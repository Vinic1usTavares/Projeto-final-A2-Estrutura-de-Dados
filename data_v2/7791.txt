otherwise known as british antarctic expedition was first of three expeditions to antarctic led by ernest shackleton its main target among a range of geographical and scientific objectives was to be first to south pole this was not attained but expedition s southern march reached a farthest south latitude of 88deg 23 s just from pole this was by far longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either pole a separate group led by welsh australian geology professor edgeworth david reached estimated location of south magnetic pole and expedition also achieved first ascent of mount erebus antarctica s second highest volcano expedition lacked governmental or institutional support and relied on private loans and individual contributions it was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried its ship nimrod was less than half of size of robert falcon scott s 1901 04 expedition ship discovery and shackleton s crew lacked relevant experience controversy arose from shackleton s decision to base expedition in mcmurdo sound close to scott s old headquarters in contravention of a promise to scott that he would not do so nevertheless although expedition s profile was initially much lower than that of scott s six years earlier its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made shackleton a public hero scientific team which included future australasian antarctic expedition leader douglas mawson carried out extensive geological zoological and meteorological work shackleton s transport arrangements based on manchurian ponies motor traction and sled dogs were innovations which despite limited success were later copied by scott for his ill fated terra nova expedition on his return shackleton overcame royal geographical society s initial scepticism about his achievements and received many public honours including a knighthood from king edward vii he made little financial gain from expedition and eventually depended on a government grant to cover its liabilities within three years his southernmost record had been surpassed as first amundsen and then scott reached south pole in his own moment of triumph amundsen

expedition in discovery he had been sent home on relief ship morning in 1903 after a physical collapse during expedition s main southern journey scott s verdict was that he ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health shackleton felt this physical failure as a personal stigma and on his return to england he was determined to prove himself in words of discovery s second in command albert armitage as a better man than scott he nevertheless declined opportunity of a swift antarctic return as chief officer of discovery s second relief ship terra nova after helping to fit her out he also helped to equip uruguay ship being prepared for relief of otto nordenskjold s expedition stranded in weddell sea during next few years while nursing intermittent hopes of resuming his antarctic career he pursued other options in 1906 he was working for industrial magnate sir william beardmore as a public relations officer according to his biographer roland huntford references to shackleton s physical breakdown made in scott s voyage of discovery published in 1905 reopened wounds to shackleton s pride it became a personal mission that he should return to antarctic and outperform scott he began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906 these include a cost estimate of ps17 000 updated value ps for entire expedition he received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer beardmore offered a ps7 000 loan guarantee updated value ps with this in hand shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to royal geographical society rgs on 12 february 1907 one reason for shackleton s sense of urgency was knowledge that polish explorer henryk arctowski was planning an expedition which was announced at rgs on same day as shackleton s in event arctowski s plans were stillborn preparations initial plans shackleton s original unpublished plan envisaged basing himself at old discovery expedition headquarters in mcmurdo sound from there he proposed to launch attempts to reach geographical south pole and south magnetic pole other journeys would follow and there would be a continuous programme of scientific work this early plan also revealed shackleton s proposed transport methods involving a combination of dogs ponies and a specially designed motor vehicle neither ponies nor motor traction had been used in antarctic before although ponies had been used by frederick jackson during jackson harmsworth arctic expedition of 1894 97 despite jackson s confused reports of his ponies prowess and contrary to specific advice from nansen renowned norwegian polar traveller shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies later scaled down to 10 by time he announced his plans to rgs in february 1907 shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic ps30 000 updated value ps however response of rgs to shackleton s proposals was muted shackleton would learn later that society was by this time aware of scott s wish to lead a new expedition and that society wished to reserve its full approval for scott nimrod thumb alt a three

s ship nimrod departing for south pole shackleton intended to arrive in antarctica in january 1908 which meant leaving england during 1907 summer he therefore had six months to secure financing acquire and fit out a ship buy all equipment and supplies and recruit personnel in april believing that he had got backing of scottish businessman donald steuart shackleton travelled to norway intending to buy a 700 ton polar vessel bjorn that would have served ideally as an expedition ship when steuart withdrew his support however bjorn was beyond shackleton s means bjorn was eventually acquired by german explorer wilhelm filchner and renamed deutschland was used in his 1911 13 voyage to weddell sea shackleton had to settle for elderly much smaller nimrod a 40 year old wooden sealer of 334 gross register tons which he was able to acquire for ps5 000 updated value ps shackleton was shocked by his first sight of nimrod after her arrival in london from newfoundland in june 1907 she was much dilapidated and smelt strongly of seal oil and an inspection showed that she needed caulking and that her masts would have to be renewed however in hands of experienced ship fitters she soon assumed a more satisfactory appearance later shackleton reported he became extremely proud of sturdy little ship fundraising by early july 1907 shackleton had secured little financial support beyond beardmore s guarantee and was lacking funds to complete refit of ship in mid july he approached philanthropic earl of otherwise known as edward guinness head of anglo irish brewing family who agreed to guarantee sum of ps2 000 updated value ps provided that shackleton found other backers to contribute a further ps6 000 shackleton was able to do this extra funds including ps2 000 from sir philip brocklehurst who paid this sum to secure a place on expedition a last minute gift of ps4 000 from shackleton s cousin william bell still left expedition far short of required ps30 000 but enabled nimrod s refit to be finished fundraising continued in australia after ship arrived there a further ps5 000 was provided as a gift from government of australia and new zealand government gave ps1 000 by these means and with other smaller loans and donations ps30 000 was raised although by end of expedition total costs had risen by shackleton s estimate to ps45 000 shackleton expected to make large sums from his book about expedition and from lectures he also hoped to profit from sales of special postage stamps bearing cancellation stamp of antarctica post office that shackleton appointed temporary postmaster by new zealand government intended to establish there none of these schemes produced anticipated riches although post office was set up at cape royds and used as a conduit for expedition s mail personnel thumb left upright alt man probably mid forties dark hair clean shaven wearing a high collar with tie looking straight ahead he is holding an open book prof edgeworth david

refused citing his work with board of agriculture s committee on investigation of grouse disease further refusals followed from former discovery colleagues michael barne reginald skelton and finally george who inadvertently revealed to shackleton that discovery officers had all committed themselves to scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans only discovery hands to join shackleton were two petty officers frank wild and ernest joyce apparently shackleton spotted joyce on top deck of a bus as it passed expedition s london offices whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in shackleton s second in command although this was not clarified until expedition reached antarctic was jameson boyd adams a royal naval reserve lieutenant who had turned down chance of a regular commission to join shackleton he would also act as expedition s meteorologist nimrods captain was another naval reserve officer rupert england 23 year old john king davis who would later make his own reputation as an antarctic captain was appointed chief officer at last moment aeneas mackintosh a merchant navy officer from p o shipping line was originally second officer but was later transferred

party s chief scientific officer second was a former pupil of david s douglas mawson a lecturer in mineralogy at university of adelaide both had originally intended to sail to antarctica and then immediately back with nimrod but were persuaded to become full members of expedition david was influential in securing australian government s ps5 000 grant before departure for antarctic in august 1907 joyce and wild took a crash course in printing methods as it was shackleton s intention to publish a book or magazine while in antarctic promise to scott thumb upright left alt man with receding hairline looking left wearing naval uniform with medals polished buttons and heavy shoulder decorations robert falcon scott shackleton s february 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at old discovery headquarters was noted by scott whose own future antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced in a letter to shackleton scott claimed priority rights to mcmurdo sound i feel i have a sort of right to my own field of work he wrote adding anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine he concluded by reminding shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander shackleton s initial reply was accommodating i would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself edward wilson asked by shackleton to mediate took an even tougher line than scott i think you should retire from mcmurdo sound he wrote advising shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in entire ross sea quarter until scott decided what limits he puts on his own rights to this shackleton replied there is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at base he asked for i consider i have reached my limit and i go no further matter was unresolved when scott returned from sea duty in may 1907 scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170deg w everything to west of that line including ross island mcmurdo sound and victoria land would be scott s preserve shackleton with other concerns pressing on him felt obliged to concede on 17 may he signed a declaration stating that i am leaving mcmurdo base to you and that he would seek to land further east either at barrier inlet visited briefly during discovery expedition or at king edward vii land he would not touch coast of victoria land at all it was a capitulation to scott and wilson and meant forfeiting expedition s aim of reaching south magnetic pole which was located within victoria land polar historian beau riffenburgh believes this was a promise that should never ethically have been demanded and one that should never have been given impacting as it might on entire safety of shackleton s expedition dispute soured relations between two men who nevertheless maintained public civilities and would eventually lead to complete rupture of shackleton s formerly close friendship with wilson in his own account of expedition shackleton makes no reference to wrangle with scott he merely states that before we finally left england i had decided that if possible i would establish my base in king edward vii land instead of mcmurdo sound expedition voyage south after inspection by king edward vii and queen alexandra nimrod sailed on 11 august 1907 shackleton remained behind on expedition business he and other expedition members followed on a faster ship entire complement came together in new zealand ready for ship s departure to antarctica on new year s day 1908 as a means of conserving fuel shackleton had arranged with new zealand government for nimrod to be towed to antarctic circle a distance of approximately costs of tow being met partly by government and partly by union steam ship company as a contribution to expedition on 14 january in sight of first icebergs towline was cut nimrod under her own power proceeded southward into floating pack ice heading for barrier inlet where six years earlier discovery had paused to allow scott and shackleton to take experimental balloon flights barrier later known as ross ice shelf was sighted on 23 january but inlet had disappeared barrier edge had changed significantly in intervening years and section which had included inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay which shackleton named bay of whales after large number of whales seen there shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a barrier surface that might calve into sea so he turned ship towards king edward vii land after repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap ship nimrod was forced to retreat shackleton s only choice now other than abandonment of expedition s goals was to break promise he had given to scott on 25 january he ordered ship to head for mcmurdo sound cape royds establishing base thumb alt a group of men in woollen jerseys several smoking pipes are watching repair work on a

southward to discovery base at hut point was blocked by frozen sea shackleton decided to wait a few days in hope that ice would break up during this delay second officer aeneas mackintosh suffered an accident that led to loss of his right eye after emergency surgery by marshall and mackay he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to new zealand with nimrod he recovered sufficiently to return with ship in following season on 3 february shackleton decided not to wait for ice to shift but to make his headquarters at nearest practicable landing place cape royds late that evening ship was moored and a suitable site for expedition s prefabricated hut was selected site was separated from hut point by of sea with no landward route to south shackleton believed party was fortunate to get winter quarters as near as this to our starting point for south following days were occupied with landing of stores and equipment this work was hampered by poor weather and by caution of captain england who frequently took ship out into bay until ice conditions at landing ground were in his view safer next fortnight followed this pattern leading to sharp dissent between shackleton and captain at one point shackleton asked england to stand down on grounds that he was ill but england refused task of unloading became in riffenburgh s description mind numbingly difficult but was finally completed on 22 february nimrod at last sailed away north england unaware that ship s engineer harry dunlop was carrying a letter from shackleton to expedition s new zealand agent requesting a replacement captain for return voyage next year this knowledge was an open secret among shore party marshall recorded in his diary that he was glad to see last of england whole thing damned disgrace to name of country ascent of mount erebus thumb left alt distant view of a mountain with a smoke emission from its summit mount erebus after nimrods departure sea ice broke up cutting off party s route to barrier and thus making preparatory sledging and depot laying impossible shackleton decided to give expedition impetus by ordering an immediate attempt to ascend mount erebus this mountain high had never been climbed a party from discovery which had included frank wild and ernest joyce had explored foothills in 1904 but had not ascended higher than neither wild nor joyce was in nimrod expedition s main erebus party which consisted of edgeworth david douglas mawson and alistair mackay with marshall adams and brocklehurst forming a support group ascent began on 5 march on 7 march two groups combined at around and all advanced towards summit on following day a blizzard held them up but early on 9 march climb resumed later that day summit of lower main crater was achieved by this time brocklehurst s feet were too frostbitten for him to continue so he was left in camp while others advanced to active crater which they reached after four hours several meteorological experiments were carried out and many rock samples were taken thereafter a rapid descent was made mainly by sliding down successive snow slopes party reached cape royds hut nearly dead according to eric marshall on 11 march winter 1908 expedition s hut a prefabricated structure measuring 33 x 19 feet 10m x 5 8m was ready for occupation by end of february it was divided into a series of mainly two person cubicles with a kitchen area a darkroom storage and laboratory space ponies were housed in stalls built on most sheltered side of hut while dog kennels were placed close to porch shackleton s inclusive leadership style in contrast to that of scott meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks all lived worked and ate together morale was high as assistant geologist philip brocklehurst recorded shackleton had a faculty for treating each member of expedition as though he were valuable to it in ensuing months of winter darkness joyce and wild printed around 30 copies of expedition s book aurora australis which were sewn and bound using packaging materials most important winter s work however was preparing for following season s major journeys which were to include attempts on both south pole and south magnetic pole by making his base in mcmurdo sound shackleton had been able to reinstate magnetic pole as an expedition objective shackleton himself would be leading south pole journey which had suffered a serious setback during winter when four of remaining ponies died mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content southern journey outward march shackleton s choice of a four man team for southern journey to south pole was largely determined by number of surviving ponies influenced by his experiences on discovery expedition he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for long polar march motor car which ran well on flat ice could not cope with barrier surfaces and was not considered for polar journey men chosen by shackleton to accompany him were marshall adams and wild joyce whose antarctic experience exceeded all save wild s was excluded from party after marshall s medical examination raised doubts about his fitness march began on 29 october 1908 shackleton had calculated return distance to pole as his initial plan allowed 91 days for return journey requiring a daily average distance of about after a slow start due to a combination of poor weather and lameness in horses shackleton reduced daily food allowance to extend total available journey time to 110 days this required a shorter daily average of around 13 1 2 nautical miles between 9 and 21 november they made good progress but ponies suffered on difficult barrier surface and first of four had to be shot when party reached 81deg s on 26 november a new farthest south record was established as they passed 82deg 17 mark set by scott s southern march in december 1902 shackleton s party covered distance in 29 days compared with scott s 59 using a track considerably east of scott s to avoid surface problems earlier journey had encountered as group moved into unknown territory barrier surface became increasingly disturbed and broken two more ponies succumbed to strain mountains to west curved round to block their path southward and party s attention was caught by a brilliant gleam of light in sky ahead quoting frank wild s diary reason for this phenomenon became clear on 3 december when after a climb through foothills of mountain chain they saw before them what shackleton later described as an open road to south a great glacier running almost south to north between two huge mountain ranges thumb left alt aerial view mountain ranges at top and bottom right of picture are separated by a broad ice river beardmore glacier discovered by shackleton s southern party on 3 december 1908 shackleton christened this glacier beardmore after expedition s biggest sponsor travel on glacier surface proved to be a trial especially for socks remaining pony who had great difficulty in finding secure footings on 7 december socks disappeared down a deep crevasse very nearly taking wild with him however pony s harness broke and sledge containing their supplies remained on surface for rest of southward journey and whole of return trip they had to rely on man hauling as journey continued personal antagonisms emerged wild privately expressed wish that marshall would fall down a crevasse about a thousand feet deep wild diary quoted by marshall wrote that following shackleton to pole was like following an old woman always panicking however christmas day was celebrated with creme de and cigars their position was 85deg 51 s still from pole and they were now carrying barely a month s supply of food having stored rest in depots for their return journey they could not cover remaining distance to pole and back with this amount of food however shackleton was not yet prepared to admit that pole was beyond them and decided to go forward after cutting food rations further and dumping all but most essential equipment on boxing day glacier ascent was at last completed and march on polar plateau began conditions did not ease shackleton recorded 31 december as hardest day we have had on next day he noted that having attained 87deg 6 1 2 s they had beaten north and south polar records north reference was to peary s then farthest north of 87deg 6 n that day referring to marshall and adams wild wrote if we only had joyce and marston here instead of those two useless beggars we would have done it pole easily on 4 january 1909 shackleton finally accepted that pole was beyond them and revised his goal to symbolic achievement of getting within 100 geographical miles of pole party struggled on at borders of survival until on 9 january 1909 after a last dash forward without sledge or other equipment march ended we have shot our bolt wrote shackleton and tale is 88deg 23 s they were 97 5 geographical miles

time beyond original 110 day estimate shackleton now aimed to reach hut point in 50 days since according to shackleton s prior orders nimrod having returned to take expedition home would depart on 1 march at latest four men were now much weakened yet in following days they achieved impressive distances reaching head of glacier on 19 january as they began descent they had five days food at half rations to last them until lower glacier depot during ascent same distance had taken 12 days shackleton s physical condition was by now a major concern yet according to adams worse he felt harder he pulled depot was reached on 28 january wild ill with dysentery was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits which were in short supply on 31 january shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on wild a gesture that moved wild to write by god i shall never forget thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit wild diary quoted in a few days later rest of party were struck with severe enteritis result of eating tainted pony meat but pace of march had to be maintained small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal however a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on sledge and maintain a good marching rate thumb left alt four dishevelled clothing and worn expressions face camera head of a dog is just visible on left wild shackleton marshall and adams aboard nimrod after their southern journey we are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on hard snow wrote shackleton from 18 february onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks and on 23rd they reached bluff depot which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by ernest joyce range of delicacies over and above crates of regular supplies was listed by shackleton carlsbad plums eggs cakes plum pudding gingerbread and crystallised fruit wild s laconic comment was good old joyce their food worries were now resolved but they still had to get back to hut point before 1 march deadline final leg of their march was interrupted by a blizzard which held them in camp for 24 hours on 27 february when they were still from safety marshall collapsed shackleton then decided that he and wild would make a dash for hut point in hopes of finding ship and holding her until other two could be rescued they reached hut late on 28 february hoping that ship was nearby they sought to attract its attention by setting fire to a small wooden hut used for magnetic observations shortly afterwards nimrod which had been anchored at glacier tongue came into view no happier sight ever met eyes of man wrote wild later it was a further three days before adams and marshall could be picked up from barrier but by 4 march whole southern party was aboard and shackleton was able to order full steam towards north northern party while preparing for his southern journey shackleton gave instructions to edgeworth david to lead a northern party to victoria land to carry out magnetic and geological work party was to try to reach magnetic pole and was to carry out a full geological survey in dry valley area david s party consisted of himself douglas mawson and alistair mackay it would be a man hauling party dogs remained at base to be used for depot laying and other routine work party had orders to plant union jack at magnetic pole and to take possession of

crossed mcmurdo sound and advanced 60 miles 100 km up difficult victoria land coast at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching magnetic pole after traversing nordenskjold ice tongue and treacherous drygalski glacier they were finally able to leave coast and turn north west towards magnetic pole s approximate location before then david had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by mawson david s account their way up to inland plateau was via a labyrinthine glacier later named reeves glacier after royal geographical society s main map curator which brought them on 27 december to a hard snow surface this enabled them to move more swiftly at a rate of about daily taking regular magnetic observations on 16 january these observations showed them to be about from magnetic pole next day 17 january 1909 they reached their goal fixing pole s position as 72deg 15 s 155deg 16 e at an elevation of in a muted ceremony david took formal possession of area for british empire exhausted and short of food party faced a return journey of with just 15 days to complete it if they were to make their prearranged coastal rendezvous with nimrod despite increasing physical weakness they maintained their daily distances and on 31 january were from their agreed pick up point bad weather delayed them and rendezvous was not reached until 2 february that night in heavy drifting snow nimrod passed by them unable to make out their camp two days later however after nimrod had turned south again group was spotted from ship and was able to scramble to safety although in rush to get aboard mawson fell down a crevasse party had been travelling for four months and were wearing same clothes in which they had departed cape royds reportedly aroma was overpowering before this rescue nimrod had picked up a geological party consisting of priestley brocklehurst and de bertram armytage who had been carrying out geological work in ferrar glacier region aftermath thumb upright left dark haired man hands on hips looking straight at camera sir ernest shackleton what nansen is to north shackleton is to south roald amundsen on 23 march 1909 shackleton landed in new zealand and cabled a 2 500 word report to london daily mail with which he had an exclusive contract amid acclamation and unstinting praise that shackleton received from exploring community including nansen and amundsen response of royal geographical society was more guarded its former president sir clements markham privately expressed his disbelief of shackleton s claimed latitude however on 14 june shackleton was met at london s charing cross station by a very large crowd which included rgs president leonard darwin and a rather reluctant captain scott as to latitude claimed reason for doubting its accuracy was that after 3 january all positions had been computed by dead reckoning on direction speed and elapsed time last proper observation on 3 january had calculated latitude as 87deg 22 shackleton s table of distances show that over next three days they covered just over to reach an estimated 88deg 7 on 6 january they were then held up for two days by a blizzard on 9 january 1909 table shows that party travelled a further to reach their farthest south and same distance back to camp this distance in a single day far exceeded those for any other stage of journey shackleton explained that this was a dash half running half walking unencumbered by sledge or other equipment each of four men independently confirmed his belief in latitude achieved and none gave any subsequent cause for his word to be doubted shackleton was made a commander of royal victorian order cvo by king edward who later conferred a knighthood on him rgs presented him with a gold medal although apparently with reservations we do not propose to make medal so large as that which was awarded to captain scott recorded an official although in eyes of public he was a hero riches that shackleton had anticipated failed to materialise soaring costs of expedition and need to meet loan guarantees meant that he was saved from financial embarrassment only by a belated government grant of ps20 000 farthest south record of nimrod expedition stood for less than three years until amundsen reached south pole on 15 december 1911 for his trail breaking achievements shackleton received a fulsome tribute from amundsen what nansen is to north shackleton is to south thereafter shackleton s antarctic ambitions were fixed on a transcontinental crossing which he attempted unsuccessfully with imperial trans antarctic expedition 1914 17 although his status as a leading figure in heroic age of antarctic exploration was by then assured other members of nimrod expedition also achieved fame and standing in future years edgeworth david adams mawson and priestley all eventually received knighthoods latter two continuing their polar work on further expeditions though neither went south again with shackleton mawson led 1911 13 australian antarctic expedition and priestley was part of terra nova expedition s scientific team frank wild was second in command to boss on imperial trans antarctic expedition and on short quest expedition where he took over command after shackleton s death in south georgia in 1922 ten years after her return from antarctic nimrod
