permission to enter indigo league which consists of best pokemon trainers in region there player will battle elite four and finally new champion player s rival also throughout game player will have to battle against forces of team rocket a criminal organization that abuses pokemon they devise numerous plans for stealing rare pokemon which player must foil development concept of pokemon saga stems from hobby of insect collecting a popular pastime which game designer satoshi tajiri enjoyed as a child while growing up however he observed more urbanization taking place in town where he lived and as a result insect population declined tajiri noticed that kids now played in their homes instead of outside and he came up with idea of a video game containing creatures that resembled insects called pokemon he thought kids could relate with pokemon by individually naming them and then controlling them to represent fear or anger as a good way of relieving stress however pokemon never bleed nor die in battle only faint this was a very touchy subject to tajiri as he did not want to further fill gaming world with pointless violence when game boy was released tajiri thought system was perfect for his idea especially because of link cable which he envisioned would allow players to trade pokemon with each other this concept of trading information was new to video gaming industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition i imagined a chunk of information being transferred by connecting two game boys with special cables and i went wow that s really going to be something said tajiri tajiri was also influenced by square s game boy game final fantasy legend noting in an interview that game gave him idea that more than just action games could be developed for handheld main characters were named after tajiri himself as satoshi who is described as tajiri in his youth and his long time friend role model mentor and fellow nintendo developer shigeru miyamoto as shigeru ken sugimori an artist and longtime friend of tajiri headed development of drawings and designs of pokemon working with a team of fewer than ten people who conceived various designs for all 151 pokemon sugimori in turn finalized each design drawing pokemon from various angles in order to assist game freak s graphics department in properly rendering creature music for game was composed by junichi masuda who utilized four sound channels of game boy to create both melodies and sound effects and pokemon cries heard upon encountering them he noted game s opening theme titled monster was produced with image of battle scenes in mind using white noise to sound like marching music and imitate a snare drum originally called capsule monsters game s title went through several transitions due to trademark difficulties becoming and before eventually settling upon pocket monsters tajiri always thought that nintendo would reject his game as company did not really understand concept at first however games turned out to be a complete success something tajiri and nintendo never expected especially because of declining popularity of game boy upon hearing of pokemon concept miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different pokemon in each noting it would assist trading aspect in japan pocket monsters red and green were first versions released having been completed by october 1995 and officially released on february 27 1996 they sold rapidly due in part to nintendo s idea of producing two versions of game instead of a single title prompting consumers to buy both several months later blue version was released in japan as a mail order only special edition featuring updated in game artwork and new dialogue to create more hype and challenge to games tajiri revealed an extra pokemon called mew hidden within games which he believed created a lot of rumors and myths about game and kept interest alive creature was originally added by shigeki morimoto as an internal prank and wasn t supposed to be exposed to consumers it was not until later that nintendo decided to distribute mew through a nintendo promotional event however in 2003 a glitch became widely known and could be exploited so anyone could obtain elusive pokemon during north american localization of pokemon a small team led by hiro nakamura went through individual pokemon renaming them for western audiences based on their appearance and characteristics after approval from nintendo co ltd in addition during this process nintendo trademarked 151 pokemon names in order to ensure they would be unique to franchise during translation process it became apparent that simply altering games text from japanese to english was impossible games had to be entirely reprogrammed from scratch due to fragile state of their source code a side effect of unusually lengthy development time therefore games were based on more modern japanese version of blue modeling its programming and artwork but keeping same distribution of pokemon found in japanese red and green cartridges respectively as finished red and blue versions were being prepared for release nintendo allegedly spent over 50 million dollars to promote games fearing series would not be appealing to american children western localization team warned that cute monsters may not be accepted by american audiences and instead recommended they be redesigned and beefed up then president of nintendo hiroshi yamauchi refused and instead viewed games possible reception in america as a challenge to face despite these setbacks reprogrammed red and blue versions with their original creature designs were eventually released in north america over two and a half years after red and green debuted in japan games were received extremely well by foreign audiences and pokemon went on to become a lucrative franchise in america music music was composed by junichi masuda at his home on a commodore amiga computer which only features pcm sample playback and converted to game boy with a program he had written reception and legacy games received mostly positive reviews from critics holding an aggregate score of 88 on gamerankings special praise was given to its multiplayer features ability to trade and battle pokemon with one another craig harris of ign gave games a masterful 10 out of 10 noting that even if you finish quest you still might not have all pokemon in game challenge to catch em all is truly game s biggest draw he also commented on popularity of game especially among children describing it as a craze gamespots peter bartholow who gave games a great 8 8 out of 10 cited graphics and audio as somewhat primitive but stated that these were games only drawbacks he praised titles replay value due to their customization and variety and commented upon their universal appeal under its cuddly exterior pokemon is a serious and unique rpg with lots of depth and excellent multiplayer extensions as an rpg game is accessible enough for newcomers to genre to enjoy but it will entertain hard core fans as well it s easily one of best game boy games to date success of these games has been attributed to their innovative gaming experience rather than audiovisual effects papers published by columbia business school indicate both american and japanese children prefer actual gameplay of a game over special audio or visual effects in pokemon games lack of these artificial effects has actually been said to promote child s imagination and creativity with all talk of game engines and texture mapping and so on there is something refreshing about this superlative gameplay which makes you ignore cutesy 8 bit graphics commented guardian commercial performance pokemon red and blue set precedent for what has become a blockbuster multibillion dollar franchise red green and blue sold 1 04 million units combined in japan during 1996 and another 3 65 million in 1997 latter performance made pokemon
