who s next is fifth studio album by english rock band who it developed from aborted lifehouse project a multi media rock opera written by group s pete townshend as a follow up to band s 1969 album tommy project was cancelled owing to its complexity and to conflicts with kit lambert band s manager but group salvaged some of songs without connecting story elements to release as their next album eight of nine songs on who s next were from lifehouse lone exception being john entwistle penned my wife ultimately remaining lifehouse tracks would all be released on other albums throughout next decade who recorded who s next with assistance from recording engineer glyn johns after producing song won t get fooled again in rolling stones mobile studio they relocated to olympic studios to record and mix most of album s remaining songs they made prominent use of synthesizer on album particularly on won t get fooled again and baba o riley which were both released as singles cover photo was shot by ethan russell it made reference to monolith in 1968 film 2001 a space odyssey as it featured group members standing by a concrete piling protruding from a slag heap apparently having urinated against it who s next was an immediate success when it was released in august 1971 it has since been viewed by many critics as who s best record and one of greatest albums of all time it was reissued on cd several times with additional songs originally intended for lifehouse background by 1970 who had obtained significant critical and commercial success but they had started to become detached from their original audience mod movement had vanished and original followers from shepherd s bush had grown up and acquired jobs and families group had started to drift apart from manager kit lambert owing to his preoccupation with their label track records they had been touring since release of tommy previous may with a set that contained most of that album but realized that millions had now seen their live performances and pete townshend in particular recognized that they needed to do something new a single seeker and a live album live at leeds were released in 1970 and an ep of new material water naked eye i don t even know myself postcard and now i m a farmer was recorded but not released as band felt it would not be a satisfactory follow up to tommy instead group tackled a project called lifehouse this evolved from a series of columns townshend wrote for melody maker in august 1970 in which he discussed importance of rock music and in particular what audience could do of all group he was most keen to use music as a communication device and wanted to branch out into other media including film to get away from traditional album tour cycle townshend has variously described lifehouse as a futuristic rock opera a live recorded concept album and as music for a scripted film project basic plot was outlined in an interview townshend gave to disc and music echo on 24 october 1970 lifehouse is set in near future in a society in which music is banned and most of population live indoors in government controlled experience suits a rebel bobby broadcasts rock music into suits allowing people to remove them and become more enlightened some elements accurately describe future technology for example grid resembles internet and grid sleep virtual reality thumb 130px pete townshend was given a gretsch 6120 guitar by joe walsh in early 1971 and it became his main electric instrument for who s next group held a press conference on 13 january 1971 explaining that they would be giving a series of concerts at young vic theatre where they would develop fictional elements of proposed film along with audience after keith moon had completed his work on film 200 motels group performed their first young vic concert on 15 february show included a new public address system which cost ps30 000 audience was mainly invited from various organisations such as youth clubs with only a few tickets on sale to general public after initial concerts group flew to new york s record plant studios at lambert s suggestion for studio recordings group were joined by guests al kooper on hammond organ ken ascher on piano and leslie west on guitar townshend used a 1957 gretsch guitar given to him by joe walsh during session it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording lambert s participation in recording was minimal and he proved to be unable to mix final recordings he had started taking hard drugs while townshend was drinking brandy regularly after returning to britain engineer glyn johns made safety copies of record plant material but decided that it would be better to re record it from scratch at olympic sound studios in barnes group gave a further series of concerts at young vic on 25 and 26 april which were recorded on rolling stones mobile studio by andy johns but townshend grew disillusioned with lifehouse and further shows were cancelled project proved to be intractable on several levels and caused stress within band as well as a major falling out between townshend and lambert years later in liner notes to remastered cd townshend wrote that failure of project led him to verge of a nervous breakdown audiences at young vic gigs were not interested in interacting with group to create new material but simply wanted who to play my generation and smash a guitar at time roger daltrey said who were never nearer to breaking up although lifehouse concept was abandoned scraps of project remained in final album including use of synthesizers and computers an early concept for lifehouse featured feeding of personal data from audience members into controller of an early analogue synthesizer to create a universal chord that would have ended proposed film abandoning lifehouse gave group extra freedom owing to absence of an overriding musical theme or storyline which had been basis of tommy this allowed band to concentrate on maximising impact of individual tracks and providing a unifying sound for them although he gave up his original intentions for lifehouse project townshend continued to develop concepts revisiting them in later albums including a 6 cd set lifehouse chronicles in 1999 in 2007 he opened a website called lifehouse method to accept personal input from applicants that would be turned into musical portraits recording and production thumb most of who s next was recorded at olympic studios barnes with glyn johns first session for what became who s next was at mick jagger s house stargroves at start of april 1971 using rolling stones mobile backing track of won t get fooled again was recorded there before band decided to relocate recording to olympic at johns suggestion first session was on 9 april attempting a basic take of bargain bulk of sessions occurred during may when group recorded time is passing pure and easy love ain t for keeping which had been reworked from a rock track into an acoustic arrangement behind blue eyes song is over let s see action and baba o riley nicky hopkins guested on piano while dave arbus was invited by moon to play violin on baba o riley john entwistle s my wife was added to album very late in sessions having been originally intended for a solo album in contrast to record plant and young vic sessions recording with johns went well as he was primarily concerned about creating a good sound whereas lambert had always been more preoccupied about group s image townshend recalled we were just getting astounded at sounds glyn was producing townshend used early synthesizers and modified keyboard sounds in several modes as a drone effect on several songs notably baba o riley and won t get fooled again as well as on bargain going mobile and song is over synthesizer was used as an integral part of sound as opposed to providing gloss as was case on other artists albums up to this point moon s drumming has a distinctly different style from earlier albums being more formal and less reliant on long drum fills partly owing to synthesizer backing but also due to no nonsense production techniques of johns who insisted on a good recording performance that only used when truly necessary johns was instrumental in convincing who that they should simply put a single studio album out believing songs to be excellent group gave him free rein to assemble a single album of whatever songs he wanted in any order despite johns key contributions he only received an associate producer credit on finished album though he maintained he acted mainly in an engineering capacity and based most of arrangements on townshend s original demos thumb left an arp synthesizer similar to one used on who s next album opened with baba o riley featuring piano and synthesizer processed lowrey organ by townshend song s title pays homage to townshend s guru meher baba and minimalist composer terry riley and is informally known as teenage wasteland from a line in lyrics organ track came from a longer demo by townshend portions of which were later included on a baba tribute album i am that was edited down for final recording townshend later said this part had two or three thousand edits to it opening lyrics to next track bargain i d gladly lose me to find you came from a phrase used by baba entwistle wrote my wife after having an argument with his wife and exaggerating conflict in lyrics track features several overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half hour session pure and easy a key track from lifehouse did not make final track selection but opening line was included as a coda to song is over behind blue eyes featured three part harmony by daltrey townshend and entwistle and was written for main antagonist in lifehouse brick moon uncharacteristically did not appear on first half of track which was later described by who biographer dave marsh as longest time keith moon was still in his entire life closing track won t get fooled again was critical of revolutions townshend explained a revolution is only a revolution in long run and a lot of people are going to get hurt song features lowrey organ fed through an arp synthesizer which came from townshend s original demo and was re used for finished track cover art cover artwork shows a photograph taken at easington colliery of band apparently having just urinated on a large concrete piling protruding from a slag heap decision to shoot picture came from entwistle and moon discussing stanley kubrick and film 2001 a space odyssey according to photographer ethan russell only townshend actually urinated against piling so rainwater was tipped from an empty film canister to achieve desired effect sky in background was added later to give image

who s next best hard rock album in years and said that while their previous recordings were marred by a thin sound group now achieves same resonant immediacy in studio that it does live billy walker from sounds highlighted songs baba o riley my wife and song is over and wrote after unique brilliance of tommy something special had to be thought out and fact that they settled for a straight forward album rather than an extension of their rock opera says much for their courage and inventiveness rolling stone magazine s john mendelsohn felt that despite some amount of seriousness and artificiality album s brand of rock and roll is intelligently conceived superbly performed brilliantly produced and sometimes even exciting at end of 1971 record was voted best album of year in pazz jop an annual poll of american critics published by village voice since then who s next has often been viewed as who s best album in a retrospective review for allmusic stephen thomas erlewine said its music was more genuine than tommy or aborted lifehouse project because those were art who s next even with its pretensions is rock roll bbc music s chris roberts cited it as band s best record and one of those carved in stone landmarks that rock canon doesn t allow you to bad mouth mojo claimed its sophisticated music and hook laden songs featured innovative use of rock synthesizers that did not weaken who s characteristic power quartet attack in encyclopedia of popular music 1998 colin larkin said it raised standards for both hard rock and who whose sense of dynamics was highlighted by contrast between their powerful playing and a counterpoint produced at times from acoustic guitars and synthesizer christgau on other hand was less enthusiastic about record during 1980s when who became what he felt was worst kind of art rock band writing that who s next revealed itself to be less tasteful in retrospect because of daltrey s histrionic singing and all that synth noodling according to acclaimed
