1970s national tikal project proyecto nacional tikal investigated mundo perdido from 1979 until 1985 and partially restored principal structures of complex coe 1967 1988 p 92 mundo perdido was first architectural complex to be built at tikal in preclassic period and last to be abandoned during terminal classic history preclassic mundo perdido underwent six phases of construction four of these date to preclassic and two to classic each construction phase produced a new version of e group lost world pyramid and east platform evidence recovered from mundo perdido dates back to earliest years of occupation at tikal in middle preclassic prior to 700 bc although these remains represent rubbish rather than structures laporte 2003a p 285 complex began to take form around end of middle preclassic around 600 bc when structures started to be added to a series of artificially levelled surfaces or platforms laporte 2003a p 287 gradually both complexity and height of structures increased lost world pyramid and east platform together form an e group that is oldest architectural complex in tikal during late preclassic a causeway was built to unite mundo perdido with north acropolis laporte 2003a p 288 this causeway channelled runoff rainwater into a canal that fed into temple reservoir about ad 100 toward end of late preclassic three temples were built upon east platform laporte 2003a 288 sabloff 2003 pp xxiv early classic thumb right temple 5c 49 features prominent talud tablero architecture a style associated with teotihuacan around ad 250 at beginning of early classic mundo perdido plaza was expanded westwards in order to make lost world pyramid centre of complex rather than western extreme it was this construction phase that led to mundo perdido achieving its final surface area of around after this various structures in mundo perdido were remodelled many times to match architectural styles developing throughout city a small platform was added to east platform in early classic surface of platform possesses a series of holes that may have supported banners platform covered a large pit that contained bodies of seventeen sacrificial victims including men women and children possibly sacrificed during a dedicatory ceremony for platform itself in 4th century ad first version of structure 5d 82 was built to north of east platform laporte 2003a pp 286 291 in second half of 4th century six tombs were built in east platform laporte 2003a pp 292 293 ceramic offerings in tombs included effigy vessels representing monkeys and macaws laporte 2003a p 293 high artistic and technical quality of funerary offerings in these tombs identify deceased as members of tikal s elite they may have been members of a line of ruling dynasty that lost power among political upheaval of late 4th century and included kings k inich muwaan jol and chak tok ich aak i with entry of siyaj k ak and establishment of a new political order in city focus of royal funerary rites was shifted from mundo perdido to north acropolis fitzsimmons 2009 pp 112 113 from 4th century through to 6th century use of talud tablero architecture became notable in mundo perdido in 5th century talud tablero form was applied to structures 5c 51 and 5c 52 at western limit of complex and 6c 24 on south side laporte 2003b p 201 laporte and fialko 1994 p 345 in latter part of 6th century or during 7th century a fifth version of talud tablero temple 5c 49 was built with a new stairway and summit shrine late classic during 7th century there were significant changes to east platform including a new version of temple 5d 87 that faced away from mundo perdido around ad 700 this version was sealed and another version built on top making temple 5d 87 one of three highest structures in mundo perdido this new version created a new orienting axis in complex breaking primary axis associated with ancient e group complex and its relationship with old solar cult thus marking a major change in ceremonial use of mundo perdido complex laporte 2003a p 302 it is about this same time that twin pyramid complex came into use demonstrating a major internal reorganisation of city during late classic access to complex was gradually restricted by closing various access points with new structures this included discontinuing use of causeway that had linked complex with north acropolis since preclassic a new palace complex was built in northern section of mundo perdido developing during 7th and 8th centuries ad this marked an important change in use of mundo perdido which until then had been dedicated to purely ritual activities construction of palace indicates permanent inhabitation of complex by an elite group apparently involved in some way with administration of city mundo perdido continued to serve as an important burial site during 8th and 9th centuries final version of talud tablero temple received three elite status burials possibly members of royal family to judge by extremely high quality of associated offerings laporte 2003a pp 302 303 these burials have been dated to second half of 8th century during reign of yax nuun ayiin ii laporte 2003a p 303 terminal classic tikal as a whole went into general decline during terminal classic with some parts of city apparently being abandoned mundo perdido however continued to be a centre of vigorous ceremonial activity evidence of this continued activity in complex includes burials and collections of ceramic and lithic artefacts together with significant construction activity main late classic structures were fitted with new benches and a change to access routes to complex took place activity was concentrated in northern portion of mundo perdido perhaps because it was closest to temple reservoir water supply some minor changes were made to talud tablero temple at this time greatest residential activity during terminal classic took place in vaulted palace immediately to east of talud tablero temple structures 5c 45 through to 5c 47 this activity included complex construction projects and indicates that elite were still in residence immediately prior to complete abandonment of city laporte 2003a p 304 further construction activity in form of structural strengthening also took place in other structures in northern sector including structures 5d 77 and 5d 82 ritual activity also continued and bottom half of early classic stela 39 was placed in temple 5d 86 on east platform and worshipped that a large population remained in residence in north sector of mundo perdido during terminal classic is evidenced by quantity of burials of differing gender and age some were interred inside collapsed buildings or in casual graves they were usually accompanied by very few funerary offerings generally bone and lithic artefacts dense occupation of north sector which included elite activity continued for at least a hundred years after abandonment of rest of tikal and is perhaps linked to nearby water supply and to continued ritual activity at temple iii while northern portion of mundo perdido continued in use rest of complex was partially abandoned occupation of mundo perdido came to an end in terminal classic and very few traces of postclassic activity have been recovered limited to a few ceramic finds in structure 3d 43 to north laporte 2003a pp 304 305 modern history university of pennsylvania carried out exploratory investigations of lost world pyramid prior to work undertaken by proyecto nacional tikal these included test cores and trenches in summit as well as west and south sides exploratory tunnels excavated up to into pyramid s interior recovered surprisingly early ceramic fragments which led to complex becoming focus of later investigations a wide ranging programme of investigations of mundo perdido was instigated by newly formed proyecto nacional tikal in september 1979 laporte 1997 p 332 first operation carried out was clearing of forest overgrowth from lost world pyramid late that year main phase of investigations ran until 1982 although test pitting and topographical surveys continued until 1984 both lost world pyramid 5c 54 and talud tablero temple were excavated and restored from 1980 through to 1982 laporte 1997 p 332 laporte 1998 p 22 soon after work started upon mundo perdido in 1979 adverse weather conditions resulted in severe damage to various structures including collapse of east face of lost world pyramid northeast corner of talud tablero temple 5c 49 and north wall of structure 5d 77 laporte 1997 p 345 structures thumb right plan of mundo perdido complex archaeologist william r coe divided mundo perdido complex into two clearly demarcated areas that he referred to as high plaza and low plaza high plaza is area around lost

delimited by structures 5d 77 5c 45 5c 46 together with some smaller structures low plaza lies to west of lost world pyramid centred upon structure 5c 53 a low platform low plaza is closed on its north side by talud tablero temple 5c 49 which is second largest structure in whole complex more recently proyecto nacional tikal has defined complex as an area divided into four plazas north east and west plazas are defined by their relationship to lost world pyramid 5c 54 while south plaza is on south side of structures 6c 25 and 6c 25 themselves to south of lost world pyramid laporte and fialko

construction phases with earliest dating to end of middle preclassic period lost world pyramid lost world pyramid structure 5c 54 also known as great pyramid dates to late preclassic sharer and traxler 2006 p 258 this structure is focus of mundo perdido complex laporte 2003b p 200 it currently stands approximately high and has a maximum width across base of laporte 2003 p 288 laporte 1997 p 333 lost world pyramid was one of most massive construction projects ever undertaken at tikal pyramid is accessed via a stairway on west side this was flanked by giant masks coe 1967 1988 p 90 final version of structure had stairways on both east and west sides that extended to top with additional stairways on north and south sides climbing only as far as eighth of ten levels this structure was one of most massive buildings in whole of late preclassic mesoamerica and its construction used masonry blocks that measured over long pyramid was periodically rebuilt throughout its history in common with rest of complex version now visible is fifth version dating to around ad 250 when it was built it was tallest structure in entire city stepped levels of pyramid have inset vertical panels that were forerunners of talud tablero style these early tableros first made an appearance in second half of 3rd century ad when they were built into fifth construction phase of pyramid masks that once adorned sides of building are now so eroded that it is not possible to determine if they were anthropomorphic or zoomorphic traces of painted stucco on final version of pyramid reveal that at some point exterior of structure was painted blue and red construction phases of lost world 1997 version date height width n s 600 500 300 1 bc8 ad five versions of lost world pyramid were each larger than previous version they were not built directly centred upon preceding version due to necessity of maintaining e group plaza area between pyramid and east platform this led to destruction of previous version s east face each time a new version was superimposed over older version phase 1 earliest version of pyramid was built at end of middle preclassic laporte and fialko 1994 p 336 it was raised upon a deep infill that levelled natural terrain laporte 1997 p 333 this earliest phase of construction has not survived in its entirety but is believed to have possessed three stepped levels with stairways on all four sides it measured north south and stood high laporte 1997 p 334 phase 2 second version dates to late preclassic between 600 and 400 bc laporte and fialko 1994 p 336 sabloff 2003 p xxiv at this time two adult males were interred without funerary offerings under summit platform of pyramid burials pnt 002 and pnt 003 laporte fialko 1994 p 336 laporte 1997 p 335 although they lacked associated offerings presence of cranial deformation and dental decoration suggests that deceased may have been members of elite investigating archaeologists of proyecto nacional tikal consider that deceased themselves were a dedicatory offering upon construction of this newer version of pyramid second version of pyramid possessed four stepped levels and measured north south it stood high phase 3 thumb right lost world pyramid viewed from north third version was built between 400 and 200 bc as a part of formal layout of e group this version measured north south and stood high construction of third version of temple damaged underlying second version and covered it completely third version was a radial pyramid with six stepped levels and a raised upper platform built from stone blocks that were not finished with stucco this upper platform had rounded corners three lower levels of pyramid had a talud sloping sided form while fourth had a tablero vertical sided form fifth level was of greater height and supported weight of giant masks flanking central stairways as they ascend upper sixth level laporte 1997 p 337 pyramid possessed auxiliary stairways that climbed lower four levels flanking central stairways they ascended fifth level in a modified form such that they enclosed giant masks between auxiliary stairways and central stairways on each side upon upper platform was a high bench accessed via three steps on its east and west sides only third version pyramid was of high quality construction with complex architectural detail and fine quality stucco covering burial pnt 001 was discovered interred within infill of upper level of fourth version of pyramid it was accompanied by a number of offerings phase 4 fourth version of pyramid was built upon a much larger scale it was built sometime between 200 bc and 200 ad laporte 1997 p 339 it stood high and measured across this represented greatest leap in volume between successive versions of pyramid once again it was a radial pyramid with auxiliary stairways temple had at least eight stepped levels although archaeologists could not determine exact number due to destruction wrought upon summit by construction of next fifth and final version it possessed giant masks on fifth stepped level due to method of construction employed with weight dispersed across shorter sides of its stone blocks fourth version of pyramid was structurally weak and it required periodic reinforcement architects soon realised their error and architectural techniques used in construction of fourth version were never used again fourth version itself remained in use for a relatively short period of time before being replaced by fifth version phase 5 thumb right collapsed and overgrown east face of lost world pyramid as seen from east platform of e group fifth and final version of lost world pyramid was built around 200 300 ad laporte 1997 pp 340 341 when excavated it was found to be poorly preserved due to poor quality structural infill used in its construction its sides had subsided in a number of places final version of pyramid had ten levels and stood high pyramid measured ns by ew through its central axis this narrowed to measuring from corner to corner these measurements make it most massive construction project at tikal fifth version of pyramid started with 8 levels between 200 and 300 ad a ninth level was added in 4th century and tenth level sometime between late 4th century and early 6th century laporte 1997 p 341 each of stairways was flanked by large tablero panels laporte 1997 p 342 bench upon summit faced west breaking long tradition that incorporated pyramid within ancient e group a large slab of slate measuring high by wide and thick was found embedded in bench it was highly eroded and may have been a stela that was erected upon pyramid during late classic laporte 1997 pp 342 343 large quantities of early and late classic ceramic fragments were found upon pyramid demonstrating continued importance of structure within tikal as a whole laporte 1997 p 343 a well preserved limestone model of an architectural complex was recovered from upper east side of pyramid it may originally have been deposited in a cache and represented a number of pyramids and a mesoamerican ballcourt model does not match any known architectural group at tikal itself east platform thumb left restored structure 5d 87 temple of skulls upon east platform east platform divides mundo perdido complex from plaza of seven temples structures are numbered from 5d 82 at north end through to 5d 89 where it joins with south range although this is one of earliest examples of architecture at tikal this platform began to take on its final form around ad 100 when first versions of three temples 5d 84 5d 86 and 5d 88 were built upon basal platform in 5th century ad platform was remodeled with a huge talud tablero laporte 2003b p 202 structure 5d 82 is northernmost structure adjoining east platform laporte 2003a p 286 first version of this building was built in 4th century ad this early version was a semicircular platform supporting a building that possessed a single chamber laporte 2003a p 291 this building was decorated with an elaborate stucco frieze decorated with anthropomorphic figures and glyphs central figure in frieze is believed by archaeologists to represent deity itzamna structure 5d 84 is towards north end of east range structure has three rooms and is flanked by structure 5d 83 to north and structure 5d 86 to south this is one of earliest three structures to be built upon east platform towards end of late preclassic structure 5d 85 is a double platform that provides access to plaza of seven temples thumb right vaulted niche in access stairway of temple 5d 87 dated to around ad 700 structure 5d 86 possesses remains of giant masks on its facade it has been dated to late classic period stela 39 was found in this building first version of this building was raised upon east platform towards end of late preclassic period at around ad 100 temple had three rooms arranged one behind other laporte 2002 p 208 laporte 2003a p 288 central chamber is smallest and is particularly notable for presence of two giant zoomorphic masks on either side of its doorway laporte 2003a p 289 this is only example known from late preclassic maya world where such masks were placed inside a building a practice that would become common in late classic period iconographic analysis of these two masks suggest that they are an early form of nu b alam a spirit protector of city that was closely associated with warfare first royal tomb in mundo perdido was installed in this structure during transition between late preclassic and early classic periods structure 5d 87 is also known as temple of skulls de las calaveras in spanish it is third largest temple in mundo perdido complex a new version of this temple was superimposed upon a preceding version during 7th century ad this new version faced away from mundo perdido and possessed a single room with five doorways that faced onto adjacent plaza of seven temples to east around ad 700 this version was sealed and a new version was built on top at which time it became one of highest structures in mundo perdido this version of structure had a four level platform with an access stairway interrupted by a vaulted niche as was architectural style prevalent at tikal during this time base of niche was adorned with three sculpted skulls one facing forwards and two flanking skulls in profile structure 5d 88 is a structure possessing three rooms it was one of first three temples to be built upon east platform towards end of late preclassic period structure 5d 89 is another structure possessing three rooms northern sector talud tablero temple talud tablero temple structure 5c 49 is second largest building in mundo perdido it is located on north side of west plaza laporte 1998 p 22 to northwest of lost world pyramid and directly north of 5c 53 platform coe 1967 1988 p 91 pyramid has a projecting stairway that rises to a summit shrine that possessed three corbel vaulted chambers and a roof comb ceilings and roof comb had collapsed into first two chambers prior to archaeological exploration ruined building currently stands over high with its summit shrine and roof comb intact it would have been taller talud tablero temple was not investigated by university of pennsylvania and prior to its exploration by proyecto nacional tikal summit shrine had served as lair of a jaguar and was littered with remains of its prey shrine has been badly damaged by multiple looters pits excavated in each of interior chambers three distinct construction phases are evident on exterior of this pyramid coe 1967 1988 pp 90 92 first version of this pyramid was built in latter half of 3rd century ad laporte 2003b pp 200 201 it was built in a forerunner of talud tablero style and had three levels it stood tall with sides that measured at base laporte 1998 p 23 it featured vertical unframed tableros that were painted black and a stairway flanked by balustrades stairway rose at an angle of and projected from pyramid base three more construction phases took place in early classic between ad 300 and 550 none of these three phases supported a masonry superstructure laporte 1998 p 24 each of these phases was very similar consisting mainly in an increase in size of building phase 2 had a basal surface area of base of third phase covered an area of this increased to in fourth construction phase second phase of construction took place in 4th century in a local variation of talud tablero style that only included framed tableros on front of pyramid except for upper level where tableros extend around all four faces of structure laporte 2003b p 201 it had four stepped levels third phase of construction maintained previous versions talud tablero variant and had five stepped levels laporte 1998 p 24 laporte 2003b p 201 fourth version of pyramid once again had four stepped levels fifth phase of construction of this building took place between ad 550 and 700 and involved construction of a new stairway on top of previous version although older four level stepped pyramid with talud tablero sides was retained laporte 2003a p 301 pyramid base now measured on each side laporte 1998 p 25 stairway was widened by covering balustrades and pyramid was heightened by by addition of two more talud tablero style levels laporte 2003b p 204 this resulted in a base height of laporte 1998 p 26 a new summit shrine was built upon this possessing three vaulted rooms and an elaborate roof comb laporte 2003a p 301 laporte 2003b p 204 this construction phase took place around same time that temple v was built first of major temples of tikal or slightly earlier shrine in its final version had three access doorways to first chamber which was wide after ad 700 pyramid served an important funerary function three elite burials have been excavated from pyramid two males and a female accompanied by extremely high quality funerary offerings offerings include polychrome ceramics and objects crafted from shell conch and mother of pearl that are inscribed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery these associated finds are of sufficient quality that it is possible that deceased were members of royal family burials have been dated to reign of yax nuun ayiin ii who ruled from ad 769 to 794 during terminal classic some minor changes were made to temple chambers and there may have been structural reinforcement of front of temple although it is poorly preserved inside of temple rooms were inscribed with graffiti that is likely to date to this time palace a three range palace complex is laid out in form of a u in northern portion of mundo perdido three ranges are 5c 45 on east side 5c 46 on south side and 5c 47 on west side all three ranges connect at corners to form a single extended palace around a central courtyard with an area of courtyard was open on north side this palace has furnished important information with regard to terminal classic occupation mundo perdido palace was built upon a late classic platform and gradually developed with construction of palace buildings in 7th and 8th centuries ad structures each housed multiple corbel vaulted chambers on two of three structures decorated facades faced outwards although buildings all opened onto interior courtyard during 1500 year history of mundo perdido complex palace was only group of buildings in entire complex that did not serve a uniquely ceremonial purpose laporte and fialko 1994 p 346 structure 5c 45 is east range of a palace complex that also incorporates 5c 46 south range and 5c 47 west range laporte 1999 p 183 this structure was remodelled in terminal classic with closing of some doorways addition of some benches and construction of new sections with multiple doorways although tikal was completely abandoned soon afterwards this continuation in complex construction activity indicated that elite residents were still inhabiting palace at this time other structures thumb right structure 5c 53 displays influence from distant city of teotihuacan structure 5c 51 is on western border of complex laporte and fialko 1994 p 345 it was modelled in talud

lost world pyramid platform has access stairways on all four sides and has no sign of ever having supported any superstructure details of sides of platform suggest that its construction was influenced by teotihuacan platform dates to beginning of late classic around ad 600 structure 6c 24 is a part of south range of mundo perdido this is another building that was styled with talud tableros in 5th century ad monuments stela 39 is broken bottom half of a stela that was found inside temple 5d 86 on east west axis running through east platform from lost world pyramid monument is sculpted on front
