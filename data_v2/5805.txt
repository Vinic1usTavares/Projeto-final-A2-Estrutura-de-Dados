killdeer charadrius vociferus is a large plover found in americas it was described and given its current scientific name in 1758 by carl linnaeus in 10th edition of his systema naturae there are three subspecies killdeer s common name comes from its often heard call its are mostly brown with rufous fringes head has patches of white and black and there are two black breast bands belly and rest of breast are white nominate or originally described subspecies breeds from southeastern alaska and southern canada to mexico it is seen year round in southern half of its breeding range subspecies c v ternominatus is probably resident in west indies and c v peruvianus inhabits peru and areas of surrounding countries throughout year north american breeders winter from their resident range south to central america west indies and northernmost portions of south america non breeding habitat of killdeer includes coastal wetlands beach habitats and coastal fields its breeding grounds are generally open fields with short vegetation but locations such as rooftops are sometimes used although it is a it does not necessarily nest close to water nest itself is a scrape lined with vegetation and white material such as pebbles or seashell fragments this bird lays a clutch of four to six buff to beige eggs with dark markings breeding season starting with egg laying occurs from mid march to august with later timing of egg laying in northern portion of range both parents incubate eggs for 22 to 28 days on average young stay in nest until day after being hatched when they are led by their parents to a feeding territory generally with dense vegetation where hiding spots are abundant where chicks feed themselves young then fledge about 31 days after hatching and breeding first occurs after one year of age killdeer primarily feeds on insects although other invertebrates and seeds are eaten it forages almost exclusively in fields especially those with short vegetation and with cattle and standing water it primarily forages during day but in non breeding season when moon is full or close to full it forages at night this is likely because of increased insect abundance and reduced predation during night predators of killdeer include various birds and mammals there are multiple responses to predation ranging from calling to ungulate display which can be fatal for performing individual this bird is classified as least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn because of its large range and population its population is declining but this trend is not severe enough for killdeer to be considered a vulnerable species it is protected by american migratory bird treaty act of 1918 and canadian migratory birds convention act etymology and taxonomy killdeer was described in 1758 by swedish naturalist carl linnaeus in 10th edition of his systema naturae as charadrius vociferus its current scientific name linnaeus description was based on a 1731 account of it by english naturalist mark catesby in his natural history of carolina florida and bahama islands where he called it chattering plover genus name charadrius is late latin for a yellowish bird mentioned in fourth century vulgate bible this word derives from ancient greek a bird found in ravines and river valleys ravine specific name vociferus is latin coming from vox cry and ferre to bear there are three subspecies c v vociferus linnaeus 1758 nominate subspecies originally described subspecies found in us including southeastern alaska southern canada mexico and with some less widespread grounds further south to panama it winters to northwestern south america c v ternominatus bangs kennard 1920 this subspecies is found on bahamas greater antilles and virgin islands c v peruvianus chapman 1920 this south american subspecies is found in west ecuador peru and extreme northwest chile killdeer s common name comes from its frequently heard call description killdeer is a large plover with adults ranging in length from having a wingspan between about and usually being between in weight it has a short thick and dark bill flesh colored legs and a red eye ring thumb left in flight its are mostly brown with rufous fringes its cap back and wings being former color it has a white forehead and a white stripe behind eye and its lores and upper borders to white forehead are black killdeer also has a white collar with a black upper border rest of face is brown breast and belly are white with exception of two black breast bands it is only plover in north america with two breast bands rump is red and tail is mostly brown latter also has a black subterminal band a white terminal band and barred white feathers on outer portion of tail in flight a white wing stripe at base of flight feathers is visible female s mask and breast bands tend to be browner than those of male adult of subspecies charadrius vociferus ternominatus is smaller and paler and greyer than nominate and subspecies c v peruvianus is smaller than nominate and has more extensive rufous feather fringes juvenile is similar to adult upperparts of chicks are colored dusky and buff their underparts forehead neck and chin are white and they have a single band across their breast killdeer is a vocal species calling even at night its calls include nasal notes like deee and kil deee basis of its common name during display flights it repeats a call of kil deer or kee when this plover is disturbed it emits notes in a rapid sequence such as kee di di di its is a long fast trill habitat and distribution nominate subspecies of killdeer breeds in us including southeastern alaska southern canada and mexico with less widespread grounds further south to panama some northern populations are migratory this bird is resident in southern half of its breeding range found throughout year in most of contiguous united states it also winters south to central america west indies colombia ecuador and islands off venezuela leaving its breeding grounds after mid july with migration peaking from august to september migration to breeding grounds starts in february and ends in mid may right thumb subspecies c v ternominatus in cuba subspecies charadrius vociferus ternominatus is thought to be resident in bahamas greater antilles and virgin islands c v peruvianus is seen year round in west ecuador peru and extreme northwestern chile killdeer uses beach habitats and coastal wetlands and fields during non breeding season it forages almost exclusively in these fields especially those with short vegetation and with cattle which likely shorten vegetation and standing water when breeding killdeer has a of about although this is generally larger when nesting more than away from water although generally a low land species it is found up to snowline in meadows and open lakeshores during its autumn migration behavior breeding left thumb copulation killdeer forms pairs on its breeding grounds right after arriving both sexes although male more often than female advertise in flight with loud killdeer calls male also advertises by calling from a high spot scraping out a dummy nest and with killdeer flights where it flies with slow wingbeats across its territory ground chases occur when a killdeer has been approached multiple times by another killdeer similarly flight chases occur when an individual has been approached from air both are forms of territorial defense killdeer nests in open fields or other flat areas with short vegetation usually below tall such as agricultural fields and meadows nests are also sometimes located on rooftops this plover frequently breeds close to where it bred previous year male seems to usually renest in same area regardless of whether or not it retains same mate this does not appear to be true of female which has been observed to not use same territory if it does not have same mate nest itself is merely a shallow depression or scrape in ground fringed by some stones and blades of grass it is generally built with white nesting material instead of darker colors function of this is suspected to either help keep nest cool or conceal it in a study of piping plovers former function was supported as nests were to cooler than surrounding ground latter function also had some support as plovers generally chose pebbles closer in color to eggs nests that contrasted more with ground suffered more predation when nesting on rooftops killdeer may choose a flat roof or build a nest of raised gravel sometimes lined with white pebbles or pieces of seashells thumb a female on a nest in pennsylvania eggs of killdeer are typically laid from mid march to early june in southern portion of range and from mid april to mid july in northern part in both cases breeding season itself extends to about august in puerto rico and possibility in other caribbean islands breeding occurs year round killdeer lays a clutch of four to six eggs that are buff to beige in color with brown markings and black speckles eggs are about in size and laid at intervals of 24 to 48 hours energy expenditure of both sexes is at its highest during egg laying female needs to produce eggs and male needs to defend its territory both of sexes are closer to nest site than usual during egg laying and incubation although male is generally closer than female during all stages of breeding this latter fact is likely due to male s increased investment in nest site defense up to five replacement clutches can be laid and there are occasionally two broods second broods are usually laid in nesting territory of first brood eggs are incubated for 22 to 28 days by both male and female with former typically incubating at night time dedicated to incubation is related to temperature with one study recording that killdeer incubated eggs 99 of time when temperature was about 76 of time around and 87 of time at about when it is hot above at least incubation cools eggs generally through shading by one of parents thumb left eggs in a nest on ground about 53 of eggs are lost mainly to predators young are precocial starting to walk within first days of their life after they hatch both parents lead them out of nest generally to a feeding territory with dense vegetation under which chicks can hide when a predator is near chicks are raised at least in single brood pairs by both parents likely because of high failure rate of nests and need for both parents to be present to successfully raise young in these broods young are usually attended by one parent at a time generally female until about two weeks of age after which both parents are occasionally seen together with chicks otherwise non attentive adult is at least about away from chicks periods of attentiveness for each parent generally last from about one to one and a half hours when chicks are young this is mainly spent standing as chicks get older less time is dedicated to standing when young are below two weeks of age attending adult spends little time feeding foraging time increases as chicks grow non attentive adult defends young most of time when they are less than a week old but this task steadily shifts onto attentive adult until about three weeks of age when attending parent does almost all of defense one parent at a time broods chicks and does so frequently until they are two days old young are brooded during rain until about 15 days after hatching and during night for about 18 days after hatching only time when they are not in presence of a parent is when parents are mating or responding to a predator or aggressive conspecific thumb a chick in new jersey when a pair has two broods second is usually attended by just male who is able to hatch eggs on his own unlike female in this case male does not spend most of time standing amount of time it does stand though stays constant as chicks age like attentive adults in two parent broods sole parent increases time spent foraging as young age young fledge about 31 days after hatching and generally move to moister areas in valleys and on banks of rivers they may be cared for by their parents for up to 10 days after they fledge and exceptionally for 81 days after hatching about 52 to 63 of nests fail to produce any fledged young breeding starts after one year of age killdeer has a maximum lifespan of at least 10 years and 11 months feeding killdeer feeds primarily on insects especially beetles and flies in addition to millipedes worms snails spiders and some seeds it opportunistically takes tree frogs and dead minnows it forages almost exclusively in fields no matter tide especially those with short vegetation and with cattle which likely shorten vegetation and standing water standing water alone does not have a significant effect on field choice unless combined with cattle viable can be recovered from killdeer feces indicating that this bird is important in transporting aquatic organisms killdeer uses visual cues to forage an example of this is foot trembling where it stands on one foot shaking other in shallow water for about five seconds pecking at any prey stirred up when feeding in fields it sometimes follows plows to take earthworms disturbed to surface female forages significantly more than male during most stages of breeding former feeds most before and during egg laying least when incubation starts as there is little time to feed with a return to high levels after during non breeding season killdeer forages during night depending on lunar cycle when moon is full it feeds more at night and roosts more during day foraging at night has benefits for this bird including increased insect abundance and reduced predation predators and parasites killdeer is parasitized by acanthocephalans cestodes nematodes and trematodes it is preyed upon by herring gulls common crows raccoons and striped skunks mentioned birds and other avian predators are majority of predators in some areas during breeding season predation is not limited to eggs and chicks mustelids for example can kill incubating adults responses to predators parents use various methods to distract predators during breeding season one method is broken wing display also known as injury feigning before displaying it usually runs from its nest making alarm calls and other disturbances when bird has attention of predator former turns its tail towards latter displaying threatening orange color of rump it then crouches droops its wings and lowers its tail with an increasing intensity wings are held higher tail is fanned out and tail becomes more depressed another behavior that has received attention is ungulate display where adult raises its wings exposes its rump lowers its head and charges at intruder this can be fatal to displaying bird intensity of responses to predators varies throughout breeding season during egg laying most common response to predators is to quietly leave nest as incubation starts and progresses intensity of predator responses increases peaking after hatching this is probably because it is worth more to protect young then as they are more likely to fledge after hatching reactions decrease in intensity until a normal response is calling this is because young become more independent as they age status killdeer is considered a least concern species by iucn this is due to its large range of about and population estimated by iucn to be about one million birds or about two million according to handbook of birds of world alive even though population is declining it is not decreasing fast enough to be considered a vulnerable species it is protected in us by migratory bird treaty act of 1918 and in canada by migratory birds convention act notes
