thumb mary i of england touching for scrofula 16th century illustration by levina teerlinc royal touch also known as king s touch was a form of laying on of hands whereby french and english monarchs touched their subjects regardless of social classes with intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis better known as scrofula or king s evil and exclusively to them from 16th century onwards disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own giving impression that monarch s touch cured it claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties origins thumb left a 15th century manuscript depicting tradition that clovis i healed scrofulous following his coronation kings and queens regnant of england and kings of france were only christian rulers who claimed divine gift to cure by touching or stroking diseased this special aptitude was thought to be evidence of god s high esteem of two monarchies though they never agreed upon whose predecessors ability was first conferred in england saint edward confessor r 1042 1066 was said to be first monarch to possess healing power of royal touch french who normally traced origins of their monarchs divine gift back to philip i r 1059 1108 or even robert ii r 987 1031 denied that saint edward used royal touch they insisted that first english monarch to claim ability was henry i r 1100 1135 and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation of gift granted exclusively to french monarchs physician andre du laurens 1558 1609 claimed that clovis i r 481 511 was first king who touched for scrofula but medievalist marc bloch 1886 1944 argued that it was probably philip i modern scholars most notably frank barlow 1911 2009 agree that french practice most likely originated from saint louis ix r 1226 1270 earliest direct evidence of royal touch in england are financial records dating from reign of edward i r 1272 1307 crusading edward i did not arrive in england until 1274 but custom of giving one penny to each patient had become well established by 1276 suggesting that practice dated at least from reign of his father henry iii r 1216 1272 henry iii known for insisting on his arbitrary decisions loved public displays and was as pious as his beloved brother in law saint louis ix all of which makes it likely that he introduced practice in england england thumb touch piece of henry vi r 1422 1461 henry i s successors did not consider royal touch fundamental reducing its application ritual remained a marginal aspect of kingship until 17th century when its appeal grew to unprecedented proportions and when it suddenly became an object of scrutiny in literature since reign of edward iv r 1461 1470 1471 1483 monarchs presented diseased with a gold coin known as an angel and hung it around subject s neck reverse of coin depicted a ship while obverse showed archangel michael slaying a dragon which led to coin being popularly referred to as an angel angels were currency valued at 6s 8d when introduced but when used as a touch piece they were pierced for hanging round neck diseased were instructed to wear coin constantly to ensure success of treatment not all people embraced notion of royal touch and miraculous cures many were simply eager to obtain valuable gold coin when angel went out of production in 1634 a small gold medal was struck for royal touching procedure henry vii r 1485 1509 first tudor on english throne was preoccupied with legitimizing his reign it was he who firmly established procedure relying heavily on precedent set by his predecessors it consisted of four distinct elements monarch touched or alternatively stroked face or neck of infected person monarch hung coin around person s neck passages from gospel of mark 16 14 20 and gospel of john 1 1 14 were read mark 16 contains themes that confirm monarchs immunity to infectious diseases they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on sick and they shall recover prayers were offered until english reformation prayers were addressed not only to god but also to virgin mary and saints a most miraculous work

cross above infected person s head while her squeamish successor james i r 1603 1625 made stroking motions above abscesses instead of actually touching them frequency thumb left charles ii performing royal touch engraving by robert white 1684 ritual was normally performed between michaelmas and easter when cold weather made it less likely to contract a disease from infected subject it was believed that treatment was more likely to be successful if performed on a holy day english monarchs generally touched less frequently than their french counterparts edward i touched up to 1 736 people annually but did not touch during his frequent military campaigns abroad his immediate successors followed a similar pattern henry vii touched seven or eight infected people annually and there were intervals lasting several years during which he did not perform ritual at all henry viii r 1509 1547 touched 59 people between early january 1530 and late december 1532 protestant edward vi r 1547 1553 apparently did not perform ritual but catholic mary i r 1553 1558 took it somewhat more seriously early in her reign protestant elizabeth i was reluctant to participate in a ritual whose efficacy she probably doubted although she resumed practice in 1570 after roman catholic church excommunicated her and alleged that she had lost her healing power elizabeth decisively downplayed her own role in miraculous healing elizabethan surgeon william clowes who asserted that royal touch proved her legitimacy claimed that elizabeth could also heal foreigners citing a dutchman as an example although strictly protestant james i wished to end practice he found himself having to touch an increasing number of people practice spread to scotland where james reigned as well as resided before union of crowns scots started believing that their king now also king of england possessed ability to heal them charles i r 1625 1649 issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain growing public demand on

touched by him over 4 500 annually james ii r 1685 1688 was very skeptical about ritual but nevertheless indulged in it he was deposed by william iii r 1689 1702 and mary ii r 1689 1694 who refused to take part in what they considered a superstition when a subject asked him for a touch william reputedly said god grant you better health and better sense anne r 1702 1714 reintroduced practice almost as soon as she ascended touching 30 people on 6 october and 20 on 19 december 1702 she took it very seriously even fasting day before on 30 march 1712 she performed ritual for last time samuel johnson

richard blackmore praised william iii and george i for abandoning that superstitious and insignificant ceremony which he believed was a popish plot glorious revolution and subsequent abandonment of idea of divine right of kings rendered royal touch unnecessary as means of proving monarch s legitimacy reports of jacobite claimants curing scrofula by touch were rebuffed by a contributor to general

some of them had come from brittany brabant and demonologist pierre de 1553 1631 boasted that even dead french monarchs could heal it was indeed still believed in 16th century that healing power was retained by saint louis ix s arm preserved in monastery in catalonia in order to be touched by french king people traveled from as far off as present day italy and spain already in 13th century

helped scrofula spread more than ever and interest in disease steadily increased catholic league started a propaganda claiming that henry iii r 1574 1589 was unable to heal by touch due to his immorality after assassination of henry iii and accession of protestant henry iv r 1589 1610 league warned that god would revoke his gift if french accepted a protestant as their sovereign and that scrofulous would never be cured again after converting to catholicism and establishing his authority henry iv was hailed not only as healer of scrofulous but also as healer of kingdom first bourbon on french throne he decided to take advantage of ability attributed to his predecessors and use it to confirm legitimacy of his reign he was however in an inconvenient situation he was crowned at chartres cathedral rather than reims and thus made no visit to shrine of saint marcouf he maintained that royal touch was something he was handed down by his predecessors and by god s grace rather than an ability conferred by rite of coronation henry decided not to exhibit his divine gift immediately after his coronation at chartres in february 1594 instead he decided to save mystique element of his kingship for his entry in paris in march two weeks after event on easter henry exercised his healing power for first time he was determined not to show any skepticism about ritual fearing that it might cast doubt on sincerity of his conversion thumb louis xiv touching scrofulous in 1690 painting by jean henry iv s decision to indulge in practice served as visual evidence to his subjects that god approved of his reign royal physicians and others who witnessed these ceremonies insisted that at least half of all diseased people he touched were healed within days ceremonies took place in other cities and at least four times a year on easter on pentecost on all saints day and on christmas on easter 1608 henry iv touched 1 250 scrofulous persons he complained that hours long ceremony

that he had lost confidence in royal touch upon hearing that a mistress of louis xiv died of scrofula despite being very well touched by king after 1722 sentence exclaimed by king upon touching infected changed to more hopeful king touches you may god heal you new formula rather than implying that god would inevitably grant monarch s wish was a prayer that may or may not result in a cure louis xv r 1715 1774 was skeptical about royal touch he performed it early in his reign but caused a scandal when he failed to summon scrofulous at in 1739 and never again touched diseased custom was thus suspended for 36 years until louis xvi r 1774 1792 revived it at his coronation on 11 june 1775 by touching 2 400 people that was probably only time he touched scrofulous at his coronation on 29 may 1825 charles x r 1824 1830 touched 121 of his subjects royal touch was never again employed legacy and comparisons royal touch was not only miraculous healing power attributed to european rulers members of house of habsburg were believed to be able to cure stuttering by a mouth kiss medieval monarchs of castile were reputed to possess ability to exorcise demons by making sign of cross and calling on god while their hungarian counterparts supposedly cured jaundice similarly english monarchs distributed cramp rings which were said to be a cure for diabolical sicknesses such as cramps and epilepsy inoculation an early form of immunization was introduced into england during reign of george i who had put a definite end to royal touch in his kingdom royal family strongly supported it but it was controversial medically as well as politically and theologically medicine historian adrian wilson described it as whig and hanoverian equivalent of stuart practice of touching for scrofula but whereas royal touch mobilised divine powers based on hereditary right inoculation deployed natural powers harnessed by man with monarch as benevolent onlooker rather than indispensable participant scholars have held different opinions about royal touch ranging from deprecation in 19th and early 20th century to more sympathetic treatment whig politician lord macaulay 1800 1859 ridiculed it as an absurd superstition of a pre enlightened age university of london medicine professor sir raymund crawfurd published a study in 1911 revealing his fascination with dubious if exotic practice a study by french historian marc bloch followed in 1924 bloch was baffled by tenacity of esoteric practice and agreed with lord macaulay s assessment that it was grounded in a form of mass hysteria recently however historians have avoided attributing popularity of royal touch to naivety of masses british historian keith thomas discussed royal touch in context of religion and magic while his colleague and compatriot j c d clark attributes survival of practice into 18th century to persisting notion of divine right of kings see also faith healing history of tuberculosis references further reading
