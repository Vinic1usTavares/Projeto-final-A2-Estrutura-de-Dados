egos of her female friends who also dance around pole blonde spears and her friends while watching dancing later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across bar music video received mixed to negative reviews from critics michael slezak of entertainment weekly said moral of story is if you re going to build an entire video around a stripper pole then you better work said pole like a nine to five drop it like it s hot alas in case of gimme more i ve seen sexier pole work during an afternoon of fly fishing andrei harmsworth of metro commented to her credit video is slightly less disappointing than her mimed performance of track at video music awards last month but it is still smeared with same smutty hallmarks dose said video sucks less than you think and added spears appears lucid sometimes happy and awards worthy editing makes her appear to be standing upright competently throughout sal cinquemani of slant magazine said lightning effects and digital body enhancement of video indicate a predilection toward maintaining an image that no longer reflects reality it doesn t point to an artist who refuses to evolve but rather one who doesn t know how or isn t being allowed to ign writer sketch longwood called it one of spears hottest videos adding that she proves to be quite skilled in art of teasingly slinking around while reviewing alternate version of video in july 2011 becky bain of idolator stated that spears s last few videos particularly joyfully silly clip for i wanna go more than make up for travesty that was pop star s video for gimme more stripper concept was a poor choice barely there outfits were ill fitting choreography was a joke editing was sloppy an alternative version of video leaked online on july 18 2011 and included new scenes which featured spears strutting down street in a black outfit and laying down in a zebra print bed with a cat scenes of blonde spears were cut becky bain of idolator said that
