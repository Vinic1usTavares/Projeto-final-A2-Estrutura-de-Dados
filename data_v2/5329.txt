heartbreaking for me matsoukas wanted pretty hurts to follow a premise reminiscent to that of a documentary with most of its filming occurring organically and unplanned in an interview with mtv news matsoukas commented on music video s theme well i think we definitely wanted to speak to as many women as we could and all pain and struggle that we go through as women to maintain this impossible standard of beauty we wanted to give it a darker edge and take it there and not give you disney version of that struggle and beyonce was more than willing to go that far with it and i applaud her for

get into toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves and use it as a microcosm for our society obviously those ideas don t just live in pageant world they live in our world and that s what song is about and it felt like we had to take it there to make it have meaning because otherwise it would be a superficial preachy kind of song and visual a scene from clip which depicts

scene featuring beyonce drowning in water while beauty contest s host questions her life aspirations was originally intended to depict her falling onstage however scene failed to surface because of time constraints matsoukas initially planned music video to visualize beyonce winning contest where she would realize that it was meaningless to her however beyonce suggested that an albino should serve as contest s winner instead speaking to mtv news matsoukas elaborated we thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what classic beauty standards would be and to do this with this beautiful albino woman i thought was really great and to show yeah she s not perfect she doesn t always win and you put your best foot forward and you may still lose video s ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of american actresses halle berry and vanessa a williams to promote beauty for african american women however beyonce sent a note to matsoukas suggesting

felt that it manifested that beyonce is not immune to disease randal roberts of los angeles times quipped she makes a convincing case were it not for string of nearly soft core fashion shoots that follow on album as a first song on an album pretty hurts works but as thematic opener to such a relentless visual seduction hypocrisy is hard to ignore although daisy buchanan of daily telegraph
