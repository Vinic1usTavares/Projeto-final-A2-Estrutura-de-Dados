hd 40307 d is an extrasolar planet orbiting star hd 40307 located 42 light years from earth in direction of southern constellation pictor planet was discovered by radial velocity method using harps apparatus in june 2008 it is most massive of six proposed planets in system planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form discovery hd 40307 d was discovered through doppler spectroscopy method which functions by measuring variations in radial velocity in a star produced by gravitational effect of orbiting exoplanets radial velocities were measured by high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher system harps at la silla observatory in chile s atacama desert other less massive planets orbiting hd 40307 were discovered in same way hd 40307 b and hd 40307 c first and then hd 40307 e hd 40307 f and hd 40307 g discovery of hd 40307 d and former two was announced at astrophysics conference that took place on june 16 18 2008 in nantes france orbit and mass hd 40307 d has a mass of at least 9 2 times earth s assuming that all planets in system have coplanar orbits it is most massive planet known in system planet orbits approximately 0 135 astronomical units from its primary star as compared to earth s orbit at approximately one astronomical unit away from sun as a result one year on hd 40307 d constitutes approximately 20 45 earth days eccentricity of planet s orbit was found to not differ significantly from zero meaning that there is insufficient data to distinguish orbit from an entirely circular one star around which hd 40307 d orbits has an unusually low metallicity compared to that of other planet bearing stars this supports a hypothesis concerning possibility that metallicity of stars during their births may determine whether a protostar s accretion disk forms gas giants or terrestrial planets characteristics planet has not been found to transit and further it is not likely to it has also not been imaged more specific physical characteristics such as radius composition and average surface temperature cannot be observed characterizing extrasolar planets timothy m brown chapter 3 extrasolar planets xvi canary islands winter school of astrophysics edited by hans deeg juan antonio belmonte and antonio aparicio cambridge uk cambridge university press 2007 a dynamical study of planets b c and d showed tidal effects at least on b and c to extent that b had to be a sub neptune all planets from b to at least f must have migrated inward that study implied that d was a sub neptune as well as such strong tidal forces often result in destruction of larger natural satellites in planets orbiting close to a star it is unlikely that hd 40307 d hosts any satellites see also references external links category hd 40307 category exoplanets category pictor constellation category super earths category exoplanets discovered in 2008 category exoplanets detected by radial velocity
