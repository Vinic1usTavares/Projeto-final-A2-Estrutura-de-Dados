arana castro was born on 3 december 1905 in villa canales guatemala his parents angel maria arana and margarita castro were from a lower middle class family he had both spanish and indigenous heritage and latter trait was visually more prominent he did not have a formal education but he was relatively well read and was described by his contemporaries as canny and intelligent and as a charismatic and convivial person he was described as a poor public speaker but as a very persuasive man in intimate conversations in 1946 during guatemalan revolution a staff member at united states embassy described his politics as nationalist as well as being slightly pro american october revolution in june 1944 a series of popular protests forced resignation of dictator jorge ubico ubico appointed federico ponce vaides leader of a three person junta which would lead provisional government a few days later ponce vaides persuaded congress to appoint him interim president ponce pledged to hold free elections soon while continuing ubico s policy of suppressing protests this resulted in growing support for an armed revolution among some sections of populace by this time guatemalan army was disillusioned with junta and progressives within it had begun to plot a coup arana became a member of this plot only in its later stages plot was initially led by jacobo arbenz and sandoval however as commander of guardia de honor arana was in a position of substantial authority within army sandoval was able to persuade arana to join coup in its final stages on 19 october arana and arbenz launched a coup against government of ponce vaides they were joined next day by other factions of army and civilian population initially battle went against revolutionaries but after an appeal for support their ranks were swelled by unionists and students and they eventually subdued police and army factions loyal to ponce vaides on 20 october next day ponce vaides surrendered unconditionally both arana and arbenz fought with distinction in coup arana arbenz and jorge toriello became members of a new three person ruling junta with arana who as a major was ranking army officer becoming its senior member arana did not wish to turn over power to a civilian administration he tried to persuade arbenz and toriello to postpone election and after juan jose arevalo was elected president in december 1944 he asked them to declare election results invalid arbenz and toriello insisted that arevalo be allowed to take power which arana reluctantly agreed to on condition that arana s position as commander of military be unchallenged arevalo had no choice but to agree to this and so new constitution of guatemala created in 1945 created a new position of commander of armed forces a position which was more powerful than that of defense minister he could only be removed by congress and even then only if he was found to have broken law when arevalo was inaugurated as president arana stepped into this new position and arbenz was sworn in as defense minister chief of armed forces after arana assumed his new and powerful position an american embassy official stated in a dispatch that arana was type of personality that might assume dictatorial power on 16 december 1945 arevalo was seriously injured in a car accident and incapacitated for a period leaders of revolutionary action party par party that supported government were afraid that arana would take opportunity to launch a coup a handful of its leaders approached arana and made a deal with him which later came to be known as del pact of ravine arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with military in return par agreed to support arana s candidacy in next presidential election scheduled for november 1950 this undertaking was given in writing however it was kept a secret american embassy only learned of it in 1947 arevalo himself recovered swiftly but was forced to support agreement although guatemala was not completely by guatemalan revolution illiterate women for example were still denied vote it nonetheless brought about substantial labor reforms parties that supported arevalo s government were led by young middle class individuals who supported this process reforms alarmed guatemala s landowning elite who looked for a political candidate who would support their cause thus a number of wealthy guatemalans began to cultivate arana s support against labor reforms of arevalo arana began to publicly complain about labor reforms without actually taking any actions against arevalo in 1948 congressional election he supported a number of anti arevalo candidates however none of them were elected to congress after electoral failure arana continued to try through threats and persuasion to get elected representatives to support him he talked to jose manuel fortuny a leftist leader in par fortuny later said that arana asked him why don t you and your friends like me i m not a man of right to which fortuny responded we are not against you we appreciate role that you played in revolt against ponce it s just that you have no sympathy for labour by 1949 national renovation party and par were both openly hostile to arana a small faction of popular liberation front fpl supported him but was soundly defeated at fpl party convention in 1949 as a result faction split off to support arana leftist parties decided to back arbenz instead as they believed that only a military officer could defeat arana in 1947 arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from country arbenz vocally disagreed with arana and latter s intervention limited number of deportees death in order to run for election constitution required that arana resign his military position by may 1950 and that his successor be chosen by congress from a list submitted by consejo superior de la defensa csd elections for csd were scheduled for july 1949 months before this election saw intense wrangling as arana supporters tried to gain control over election process specifically they wanted election to be supervised by regional commanders loyal to arana rather than centrally dispatched observers arana called an emergency meeting of csd just before scheduled election at which no agreement was reached but a few days later arana s supporters suddenly gave in to demands of arbenz supporters on 16 july 1949 arana delivered an ultimatum to arevalo demanding expulsion of all of arbenz supporters from cabinet and military he threatened a coup if his demands were not met arevalo informed arbenz and other progressive leaders of ultimatum who all agreed that arana should be exiled a secret meeting of permanent committee of congress met and voted to dismiss arana cuban president carlos prio socarras agreed to give arana asylum there two days later arevalo and arana had another meeting at which arevalo later said that arana was highly threatening and abusive on way back arana s convoy was intercepted by a small force led by arbenz a shootout ensued killing three men including arana arana s supporters in military rose up in revolt but they were leaderless and by next day rebels asked for negotiations coup attempt left approximately 150 dead and 200 wounded many of arana s supporters including carlos castillo armas were exiled details of incident were not made public in a speech on 21 july arevalo made a speech describing arana s death he suggested that arana had flirted with conspiring against president with people hostile to arevalo but had eventually refused to overthrow government and been assassinated for his refusal he did not name assassins but suggested that they were members of conservative opposition he declared five days of national mourning in arana s honor prior to making this speech arevalo shared text with his ministers arbenz and a few others had disagreed with its thrust and suggested that entire truth be told however they were overruled by majority of ministers historian piero gleijeses stated that if arana had attempted a coup without delivering an ultimatum he would likely have succeeded however his overconfidence in his hold over military as well as his lingering desire to take power in a legitimate manner led to his effort being sabotaged before it truly began gleijeses also stated that arbenz probably had orders to capture rather than to kill arana
