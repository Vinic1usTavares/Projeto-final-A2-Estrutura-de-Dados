1872 some literature and film scholars have drawn comparisons between let s scare jessica to death and irish novelist sheridan le fanu s novel carmilla 1871 which tells story of a female vampire scholar nancy west cites film as one of several examples of horror films of 1970s that directly lift premise of novel and place it in other historical or cultural contexts this languid movie reimagines le fanu s laura as jessica like carmilla emily is a horror of a houseguest and after both men have been bitten by her it becomes apparent that emily is none other than one hundred year old vampire who in course of time has attacked all men in nearby town is emily an imaginative projection of jessica s murderous feelings toward her husband of jessica s frustration with a mental condition that has rendered her sadly dependent on men film never makes clear decline of 1960s counterculture has been cited as a theme by critics and observers hearse that duncan and jessica drive which has with word love spray painted on it has been noted as a blatant reference to death of hippie values critic and biographer michael doyle describes film as a haunting elegy for failures of hippie movement doyle elaborates that film isolates and illuminates death and corruption of counterculture values from era and anticipates festering paranoia that occurred 1970s with watergate scandal assassinations of harvey milk and george moscone and jonestown massacre director john hancock though ambivalent about whether it was consciously or subconsciously integrated into screenplay has conceded this interpretation commenting you could already feel that negativity brewing when we were making jessica that things weren t working out way some of us had hoped and dreamed they would production development according to lee kalcheim original script for film was far different from completed film hired by producer charles b moss kalcheim s original screenplay entitled it drinks hippie blood followed a group of hippies camping on a cove who are attacked by a creature that lives in water kalcheim described his screenplay as a satire john hancock turned screw so to speak making it a serious darker theme simplicity of film worked perfectly to create a scary mood hancock agreed to direct film only as long as he was allowed to redraft screenplay and proceeded to rework kalcheim s original script in both tone and thematic content but retained certain elements at request of producers mute girl played by gretchen corbett for example was a character from kalcheim s original script that moss requested hancock retain in his redraft scene in which group attempt a seance was also requested to be kept in film by both kalcheim and producers hancock stated that scenes didn t make much sense to me but mosses felt they would be particularly enjoyable and scary i trusted their instincts because they had a concrete experience of audiences kalcheim is credited as a co writer on film under pseudonym norman jonas certain elements of film were drawn from hancock s own life such as apple orchard settings and farmhouse as he had grown up on an apple orchard as well as norman s career as a bassist as hancock s father was a professional double bass player in writing role of jessica hancock sought to create a filmic equivalent to unreliable narrator in literary fiction jessica was partly influenced by governess in henry james s novella turn of screw as well as character of eleanor lance in robert wise s film haunting 1963 theme of evil pervading protagonist s mind was central i was alarmed by notion that you can t defeat or defuse evil it forever lives inside and all around us so i worked that fear inside story said hancock casting thumb upright 1 3 right film s

remaining in character hancock recalled of her casting i knew she would be perfect for lead role zohra could play fragility of character but she could also authentically convey fear and terror mariclare costello an actress who had worked as a casting director on hancock s stage production of freaking out of stephanie blake 1967 was cast opposite lampert as mysterious hippie emily hancock was specifically taken by costello s physical features which included bright red hair and a pale complexion which he felt was befitting of vampiric emily barton heyman and kevin o connor were given

east haddam chester ferry is featured in film crossing connecticut river co producer william badalato had suggested location my wife and i had a weekend house in chester connecticut we loved area and shared our feelings with john hancock and producer charles b moss jr after a preliminary scout we all agree that this was where jessica should be filmed badalato recalled of hancock s direction he was always responsible to our budget and was very confident with actors he felt close to material as it spoke to him in some bizarre way john actually used to take his own pulse while he was shooting and i was completely intrigued by this because film was shot in fall months sequences that were shot in lake required actors to swim in very cold water scene in which costello s character emerges from lake in a wedding dress was filmed in late november on a day in which it had snowed music let s scare jessica to death was one of first horror films to prominently feature a synthesizer in its musical

reel vampires seem to have lost their bite roger greenspun of new york times also praised lampert s performance and lauded film calling it a thinking man s vampire movie probably a secret dream for at least half world s young filmmakers kevin thomas of los angeles times remarked strong sense of atmosphere in film in addition to four lead performances who are likable believable people but conceded there s no getting around movie s poorly resolved script san francisco examiners stanley also noted deficiencies in screenplay noting that film seems improvised and nothing could be worse for this kind of structured suspense thriller hancock s direction is ridiculously disjointed and inconsistent this sentiment was echoed by kevin kelly of boston globe who felt film contained so many idiosyncrasies that nothing rings true jack meredith of windsor star described film as a far out bit of froth that nevertheless packs continuing suspense and a what s going to happen next element that never lets down through about 1 1 2 hours of sustained action writing for edmonton journal barry westgate was critical of film noting even contrived cinema has to have its share of rhyme or reason and this effort by john hancock doesn t have so much as a touch of either ann guarino of new york daily news commented on film s ambiguous plot writing that it presents problem and leaves you to solve it film may not take curl out of your hair but it will hold your interest even if title will throw you off there actually is no plot to scare jessica she also praised performances of lampert and costello as well as those of heyman and o connor but noted of latter that their characters are not well developed by script pittsburgh post gazettes donald miller wrote that after first ten minutes i thought director john hancock was onto something if not a new genre then perhaps something as arresting as cat people but felt that it devolved into a routine vampire romp though he did praise cinematography and visuals modern contemporary critical reviews of film have been mixed film scholar john stanley gave film a favorable review in his 1995 book writing director john hancock is to be congratulated for a multi layered horror film with frightening visuals there isn t much logic to story yet overall effect is unsettling film has a dream like quality allmovie deemed it an eerie low budget chiller film scholar gary a smith remarked lampert s performance as jessica as laid back to point of somnambulism lampert gives a performance so overwrought that it has to rank as one of most eccentric ever captured on film in 2006 eric henderson of slant gave film an unfavorable review writing a lesbian panic melodrama in new england gothic drag only things separating let s scare jessica to death from its cinematic descendants are its narrative incoherence its lack of a directorial presence especially surprising considering colloquial implications of director s name and its drab douche commercial

very disturbing and noting its lovely and poetic visuals film critic leonard maltin awarded film 2 1 2 out of a possible 4 stars calling it creepy in a 2013 article published by film society of lincoln center erik wrote of film technical qualities of let s scare jessica to death are superb with gorgeous cinematography and an audio track that takes on a life of its own each sound and image presents a hazy version of reality as plot develops we learn that world around jessica is scarier than anything her mind could concoct genre scholar kim newman has praised film specifically lampert s performance which he ranks as equal to those of gena rowlands in a woman under influence 1974 carrie snodgress in diary of a mad housewife 1970 shirley knight in rain people 1969 and susannah york in
