1992 atlantic hurricane season was a well below average hurricane season that had one of latest dates on record for first named storm season officially began on june 1 1992 and lasted until november 30 1992 first storm an unnamed subtropical storm developed in central atlantic on april 21 over a month before official start of hurricane season most significant storm of season was hurricane andrew which at time was costliest u s hurricane after crossing bahamas hurricane made landfall in florida and louisiana it caused 27 3 billion 1992 usd in damage mostly in florida and 65 fatalities andrew was also strongest hurricane of season reaching winds of while approaching florida unusually hurricanes bonnie and charley produced tropical storm force winds in azores and former caused one fatality tropical storm danielle was one of few tropical cyclones known to make landfall on delmarva peninsula storm caused minor damage and two fatalities in mid atlantic and new england regions of united states one other hurricane in season frances did not significantly affect land system developed in central atlantic and tracked well away from land and brought only light rainfall to newfoundland in addition to seven storms there were three non developing tropical depressions first depression of season caused flooding in cuba and florida while other two depressions did not affect any land collectively storms in 1992 atlantic hurricane season caused 27 3 billion in losses and 73 fatalities season summary pre season forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 1992 season source date

csu and weather research center wrc a normal season as defined by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has 12 1 named storms of which 6 4 reach hurricane strength and 2 7 become major hurricanes in december 1991 csu issued its first forecast for year and predicted that 1992 would see eight named storms four hurricanes and one major hurricane csu also issued a forecast in april june and august however no revisions were made to numbers of named storms hurricanes and major hurricane predicted in 1992 prior to season starting wrc predicted that season would see six named storms with three of those becoming a hurricane while no forecast was made on numbers of major hurricanes season activity atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 but activity in 1992 began more than a month earlier with formation of subtropical storm one on april 21 it was a below average season in which 10 tropical depressions formed seven of depressions attained tropical storm status and four of these attained hurricane status in addition one tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status which is below 1981 2010 average of 2 7 per season low amount of activity is partially attributed to weaker than normal tropical waves source for most north atlantic tropical cyclones only two hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during season however damage from hurricane andrew was astronomical causing most of season s 106 deaths and 27 3 billion 1992 usd damage toll last storm of season hurricane frances became extratropical on october 27 over a month before official end of season on november 30 tropical cyclogenesis in 1992 atlantic hurricane season began with development of subtropical storm one on april 21 however over next three months minimal activity occurred with only two depressions developing one in june and other in july although wind shear was relatively weak in august only one tropical cyclone occurred in that month however that one tropical cyclone hurricane andrew was strongest and costliest of season though september is climatological peak of hurricane season an increase in wind shear prevented tropical cyclogenesis in first half of month after september 16 however five tropical cyclones developed in a span of nine days from september 17 to 26 thereafter activity abruptly halted and only one tropical cyclone developed in october hurricane frances by october 27 frances became extratropical which was more than a month before official end of season on november 30 season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 76 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength although officially subtropical cyclones such as first storm are excluded from total figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase systems subtropical storm one on april 21 a low pressure area separated from prevailing westerlies about southeast of bermuda and developed into a subtropical depression at 1200 utc system maintained a large comma shaped cloud pattern around low level circulation operationally it was not classified until 27 hours later isolated from strong steering currents depression tracked northwestward at and intensified into a subtropical storm early on april 22 this was first such storm on record in month it gradually became better organized with a large convective band in eastern semicircle reports from a nearby ship indicated peak winds of with swells of national hurricane center remarked potential for system transitioning into a tropical cyclone an approaching trough caused storm to stall and weaken deep convection on april 23 cyclone weakened to depression status due to strong wind shear a hurricane hunter s flight into system confirmed weakening and also reported a temperature rise in center suggesting a warm core and some tropical characteristics early on april 24 subtropical depression turned eastward maintaining limited convection at time forecasters anticipated depression would continue east northeastward and become an extratropical cyclone by late on april 24 system was too weak to classify using dvorak technique and nhc ceased issuing advisories within 24 hours circulation dissipated as system continued eastward through westerlies tropical depression one a tropical wave emerged off western coast of africa on june 12 and eventually developed into tropical depression one in southeastern gulf of mexico operationally national hurricane center designated this system as tropical depression two which led to confusion because of subtropical storm one in april and then another tropical depression two in july outflow from hurricane celia in pacific ocean and a trough in gulf of mexico generated wind shear on depression which prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm depression curved north northeastward and eventually made landfall in near tampa florida on june 26 around 1500 utc as it was moving ashore national hurricane center noted that depression was too poorly organized to locate center of circulation and discontinued advisories on system depression dropped heavy rainfall in cuba peaking at large amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding which damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities in provinces of pinar del rio and la habana as system was only a tropical depression light winds were reported however a peak gust of was reported at macdill air force base heavy rainfall fell on west coast of florida with local amounts exceeded precipitation throughout state peaked at in arcadia tower heavy rainfall caused flooding in portions of florida which in turn damaged 4 000 houses and destroyed 70 houses in addition five homes destroyed and twelve were damaged by a tornado spawned in nokomis severe crop damage to orange trees was also reported depression caused two fatalities in florida and damage totaled to 2 6 million 1992 usd tropical depression two a squall line which moved offshore new york and southern new england formed a mesoscale convective vortex which fired new thunderstorm activity each day as it moved within westerlies across northern atlantic once it reached mid ocean an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped system down into subtropics to east of bermuda and it maintained decent organization by 2100 utc on july 24 national hurricane center began classifying system as tropical depression two in first advisory on depression it was noted that previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as tropical depression two due to northeasterly wind shear depression failed to intensified or organize further as predicted instead depression weakened by late on july 25 with satellite imagery indicating that much of deep convection was removed from surface circulation by july 26 national hurricane center issued its final advisory noting that it was too weak to classify and is rapidly losing its identity depression dissipated about three hours later hurricane andrew a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on august 14 and organized into tropical depression three on august 16 while located about halfway between windward islands and coast of africa it moved to west northwest and strengthened into tropical storm andrew on august 17 after reaching winds of strong southwesterly shear weakened storm and by august 20 it weakened to a minimal storm with a pressure of it bypassed lesser antilles completely and turned to west in response to a building high pressure system to north upon turning to west a trough of low pressure positioned to southwest of andrew created an environment with little vertical shear and well defined outflow storm quickly intensified due to its small size and became a hurricane on august 22 andrew rapidly intensified under ideal conditions for development and on august 23 hurricane peaked with winds of it crossed bahamas at that intensity weakened slightly and re intensified to a category 5 hurricane before making landfall near homestead florida it weakened slightly over state to a hurricane but restrengthened to a hurricane over gulf of mexico a strong mid latitude trough turned andrew northward where it greatly weakened before hitting west of morgan city louisiana on august 26 as a category 3 hurricane it turned northeastward and lost its tropical identity over tennessee on august 28 before merging with remnants of hurricane lester and another frontal system over pennsylvania on august 29 in bahamas andrew brought high tides hurricane force winds and tornadoes which caused significant damage in archipelago especially on cat cays at least 800 houses were destroyed and left damage to transport communications water sanitation agriculture and fishing sectors overall andrew caused four fatalities and 250 million in damage in bahamas throughout southern portions of florida andrew brought very high winds a wind gust of was reported at a house in perrine florida high winds caused catastrophic damage in florida especially in miami dade county where approximately 117 000 houses were either severely damaged or destroyed in everglades 70 000 acres 280 km2 of trees were knocked down and about 182 million fish were killed rainfall in florida was moderate peaking at in western miami dade county significant damage to oil platforms was reported with one company losing 13 platforms had 104 structures damaged and five drilling wells blown off course in louisiana andrew produced hurricane force winds along its path damaging 23 000 homes and destroying 985 homes and 1 951 mobile homes an f3 tornado in st john baptist parish damaged or destroyed 163 structures 17 fatalities were reported in louisiana six of which were drowning victims offshore elsewhere storm spawned at least 28 tornadoes especially in alabama georgia and mississippi overall andrew caused 65 fatalities and 27 3 billion 1992 usd in damage making it eighth costliest hurricane in u s history behind hurricane katrina in 2005 hurricane ike in 2008 hurricane sandy in 2012 hurricanes harvey irma maria in 2017 and hurricane florence in 2018 hurricane bonnie in mid september a tropical low detached from a cold front and developed into tropical depression four late on september 17 while located about east northeast of bermuda early on following day depression intensified into tropical storm bonnie due to light vertical wind shear bonnie quickly strengthened and became a hurricane late on september 18 further deepening occurred and at 1800 utc on september 21 bonnie peaked as a category 2 hurricane thereafter bonnie became nearly stationary for almost 24 hours satellite images indicated that low level center became exposed indicating that bonnie was significantly weakening while tracking southward it is estimated that bonnie weakened to a tropical storm by late on september 24 bonnie further deteriorated to tropical depression status on september 26 but re strengthened to a tropical storm later that day by 1500 utc on september 27 national hurricane center declared bonnie extratropical since it was losing tropical characteristics bonnie re acquired tropical characteristics and national hurricane center resumed advisories on storm by 2100 utc on september 28 however post analysis indicated that bonnie remained tropical during that time period bonnie re strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching azores shortly before becoming extratropical on september 30 bonnie passed through azores as a moderately weak tropical storm one location in azores reported tropical storm force winds in addition one man was killed by a rock fall on island of sao miguel no damage was reported in association with bonnie hurricane charley on september 20 meteosat imagery indicated an area of convection becoming concentrated while well south of azores it is possible that a mid to upper level cyclonic circulation interacted with northern portion of a tropical wave by following day satellite imagery noted a well defined low level circulation and thus tropical depression five while centered about south of azores depression tracked northwestward and satellite imagery began to indicate banding features as a result depression was upgraded to tropical storm charley on september 22 an eye developed as charley tracked north northwestward and it became a hurricane on september 23 further strengthening occurred and by late on september 24 charley peaked as a category 2 hurricane thereafter charley turned eastward and then east northeastward while tracking over decreasing sea surface temperatures sst early on september 27 charley was downgraded to a tropical storm later that day charley crossed over terceira island in azores with winds of charley gradually lost tropical characteristics and by 1800 utc on september 27 it had transitioned into an extratropical storm remnant system accelerated northeastward toward british isles where it merged with another extratropical low on september 29 while passing through azores charley produced tropical storm force winds with lajes afb reporting sustained winds of and gusts reaching no other effects from charley were reported in azores tropical storm danielle tropical depression six developed offshore of southeastern united states on september 22 from merger of a surface trough a tropical wave and a cold front depression quickly intensified and was upgraded to tropical storm danielle six hours later an approaching trough caused a northeastward movement but later a high pressure system forced storm to northwestward which caused danielle to execute a small anti cyclonic loop on september 23 24 while offshore of north carolina on september 25 danielle reached its peak intensity as a moderately strong tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of it was initially predicted that danielle would make landfall in north carolina however storm curved north northwestward and made landfall in maryland on eastern shore of delmarva peninsula at same intensity danielle continued inland and weakened and dissipated over eastern pennsylvania on september 26 danielle caused severe beach erosion in north carolina virginia and maryland which resulted in overwash which in turn damaged or destroyed several businesses and houses in coastal portions of three states in addition street flooding also closed several roads in region most notably north carolina highway 12 many states in mid atlantic and new england also reported rainfall although rarely exceeding in addition high seas offshore of new jersey capsized a sailboat causing two people to drown overall damage from storm was minimal with exception of damaged or destroyed businesses and houses in north carolina virginia and maryland tropical depression seven a poorly organized tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa on september 23 and quickly developed into tropical depression seven on september 25 while centered southwest of cape verde because depression was tracking over warm sst it was predicted to intensify into a tropical storm however wind shear exposed center as indicated by visible satellite images on september 26 and national hurricane center noted on september 26 that depression could be downgraded to a tropical wave later today early on september 27 center of depression became difficult to locate on satellite imagery by september 28 organization of depression deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear center of depression again became difficult to location by infrared images early on september 29 later that day a few computer models indicated a decrease in wind shear over depression within two days thus it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm however wind shear exposed center of depression again by early on september 30 though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status by late on october 1 satellite imagery noted that depression dissipated and national hurricane center issued its final advisory on system tropical storm earl on september 26 a tropical wave developed into tropical depression eight while centered about north of hispaniola depression tracked west northwestward toward bahamas initially depression remained weak but after reaching gulf stream it strengthened into tropical storm earl at 1200 utc on september 29 around that time earl began to veer east lessening threat to florida early on october 1 earl reached maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of it gradually weakened thereafter and earl was downgraded to a tropical depression on october 3 later that day earl became extratropical about south of bermuda threat from earl prompted a tropical storm watch in bahamas and later bermuda while a coastal flood watch was issued in florida because earl remained offshore impact was generally minor throughout florida earl spawned 11 tornadoes and brought moderately heavy rainfall peaking at near canal point florida in addition light amounts of precipitation were also reported in georgia and north carolina above normal tides washed away of beaches and lifeguards on st augustine beach made eight rescues hurricane frances a low pressure area developed along end of a quasi stationary frontal trough initially vertical wind shear prevented deep convection from forming on western portion of system after wind shear decreased system became a gale center late on october 22 by early on following day gale center had transitioned into a tropical storm and it is estimated that tropical storm frances developed at 0600 utc on october 23 frances quickly strengthened after becoming a tropical storm and was upgraded to a hurricane by 1800 utc on that same day after becoming a hurricane frances curved northeastward and remained well east of bermuda by midday on october 24 frances peaked as an category 1 hurricane after reaching peak intensity frances began tracking over cooler sst which gradually weakened storm eye featured became indistinct and by late on october 25 frances was downgraded to a tropical storm over next two days frances began losing tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical by early on october 27 one sailor was reported missing however it is unknown if it was as a result of frances in addition one person on a sailboat suffered injuries during an encounter with frances on land frances caused minimal impact limited to light rainfall across newfoundland storm names following names were used for named storms that formed in north atlantic in 1992 subtropical storms were unnamed until 2002 as a result subtropical cyclone in april 1992 did not receive a name names not retired from this list appeared again on naming list for 1998 season this is same naming list used for 1986 season names that were not assigned are marked in andrew bonnie charley danielle earl frances retirement at their meeting in spring of 1993 world meteorological organization retired name andrew from list above name that
