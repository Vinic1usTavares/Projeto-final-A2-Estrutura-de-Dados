british rail class 700 is an electric multiple unit passenger train built between 2014 and 2018 for thameslink as part of thameslink programme in united kingdom a fleet of 60 eight car and 55 twelve car trains have entered service between spring 2016 and 2018 maintenance depots have been built at hornsey and three bridges first train was delivered in late july 2015 in 2011 consortium cross london trains consisting of siemens project ventures 3i infrastructure and innisfree was announced as preferred bidder with siemens to manufacture trains decision was politically controversial as trains were to be built in germany while competing consortium led by bombardier transportation had a train factory in uk both procurement process and final close of contract were significantly delayed resulting in expected first delivery date moving from 2012 to 2016 ps1 6 billion contract to manufacture and provide service depots for trains was finalised in june 2013 first unit 700108 was introduced on 20

began its procurement process thameslink rolling stock project or thameslink rolling stock programme on 9 april 2008 with aim of introducing more passenger capacity on thameslink lines to match expected demand in addition bidders were to provide depots for vehicle maintenance and storage and finance for rolling stock project whereby revenues would be generated from long term leasing of rolling stock to train operating company and associated maintenance payments general specifications included high reliability short station dwell times integrated information technology including passenger information and information for vehicle maintenance a top speed of high acceleration and deceleration performance in line with a high frequency timetable trains were to be designed for low weight low track forces and high energy efficiency a standard 12 car train was to be about long and services using 8 car trains are limited to passenger accommodation were to include versions for both metro and commuter trains based around a 2 2 seating arrangement with fold up seats and designed for high levels of standing passengers ride quality and noise levels were expected to equal or be better than those of current vehicles and climate control air conditioning was to be fitted vehicles were to be fitted for driver only operation and to include gsm r communications radio as well as aws and level 2 safety systems ability to be used in automatic train operation ato mode where an on board computer controls motors and brakes was also specified vehicles were to operate on 750 v dc and 25 kv ac electrification systems with regenerative brakes maintenance time was to be reduced by use of modular components remote diagnostics and avoidance of over complicated systems department for transport gave a target of when empty for a train bids in july 2008 department for transport shortlisted consortia including alstom bombardier hitachi and siemens as train builders invitations to tender were issued to four bidders in november 2008 hitachi exited bidding process in april 2009 in july 2009 siemens unveiled desiro city a development of design and technology used in its british desiro range and desiro mainline range development of design began in 2007 with an investment of about ps45 million in september 2009 alstom unveiled x uk unusually an articulated vehicle using cars with individual carriages proposed to be supported at one end by a bogie and at opposite end by a linkage to next carriage shorter vehicle allowed a slightly wider design smaller number of bogies was to have resulted in a train approximately 40 tonnes lighter than a conventional design however design would have resulted in a higher axle load bid was rejected in october 2009 bombardier transportation offered a design incorporating a development of eco inside frame bogie with bogie mounted traction motors both bombardier s and siemens rolling stock designs were conventional emus incorporating inside frame bogies and modern passenger and rolling stock information systems contract decision and financial close thumb right full size mock up of class 700 at excel contract for order was originally planned to be signed in summer 2009 with first vehicles in service by february 2012 and squadron service by 2015 award of contract was delayed by 2010 general election and subsequent spending review following which procurement was announced to be proceeding in late 2010 on 16 june 2011 cross london trains ltd a consortium formed by siemens project ventures gmbh innisfree ltd and 3i infrastructure ltd was named preferred bidder for pfi contract and targeted entry of trains into service was rescheduled to 2015 2018 vehicles would be manufactured at siemens plant in krefeld germany and maintenance depots were to be built at hornsey london and three bridges sussex because trains were to be built outside uk decision to award contract to siemens proved controversial there was widespread criticism of uk government s bidding process and perceived lack of support for british manufacturing which in turn led to a review of governmental procurement mechanisms contract was significantly delayed initially siemens had hoped to reach agreement in early 2012 by late 2011 commercial close was hoped for by end of year and financial close in early 2013 key aspects of commercial contract were reported to have been finalised by december 2012 as a result of delays to procurement in late 2012 train operating company southern began procurement of 116 dual voltage emus from bombardier that would be used temporarily on thameslink route until 2015 order contract was finalised in july 2013 in mid 2013 national audit office nao reported that contract delay could negatively impact delivery of entire thameslink programme ps1 6 billion contract to finance supply and maintain a 1 140 carriage fleet of passenger rolling stock was finalised between dft supplier siemens and cross london trains consortium on 14 june 2013 to finance work loans were arranged with nineteen banks with lloyds sumitomo mitsui banking corporation kfw and acting as mandated lead arrangers european investment bank also provided a debt facility loans for construction of rolling stock depots were through siemens financial services in 2014 nao reported on handling of intercity express and thameslink rolling stock procurement projects by department for transport report questioned dft s attempt to take leadership in project contrary to general policy without any prior experience of large scale rolling stock procurement nao also said dft had handled communications with bidders poorly increasing likelihood of a legal challenge to its decisions additional orders in addition to thameslink fleet govia thameslink railway gtr announced upon winning franchise that it would seek to replace existing units in use on services on northern city line with up to 25 six car units intended to be procured in december 2015 gtr announced that it had selected siemens to provide this new fleet as a follow on order to class 700 with entry into service expected from 2018 order was finalised in february 2016 these are known as manufacture design and introduction design bogie thumb right class 700 powered bogie development of a new bogie type began in 2007 design was intended specifically for uk market as a replacement for sf5000 bogie to reduce energy consumption and track access charges a key feature of design was reduced weight weight saving design elements included short wheelbase inboard frames a bogie design and hollow axles total bogie weight is 6 3 tonnes powered and 4 4 tonnes trailer a reduction of around one third from sf5000 design decision to procure a train with a new bogie design untested in uk was challenged by several observers at a parliamentary investigation into train procurement rival bidder bombardier already had a proven low weight bogie primary suspension system uses layered rubber with pneumatic secondary suspension bogie wheel base is motor bogie with wheels braking is by tread brakes and regenerative braking on power bogies and by two axle mounted disc brakes per axle on trailer bogies prototypes of new sf 7000 bogie were completed at siemens bogie plant in graz austria in late 2011 seating there has been criticism of seating arrangements in class 700s there are 666 seats on twelve car versions of new trains compared to 714 on a twelve car formation of a thameslink class 377 5 and 807 on a twelve car formation of a great northern they replace although there will be more seats overall as services will run more frequently reduced number of seats is to allow for more room for passengers to stand on busy commuter trains into central london prompting complaints from those who travel long distances on trains lack of any tables outside of first class has drawn similar criticism comparing experience to travelling on london underground many passengers on thameslink route have also criticised hardness and width of seats with one passenger likening them to ironing boards thameslink passengers left in pain by trains concrete seats times 18 february companies claim uncomfortable ironing board seats are due to strict government regulations telegraph 18 february 2018 tables and wi fi were later retrofitted manufacture and introduction manufacture of pre series production trainsets began before formal financial close of project in mid 2013 a mockup of train was unveiled at excel centre in january 2014 and then displayed at various stations in london and surrounding area and testing of a twelve car unit at test and validation centre began in march 2014 a completed unit was presented by siemens in krefeld germany in april 2015 first delivered train arrived in uk by end of july 2015 and was delivered to three bridges depot first test run on brighton main line took place in december

into location of depots for future thameslink rolling stock network rail preferred two depots based on an expectation that at times central area of thameslink route would be closed for maintenance outside commercial operational hours with no workable alternative electrified routes available as a result depots on either side of central thameslink area were required enabling trains to reach a depot on a nightly basis without passing through central london a single depot solution was also investigated but no suitably large sites were identified for such a facility sites were considered at wellingborough including sidings used by gb railfreight hornsey adjacent to existing hornsey emu depot then operated by first capital connect cricklewood on development land associated with planned brent cross thameslink railway station selhurst on site of existing selhurst depot used by southern three bridges a split site on either side of main line and tonbridge by late 2008 sites had been narrowed to hornsey three bridges and tonbridge finally hornsey and three bridges were selected as a two depot solution in late 2009 hornsey depot was refused permission on grounds of its scale it would have damaged a local conservation area in 2011 revised plans were submitted for both hornsey and three bridges schemes with hornsey scheme reduced in size and three bridges scheme expanded three bridges depot was to be located on either side of london to brighton main line with a five road carriage shed hornsey depot to be located next to east coast main line was to have a three road carriage shed depots were expected to be opened in 2015 and 2016 respectively in mid 2013 was awarded approximately ps150 million contract to build two depots three bridges in 2009 arup acting on behalf of network rail submitted a planning application for a rolling stock depot south of three bridges railway station with facilities on either side of brighton main line development was on a site owned by network rail 1 5 km south of three bridges railway station development site was on land historically used for railway use unbuilt on prior to railway developments by 1910 sidings had been built east of london brighton and south coast railway brighton main line as well as an engine shed and turntable adjacent west of site ordnance survey 1 2500 1873 4 1897 1910 in 2008 western development area comprised underutilised sidings and with site east of mainline including operation sidings as well as offices tenants included english welsh scottish railway bam nuttall colas rail and balfour beatty western side of proposed development included a single ended three road maintenance shed high a wheel lathe electricity substation and sidings for 8 twelve car trains eastern side included stabling for 4 twelve car trains and an underframe cleaning facility both sides of development were to have separate train washing facilities waste storage and controlled emission toilet facilities site offices and warehousing were to be in a three storey building northwest of main shed planning permission for development was granted in november 2009 but in december associated hornsey depot application was blocked by secretary of state for communities and local government network rail submitted revised plans for both sites in 2011 with a smaller hornsey scheme and an expanded three bridges scheme in same period as new application network rail submitted plans for a large railway operation and signalling centre to be built adjacent to three bridges depot see three bridges rail operating centre revised plans added additional carriage stabling on ews db schenker freight depot to west of original site with stabling for 5 eight car trains and with cet facilities and total stabling on western site was increased to 11 eight car trains additional major changes included expansion of main depot to a 5 road building wide stabling on eastern site was increased by 1 to 5 eight car trains and additional office and accommodation space was specified depot was officially opened by patrick mcloughlin mp in october 2015 completed main facilities building mfb was with five roads each with full underfloor inspection facilities and a light 2 5 t crane one road had two bogie drops and a road was fitted with 25 kv ac electrification for static tests though main building was unelectrified third rail wheel lathes and carriage washes were outside mfb hornsey network rail submitted a planning application in august 2009 development was split across sites east of main railway line main maintenance building was north of hornsey railway station and road high street turnpike lane storage sidings were located south east of hornsey station adjacent to pre existing hornsey emu depot northern site was on rail sidings coronation sidings hornsey sidings which had been developed on made embankments from later 19th century to early 20th century southern stabling area was on land that had been extensively developed as railway sidings since early 20th century ordnance survey 1 2500 1863 1896 1914 1935 proposed development required bridge widening of crossing at turnpike lane and additional embankment work and extensions main maintenance building was a six road high single ended train shed with an adjacent train wash west and a two storey warehouse adjacent to east southern site included sidings for 11 twelve car trains and 2 eight car trains with cleaning and controlled emission toilet facilities in 2009 john denham secretary of state for communities and local government blocked development of depot development had been subject to local and council objections on grounds including negative impact to a conservation area as well as a potential negative impact to haringey council s haringey heartlands redevelopment project a revised two depot plan was produced southern three bridges depot was expanded to a five road shed while estimates for total maintenance roads required had been reduced from nine to eight northern depot was required to be only a three road depot depot was to be suitable for twelve car trains with wheel lathe cleaning warehousing and stabling facilities potential sites for northern depot were reassessed and possible options reduced to three a main depot at coronation sidings hornsey a main depot adjacent to existing depot at hornsey and a site at chesterton cambridge a depot reduced in size on site of original plan was chosen as best option for network rail revised plan was submitted in 2011 with main depot reduced approximately in height and nearly half area and with estimated employment figures reduced from 270 to 120 people rail union rmt criticised loss of employment opportunities due to reduced scale of plans stating without anyone trying haringey has lost 150 jobs revised scheme continued to produce significant opposition from local residents with concerns including noise and light pollution during night working as well as visual impact and traffic main building was a three road high single ended shed with a two storey warehouse adjacent east and a train washing building adjacent west facilities at depot were to include equipment for heavy overhaul with overhead synchronised lift cranes on one road southern site adjacent to pre existing first capital connect fcc emu depot would include cet facilities another train washing building a underfloor cleaning building and shunter s cabins wheel lathe facilities were to be shared with a pre existing installation at fcc depot existing sidings adjacent to fcc depot were to be rebuilt to provide 16 roads four arrival and departure roads and 12 storage roads civil engineering work included bridge widening across turnpike lane and a culverted waterway as well as minor embankment works and rebuilding of a footbridge at hornsey station plan was given permission in late 2011 future as part of thameslink programme
