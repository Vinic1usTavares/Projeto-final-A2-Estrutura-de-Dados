kingdom at rockingham motor speedway in corby which was dropped from season schedule in november 2002 because of poor attendance and inclement weather brands hatch s return was publicly announced at autosport international show in birmingham on 9 january 2003 and it was held on indy configuration cart president and ceo chris pook cited track s proximity from london and history of brands hatch circuit as primary reasons of hosting race there he also stated that brands hatch grand prix configuration could not be used because of high cost of upgrading it to cart standards it was part of cart s desire to distance itself from indy racing league by holding european road course races brands hatch and cart invested 2 million in enhancing track s safety standards of fencing was erected around each side of indy layout around 38 000 tyres were used to construct barriers and majority of guard railing alongside circuit was reconstructed improvements were completed on day before official announcement of race tim mayer cart s international and development liaison officer admitted more efforts were needed to upgrade track to obtain an fia grade 2 licence for a potential future event on grand prix layout and noted that its history had to be regarded when altering it for increased space we have garages here that are twenty six feet long and we have cars that are sixteen feet long and each team brings two cars so you figure out very quickly that garages are not big enough you look at paddock and realize that it s going to be tight getting all our equipment in there and of course we ve done a lot of work to get enough barrier protection around track a lot of people have worked very hard to get it done championship leader tracy said he was excited to race at brands hatch and felt circuit would be challenging to drive tracy had won previous three races of season and aimed to secure his fourth consecutive victory but said he was not thinking about his recent success after starting from pole position in two of three opening rounds of season but retiring from lead in both races sebastien bourdais of newman haas racing said he wanted to win race because of its proximity to his home country france he felt two qualifying sessions would be influential in deciding its outcome and believed overtaking opportunities would be sparse walker racing s darren manning said that he hoped he would perform well at circuit since brands hatch was only track on cart schedule he had previously raced on practice and qualifying three practice sessions were held before race two 50 minute sessions on 3 may and a third 75 minute session on morning of 4 may manning set fastest time in first practice session with a lap of 37 953 seconds ahead of junqueira and tracy tiago monteiro spun at surtees corner but avoided damaging his car fernandez caused session to be suspended when he spun backwards into a tyre barrier at surtees corner which caused heavy damage to his car s rear he was unhurt tracy recorded fastest lap of second practice session at 37 263 seconds bourdais finished with second fastest time with alex tagliani in third junqueira and manning rounded out top five their best times two thousandths of a second apart two red flags were triggered during session first was for tracy who spun exiting druids hairpin removing front wing of his car in a collision with a tyre barrier second when tagliani spun at pit lane entrance midway through practice qualifying was split into two sessions both sessions took place on saturday and sunday afternoon and lasted 60 minutes with one driver allowed on track at any time saturday qualifying order would be set in reverse of day s earlier practice sessions with sunday s running order based on saturday qualifying results each driver was allowed four timed laps and starting order was determined by competitor s fastest lap times one championship point was available to fastest drivers of both qualifying sessions they were guaranteed to start on front row of grid for monday s race this was first time this format was used on a road course in cart after drivers voiced concerns over their ability to achieve a lap time without encountering traffic first qualifying session had track temperatures lower than observed in morning and drivers could not get optimum tyre temperature this meant they could only increase their pace on their final attempts alt photograph of a man in his late thirties with black sunglasses on top of his head thumb upright paul tracy pictured in 2009 took his first pole position for three years with a new track record of brands hatch indy circuit tracy took provisional pole by recording only lap close to 36 seconds with a new track record of 37 006 seconds on his last attempt 0 016 seconds ahead of junqueira who held first position until tracy s time s performance was compromised as he drove in an altered car that had better straightline speed but was slower in corners bourdais ended session third with oriol servia fourth and manning fifth following him were canadian duo of patrick carpentier in sixth and tagliani seventh fernandez switched to a back up car for rest of race meeting his team altered its setup but he used too much kerb at clearways corner and was left eighth two other mexican drivers jourdain and mario dominguez rounded out top ten vasser was fastest driver not to reach top ten his best time of 37 982 seconds was nearly a second off tracy s pace he was followed by monteiro and mario haberfeld alex yoong recovered from gear linkage issues from practice but an error at druids hairpin left him 14th patrick lemarie rodolfo lavin joel camathias and roberto moreno were in next four provisional positions ryan hunter reay did not set a lap time after he spun on front straight before starting his first timed lap he was sent to rear of qualifying line and could not manage a second run monteiro and camathias made two outings because of a miscommunication between their respective teams and completed three timed laps on first runs both drivers were allowed back on track later in session and warmed up their tyres to gain optimum running temperature monteiro and camathias ran four out laps before their final attempt in third practice session fernandez was quickest early on until bourdais moved to top of time sheets tracy then took over top spot but bourdais responded with a last minute lap of 37 379 seconds tracy followed 0 120 seconds adrift in second fernandez and servia placed third and fourth and junqueira completed top five ahead of second qualifying several incidents took place during session lavin spun off under braking for druids hairpin and was beached in turn s gravel trap causing session s first stoppage he was handed an eight minute penalty yoong locked his brakes and ran straight into a left hand side tyre barrier at druids hairpin necessitating a second red flag camathias prompted final stoppage after he spun at clark curve which ended session with two minutes left weather conditions were hot and sunny with a slight breeze and it was expected that lap times would improve since teams were more knowledgeable of track conditions and more rubber had been laid on racing line bourdais looked set to challenge tracy but he ran wide leaving paddock hill bend on his last qualifying lap and put left hand side of his car into gravel this created enough decompression to pull his hand off his steering wheel when tracy learned of this he ran at a reduced pace and used scrubbed tyres so he could save an additional set for race tracy thus took 14th pole position of his career his first since 2000 michigan 500 and his first on a road course since 1994 grand prix of monterey third placed junqueira altered his car but changes created excessive understeer he and could not push hard servia remained in fourth position while tagliani made downforce changes to his back up car and moved from seventh to fifth fernandez was another driver to move up two positions from his saturday qualifying result and started sixth he was followed by fellow mexican dominguez in seventh manning elected to push harder than any other driver but was unable to better his time and fell to eighth carpentier and jourdain rounded out top ten qualifiers haberfeld gained two places from first qualifying to begin eleventh moreno was biggest mover as he gained six places to begin 12th while yoong took 13th following him was vasser monteiro hunter reay lemarie and camathias lavin was slowest overall and was on a faster lap when he made a minor driving error heading towards clark curve and lost around three tenths of a second warm up drivers took to track at 10 00 british summer time bst utc 1 for a 30 minute warm up session weather conditions were overcast and a slight wind could be felt drivers used session to practice pit stops and scrub their tyres carpentier was running faster than he did in previous two days and posted quickest time of session at 37 885 seconds bourdais continued his strong form by going second fastest and hunter reay completed top three participants lemarie drifted wide onto left hand grass between mclaren and clearways corners camathias caused session s sole stoppage by going straight into a gravel trap at druids hairpin after locking his brakes he required extraction by marshals to enable his return to pit lane race race started at 14 00 bst on 5 may approximately 40 000 people were in attendance close to start weather conditions were partly cloudy with air temperature ranging between former racing drivers damon hill emerson fittipaldi and mario andretti commanded drivers to start their engines first caution was triggered on first lap when drivers in first two rows of grid were not alongside each other competitive racing began at start of lap two and tracy maintained his pole position advantage heading into first corner farther back fernandez made contact with tagliani and drifted wide to left side of track but managed to continue vasser drove into pit lane and got out of his car to retire with left front suspension damage caused by his front tyre turning in tracy began to pull away from rest of field extending his lead to 2 088 seconds over bourdais by start of eleventh lap junqueira maintained third position followed by tagliani in fourth and servia in fifth four laps later carpentier slowed momentarily and was overtaken by fernandez on backstraight for eighth place left thumb upright sebastien bourdais pictured in 2007 got

to 1 401 seconds as fastest lap of race at time was set by carpentier who completed a circuit in 38 515 seconds on his 18th lap first round of green flag pit stops began on lap 49 when tagliani monteiro and lavin entered pit lane for fuel and tyres during this period manning ran off circuit and into a gravel trap at paddock hill bend haberfeld caught out by his cold tyres went wide into some grass at graham hill bend tracy ran more downforce than his nearest rivals and used more fuel as a consequence he was delayed by slower lavin losing two seconds before he made his pit stop on 55th lap bourdais spent one extra lap on track with a low amount of fuel when he entered pit lane on following lap additional time bourdais spent on circuit and his teammate tracy being delayed enabled him to assume lead with a seven tenths of a second advantage over tracy after all pit stops had been completed bourdais and tracy ran within about a half second of each other during following 24 laps before a second caution was necessitated for an accident on lap 80 yoong was behind moreno in eleventh and in front of jourdain in twelfth when he locked his brakes on run to druids corner and drifted wide onto dirty side of track he then ran into left hand side tyre barrier at turn becoming second retirement of race during caution manning and tagliani made pit stops for fuel because they wanted to push harder than rest of field doing this however required them to make an additional pit stop due to mandatory two pit stop regulation enacted by cart safety car was withdrawn at end of lap 85 and racing resumed bourdais led and was followed by tracy in second as entire field went through paddock hill bend without incident bourdais and tracy exchanged race s fastest lap as margin between two drivers

confines of track to claim his first cart victory junqueira was 7 835 seconds adrift in second and dominguez completed podium in third off podium servia finished fourth and carpentier took fifth rounding out top ten positions were jourdain moreno tagliani haberfeld and manning final finishers were lemarie fernandez camathias monteiro lavin and hunter reay there were two cautions and three lead changes amongst three different drivers during course of race bourdais led twice for a total of 95 laps more than any other driver post race top three drivers appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media at a later press conference bourdais said of his maiden success in series we made it it was difficult but we made it we would probably have been winner in two races already it s been frustrating after first events worm turned paul had trouble today and we got a bit lucky he added that victory satisfied him and his team after as be believed he could have won races earlier in season second placed junqueira stated that he was pleased with advancing his position in points standings and spoke of his hope that pit stop phase would fall in his favour during race i am closer now but i know that if i want to win championship i am going to have to pull a few wins out of bag dominguez said that his team worked hard to produce his third place result and spoke of his feeling that his performance at brands hatch was better than his victory at 2002 honda indy 300 he revealed that he acquainted himself with optimum line around circuit s by trailing manning during saturday s free practice sessions he s got lots of little tricks guy s who ve been here before they know their way around even though it s a small track it has a very particular driving style tracy s retirement from a broken gearbox was his first of season he said of situation in championship it s never good to give away points like this now we don t have a cushion this dnf is very costly it s disappointing to have a failure like that we would have been content to finish on podium but engine let go on us tracy later revealed that his gearbox shifted by itself three to four laps and heard noises and spoke emitting from his car before his retirement when i was rolling down hill i had no gearbox otherwise car was running good manning said a poor fuel mileage led to him making three pit stops during race he admitted that his team compromised set up of his car for season s european leg and that he lost six seconds of time behind monteiro and a group of slower cars we were running a weird kind of set up for this track which is not really an oval but we always knew we would be compromised round here we re also giving something away to lola chassis at moment but having said that we expect to go better in germany media reaction to race was largely negative derick of independent argued that brands hatch indy circuit was too restrictive for champ cars and that it prevented overtaking a crowd of nearly 40 000 witnessed cart s latest attempt to find a home in this country and could be forgiven for wondering why series still claims to represent racing at its most thrilling for two hours they watched cars circulating 1 2 mile indy track nestling in natural amphitheatre here and waited in vain for much vaunted spectacle to materialise guardians richard wrote spectators were entitled to feel let down after fuel economy created a processional event it was hardly way to help spread gospel of cart championship auto racing teams around globe which was reason they were here and at rockingham in past two years correspondent for times said it was never pulsating spectacle pre race propaganda had promised and argued that utilising grand prix layout was in public interest result meant tracy still led drivers championship with 65 points but his lead over junqueira was reduced to eleven points with 42 points jourdain kept third place and fernandez maintained fourth position with 29 points carpentier rounded out top five competitors in standings with 28 points in championship lola further extended their advantage over their sole rivals reynard to 54 points with fourteen races left in
