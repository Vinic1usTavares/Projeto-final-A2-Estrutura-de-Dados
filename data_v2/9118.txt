troll is a norwegian research station located at jutulsessen from coast in eastern part of princess martha coast in queen maud land antarctica it is norway s only all year research station in antarctica and is supplemented by summer only station tor troll is operated by norwegian polar institute and also features facilities for norwegian meteorological institute and norwegian institute for air research contrary to most other research stations on continent troll is constructed on snow free slope of solid rock breaking through ice sheet at jutulsessen located above mean sea level station opened as a summer only station in 1990 and was taken into use as an all year station in 2005 it has an overwintering capacity of eight people and a summer capacity of 40 it is served by troll airfield which is base for dronning maud land air network facilities troll is located in eastern part of princess martha coast in queen maud land which norway claims as a dependent territory station is located on nunatak bare ground area jutulsessen at above mean sea level it is completely surrounded by antarctic ice sheet this is unlike most other antarctic research stations which are located on snow troll is from coast station facilities are owned by government of norway through norwegian directorate of public construction and property operation of facility is done by another government agency norwegian polar institute facilities consist of a module built new section that is and old section that is new section consists of eight bedrooms a gym a sauna a kitchen a communication center and office space in addition there are several smaller buildings which are used as laboratories provision stores generators and garages old station is used partially for storage and partially as a summer station facility also features an emergency facility for eight people located at a safe distance from main base in case of fire or other accidents station is to tolerate temperatures down to and wind speeds of facility attempts to minimize its environmental impact through several mechanisms including minimizing area usage energy consumption is reduced by using excess heat to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating waste is minimized through purchase planning and recycling remaining waste is compressed and transported away from antarctic fuel is handled in such a way that even small spills are minimized in 2016 a solar pv plant with 7 3 kilowatt peak has been installed on one of roof tops it serves as a pilot installation for declared middle term target of reducing oil consumption of research station significantly by extending solar pv plant over next few years station has a cold and dry climate being located in a desert annual mean temperature is with summer temperature able to reach about and lowest during winter at storms which can occur throughout year can occasionally make outdoor activity impossible being located south of antarctic circle troll has midnight sun in summer and polar night during winter research norwegian institute for air research nilu maintains air and atmospheric measurement equipment at troll combined with a similar measuring station zeppelin in ny alesund svalbard norway this allows institute to collect such data from both polar regions in particular facility measures aerosols organic and inorganic pollution ozone and ultraviolet uv radiation nilu also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at zeppelin ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury two of greatest pollution threats in polar regions stratosphere measurements are conducted to measure ozone and uv levels in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and antarctic ozone hole kongsberg satellite services a joint venture between kongsberg group and norwegian space center operates trollsat a satellite ground station which allows downloading of data in conjunction with svalsat located in longyearbyen svalbard trollsat targets satellites in a polar orbit trollsat consists of a single radome with an low earth orbit antenna capable of s band and x band reception to relay information trollsat has a and a c band uplink to provide broadband connection to europe and north america trollsat will be one of 30 ground stations for european satellite navigation system galileo and is norway s main contribution to project norwegian meteorological institute operates a manned weather station at troll it measures air pressure temperature humidity and wind both at station itself and at airfield history during 1980s it became increasingly important for government of norway to have a permanent base in queen maud land area had been annexed as a dependency on 14 january 1939 at time mainly based on norwegian whaling interests in antarctic kyvik et al 2008 57 from 1956 norway operated research station norway station kyvik et al 2008 77 but this was given to south africa in 1959 kyvik et al 2008 78 from 1960s through 1980s norway s research activities in antarctica were sporadic and without a fixed base this gave advantage that research was not bound geographically kyvik et al 2008 79 but it weakened norwegian claim for queen maud land and right to participate as a consultative member of antarctic treaty in 1989 any party to treaty could ask for it to be renegotiated and norwegian authorities saw need for a permanent base to strengthen norway s claim to queen maud land kyvik et al 2008 82 norwegian polar institute decided to establish a summer station this was built during summer of 1989 and 1990 resulting in a building with room for eight people kyvik et al 2008 153 construction required of materials to be hauled from coast and station was officially opened on 17 february 1990 kyvik et al 2008 169 station took its name from surrounding jagged mountains which resemble trolls of norse mythology first overwintering occurred in 2000 when a south pole expedition used camp as a base to ease logistics norway took initiative to establish dronning maud land air network dromlan a cooperation between countries with bases in queen maud land to streamline transport costs having an airfield at troll allows quicker transport to research stations in western queen maud land which are located further away from incumbent airfields at henriksenskjera and first flight that was a preliminary to dromlan was made in 2000 from cape town south africa to henriksenskjera where a twin otter was used onwards to troll kyvik et al 2008 167 in 2003 it was decided that norway was to extend its operations in antarctica by establishing an all year research station by then norway was only country with a territorial claim to antarctica to not have an all year research station on continent government stated that investment was motivated to improve climate research to strengthen norway as a bi polar research nation and to strengthen norway s role as a premise maker in environmental policy of antarctic construction of expansion was done from december 2004 through february 2005 by norwegian directorate of public construction and property who contracted job to af gruppen about of equipment was hauled to base from ice shelf base was prefabricated and only required modules to be connected at site kyvik et al 2008 154 new infrastructure included a new generator emergency station garage provision stores container ramps for equipment and fuel and more laboratories kyvik et al 2008 155 at same time norwegian meteorological institute established a meteorological station at troll kyvik et al 2008 159 construction of runway itself required filling of crevasses and removal of stones kyvik et al 2008 170 troll airfield was opened on 11 february 2005 by queen sonja of norway and new research station following day after opening another power station was built in 2005 in 2006 a satellite base station was built by kongsberg satellite services kyvik et al 2008 157 this resulted in need for a broadband connection for base during winter season of 2006 there was no overwintering due to lack of funding but from 2007 this has been re instated in 2008 a windmill was taken into use to provide some of power norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg visited troll in january 2008 when he among other things opened trollsat at same time as part of international polar year a norwegian united states expedition traveled from troll to amundsen scott south pole station and back on 23 february 2009 norwegian minister of environment erik solheim hosted a meeting for environment ministers from 15 countries to discuss climate change and learn about recent research in field see also
