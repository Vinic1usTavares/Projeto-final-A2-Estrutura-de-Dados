white bellied sea eagle haliaeetus also known as white breasted sea eagle is a large diurnal bird of prey in family originally described by johann friedrich gmelin in 1788 it is closely related to sanford s sea eagle of solomon islands and two are considered a superspecies a distinctive bird adult white bellied sea eagle has a white head breast under wing coverts and tail upper parts are grey and black under wing flight feathers contrast with white coverts tail is short and wedge shaped as in all haliaeetus species like many raptors female is slightly larger than male and can measure up to long with a wingspan of up to and weigh immature birds have brown plumage which is gradually replaced by white until age of five or six years call is a loud goose like honking resident from india and sri lanka through southeast asia to australia on coasts and major waterways white bellied sea eagle breeds and hunts near water and fish form around half of its diet opportunistic it consumes carrion and a wide variety of animals although rated as least concern globally it has declined in parts of southeast asia such as thailand and southeastern australia it is ranked as threatened in victoria and vulnerable in south australia and tasmania human disturbance to its habitat is main threat both from direct human activity near nests which impacts on breeding success and from removal of suitable trees for nesting white bellied sea eagle is revered by indigenous people in many parts of australia and is subject of various folk tales throughout its range taxonomy white bellied sea eagle was first described by german naturalist johann friedrich gmelin in 1788 although john latham had made notes on species in 1781 from a specimen obtained in february 1780 at princes island off westernmost cape of java during captain cook s last voyage its specific name is derived from ancient greek leuko white and gaster belly its closest relative is little known sanford s sea eagle of solomon islands these form a superspecies and as is usual in other sea eagle superspecies one white bellied sea eagle has a white head as opposed to other species dark head bill and eyes are dark and talons are dark yellow as in all southern hemisphere sea eagles both these species have at least some dark colouration in their tails though this may not always be clearly visible in white bellied sea eagle nucleotide sequences of cytochrome b gene of two sea eagles were among those analysed in a 1996 study although they differ greatly in appearance and ecology their genetic divergence of 0 3 indicates that ancestors of two forms might have diverged as recently as 150 000 years ago study authors conclude that although genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies distinctness in appearance and behaviour warrants two being retained as separate species mitochondrial sequence of cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of sanford s sea eagle suggesting a relatively recent divergence after new guinea based white bellied sea eagles colonised solomon islands white bellied sea eagle s affinities beyond sanford s sea eagle are a little less clear molecular data indicate that it is one of four species of tropical sea eagle along with african fish eagle and madagascar fish eagle while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with sea eagles of northern hemisphere a further molecular study published in 2005 showed white bellied and sanford s sea eagles to be basal to four fish eagles two mentioned above plus two hitherto untested species of genus ichthyophaga as well as white bellied sea eagle and white breasted sea eagle other recorded names include white bellied fish hawk white eagle and grey backed sea eagle description thumb adult flying in national park sri lanka black flight feathers contrasting with wing lining clearly visible white bellied sea eagle has a white head rump and underparts and dark or slate grey back and wings in flight black flight feathers on wings are easily seen when bird is viewed from below large hooked bill is a leaden blue grey with a darker tip and irides are dark brown cere is also lead grey legs and feet are yellow or grey with long black talons claws unlike those of eagles of genus aquila legs are not feathered sexes are similar males are long and weigh females are slightly larger at and wingspan ranges from raptors of world by ferguson lees christie franklin mead burton houghton mifflin 2001 a 2004 study on 37 birds from australia and papua new guinea 3 degs to 50 degs found that birds could be sexed reliably on size and that birds from latitudes further south were larger than those from north there is no seasonal variation in plumage moulting pattern of white bellied sea eagle is poorly known it appears to take longer than a year to complete and can be interrupted and later resumed from point of interruption wings are modified when gliding so that they rise from body at an angle but are closer to horizontal further along wingspan in silhouette comparatively long neck head and beak stick out from front almost as far as tail does behind for active flight white bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing beats with short periods of gliding thumb right a juvenile from sundarbans national park west bengal india left upright thumb adult in captivity at anna zoological park chennai a young white bellied sea eagle in its first year is predominantly brown with pale cream streaked plumage on their head neck nape and rump areas plumage becomes more infiltrated with white until it acquires complete adult plumage by fourth or fifth year species breeds from around six years of age onwards lifespan is thought to be around 30 years loud goose like honking call is a familiar sound particularly during breeding season pairs often honk in unison and often carry on for some time when perched male s call is higher pitched and more rapid than that of female australian naturalist david fleay observed that call is among loudest and furthest carrying of all australian bird calls in stark contrast to relatively quiet calls of wedge tailed eagle adult white bellied sea eagles are unmistakable and unlikely to be confused with any other bird immature birds can be confused with wedge tailed eagles however plumage of latter is darker tail longer and legs feathered they might also be confused with black breasted buzzard but this species is much smaller has white patches on wings and has a more undulating flight in india egyptian vulture has white plumage but is smaller and has a whiter back and wings white tail of white bellied sea eagle in flight distinguishes it from other species of large eagles in philippines it can be confused with philippine eagle which can be distinguished by its crest immature white bellied sea eagles resemble immature grey headed fish eagles but can be identified by their more wholly dark brown underparts and flight feathers and wedge shaped tail distribution and habitat thumb upright 0 80 right in gippsland victoria australia white bellied sea eagle is found regularly from mumbai sometimes north to gujarat and in past in lakshadweep islands eastwards in india bangladesh and sri lanka in southern asia through all of coastal southeast asia including burma thailand malaysia indonesia indochina main and offshore islands of philippines and southern china including hong kong hainan and fuzhou eastwards through new guinea and bismarck archipelago and australia in northern solomons it is restricted to nissan island and replaced elsewhere by sanford s sea eagle in victoria where it is otherwise scarce it is locally more common at corner inlet and gippsland lakes similarly in south australia it is most abundant along north coast of kangaroo island range extends to islands of bass strait and tasmania and it is thought able to move between islands and mainland there is one unconfirmed record from lord howe island and several from new zealand they are a common sight in coastal areas but may also be seen well inland it is reportedly seen at panna tiger reserve in central india nearly away from sea shore white bellied sea eagle is generally sedentary and territorial although it may travel long distances they have been reported travelling upriver to hunt for flying foxes pteropus populations in inland australia move around as inland bodies of water appear and then dry up in one instance a pair came to breed at lake in northwestern victoria after lake had been empty for 30 years species is easily disturbed by humans especially when nesting and may desert nesting sites as a result it is found in greater numbers in areas with little or no human impact or interference behaviour white bellied sea eagle is generally territorial some birds form permanent pairs that inhabit territories throughout year while others are nomadic species is monogamous with pairs remaining together until one bird dies after which surviving bird quickly seeks a new mate this can lead to some nest sites being continuously occupied for many years one site in mallacoota was occupied for over fifty years immature birds are generally dispersive with many moving over away from area they were raised one juvenile raised in cowell south australia was reported away at fraser island in queensland a study of species in jervis bay showed increases in numbers of immature and subadult birds in autumn although it was unclear whether these were locally fledged or as was considered more likely an influx of young birds born and raised elsewhere in australia birds are often seen perched high in a tree or soaring over waterways and adjacent land they are most commonly encountered singly or in pairs small groups of white bellied sea eagles sometimes gather if there is a plentiful source of food such as a carcass or fish offal on a ship much of white bellied sea eagle s behaviour particularly breeding remains poorly known thumb left an adult bird with fish catch from india breeding thumb left upright a dead branch makes a good perch to survey surrounding area breeding season varies according to location it has been recorded in dry season in trans fly region and central province of papua new guinea and from june to august in australia a pair of white bellied sea eagles performs skilful displays of flying before copulation diving gliding and chasing each other while calling loudly they may mirror each other flying apart and copying each other swooping and swerving a talon grappling display has been recorded where pair will fly high before one flips upside down and tries to grapple other s talons with its own if successful two then plunge cartwheeling before separating as they approach ground this behaviour has also been recorded as an aggressive display against a wedge tailed eagle white bellied sea eagle usually chooses tall trees or man made pylons to nest in often locations are sought where there is a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which can be used as a perch to survey surrounding area which is generally a low lying locale near water with some forest cover perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter immediate surrounding area nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger nests are generally sited in forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water old nests of wedge tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used cliffs are also suitable nesting sites and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on ground a breeding pair with male being more active spends three to six weeks building or renovating nest before laying eggs normally a clutch of two dull white oval eggs are laid measuring mm they are incubated over six weeks before hatching young are semi altricial and covered in white down when they emerge from egg initially male brings food and female feeds chicks but both parents feed chicks as they grow larger although two eggs are laid it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging leaving nest one egg may be infertile or second chick may die in nest if first clutch is lost parents may attempt a second brood nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old and remaining around parents territory for up to six months or until following breeding season feeding white bellied sea eagle is an opportunistic carnivore and consumes a wide variety of animal prey including carrion it often catches a fish by flying low over water and grasping it in its talons it prepares for strike by holding its feet far forward almost under its chin and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards generally only one foot is used to seize prey white bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish near water surface while hunting over water on sunny days it often flies directly into sun or at right angles to it seemingly to avoid casting shadows over water and hence alerting potential prey left thumb seizing waterborne prey white bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals such as fish turtles and sea snakes but it takes birds such as little penguins eurasian coots and shearwaters and mammals including flying foxes as well in bismarck archipelago it has been reported feeding on two species of possum northern common cuscus and common spotted cuscus it is a skilled hunter and will attack prey up to size of a swan they also feed on carrion such as dead sheep birds and fish found along waterline as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters they harass smaller raptors such as swamp harriers whistling kites brahminy kites and ospreys forcing them to drop any food that they are carrying other birds victimised include silver and pacific gulls cormorants and australasian gannets there is one record of a white bellied sea eagle seizing a gannet when unsuccessful in obtaining its prey they may even steal food from their own species including their mates white bellied sea eagle attacks these birds by striking them with outstretched talons from above or by flying upside down underneath smaller predator and snatching prey all while screeching shrilly southern fur seals have also been targeted for their fish white bellied sea eagles feed alone in pairs or in family groups a pair may cooperate to hunt prey can be eaten while bird is flying or when it lands on a raised platform such as its nest white bellied sea eagle skins victim as it eats it it is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone fur and feathers a 2006 study of inland bodies of water around canberra where wedge tailed eagles and white bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap in range of prey taken wedge tailed eagles took rabbits various terrestrial birds such as cockatoos and parrots and various passerines including magpies and starlings white bellied sea eagles caught fish water dwelling reptiles such as eastern long necked turtle and australian water dragon and waterbirds such as ducks grebes and coots both species preyed on maned duck rabbits constituted only a small fraction of white bellied sea eagle s diet despite nesting near each other two species seldom interacted as wedge tailed eagles hunted away from water and white bellied sea eagles foraged along lake shores however conflict with wedge tailed eagles over nesting sites in remnant trees has been recorded in tasmania conservation status thumb juvenile flying over east island an australian island in indian ocean white bellied sea eagle is listed as being of least concern by iucn there are an estimated 10 thousand to 100 thousand individuals although there seems to be a decline in numbers they have become rare in thailand and some other parts of southeast asia they are relatively abundant in hong kong where population increased from 39 to 57 birds between 2002 and 2009 a field study on kangaroo island in south australia showed that nesting pairs in areas of high human disturbance as defined by clearing of landscape and high human activity had lower breeding success rates in eyre peninsula in south australia nests have been vacated as human activities have encroached on eagles territories elsewhere clearing of trees suitable for nesting has seen it largely disappear locally such as removal of stands of casuarina equisetifolia in visakhapatnam district in andhra pradesh in india in india nest densities of about one per 4 32 km of coastline have been noted in sindhudurg and one per 3 57 km 45 nests along 161 km in ratnagiri district of maharashtra they also nest on island where about a 100 birds were noted in 1875 then known as pigeon island by allan octavian hume who noted that this was perhaps largest breeding colony of species in 2000 disturbance to island from torpedo firing exercises conducted by indian navy was noted as a threat nearly 100 nests have been noted in 2004 on this island ddt was a widely used pesticide in agriculture that was found to have significant adverse effects on wildlife particularly egg thinning and subsequent breakage in birds of prey a review of ddt s impact on australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that average egg shell thickness had decreased by 6 this average level of thinning was not thought likely to result in significantly more breakage overall however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken white bellied sea eagle was one of more affected species probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps ddt use peaked in 1973 but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989 australia white bellied sea eagle is listed under marine and migratory categories which give it protected status under australia s federal environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 as a mainly coastal species it is vulnerable to habitat destruction in australia s increasingly populated and urbanised coastal areas particularly in south and east of country where it appears to have declined in numbers however there may have been an increase in population inland secondary to creation of reservoirs dams and weirs and spread of introduced common carp cyprinus carpio however it is rare along murray river where it was once common it is also listed as threatened under victoria s flora and fauna guarantee act 1988 with possibly fewer than 100 breeding pairs remaining in state on 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in victoria white bellied sea eagle is listed as vulnerable there are fewer than 1000 adult birds in tasmania where species is listed as vulnerable under schedule 3 1 of tasmanian threatened species protection act 1995 in tasmania it is threatened by nest disturbance loss of suitable nesting habitat shooting poisoning trapping and collision with power lines and wind turbines as well as entanglement and environmental pollution estuaries are a favoured habitat and these are often subject to environmental disturbance white bellied sea eagles have been observed to increase their hunting ranges to include salmon fish farms but effect of this on breeding success is unknown cultural significance thumb left adult flying in tasmania white bellied sea eagle was important to different tribes of indigenous people across australia guardian animal of wreck bay aboriginal community it is also official emblem of booderee national park and botanic gardens in jervis bay territory community considered localities around booderee national park to be connected with it a local sydney name was and bird was totem of late 18th century indigenous leader of cadigal people white bellied sea eagle is important to mak mak people of floodplains to southwest of darwin in northern territory who recognised its connection with good country it is their totem and integrally connected to their land term mak mak is their name for both species and themselves gorge nature park was a dreaming site of bird in this area known as kuna ngarrk ngarrk it was similarly symbolic to tasmanian indigenous people was one name used there known as to people of nissan island white bellied sea eagle is considered special and killing it is forbidden its calls at night are said to foretell danger and seeing a group of calling eagles flying overhead is a sign that someone has died local malay folk tales tell of white bellied sea eagle screaming to warn shellfish of turning of tides and a local name burung hamba translates as slave of shellfish called in recently extinct aka bo language white bellied sea eagle was held to be ancestor of all birds in
