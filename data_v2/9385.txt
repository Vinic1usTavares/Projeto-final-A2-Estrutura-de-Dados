mercury is smallest and innermost planet in solar system its orbit around sun takes only 87 97 days shortest of all planets in solar system it is named after roman deity mercury messenger of gods like venus mercury orbits sun within earth s orbit as an inferior planet and its apparent distance from sun as viewed from earth never exceeds 28deg this proximity to sun means planet can only be seen near western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise usually in twilight at this time it may appear as a bright star like object but is often far more difficult to observe than venus planet telescopically displays complete range of phases similar to venus and moon as it moves in its inner orbit relative to earth which recurs over its synodic period of approximately every 116 days mercury rotates in a way that is unique in solar system it is tidally locked with sun in a 3 2 spin orbit resonance extract of page 51 meaning that relative to fixed stars it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around sun as seen from sun in a frame of reference that rotates with orbital motion it appears to rotate only once every two mercurian years an observer on mercury would therefore see only one day every two mercurian years mercury s axis has smallest tilt of any of solar system s planets about degree its orbital eccentricity is largest of all known planets in solar system at perihelion mercury s distance from sun is only about two thirds or 66 of its distance at aphelion mercury s surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to moon s indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years having almost no atmosphere to retain heat it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in solar system ranging from at night to during day across equatorial regions polar regions are constantly below planet has no known natural satellites two spacecraft have visited mercury flew by in 1974 and 1975 and messenger launched in 2004 orbited mercury over 4 000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into planet s surface on april 30 2015 bepicolombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at mercury in 2025 physical characteristics internal structure mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid iron sulfide outer core layer a deeper liquid core layer and a solid inner core mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in solar system and is a rocky body like earth it is smallest planet in solar system with an equatorial radius of mercury is also smaller albeit more massive than largest natural satellites in solar system ganymede and titan mercury consists of approximately 70 metallic and 30 silicate material mercury s density is second highest in solar system at 5 427 g cm3 only slightly less than earth s density of 5 515 g cm3 if effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets materials of which mercury is made would be denser than those of earth with an uncompressed density of 5 3 g cm3 versus earth s 4 4 g cm3 mercury s density can be used to infer details of its inner structure although earth s high density results appreciably from gravitational compression particularly at core mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed therefore for it to have such a high density its core must be large and rich in iron geologists estimate that mercury s core occupies about 55 of its volume for earth this proportion is 17 research published in 2007 suggests that mercury has a molten core surrounding core is a mantle consisting of silicates gallant r 1986 national geographic picture atlas of our universe national geographic society 2nd edition based on data from mission and earth based observation mercury s crust is estimated to be thick one distinctive feature of mercury s surface is presence of numerous narrow ridges extending up to several hundred kilometers in length it is thought that these were formed as mercury s core and mantle cooled and contracted at a time when crust had already solidified mercury s core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in solar system and several theories have been proposed to explain this most widely accepted theory is that mercury originally had a metal silicate ratio similar to common chondrite meteorites thought to be typical of solar system s rocky matter and a mass approximately 2 25 times its current mass early in solar system s history mercury may have been struck by a planetesimal of approximately 1 6 that mass and several thousand kilometers across impact would have stripped away much of original crust and mantle leaving core behind as a relatively major component a similar process known as giant impact hypothesis has been proposed to explain formation of moon alternatively mercury may have formed from solar nebula before sun s energy output had stabilized it would initially have had twice its present mass but as contracted temperatures near mercury could have been between 2 500 and 3 500 k and possibly even as high as 10 000 k much of mercury s surface rock could have been vaporized at such temperatures forming an atmosphere of rock vapor that could have been carried away by solar wind a third hypothesis proposes that solar nebula caused drag on particles from which mercury was accreting which meant that lighter particles were lost from accreting material and not gathered by mercury each hypothesis predicts a different surface composition and there are two space missions set to make observations messenger which ended in 2015 found higher than expected potassium and sulfur levels on surface suggesting that giant impact hypothesis and vaporization of crust and mantle did not occur because potassium and sulfur would have been driven off by extreme heat of these events bepicolombo which will arrive at mercury in 2025 will make observations to test these hypotheses findings so far would seem to favor third hypothesis however further analysis of data is needed surface geology thumb center 600px topographic map of mercury s northern hemisphere by mla instrument on purple to highest red mercury s surface is similar in appearance to that of moon showing extensive mare like plains and heavy cratering indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years because knowledge of mercury s geology had been based only on 1975 flyby and terrestrial observations it is least understood of terrestrial planets as data from messenger orbiter are processed this knowledge will increase for example an unusual crater with radiating troughs has been discovered that scientists called spider it was later named apollodorus thumb mercury s surface thumb left spectrum scan of mercury s surface by messenger albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity as seen by telescopic observation mercury has dorsa also called wrinkle ridges moon like highlands montes mountains planitiae plains rupes escarpments and valles valleys names for features on mercury come from a variety of sources names coming from people are limited to deceased craters are named for artists musicians painters and authors who have made outstanding or fundamental contributions to their field ridges or dorsa are named for scientists who have contributed to study of mercury depressions or fossae are named for works of architecture montes are named for word hot in a variety of languages plains or planitiae are named for mercury in various languages escarpments or rupes are named for ships of scientific expeditions valleys or valles are named for abandoned cities towns or settlements of antiquity mercury was heavily bombarded by comets and asteroids during and shortly following its formation 4 6 billion years ago as well as during a possibly separate subsequent episode called late heavy bombardment that ended 3 8 billion years ago during this period of intense crater formation mercury received impacts over its entire surface facilitated by lack of any atmosphere to slow down during this time mercury was volcanically active basins such as caloris basin were filled by magma producing smooth plains similar to maria found on moon data from october 2008 flyby of messenger gave researchers a greater appreciation for jumbled nature of mercury s surface mercury s surface is more heterogeneous than either mars s or moon s both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology such as maria and plateaus impact basins and craters thumb perspective view of caloris basin high red low blue thumb left enhanced color image of munch sander and poe craters amid volcanic plains orange near caloris basin craters on mercury range in diameter from small bowl shaped cavities to multi ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across they appear in all states of degradation from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller a consequence of mercury s stronger surface gravity according to iau rules each new crater must be named after an artist that was famous for more than fifty years and dead for more than three years before date crater is named largest known crater is with a diameter of 1 550 km impact that created caloris basin was so powerful that it caused lava eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2 km tall surrounding impact crater at antipode of caloris basin is a large region of unusual hilly terrain known as weird terrain one hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during caloris impact traveled around mercury converging at basin s antipode 180 degrees away resulting high stresses fractured surface alternatively it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of convergence of ejecta at this basin s antipode overall about 15 impact basins have been identified on imaged part of mercury a notable basin is 400 km wide multi ring basin that has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500 km from its rim and a floor that has been filled by smooth plains materials beethoven basin has a similar sized ejecta blanket and a 625 km diameter rim like moon surface of mercury has likely incurred effects of space weathering processes including solar wind and micrometeorite impacts thumb 600px center interior of abedin crater plains there are two geologically distinct plains regions on mercury gently rolling hilly plains in regions between craters are mercury s oldest visible surfaces predating heavily cratered terrain these inter crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30 km in diameter smooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to lunar maria notably they fill a wide ring surrounding caloris basin unlike lunar maria smooth plains of mercury have same albedo as older inter crater plains despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics localisation and rounded lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins all smooth plains of mercury formed significantly later than caloris basin as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on caloris ejecta blanket floor of caloris basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern it is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by impact or a large sheet of impact melt compressional features one unusual feature of mercury s surface is numerous compression folds or rupes that crisscross plains as mercury s interior cooled it contracted and its surface began to deform creating wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps associated with thrust faults scarps can reach lengths of 1000 km and heights of 3 km these compressional features can be seen on top of other features such as craters and smooth plains indicating they are more recent mapping of features has suggested a total shrinkage of mercury s radius in range of 1 to 7 km small scale thrust fault scarps have been found tens of meters in height and with lengths in range of a few km that appear to be less than 50 million years old indicating that compression of interior and consequent surface geological activity continue to present lunar reconnaissance orbiter discovered that similar small thrust faults exist on moon volcanology thumb picasso crater large arc shaped pit located on eastern side of its floor are postulated to have formed when subsurface magma subsided or drained causing surface to collapse into resulting void images obtained by messenger have revealed evidence for pyroclastic flows on mercury from low profile shield volcanoes messenger data has helped identify 51 pyroclastic deposits on surface where 90 of them are found within impact craters a study of degradation state of impact craters that host pyroclastic deposits suggests that pyroclastic activity occurred on mercury over a prolonged interval a rimless depression inside southwest rim of caloris basin consists of at least nine overlapping volcanic vents each individually up to 8 km in diameter it is thus a compound volcano vent floors are at a least 1 km below their brinks and they bear a closer resemblance to volcanic craters sculpted by explosive eruptions or modified by collapse into void spaces created by magma withdrawal back down into a conduit scientists could not quantify age of volcanic complex system but reported that it could be of order of a billion years surface conditions and exosphere thumb composite image of mercury taken by messenger right thumb radar image of mercury s north pole thumb composite of north pole of mercury where nasa confirmed discovery of a large volume of water ice in permanently dark craters that are found there surface temperature of mercury ranges from at most extreme places 0degn 0degw or 180degw it never rises above 180 k at poles due to absence of an atmosphere and a steep temperature gradient between equator and poles point reaches about 700 k during perihelion 0degw or 180degw but only 550 k at aphelion 90deg or 270degw on dark side of planet temperatures average 110 k intensity of sunlight on mercury s surface ranges between 4 59 and 10 61 times solar constant 1 370 w m 2 although daylight temperature at surface of mercury is generally extremely high observations strongly suggest that ice frozen water exists on mercury floors of deep craters at poles are never exposed to direct sunlight and temperatures there remain below 102 k far lower than global average water ice strongly reflects radar and observations by 70 meter goldstone solar system radar and vla in early 1990s revealed that there are patches of high radar reflection near poles although ice was not only possible cause of these reflective regions astronomers think it was most likely icy regions are estimated to contain about 1014 1015 kg of ice and may be covered by a layer of regolith that inhibits sublimation by comparison antarctic ice sheet on earth has a mass of about 4 kg and mars s south polar cap contains about 1016 kg of water origin of ice on mercury is not yet known but two most likely sources are from outgassing of water from planet s interior or deposition by impacts of comets mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time it does have a tenuous surface bounded exosphere containing hydrogen helium oxygen sodium calcium potassium and others at a surface pressure of less than approximately 0 5 0 005 this exosphere is not stable atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources hydrogen atoms and helium atoms probably come from solar wind diffusing into mercury s magnetosphere before later escaping back into space radioactive decay of elements within mercury s crust is another source of helium as well as sodium and potassium messenger found high proportions of calcium helium hydroxide magnesium oxygen potassium silicon and sodium water vapor is present released by a combination of processes such as comets striking its surface sputtering creating water out of hydrogen from solar wind and oxygen from rock and sublimation from reservoirs of water ice in permanently shadowed polar craters detection of high amounts of water related ions like o oh and h2o was a surprise because of quantities of these ions that were detected in mercury s space environment scientists surmise that these molecules were blasted from surface or exosphere by solar wind sodium potassium and calcium were discovered in atmosphere during 1980 1990s and are thought to result primarily from vaporization of surface rock struck by micrometeorite impacts including presently from comet encke in 2008 magnesium was discovered by messenger studies indicate that at times sodium emissions are localized at points that correspond to planet s magnetic poles this would indicate an interaction between magnetosphere and planet s surface on november 29 2012 nasa confirmed that images from messenger had detected that craters at north pole contained water ice messenger principal investigator sean solomon is quoted in new york times estimating volume of ice to be large enough to encase washington d c in a frozen block two and a half miles deep magnetic field and magnetosphere thumb graph showing relative strength of mercury s magnetic field despite its small size and slow 59 day long rotation mercury has a significant and apparently global magnetic field according to measurements taken by it is about 1 1 strength of earth s magnetic field strength at mercury s equator is about like that of earth mercury s magnetic field is dipolar unlike earth s mercury s poles are nearly aligned with planet s spin axis measurements from both and messenger space probes have indicated that strength and shape of magnetic field are stable it is likely that this magnetic field is generated by a dynamo effect in a manner similar to magnetic field of earth this dynamo effect would result from circulation of planet s iron rich liquid core particularly strong tidal effects caused by planet s high orbital eccentricity would serve to keep core in liquid state necessary for this dynamo effect mercury s magnetic field is strong enough to deflect solar wind around planet creating a magnetosphere planet s magnetosphere though small enough to fit within earth is strong enough to trap solar wind plasma this contributes to space weathering of planet s surface observations taken by spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in magnetosphere of planet s bursts of energetic particles in planet s magnetotail indicate a dynamic quality to planet s magnetosphere during its second flyby of planet on october 6 2008 messenger discovered that mercury s magnetic field can be extremely leaky spacecraft encountered magnetic tornadoes twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space that were up to wide or a third of radius of planet these twisted magnetic flux tubes technically known as flux transfer events form open windows in planet s magnetic shield through which solar wind may enter and directly impact mercury s surface via magnetic reconnection this also occurs in earth s magnetic field messenger observations showed reconnection rate is ten times higher at mercury but its proximity to sun only accounts for about a third of reconnection rate observed by messenger orbit rotation and longitude mercury has most eccentric orbit of all planets its eccentricity is 0 21 with its distance from sun ranging from it takes 87 969 earth days to complete an orbit diagram illustrates effects of eccentricity showing mercury s orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having same semi major axis mercury s higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from greater distance it covers in each 5 day interval in diagram varying distance of mercury to sun is represented by size of planet which is inversely proportional to mercury s distance from sun this varying distance to sun leads to mercury s surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by sun that are about 17 times stronger than moon s on earth combined with a 3 2 spin orbit resonance of planet s rotation around its axis it also results in complex variations of surface temperature resonance makes a single solar day on mercury last exactly two mercury years or about 176 earth days mercury s orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to plane of earth s orbit ecliptic as shown in diagram on right as a result transits of mercury across face of sun can only occur when planet is crossing plane of ecliptic at time it lies between earth and sun this occurs about every seven years on average mercury s axial tilt is almost zero with best measured value as low as 0 027 degrees this is significantly smaller than that of jupiter which has second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 3 1 degrees this means that to an observer at mercury s poles center of sun never rises more than 2 1 arcminutes above horizon at certain points on mercury s surface an observer would be able to see sun peek up about halfway over horizon then reverse and set before rising again all within same mercurian day this is because approximately four earth days before perihelion mercury s angular orbital velocity equals its angular rotational velocity so that sun s apparent motion ceases closer to perihelion mercury s angular orbital velocity then exceeds angular rotational velocity thus to a hypothetical observer on mercury sun appears to move in a retrograde direction four earth days after perihelion sun s normal apparent motion resumes a similar effect would have occurred if mercury had been in synchronous rotation alternating gain and loss of rotation over revolution would have caused a libration of 23 65deg in longitude for same reason there are two points on mercury s equator 180 degrees apart in longitude at either of which around perihelion in alternate mercurian years once a mercurian day sun passes overhead then reverses its apparent motion and passes overhead again then reverses a second time and passes overhead a third time taking a total of about 16 earth days for this entire process in other alternate mercurian years same thing happens at other of these two points amplitude of retrograde motion is small so overall effect is that for two or three weeks sun is almost stationary overhead and is at its most brilliant because mercury is at perihelion its closest to sun this prolonged exposure to sun at its brightest makes these two points hottest places on mercury maximum temperature occurs when sun is at an angle of about 25 degrees past noon due to diurnal temperature lag at 0 4 mercury days and 0 8 mercury years past sunrise conversely there are two other points on equator 90 degrees of longitude apart from first ones where sun passes overhead only when planet is at aphelion in alternate years when apparent motion of sun in mercury s sky is relatively rapid these points which are ones on equator where apparent retrograde motion of sun happens when it is crossing horizon as described in preceding paragraph receive much less solar heat than first ones described above mercury attains inferior conjunction nearest approach to earth every 116 earth days on average but this interval can range from 105 days to 129 days due to planet s eccentric orbit mercury can come as near as to earth and that is slowly declining next approach to within is in 2679 and to within in but it will not be closer to earth than until 28 622 mercury closest approaches to earth generated with 1 solex 10 text output file 2 gravity simulator charts 3 jpl horizons 1950 2200 its period of retrograde motion as seen from earth can vary from 8 to 15 days on either side of inferior conjunction this large range arises from planet s high orbital eccentricity on average mercury is closest planet to earth and it is closest planet to each of other planets in solar system longitude convention longitude convention for mercury puts zero of longitude at one of two hottest points on surface as described above however when this area was first visited by this zero meridian was in darkness so it was impossible to select a feature on surface to define exact position of meridian therefore a small crater further west was chosen called hun kal which provides exact reference point for measuring longitude center of hun kal defines 20deg west meridian a 1970 international astronomical union resolution suggests that longitudes be measured positively in westerly direction on mercury two hottest places on equator are therefore at longitudes 0degw and 180degw and coolest points on equator are at longitudes 90degw and 270degw however messenger project uses an east positive convention spin orbit resonance thumb after one orbit mercury has rotated 1 5 times so after two complete orbits same hemisphere is again illuminated for many years it was thought that mercury was synchronously tidally locked with sun rotating once for each orbit and always keeping same face directed towards sun in same way that same side of moon always faces earth radar observations in 1965 proved that planet has a 3 2 spin orbit resonance rotating three times for every two revolutions around sun eccentricity of mercury s orbit makes this resonance stable at perihelion when solar tide is strongest sun is nearly still in mercury s sky rare 3 2 resonant tidal locking is stabilized by variance of tidal force along mercury s eccentric orbit acting on a permanent dipole component of mercury s mass distribution in a circular orbit there is no such variance so only resonance stabilized in such an orbit is at 1 1 e g earth moon when tidal force stretching a body along center body line exerts a torque that aligns body s axis of least inertia longest axis and axis of aforementioned dipole to point always at center however with noticeable eccentricity like that of mercury s orbit tidal force has a maximum at perihelion and therefore stabilizes resonances like 3 2 enforcing that planet points its axis of least inertia roughly at sun when passing through perihelion original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked was that whenever mercury was best placed for observation it was always nearly at same point in its 3 2 resonance hence showing same face this is because coincidentally mercury s rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to earth due to mercury s 3 2 spin orbit resonance a solar day length between two meridian transits of sun lasts about 176 earth days a sidereal day period of rotation lasts about 58 7 earth days simulations indicate that orbital eccentricity of mercury varies chaotically from nearly zero circular to more than 0 45 over millions of years due to perturbations from other planets this was thought to explain mercury s 3 2 spin orbit resonance rather than more usual 1 1 because this state is more likely to arise during a period of high eccentricity however accurate modeling based on a realistic model of tidal response has demonstrated that mercury was captured into 3 2 spin orbit state at a very early stage of its history within 20 more likely 10 million years after its formation numerical simulations show that a future secular orbital resonant perihelion interaction with jupiter may cause eccentricity of mercury s orbit to increase to point where there is a 1 chance that planet may collide with venus within next five billion years advance of perihelion in 1859 french mathematician and astronomer urbain le verrier reported that slow precession of mercury s orbit around sun could not be completely explained by newtonian mechanics and perturbations by known planets he suggested among possible explanations that another planet or perhaps instead a series of smaller might exist in an orbit even closer to sun than that of mercury to account for this perturbation u le verrier 1859 in french lettre de m le verrier a m faye sur la theorie de mercure et sur le mouvement du de cette planete comptes rendus hebdomadaires des seances de l academie des sciences paris vol 49 1859 pp 379 383 at p 383 in same volume le verrier s report is followed by another from faye enthusiastically recommending to astronomers to search for a previously undetected intra mercurial object other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of sun success of search for neptune based on its perturbations of orbit of uranus led astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation and hypothetical planet was named vulcan but no such planet was ever found perihelion precession of mercury is 5 600 arcseconds 1 per century relative to earth or 574 10 0 65 arcseconds per century relative to inertial newtonian mechanics taking into account all effects from other planets predicts a precession of 5 557 arcseconds 1 per century in early 20th century albert einstein s general theory of relativity provided explanation for observed precession by formalizing gravitation as being mediated by curvature of spacetime effect is small just 42 98 arcseconds per century for mercury it therefore requires a little over twelve million orbits for a full excess turn similar but much smaller effects exist for other solar system bodies 8 62 arcseconds per century for venus 3 84 for earth 1 35 for mars and 10 05 for 1566 icarus albert einstein s formula for perihelion shift per revolution is where is orbital eccentricity semi major axis and orbital period filling in values gives a result of 0 1035 arcseconds per revolution or 0 arcseconds per earth year i e 42 97 arcseconds per century this is in close agreement with accepted value of mercury s perihelion advance of 42 98 arcseconds per century observation thumb image mosaic by 1974 mercury s apparent magnitude is calculated to vary between 2 48 brighter than sirius around superior conjunction and 7 25 below limit of naked eye visibility around inferior conjunction mean apparent magnitude is 0 23 while standard deviation of 1 78 is largest of any planet mean apparent magnitude at superior conjunction is 1 89 while that at inferior conjunction is 5 93 observation of mercury is complicated by its proximity to sun as it is lost in sun s glare for much of time mercury can be observed for only a brief period during either morning or evening twilight mercury can like several other planets and brightest stars be seen during a total solar eclipse like moon and venus mercury exhibits phases as seen from earth it is new at inferior conjunction and full at superior conjunction planet is rendered invisible from earth on both of these occasions because of its being obscured by sun except its new phase during a transit mercury is technically brightest as seen from earth when it is at a full phase although mercury is farthest from earth when it is full greater illuminated area that is visible and opposition brightness surge more than compensates for distance opposite is true for venus which appears brightest when it is a crescent because it is much closer to earth than when gibbous thumb left false color map showing maximum temperatures of north polar region nonetheless brightest full phase appearance of mercury is an essentially impossible time for practical observation because of extreme proximity of sun mercury is best observed at first and last quarter although they are phases of lesser brightness first and last quarter phases occur at greatest elongation east and west of sun respectively at both of these times mercury s separation from sun ranges anywhere from 17 9deg at perihelion to 27 8deg at aphelion look at 1964 and 2013 numbers generated using solar system dynamics group horizons on line ephemeris system at greatest western elongation mercury rises at its earliest before sunrise and at greatest eastern elongation it sets at its latest after sunset mercury can be easily seen from tropics and subtropics more than from higher latitudes viewed from low latitudes and at right times of year ecliptic intersects horizon at a steep angle mercury is 10deg above horizon when planet appears directly above sun i e its orbit appears vertical and is at maximum elongation from sun 28deg and also when sun is 18deg below horizon so sky is just completely dark this angle is maximum altitude at which mercury is visible in a completely dark sky thumb right false color image of carnegie rupes a tectonic landform high terrain red low blue at middle latitudes mercury is more often and easily visible from southern hemisphere than from northern this is because mercury s maximum western elongation occurs only during early autumn in southern hemisphere whereas its greatest eastern elongation happens only during late winter in southern hemisphere in both of these cases angle at which planet s orbit intersects horizon is maximized allowing it to rise several hours before sunrise in former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in latter from southern mid latitudes such as argentina and south africa an alternate method for viewing mercury involves observing planet during daylight hours when conditions are clear ideally when it is at its greatest elongation this allows planet to be found easily even when using telescopes with apertures care must be taken to ensure instrument isn t pointed directly towards sun because of risk for eye damage this method bypasses limitation of twilight observing when ecliptic is located at a low elevation e g on autumn evenings ground based telescope observations of mercury reveal only an illuminated partial disk with limited detail first of two spacecraft to visit planet was which mapped about 45 of its surface from 1974 to 1975 second is messenger spacecraft which after three mercury flybys between 2008 and 2009 attained orbit around mercury on march 17 2011 to study and map rest of planet hubble space telescope cannot observe mercury at all due to safety procedures that prevent its pointing too close to sun because shift of 0 15 revolutions in a year makes up a seven year cycle 0 15 x 7 1 0 in seventh year mercury follows almost exactly earlier by 7 days sequence of phenomena it showed seven years before observation history ancient astronomers thumb mercury from liber astronomiae 1550 earliest known recorded observations of mercury are from mul apin tablets these observations were most likely made by an assyrian astronomer around 14th century bc cuneiform name used to designate mercury on mul apin tablets is transcribed as udu gu u4 ud jumping planet babylonian records of mercury date back to 1st millennium bc babylonians called planet nabu after messenger to gods in their mythology ancient greeks knew planet as stilbon stilbon meaning gleaming and ermes hermes a planetary name that is retained in modern greek ermes ermis see also greek article about planet romans named planet after swift footed roman messenger god mercury latin mercurius which they equated with greek hermes because it moves across sky faster than any other planet astronomical symbol for mercury is a stylized version of hermes caduceus greco egyptian astronomer ptolemy wrote about possibility of planetary transits across face of sun in his work planetary hypotheses he suggested that no transits had been observed either because planets such as mercury were too small to see or because transits were too infrequent thumb left ibn al shatir s model for appearances of mercury showing multiplication of epicycles using tusi couple thus eliminating ptolemaic eccentrics and equant in ancient china mercury was known as hour star chen xing it was associated with direction north and phase of water in five phases system of metaphysics modern chinese korean japanese and vietnamese cultures refer to planet literally as water star based on five elements hindu mythology used name budha for mercury and this god was thought to preside over wednesday god odin or woden of germanic paganism was associated with planet mercury and wednesday maya may have represented mercury as an owl or possibly four owls two for morning aspect and two for evening that served as a messenger to underworld in medieval islamic astronomy andalusian astronomer abu ishaq ibrahim al zarqali in 11th century described deferent of mercury s geocentric orbit as being oval like an egg or a pignon although this insight did not influence his astronomical theory or his astronomical calculations at pp 118 122 in 12th century ibn bajjah observed two planets as black spots on face of sun which was later suggested as transit of mercury and or venus by maragha astronomer qotb al din shirazi in 13th century note that most such medieval reports of transits were later taken as observations of sunspots in india kerala school astronomer nilakantha somayaji in 15th century developed a partially heliocentric planetary model in which mercury orbits sun which in turn orbits earth similar to tychonic system later proposed by tycho brahe in late 16th century ground based telescopic research thumb transit of mercury mercury is visible as a black dot below and to left of center dark area above center of solar disk is a sunspot thumb right elongation is angle between sun and planet with earth as reference point mercury appears close to sun first telescopic observations of mercury were made by galileo in early 17th century although he observed phases when he looked at venus his telescope was not powerful enough to see phases of mercury in 1631 pierre gassendi made first telescopic observations of transit of a planet across sun when he saw a transit of mercury predicted by johannes kepler in 1639 giovanni used a telescope to discover that planet had orbital phases similar to venus and moon observation demonstrated conclusively that mercury orbited around sun a rare event in astronomy is passage of one planet in front of another occultation as seen from earth mercury and venus occult each other every few centuries and event of may 28 1737 is only one historically observed having been seen by john bevis at royal greenwich observatory next occultation of mercury by venus will be on december 3 2133 difficulties inherent in observing mercury mean that it has been far less studied than other planets in 1800 johann schroter made observations of surface features claiming to have observed mountains friedrich bessel used schroter s drawings to erroneously estimate rotation period as 24 hours and an axial tilt of 70deg in 1880s giovanni schiaparelli mapped planet more accurately and suggested that mercury s rotational period was 88 days same as its orbital period due to tidal locking this phenomenon is known as synchronous rotation effort to map surface of mercury was continued by antoniadi who published a book in 1934 that included both maps and his own observations many of planet s surface features particularly albedo features take their names from antoniadi s map in june 1962 soviet scientists at institute of radio engineering and electronics of ussr academy of sciences led by vladimir became first to bounce a radar signal off mercury and receive it starting radar observations of planet three years later radar observations by americans gordon pettengill and r dyce using 300 meter arecibo observatory radio telescope in puerto rico showed conclusively that planet s rotational period was about 59 days mercury at eric weisstein s world of astronomy theory that mercury s rotation was synchronous had become widely held and it was a surprise to astronomers when these radio observations were announced if mercury were tidally locked its dark face would be extremely cold but measurements of radio emission revealed that it was much hotter than expected astronomers were reluctant to drop synchronous rotation theory and proposed alternative mechanisms such as powerful heat distributing winds to explain observations thumb left water ice yellow at mercury s north polar region italian astronomer giuseppe colombo noted that rotation value was about two thirds of mercury s orbital period and proposed that planet s orbital and rotational periods were locked into a 3 2 rather than a 1 1 resonance data from subsequently confirmed this view this means that schiaparelli s and antoniadi s maps were not wrong instead astronomers saw same features during every second orbit and recorded them but disregarded those seen in meantime when mercury s other face was toward sun because orbital geometry meant that these observations were made under poor viewing conditions ground based optical observations did not shed much further light on mercury but radio astronomers using interferometry at microwave wavelengths a technique that enables removal of solar radiation were able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of subsurface layers to a depth of several meters golden leslie m a microwave interferometric study of subsurface of planet mercury 1977 phd dissertation university of california berkeley not until first space probe flew past mercury did many of its most fundamental morphological properties become known moreover recent technological advances have led to improved ground based observations in 2000 high resolution lucky imaging observations were conducted by mount wilson observatory 1 5 meter hale telescope they provided first views that resolved surface features on parts of mercury that were not imaged in mission most of planet has been mapped by arecibo radar telescope with resolution including polar deposits in shadowed craters of what may be water ice research with space probes thumb left messenger being prepared for launch thumb mercury transiting sun as viewed by mars rover curiosity june 3 2014 reaching mercury from earth poses significant technical challenges because it orbits so much closer to sun than earth a mercury bound spacecraft launched from earth must travel over into sun s gravitational potential well mercury has an orbital speed of whereas earth s orbital speed is therefore spacecraft must make a large change in velocity delta v to enter a hohmann transfer orbit that passes near mercury as compared to delta v required for other planetary missions potential energy liberated by moving down sun s potential well becomes kinetic energy requiring another large delta v change to do anything other than rapidly pass by mercury to land safely or enter a stable orbit spacecraft would rely entirely on rocket motors aerobraking is ruled out because mercury has a negligible atmosphere a trip to mercury requires more rocket fuel than that required to escape solar system completely as a result only two space probes have visited it so far a proposed alternative approach would use a solar sail to attain a mercury synchronous orbit around sun mariner 10 thumb mariner 10 first probe to visit mercury first spacecraft to visit mercury was nasa s 1974 1975 spacecraft used gravity of venus to adjust its orbital velocity so that it could approach mercury making it both first spacecraft to use this gravitational slingshot effect and first nasa mission to visit multiple planets provided first close up images of mercury s surface which immediately showed its heavily cratered nature and revealed many other types of geological features such as giant scarps that were later ascribed to effect of planet shrinking slightly as its iron core cools unfortunately same face of planet was lit at each of close approaches this made close observation of both sides of planet impossible and resulted in mapping of less than 45 of planet s surface spacecraft made three close approaches to mercury closest of which took it to within of surface at first close approach instruments detected a magnetic field to great surprise of planetary geologists mercury s rotation was expected to be much too slow to generate a significant dynamo effect second close approach was primarily used for imaging but at third approach extensive magnetic data were obtained data revealed that planet s magnetic field is much like earth s which deflects solar wind around planet for many years after encounters origin of mercury s magnetic field remained subject of several competing theories on march 24 1975 just eight days after its final close approach ran out of fuel because its orbit could no longer be accurately controlled mission controllers instructed probe to shut down is thought to be still orbiting sun passing close to mercury every few months messenger thumb estimated details of impact of messenger on april 30 2015 a second nasa mission to mercury named messenger mercury surface space environment geochemistry and ranging was launched on august 3 2004 it made a fly by of earth in august 2005 and of venus in october 2006 and june 2007 to place it onto correct trajectory to reach an orbit around mercury a first fly by of mercury occurred on january 14 2008 a second on october 6 2008 and a third on september 29 2009 most of hemisphere not imaged by was mapped during these fly bys probe successfully entered an elliptical orbit around planet on march 18 2011 first orbital image of mercury was obtained on march 29 2011 probe finished a one year mapping mission and then entered a one year extended mission into 2013 in addition to continued observations and mapping of mercury messenger observed 2012 solar maximum nasa extends spacecraft s mercury mission upi november 15 2011 retrieved november 16 2011 mission was designed to clear up six key issues mercury s high density its geological history nature of its magnetic field structure of its core whether it has ice at its poles and where its tenuous atmosphere comes from to this end probe carried imaging devices that gathered much higher resolution images of much more of mercury than assorted spectrometers to determine abundances of elements in crust and magnetometers and devices to measure velocities of charged particles measurements of changes in probe s orbital velocity were expected to be used to infer details of planet s interior structure messenger final maneuver was on april 24 2015 and it crashed into mercury s surface on april 30 2015 spacecraft s impact with mercury occurred near 3 26 pm edt on april 30 2015 leaving a crater estimated to be in diameter thumb center 600px first march 29 2011 and last april 30 2015 images of mercury by messenger bepicolombo european space agency and japanese space agency developed and launched a joint mission called bepicolombo which will orbit mercury with two probes one to map planet and other to study its magnetosphere launched on october 20 2018 bepicolombo is expected to reach mercury in 2025 it will release a magnetometer probe into an elliptical orbit then chemical rockets will fire to deposit mapper probe into a circular orbit both probes will operate for one terrestrial year mapper probe carries an array of spectrometers similar to those on messenger and will study planet at many different wavelengths including
