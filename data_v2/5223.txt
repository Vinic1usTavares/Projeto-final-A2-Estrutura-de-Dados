thumb bombycilla garrulus in ontario canada bohemian waxwing bombycilla garrulus is a starling sized passerine bird that breeds in northern forests of eurasia and north america it has mainly buff grey plumage black face markings and a pointed crest its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow and some feather tips have red waxy appearance that give this species its english name three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance females are similar to males although young birds are less well marked and have few or no waxy wingtips although bohemian waxwing s range overlaps those of cedar and japanese waxwings it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences breeding habitat is coniferous forests usually near water pair build a lined cup shaped nest in a tree or bush often close to trunk clutch of 3 7 eggs is incubated by female alone for 13 14 days to hatching chicks are altricial and naked and are fed by both parents initially mostly with insects but thereafter mainly fruit they fledge about 14 16 days after leaving egg many birds desert their nesting range in winter and migrate farther south in some years large numbers of bohemian waxwings well beyond their normal winter range in search of fruit that makes up most of their diet waxwings can be very tame in winter entering towns and gardens in search of food rowan berries being a particular favourite they can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit but can still become intoxicated sometimes fatally other hazards include predation by birds of prey infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows bohemian waxwing s high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by international union for conservation of nature taxonomy waxwings are a family bombycillidae of short tailed stocky birds with soft plumage a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails there are three species bohemian cedar and japanese waxwings dna studies and shared features such as a relatively large size grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that japanese and bohemian waxwings are most closely related within genus although only cedar and bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers this feature is occasionally shown by japanese waxwing suggesting that this was originally a whole family characteristic that has been lost in one species rather than an indicator of a close relationship dna analysis confirms that cedar waxwing diverged early from other members of family outside genus closest relatives of waxwings are believed to be silky flycatchers and grey all of which have sometimes been included in bombycillidae bohemian waxwing was described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 as lanius garrulus linnaeus 1758 p 95 waxwings were moved to their own genus bombycilla by vieillot in 1808 vieillot 1808 p 88 genus name bombycilla comes from greek silk and modern latin cilla tail jobling 2010 p 74 this is a direct translation of german silk tail and refers to silky soft plumage of bird species name garrulus is latin for talkative and was applied to this bird as garrulus bohemicus by conrad gessner in 1555 jobling 2010 p 171 gessner 1555 p 27 term is a reference to a supposed likeness to eurasian jay garrulus glandarius rather than to waxwing s vocalisations english name waxwing refers to bright red tips of secondary feathers on its wings which look like drops of sealing wax while bohemian follows gessner s usage and may refer to romani alluding to bird s wanderings holloway 2003 p 39 or to its presumed origin from bohemia cocker mabey 2005 pp 326 327 waxwing and bohemian waxwing were first recorded in 1817 former as a reference to vieillot s separation of this bird from there are three recognised subspecies b g garrulus linnaeus 1758 nominate subspecies breeds in northern europe from northern sweden east to ural mountains b g centralasiae poliakov 1915 breeds from urals eastwards across northern asia b g pallidiceps reichenow 1908 breeds in northwestern north america differences between these forms are small and clinal and species could be possibly considered as monotypic fossil record includes pleistocene deposits from uk and carpathian mountains 2013 p 395 description thumb alt a spread wing with yellow white and red markings right distinctive red wing tips bohemian waxwing is a starling sized bird in length with a wingspan and an average weight of it is short tailed mainly brownish grey and has a conspicuous crest on its head male of nominate subspecies has a black mask through eye and a black throat there is a white streak behind bill and a white curve below eye lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon coloured areas around mask rump is grey and tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it wings are very distinctive flight feathers are black and primaries have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white fishhooks on closed wing adult s secondaries end in long red appendages with sealing wax appearance that gives bird its english name eyes are dark brown bill is mainly black and legs are dark grey or black in flight waxwing s large flocks long wings and short tail give some resemblance to common starling and its flight is similarly fast and direct it clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on ground soft dense feathers are kept in good condition by preening red waxy tips are extended and flattened ends of feather shafts pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath a study of cedar waxwings showed that red tips are few or absent until third year of life for that related species all adult waxwings have a complete moult annually between august and january juveniles moult at same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers female bohemian waxwing is very similar to male but has a narrower yellow terminal band to tail a less defined lower edge to black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings juveniles are duller than adults with whiter underparts only a few red wing tips no black on throat and a smaller black face mask compared to nominate subspecies eastern b g centralasiae is paler greyer and has little reddish brown behind bill american subspecies b g pallidiceps has more colouring on cheeks and forehead than nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance range of bohemian waxwing overlaps those of both other members of genus cedar waxwing is smaller than bohemian it has browner upperparts a white undertail and a white line above black eye patch adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than bohemian waxwing snow perrins 1998 pp 1113 1115 japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives it has a red terminal band to tail black mask extends up rear of crest and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on wings brazil 2009 p 312 bohemian waxwing s call is a high trill it is less wavering and lower pitched than that of cedar waxwing sibley 2000 p 423 and longer and lower pitched than call of japanese waxwing other calls are just variants of main vocalisation a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents and courtship calls also given during nest construction have a particularly large frequency range although not a call as such when a flock takes off or lands wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard away distribution and habitat thumb alt conifer woodland and river northern coniferous forest breeding habitat bohemian waxwing has a circumpolar distribution breeding in northern regions of eurasia and north america in eurasia its northern nesting limit is just short of treeline roughly at 10 degc july isotherm and it breeds south locally to about most birds breed between 60 reaching 70degn in scandinavia north american subspecies breeds in northwestern and north central areas of continent its range extending southwards beyond us border in rocky mountains this waxwing is migratory with much of breeding range abandoned as birds move south for winter migration starts in september in north of range a month or so later farther south eurasian birds normally winter from eastern britain through northern parts of western and central europe ukraine kazakhstan and northern china to japan north american breeders have a more southeasterly trend many birds wintering in southeast canada with smaller numbers in north central and northeastern us states birds do not usually return to same wintering sites in successive years one bird wintering in ukraine was found to east in siberia in following year newton 2010 p 406 thumb alt waxwings in a bare tree a winter flock in poland in some years this waxwing south of its normal wintering areas sometimes in huge numbers fruit on which birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year and in poor years particularly those following a good crop previous year flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies newton 2010 pp 393 395 they will stay until food runs out and move on again newton 2010 p 403 in what may be largest ever in europe in winter of 2004 2005 more than half a million waxwings were recorded in germany alone this invasion followed an unusually warm dry breeding season in 1908 an american flock wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over breeding habitat is mature conifers often spruce although other conifers and broadleaf trees may also be present more open wet areas such as lakes and peat swamps with dead and drowned trees are used for feeding on insects lowlands valleys and uplands are used in eurasia although mountains tend to be avoided however north american subspecies nests in canada at altitudes between campbell 1997 p 466 outside breeding season waxwing will occupy a wide range of habitats as long as suitable fruits such as rowan are available it may be found by roads in parks and gardens or along hedges or woodlands edges it shows little fear of humans at this time in winter waxwings roost communally in dense trees or hedges sometimes with american robins fieldfares or other wintering species behaviour breeding thumb alt single waxwing sitting on a nest female on nest bohemian waxwings start their return from wintering grounds in february or march but northern breeders do not reach their breeding areas until april or early may this monogamous species nests mainly from mid june to july left thumb egg collection museum wiesbaden waxwings are not highly territorial and although normally solitary breeders several pairs may nest close together where there are a number of good nest sites males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates and females may squabble over nest sites aggression is shown by down feathers and crest showing black throat and opening bill breeding display is almost opposite of this male erects his body and crest feathers and turns his head away from female male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item often food to his partner placing it in her open bill in about 90 of cases this display does not lead to copulation older males have more red tips to wings and are preferred by females thumb alt five white eggs in a twig nest nest and eggs nest built by both sexes is a cup of thin twigs lined with softer material such as fine grass moss fur or lichen it is constructed above ground in a pine or scrub commonly close to trunk eggs are a glossy pale blue spotted with black and grey and clutch is 3 7 eggs although five or six is most common average size of egg is and it weighs of which 5 is shell eggs are incubated for 13 14 days by female alone she is fed regurgitated berries by her mate and rarely leaves nest chicks are altricial and naked and have bright red mouths they are fed by both parents although male brings most of food mainly insects in first few days young are subsequently fed largely with fruit chicks fledge about 14 16 days after hatching they are fed by adults for about two weeks after fledging breeding densities of this waxwing are typically low compared to other passerines usually less than ten birds per square kilometre 26 per square mile even in good habitat although up to 35 6 birds per square kilometre 92 per square mile have been found in russia one brood each year is normal maximum recorded ages are 5 years 10 months in north america and more than 13 years 6 months in europe average life expectancy is unknown significant causes of death include predation collisions with windows and cars and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking feeding alt bunch of red berries thumb european rowan is a favourite food waxwings are primarily fruit eaters but also consume insects during breeding season mosquitoes and midges are most common prey but many other insects and some spiders are eaten they are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch but some may be picked off vegetation fruit is normally picked from trees sometimes from ground and is usually swallowed whole in summer vaccinium and rubus species and canada are important items of their diet while cotoneaster juniper rose hips and apples predominate outside breeding season rowan berries are a favourite food and are eaten whenever available waxwings can eat huge numbers of berries each bird sometimes consuming several hundred a day more than double its own weight one individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1 000 cotoneaster berries in six hours and defecating every four minutes waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse fruit seeds waxwings forage in large flocks sometimes of several hundred birds which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees snow snow 2010 pp 154 156 thumb alt waxwing eating berries feeding on rowan fruit is rich in sugar but deficient in other nutrients so it must be eaten in large quantities bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy they can metabolise ethanol produced from fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans but may still become intoxicated mullarney et al 2009 p 272 sometimes fatally waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter since sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate birds through an osmotic effect in summer fruits are and water is less of a problem in past arrival of waxwings sometimes coincided with epidemics of cholera or plague and led to old dutch and flemish name plague bird juniper berries on which they fed were thought to offer protection and people consumed fruit and burned branches to fumigate their houses predators and parasites thumb upright alt perched grey bird of prey eurasian sparrowhawk hunts bohemian waxwings waxwings are preyed upon by birds of prey including rough legged buzzards eurasian sparrowhawks prairie falcons and great grey shrikes merlins attack winter flocks including those in cities 1992 p 91 when alarmed bohemian waxwings freeze with bill and neck pointing upwards if this fails they fly calling noisily bohemian waxwings are not brood parasitised by common cuckoo or its relatives in eurasia because cuckoo s young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet in north america waxwing s breeding range has little overlap with brown headed cowbird another parasitic species nevertheless eggs of other birds placed in a bohemian waxwing s nest are always rejected this suggests that in past perhaps 3 million years ago ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species and retains rejection behaviour acquired then parasitic mites include bombycillae first identified on this species and nasal mite ptilonyssus bombycillae blood parasites include trypanosoma species and a first identified in this waxwing bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low rausch 1983 p 401 status global population of bohemian waxwing has been estimated at more than three million birds and breeding range covers about 12 8 million km2 4 9 million mi2 although this species population as of 2013 appears to be declining decrease is not rapid nor large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria given its high numbers and huge breeding area this waxwing is therefore classified by international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern woodlands used by this species are well to north of major human populations and birds can use disturbed habitats so there are no serious long term threats to this species notes
