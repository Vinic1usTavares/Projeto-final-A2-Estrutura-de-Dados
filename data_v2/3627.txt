see bughouse in other languages accessed july 29 2007 normal chess rules apply except that captured pieces on one board are passed on to teammate on other board who then has option of putting these pieces on their board game is usually played at a fast time control this together with passing and dropping of pieces can make game look chaotic and random to casual onlooker hence name bughouse which is slang for mental hospital game is traditionally played as a diversion from regular chess both over board and online yearly several dedicated bughouse tournaments are organized on a national and an international level toc rules bughouse is a chess variant played on two chessboards by four players in teams of two each team member faces one opponent of other team partners sit next to each other and one player has black while other has white each player plays opponent as in a standard chess game with exception of rules specified below bughouse has many variations and there is no international standard rules below are in accordance with us chess federation rules as applied on chess servers free internet chess server and internet chess club and berlin bughouse tournament in case rules contradict alternatives are listed accessed july 29 2007 captured pieces a player capturing a piece immediately passes that piece to capturing player s partner partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may instead of playing a regular move place one of these pieces on board as in and crazyhouse called dropping piece pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square including squares where piece delivers check or checkmate however pawns may not be dropped on first or last dropped pawns may promote but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured in play over board a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion von zimmerman 2006 p 15 a pawn placed on second rank may move two squares on its first move each player must keep reserve or stock pieces on table in front of board always visible to all players of game clock and completion of a move bughouse chess is usually played with chess clocks to prevent players from waiting indefinitely for a piece clocks are placed on outside so that each player can see both clocks at start of game players with black pieces start clocks simultaneously bughouse is usually played using which allows touching of pieces a move is completed only when clock is pressed is practiced to a lesser extent see for example rules of geneva bughouse tournament accessed july 29 2007 when used it applies to pieces in reserve as well they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square bughouse can be played without a clock but then there is usually a rule preventing a player waiting for pieces stalling or sitting indefinitely one rule states that players may not delay their move beyond time that it takes for their partner to make three moves a team must have one checkmate to win if they draw it s over end of game match ends when either of games on two boards ends a game is won when one player gets checkmated resigns forfeits on time or when an illegal move is made in which offending side is caught match can be drawn by agreement or when two players run out of time or are checkmated simultaneously depending on local rules threefold repetition applies in which case reserve of pieces is not taken into account for instance threefold repetition applies on fics but not on internet chess club alternatively when one board finishes play can continue on other board in this case pieces in reserve can still be dropped but no new pieces are coming in outcome of match is then decided by adding score of two boards communication partners are normally allowed to talk to each other during game they can for instance ask for a specific piece for more trades ask to hold a piece suggest moves or ask their partner to stall shouts like knight mates or don t let him have a bishop are common and can lead to seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on other board partners are not allowed to physically act on other board see article nr 12 us chess federation bughouse rules accessed august 27 2007 two player and six player variations it is possible to play game with just two players one per team by having each player move on two boards analogously to simultaneous chess this way of playing game is referred to as simultaneous bughouse it can also be played with just one clock by playing boards in a specific order white a white b black b black a and pressing clock after each move this variation is suitable for play by mail von zimmerman 2006 p 108 bughouse can be played with three or more boards game is played in exactly same way as normal bughouse with boards placed with alternating colours and two players and one clock per board on capturing a piece however player has to decide which player of team will get that piece in three board bughouse chess middle player is key since he gets material from two boards but has to decide how to divide captured pieces manson and hoover 1992 pp 34 37 middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice number of pieces available strategy material in chess a minor material advantage is important as when material gets exchanged relative advantage becomes larger because new pieces come in there is no endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important it is common to sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking defending or hunting down a certain piece which partner requires a scoring system to evaluate material is to add up piece values of material on board in chess when a pawn equals one unit a bishop or knight is worth three a rook five and a queen nine these values are a consequence of difference in mobility of pieces in bughouse piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square von zimmerman 2006 p 17 pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns they can for instance be dropped to block non contact checks pawns can be dropped onto seventh rank one step away from promotion which again adds to their importance long range pieces like queen or rook lose relative value due to constantly changing pawn structure they are also more likely to be hemmed in manson and hoover 1992 pp 32 33 a valuation system first suggested by fics player often applied to bughouse is pawn 1 bishop knight rook 2 and queen 4 von zimmerman 2006 p 17 bughouse playing program sunsetter uses values pawn 100 bishop 195 knight 192 rook 200 and queen 390 while engine sjeng uses pawn 100 bishop 230 knight 210 rook 250 and queen 450 accessed july 29 2007 coordination captured pieces are passed on and thus what happens on one board influences what happens on other board it is therefore natural for team members to communicate during game play a common request of an attacking player would be trades are good while players in trouble would ask their partner to hold trades with trades are bad equally a player can request a piece e g knight wins a queen or ask to hold a piece e g rook mates me von zimmerman 2006 pp 243 44 another common situation in interplay between two boards is a player not moving also called sitting or stalling this can happen in anticipation of a certain piece or at request of partner suppose a player is under heavy attack and an additional pawn would mate him when partner cannot prevent giving up a pawn on next move sitting is only strategy it would of course be perfectly logical for attacker to sit as well waiting for a pawn to come situation where diagonal opponents sit at same time is known as a sitzkrieg literally sitting war in german and a pun on blitzkrieg difference in time between diagonal opponents will eventually force one party to move this diagonal time advantage is more important than difference on clock between opponents on same board manson and hoover 1992 pp 75 89 apart from this active communication a good bughouse player tries to coordinate silently by keeping an eye on other board and adapting moves accordingly this can mean as little as glancing at other board before trading queens or as much as playing an opening adapted to other board see chris ferrante 2000 reproduced in von zimmerman 2006 pp 79 94 attack and defense attacking king can mean checking opponent but also controlling vital squares around king it is an essential part of bughouse gameplay from a player s perspective attacking king has important advantages as opposed to defending or attempting to win material von zimmerman 2006 p 109 because of possibility of dropping pieces attacks in bughouse can quickly lead to checkmate attacking player has initiative he is one who controls board while opponent is left to react this has also important consequences for other board it is easier to attack than to defend a defending mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake thus defender needs to be more precise which in turn can lead to a time advantage for attacker it is common to sacrifice material to build up or sustain an attack characteristic of attacks is so called piece storm where a player drops piece after piece with check contact checks or knight checks which force king to move as opposed to dropping pieces are especially important they can be used to drive king into open away from its defenders while they prevent opponent from putting new material on board von zimmerman 2006 p 20 partner communication is essential in a good defense when one partner is under attack other partner should be aware of which pieces hurt most sitting strategies might be necessary and it is therefore important to play defense fast accepting a sacrifice can be lethal on other hand it results in attacker having a piece less to play with with defender s partner having a piece more sacrifices therefore give partner of defender an opportunity to take initiative von zimmerman 2006 p 113 opening there are significantly fewer bughouse openings than there are chess openings many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse it is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than d and e pawns von zimmerman 2006 pp 21 24 bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development captured pieces become available after first few moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks von zimmerman 2006 p 68 notation and sample game frame right example bughouse game algebraic chess notation for chess can be used to record moves in bughouse games different notations for piece drops are possible manson and hoover 1992 use an x as used in captures in front to indicate a piece drop as in penn and dizon 1998 use i for insert in front as in inf1 von zimmerman 2006 uses notation internet chess servers fics and internet chess club use at sign as in n f1 knight drop at f1 q e6 queen drop with check at e6 or p h7 pawn drop at h7 because of fast pace at which game is played bughouse games are rarely recorded in games played over board with arrival of online chess it has become possible to systematically record games two large bughouse databases are s database and lieven s database accessed july 31 2007 format in which this is done is bughouse portable game notation

likely to find a game more quickly at chess com game is played online in same way as over board but some aspects are unique to online bughouse in games over board communication is heard by all players while in online bughouse it is usually done via private messages between two partners this makes communication a more powerful weapon it is also easier to coordinate as second board is more visible on screen than over board von zimmerman 2006 p 240 time aspect is altered due to existence of and lag latter can influence diagonal time difference significantly and it is good sportsmanship to restart

teachers while some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse most do not consider it to have a positive effect especially for novice chess players according to susan polgar if your children want to play bughouse for fun it is ok but just remember that it is not chess and it has no positive value for chess in fact i absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament scholastic chess polgar girls world open and boys chess challenge uscf chess live magazine accessed october 3 2007 arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at expense of positional strategy von zimmerman 2006 p 27 for example in bughouse one can just drop a pawn to compensate for a weakness created by moving one unlike normal chess it also lacks endgame play due to pieces being recycled thereby reducing need for precise moves in addition lack of control over your teammate s board introduces randomness that is not encountered in normal chess further many claim that since there is no set order of moves between two boards normal calculation ability is diminished it also shares criticisms with speed chess in general potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing with expectation that one s opponent will be moving quickly levon aronian is among those who view bughouse as beneficial for players who know chess well already i started to play bug when i was already at master level you see and i think bughouse is good for imagination to develop new ideas for
