his brother s military campaigns most notably in crucial victory at battle of pelagonia but also in repeated campaigns against epirus and against turks in asia minor he retired from active service after his defeat at neopatras and died shortly after biography early life and first successes thumb right 200px michael viii palaiologos r 1259 1282 john doukas palaiologos was born sometime after 1225 and before 1230 son of andronikos palaiologos megas domestikos of empire of nicaea and his first wife theodora palaiologina john was their second son after future emperor michael palaiologos and fourth child overall nothing is known of him until 1256 when he appears to have been sent to rhodes reasons for this is unclear possibly to take charge of military fill an administrative post or as an exile is unknown he appears again in 1258 when he participated in coup launched by his elder brother michael palaiologos then megas konostaulos against regent for underage john iv laskaris r 1258 1261 george mouzalon after mouzalon s murder michael placed young emperor under protection of john and their half brother constantine michael quickly secured his own nomination as regent and in turn appointed john as megas domestikos and sent him to command nicaean army in macedonia with alexios strategopoulos and john raoul petraliphas as subordinate commanders after his coronation as co emperor in early 1259 michael raised his brother further to rank of sebastokrator strategopoulos succeeded him as megas domestikos and arranged a marriage to a daughter of general michael then ordered john to attack michael ii ruler of rival byzantine greek state of epirus nicaean army advanced so quickly that they caught epirote army by surprise at its camp at kastoria and forced it to flee in disorder john then proceeded to retake fortresses of and only recently captured by epirotes cities fell after short sieges and plain of pelagonia with town of bitola and around lake prespa was subjugated michael of epirus however marshalled his forces and was reinforced with men from principality of achaea and latin states of southern greece under prince william ii of villehardouin himself as well as a sicilian contingent further forces were provided by michael ii s illegitimate son john doukas ruler of thessaly allied force was clearly superior in numbers to nicaean army and john palaiologos avoided direct confrontation using his mobile turkish and cuman horse archers instead to wear down opposing forces in addition allied army was divided by conflicting aims and hatred between epirote greeks and latins a quarrel with william ii led to withdrawal of epirote army and temporary defection of john doukas to nicaean camp next day nicaean forces attacked latins and secured a crushing victory william ii himself and many other barons were taken prisoner while most of latin soldiery was killed or captured in aftermath of this success john palaiologos joined by forces of john doukas marched south into thessaly seizing and fortifying its fortresses until he reached town of neopatras where he made his camp for a time he then continued on into boeotia territory of duchy of athens where he took and plundered and thebes at this point however john doukas defected back to his father upsetting balance of power and john himself was soon after recalled to lampsacus thus his conquest of greece remained incomplete and was soon reversed by recovery of epirus fortunes later years and death thumb right 250px map of byzantine empire and surrounding states in circa 1265 at lampsacus john met with his brother who rewarded his victories with title of despotes second after emperor himself in byzantine hierarchy while his father in law tornikes and his half brother constantine were raised to then or sometime after he was also given islands of rhodes and lesbos as personal domains in july 1261 constantinople was recovered and byzantine empire restored with michael viii as sole emperor in meantime however things had been going badly in epirus where michael ii had recovered his realm and was once again threatening imperial possessions in macedonia in 1261 john was sent on campaign against epirotes after long and hard fighting in summer of 1263 1264 he achieved a major victory which forced michael ii to come to terms epirote ruler acknowledged imperial suzerainty and his son and heir nikephoros was married to anna palaiologina kantakouzene a niece of michael viii after this success he was sent to asia minor where turkish raids on byzantine borderlands had become a menace and where turkish settlers had begun encroaching upon imperial territory he remained there until 1267 and achieved some success securing lands around valley of maeander river and restoring defences of region historian george pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations and alleged that mere mention of his approach caused fear to his enemies in late 1260s john returned to europe and there is evidence of his activity in macedonia and thessaly he had estates in valley of river strymon in macedonia and is attested in documents concerning properties of monasteries in eastern thessaly which byzantines had probably recovered by that time following death of michael ii of epirus in 1267 1268 john doukas of thessaly however remained one of empire s chief opponents and michael palaiologos organized a campaign variously dated to 1272 1273 or 1274 1275 to finally subdue him it was a large scale undertaking an army of some 30 000 men mostly mercenaries was placed under command of john palaiologos and alexios while land forces were to be aided by a fleet of over 70 vessels under alexios philanthropenos campaign was initially crowned with success as byzantine army advanced quickly through thessaly and besieged john doukas at his capital neopatras latter however was able to escape in secret procure aid from duchy of athens and utterly defeat besieging byzantine army at battle of neopatras with his forces scattered john palaiologos retreated to north on his way he learned of an attack by latin fleet on byzantine navy at demetrias assembling whatever men he could find despotes led his troops in a forty mile ride through night towards demetrias there they encountered battle in full swing and latins having advantage arrival of fresh troops however tilted balance and battle ended in a crushing byzantine victory despite his contribution to victory at demetrias john palaiologos was shattered by loss of his army at neopatras according to byzantine sources he resigned his title of despotes although some modern historians have postulated that it was revoked by his brother and appears to have died shortly after 1273 1274 or 1274 1275 depending on dating
