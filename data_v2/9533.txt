1987 tampa bay buccaneers season was franchise s 12th season in national football league 12th playing their home games at tampa stadium and first under head coach ray perkins it was a year of great change for tampa bay buccaneers organization in national football league perkins had only needed three seasons to build giants into a playoff team and it was hoped that he would be able to repeat feat with buccaneers they improved over their 2 14 record from 1986 and finished 4 11 buccaneers possessed first overall pick in nfl draft and used it to select university of miami quarterback vinny testaverde buccaneers appeared changed and won four games early in season but they notably lost large leads in later games and fell from playoff contention after midseason season was marked by a 1987 players strike in which regular play was interrupted for a month while nfl owners fielded teams of replacement players overview perkins brought discipline to a team that had been described as country club of nfl and rebuilt team with youth perkins claimed that buccaneers were more talented than new york giants team he had taken over in 1979 and selected a then record 20 players in 1987 nfl draft he improved their conditioning program and instituted three a day practices perkins harsh style was in stark contrast to laid back approach of his predecessor bennett of whom it was said that his idea of team discipline was everyone wearing same color uniform on game day bricker charles bad decisions haunting culverhouse sun sentinel fort lauderdale 9 december 1990 conditioning improvements included emphasizing free weights over nautilus machines to improve players were also given pay incentives to work out although perkins expressed surprise that players should need extra incentive to improve their conditioning improved conditioning paid off early in season their opening week 48 10 win over atlanta falcons still as of 2012 ranks as most buccaneer points scored in a game matched only in super bowl xxxvii team had a 1 1 record when season was disrupted by 1987 players strike unlike in previous seasons when players strikes stopped all play owners formed teams of replacement players to play scheduled games buccaneers had a 3 2 record when regular play resumed and nearly beat a chicago bears team only one season removed from its super bowl victory game had been preceded by much media speculation over whether bears star quarterback jim mcmahon would play it was first week since undergoing surgery after being dropped on his shoulder following a play previous november that mcmahon was in bears lineup although mike tomczak remained starter for game hewitt brian bears mcmahon may play in tampa stadium sunday st petersburg times october 20 1987 buccaneers took a 20 0 lead and dominated game for three quarters late in third quarter mcmahon came off bench and sparked bears to a 27 26 win their biggest comeback in team history two weeks later tampa bay had a 28 3 fourth quarter lead over st louis cardinals in what is now third biggest comeback in nfl history cardinals scored 4 touchdowns to win game buccaneers did not win again for rest of season it was rare for an nfl team to fall into a season long losing streak following such a defensive collapse john schedule only gets tougher on searching for clues bucs st petersburg times november 10m 1987 once buccaneers were out of playoff picture perkins began to prepare testaverde for next season testaverde s first start came on december 6 against new orleans saints his 369 yards on 22 completions set a record for an nfl debut but his two early fumbles set up a saints lead that buccaneers were not able to overcome tackle ron heller dispirited by coach perkins confrontational attitude and three a day practices that he believed were causing unnecessary injuries to players got into a fight with perkins at halftime of this game that led to his being traded to seattle seahawks in return buccaneers received defensive lineman randy edwards and a 1989 6th round draft pick that was used to select linebacker derrick little neither made buccaneers squad heller went on to play seven more solid seasons buccaneers finished season with a 4 11 record their 3 4 division record placed them ahead of 4 11 detroit lions for fourth place in nfc central ron holmes had eight quarterback sacks despite appearing in only ten games ervin randle who was named a upi second team all nfc linebacker was only buccaneer to be singled out for postseason honors offseason hiring of ray perkins ray perkins replaced leeman bennett as third head coach in buccaneers history expectations had been that owner hugh culverhouse would hire popular ex tampa bay bandits coach steve spurrier but perkins was only candidate interviewed perkins had been approached about job two years earlier but was not interested at time he was given same title head coach and vice president of football operations as previous two coaches he brought along seven of his alabama assistants linebackers coach sylvester croom assistant coach john bobo running backs coach rodney stokes defensive line coach mike dubose strength coach kent johnston head trainer chris smith and defensive coordinator joe who had previously been charley pell s defensive coordinator with florida gators he rounded out his staff with kansas city chiefs secondary coach doug graber and receivers coach richard williamson buffalo bills defensive coordinator herb smu defensive coordinator bill clay and atlanta falcons offensive line coach larry perkins also overhauled scouting staff firing most of them including jim gruden father of future buccaneers coach jon gruden shortly after draft no reason was given but some observers most outspokenly boston globe columnist will mcdonough felt that buccaneers office was staffed heavily with people whose main experience was in college football and that team suffered from a lack of nfl knowledge bruce decline of bucs where did it all go wrong st petersburg times 16 jan 1987 recently fired falcons coach dan henning turned down offensive coordinator position as he had been trying to rebuild falcons and did not want to relive that experience with another team perkins had previously been hired as head coach of new york giants on basis of his experience working with a losing franchise new england patriots that needed turning around perkins coached giants back to playoffs leaving four years later to succeed coaching legend bear bryant at university of alabama ironically irritation over 1982 players strike was a major factor in perkins leaving giants and became an issue he had to contend with again in 1987 frustration with what he saw as by ncaa played a part in perkins decision to return to nfl along with 750 000 a year for five years perkins was given free rein to run buccaneers however he wanted some players were enthusiastic about perkins hire coach perkins will bring in a sense of pride here and that s something we ve been missing said tackle ron heller others were upset with perkins military style manner saying that he made playing football a miserable experience ford tom

linebacker rick dibernardo was traded to st louis cardinals for a 12th round pick dan sileo was signed as a free agent after ncaa ruled that he had used up his college eligibility but league voided agreement and declared that he must enter a draft a special draft was held in which buccaneers selected him with a 1988 third round pick vinny testaverde using their number one selection in 1987 draft buccaneers selected quarterback vinny testaverde who had led miami hurricanes to a 21 3 record in games he started looking to avoid a repeat of previous year s disastrous selection of bo jackson buccaneers signed testaverde 16 days before draft began owner hugh culverhouse wanted to take one last shot at building buccaneers into a successful franchise and made sure that money would not be an issue in signing testaverde in training camp testaverde failed to win starting job over veteran steve deberg who coach perkins felt gave team a better chance to win deberg was displaced for fourth time having played for san francisco 49ers when joe montana was drafted denver broncos when john elway was traded for and buccaneers when steve young was signed steve young when buccaneers selected university of miami quarterback vinny testaverde first overall in 1987 nfl draft starting quarterback steve young became expendable he was traded to 49ers on april 24 1987 49ers were concerned about health of joe montana and were preparing for possibility that he might not recover from back surgery buccaneers received 2nd and 4th round draft picks in trade picks 50 and 106 overall which they used to draft university of miami linebacker winston moss and arizona state wide receiver bruce hill they also received an unspecified amount of cash in deal young would spend final 13 years of his career with 49ers a stint which would help him secure a spot in pro football hall of fame in 2005 other attempted deals coach perkins met for several hours with oklahoma linebacker brian bosworth who entered a supplemental draft after being kicked off of oklahoma team perkins and bosworth were impressed with each other but rights to select were awarded lottery style and first selection went to seattle seahawks seahawks drafted bosworth despite his having sent them a letter telling them not to bother he expressed a preference to play for buccaneers when indianapolis colts failed to sign linebacker cornelius bennett second player selected in draft directly after testaverde they attempted to trade him to tampa bay perkins had previously coached bennett at alabama but colts looking for extra draft picks to trade to los angeles rams to get running back eric dickerson wanted two draft picks in return for bennett perkins felt that this price was too steep perkins also attempted to persuade bo jackson their first overall pick from 1986 nfl draft who had refused to sign with buccaneers to change his mind and join team coach perkins would make a move in supplemental draft by taking all american defensive tackle dan sileo out of university of miami fl with a 3rd round pick after ncaa ruled he had used his eligibility up regular season 1987 players strike nfl players went on strike during third week of 1987 season unlike in 1982 season in which play was suspended for duration of strike nfl continued to play a full schedule games were cancelled in third week but returned in fourth with rosters of replacement players these scab players were in some cases regular players who crossed picket line but were usually players who had previously failed to make an nfl team buccaneers replacement team was made up of a dozen of their training camp cuts a dozen more players cut from other teams training camps and 17 former players from usfl s tampa bay bandits only regular buccaneer to cross picket line was center dan turk although three inactive players crossed picket line by receiving treatment for their injuries there were a few notable names on replacement roster former bandits quarterback and florida gators standout john reaves started first two games while former seattle seahawks and winnipeg blue bombers quarterback jim zorn returned to nfl to start for buccaneers in final replacement game former oklahoma and usfl standout marcus dupree tried out for replacement squad but was rejected due to health concerns replacement players finished with a 2 1 record several of them notably zorn and kicker john carney went on to have successful careers as players and coaches three replacement buccaneers brian gant steve holloway and paul tripoli remained with team once regular play resumed figures later published in los angeles times showed that strike cost owners more than 108 million in potential income all teams had less income in 1987 than in 1986

record having been tied by brad johnson in 2002 perkins who had played with joe namath in college and johnny unitas in pros and drafted phil simms with giants said that deberg had one of best games of any quarterback with whom he had been associated in a completely dominating performance buccaneers controlled ball for 38 minutes allowed no sacks and converted 14 of 16 third down attempts meanwhile

bears past buccaneers he scored a touchdown on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go and tied game with a touchdown pass to neal anderson with 1 28 to go buccaneers allowed seven sacks but led
