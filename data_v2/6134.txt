albatrellus subrubescens is a species of polypore fungus in family fruit bodies mushrooms of fungus have whitish to pale buff colored caps that can reach up to in diameter and stems up to long and thick on underside of caps are tiny light yellow to pale greenish yellow pores site of spore production when fruit bodies are fresh cap and pores stain yellow where exposed handled or bruised species is found in asia europe and north america where it grows on ground in deciduous or mixed woods usually in association with pine trees it is closely related and physically similar to more common albatrellus ovinus from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in color when bruised and microscopically by amyloid staining bluish black to black with melzer s reagent walls of spores fruit bodies of a subrubescens contain scutigeral a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity a subrubescens mushrooms are mildly poisonous and consuming them will result in a short term gastrointestinal illness taxonomy and phylogeny species was first described as scutiger subrubescens by american mycologist william murrill in 1940 based on collections that he found growing under oak near gainesville florida in november 1938 in 1947 he transferred it to genus josiah lincoln lowe examined murrill s type material and thought that it did not differ from albatrellus confluens in 1965 zdenek pouzar made collections from bohemia now czech republic and described it as a new species albatrellus similis unaware of similarity to murrill s florida specimens further study revealed that a similis was identical to murrill s scutiger subrubescens and pouzar transferred latter epithet to albatrellus in 1974 pouzar recognized that lowe s species albatrellus confluens was distinct from a subrubescens specific epithet subrubescens tinted reddish is derived from latin words sub less than and rubescens growing red four albatrellus species were included in a large scale phylogenetic analysis of order russulales published in 2003 based on their ribosomal dna sequences four form a clade or monophyletic group that is they derived from a single ancestor of four tested species a ovinus was most closely related to a subrubescens polypore wrightoporia lenta type species of genus wrightoporia occurred on a single branch basal to albatrellus clade implying that it shared with albatrellus species a common ancestor from which both were descended in a more recent 2010 molecular analysis by canadian mycologist serge audet aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in scutiger a subrubescens grouped in a clade with a ovinus and a citrinus according to audet these species in addition to a and a are constituents of an albatrellus with limits defined by molecular genetics other albatrellus species were transferred to segregate genera a and a confluens to albatrellopsis a and a to a pes and a to an amended scutiger description thumb left caps of some north american populations have a blackish gray to purple gray coloration cap of a subrubescens is between in diameter with a central eccentric away from center or rarely lateral attached to edge of cap stem initially cap is convex with an involute margin flattening out with age cap margin may be folded or flat cap surface in young specimens is smooth but soon forms appressed scale like spots which may transform into scales in age initially cap has white margins and a brownish violet center with scale like spots center later becomes orange brownish or ochraceous brown according to canadian mycologist james ginns who described north american albatrellus species in 1997 some north american specimens may be covered with blackish gray to purple gray fibrils but this characteristic is not seen in european collections cap discolors yellowish when bruised stem is long and thick cylindrical irregular and its base may be somewhat pointed or bulbous initially white stem develops orange violet spots and later brownish orange spots in old specimens stem may be brownish brick red tubes on pore surface underside of cap are about 2 5 3 mm long and decurrent in attachment pores are small measuring about 2 3 per millimeter they are initially greenish white but later turn dark brown dried specimens can have pores that are tinted green fruit bodies have a faintly fragrant pleasant odor in his original report on species murrill noted that specimens left to dry in an oven developed a strong odor of burnt sugar taste of mushroom has been described variously as indistinct or distinctly bitter type material was noted by murrill to taste bitter an observation later corroborated by pouzar with european collections a subrubescens mushrooms are mildly toxic consumption causes a gastrointestinal illness that usually subsides one to four hours after ingestion in deposit spores are white spores are 3 4 4 7 by 2 2 3 4 um ellipsoid to ovoid in shape and amyloid absorbing iodine when stained with melzer s reagent most have a single large oil drop spore bearing cells basidia are club shaped 12 16 um long by 5 7 7 7 um thick and have four thin slightly curved sterigmata that are 3 4 4 3 um long hymenium lacks any cystidia hyphal system is monomitic meaning that context is made of thin walled generative hyphae these hyphae have lengths in range of 3 5 30 um most commonly 6 17 um with thin walls up to 1 um thick and are hyaline translucent although they are inamyloid some hyphae have internal masses that are colored pale bluish gray to black which makes them appear collectively grayish black under microscope hyphae wide and thin walled with refractive contents are also scattered throughout context as well as some hyphae with expanded tips that are thick walled and amyloid similar species in general a subrubescens can be distinguished from other albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised its simple septate hyphae small amyloid spores and habitat under pines in field albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from a subrubescens due to its similar appearance a ovinus usually lacks violet color often seen in cap and stem of a subrubescens microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish two species spores of a subrubescens are amyloid in contrast to those of a ovinus and a ovinus spores are smaller typically 3 8 4 6 by 3 3 3 5 um other similar species include a tianschanicus described from altai mountains in east central asia and japanese species a cantharellus unlike a subrubescens these species have hairy scales on surface of their caps and scales are darker than spaces between scales also scales of a subrubescens are not much darker than area between scales both of these asian species have larger spores than a subrubescens those of a cantharellus are 4 5 7 by 4 5 5 um while those of a tianschanicus are 5 7 by 4 5 um albatrellopsis confluens has caps that are pinkish buff to pale orange and white flesh that dries to a pinkish buff it has a taste that is bitter or like cabbage spores of a confluens are weakly amyloid additional differences distinguishing albatrellopsis confluens from a subrubescens include presence of clamp connections in context hyphae and mycelium on base of stem european fungus a citrinus originally considered a of a subrubescens was described as a new species in 2003 it is distinguished from a subrubescens morphologically by its smaller caps up to in diameter yellowish bruising of caps with age or after handling and absence of violet spots on cap a citrinus associates with spruce rather than pine and requires calcareous lime rich soil habitat and distribution thumb left fruit bodies sometimes grow in groups fused at caps or stem bases fruit bodies of a subrubescens are usually solitary but sometimes several typically between two and eight are stuck together by stem bases or on sides of their caps a strictly terrestrial species it is not found fruiting on wood it prefers to grow in pine woods but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in europe fruit bodies associated with latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine it is suspected that a subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two and three needle pines i e those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty ginns relating a personal communication with david arora wrote that arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in california containing mostly pine a three needle pine manzanita huckleberry and a few species has been reported from a variety of locations in temperate regions of asia europe and north america in north america its distribution includes alberta quebec and northwest territories in canada in united states it is found in alabama arizona california florida new york texas washington and wisconsin north american distribution extends south to mexico in chiapas in asia fungus has been recorded from yunnan in southwest china and tibet in europe collections have been reported from austria czechoslovakia finland germany italy poland sweden switzerland yugoslavia and ukraine bioactive compounds thumb right chemical structure of scutigeral albatrellus subrubescens contains bioactive compound scutigeral which has antibiotic activity this chemical also found in related species a ovinus may contribute to mushroom s toxicity by disturbing body s intestinal flora scutigeral interacts selectively to dopamine receptor d1 subfamily most abundant dopamine receptor in central nervous system regulating neuronal growth and development and mediating some behavioral responses a 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals specifically that it affects uptake of calcium in neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity one 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on human vanilloid receptor while another study published that year did not find any activity references category fungi described in 1940 category fungi of asia category fungi of
