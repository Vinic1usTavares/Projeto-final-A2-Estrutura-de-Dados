150px several reviews wrote positively about return cameo of andy buckley episode received mixed reviews from critics with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative myles mcnutt from a v club gave episode a slightly positive review and gave it a b rating he wrote office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior but there s a certain charm to it mcnutt noted that despite feeling that episode s description of darryl teaches nellie how to eat a taco was a poor move on nbc s part he thought they could have spent more time with nellie learning how to eat a taco craig mcquinn from faster times wrote positively of episode noting for first time in forever this is an episode of office that actually has a lot going on whether stuff that s happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate but i actually enjoyed most of this episode not all reviews were positive dan forcella from tv fanatics gave episode a mixed review and awarded it two and a half stars out of five forcella noted it has been four episodes now since super team returned from florida and office still hasn t found its footing back in scranton and he called outing another lackluster effort a review from cliqueclack was largely critical of episode calling it worse than usual and noting that show had finally hit rock bottom whatculture reviewer joseph kratzer felt that episode s setting outside of office building was detrimental to episode he wrote thing is i in no way felt like any of what occurred in fundraiser needed to take place outside scranton branch and that s really why a sitcom should move locations for an episode because story couldn t function without it but this time it just felt like a cheap way to liven up a clearly very boring uninspired weak episode of television screen crave wrote those viewers of office that have scolded show throughout season for its varying degrees of sucking are not likely to be changing their thinking after watching latest episode however many reviews were happy about return of andy buckley who portrayed david wallace a review from tv equals noted that i m not totally convinced that david wallace s story is as simple as one he tells but maybe that s just because i d love any excuse for him to work his way back into story lines for office michael tedder from vulture called wallace s character always welcome references external links fundraiser at nbc com category office american season 8 episodes category 2012 american television episodes
