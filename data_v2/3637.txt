spacex reusable launch system development program is a privately funded program to develop a set of new technologies for an orbital launch system that may be reused many times in a manner similar to reusability of aircraft company spacex is developing technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles project s long term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to launch pad following orbital realignment with launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours spacex s long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return program was publicly announced in 2011 spacex first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in december 2015 first re flight of a landed first stage occurred in march 2017 with second occurring in june 2017 that one only five months after maiden flight of booster third attempt occurred in october 2017 with ses 11 echostar 105 mission second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine starting in 2018 some first stages made a third flight reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for first stage of falcon 9 after stage separation booster flips around an optional boostback burn is done to reverse its course a reentry burn controlling direction to arrive at landing site and a landing burn to effect final low altitude deceleration and touchdown spacex intended from at least 2014 to develop technology to extend reusable flight hardware to second stages a more challenging engineering problem because vehicle is travelling at orbital velocity second stage reuse is considered paramount to elon musk s plans to enable settlement of mars initial concepts to make second stage of falcon 9 reusable have been abandoned spacex is developing a fully reusable two stage vehicle starship it will fully replace falcon 9 and falcon heavy but also support missions to moon and to mars in addition it could be used for point to point transportation on earth history thumb 400px right from left to right falcon 1 falcon 9 v1 0 three versions of falcon 9 v1 1 three versions of falcon 9 v1 2 full thrust three versions of falcon 9 block 5 falcon heavy and falcon heavy block 5 spacex reusable rocket technology is being developed for both falcon 9 v1 2 and falcon heavy spacex initially attempted to land first stage of falcon 1 by parachute however stage did not survive re entry into atmosphere they continued to experiment unsuccessfully with parachutes on earliest falcon 9 flights after 2010 spacex subsequently switched its focus to developing a powered descent landing system broad outline of reusable launch system was first publicly described in september 2011 spacex said it would attempt to develop powered descent and recovery of both falcon 9 fully vertical takeoff vertical landing vtvl rocket company produced a computer animated video depicting a notional view of first stage returning tail first for a powered descent and second stage with a heat shield reentering head first before rotating for a powered descent in september 2012 spacex began flight tests on a prototype reusable first stage with suborbital grasshopper rocket those tests continued into 2014 including testing of a second and larger prototype vehicle f9r dev1 news of grasshopper test rocket had become public a few days earlier when us federal aviation administration released a draft environmental impact assessment for spacex test site in texas and space media had reported it in may 2012 spacex obtained a set of atmospheric test data for recovery of falcon 9 first stage based on 176 test runs in nasa marshall space flight center wind tunnel test facility work was contracted for by spacex under a space act agreement with nasa in 2012 it was projected that first stage separation of a reusable falcon 9 rocket would occur at a velocity of approximately rather than for an expendable falcon 9 to provide residual fuel necessary for deceleration and turnaround maneuver and controlled descent and landing in november 2012 ceo elon musk announced spacex s plans to build a second much larger reusable rocket system this one to be powered by lox methane rather than lox rp 1 used on falcon 9 and falcon heavy new system was to be an evolution of spacex s falcon 9 booster and spacex reiterated their commitment to develop a breakthrough in vertical landing technology by end of 2012 demonstration test vehicle grasshopper had made three vtvl test a 29 second hover flight to on december 17 2012 in early march 2013 spacex successfully tested grasshopper for a fourth time when it flew to an altitude of over in march 2013 spacex announced that it would instrument and equip subsequent falcon 9 first stages as controlled descent test vehicles with plans for over water propulsively decelerated simulated landings beginning in 2013 with intent to return vehicle to launch site for a powered as early as mid 2014 april 2013 draft environmental impact statement for proposed spacex south texas launch site includes specific accommodations for return of falcon 9 first stage boosters to launch site elon musk first publicly referred to reusable falcon 9 as falcon 9 r in april 2013 in september 2013 spacex successfully relit three engines of a spent booster on an orbital launch and booster re entered atmosphere at hypersonic speed without burning up with data collected from first flight test of a booster controlled descent from high altitude coupled with technological advancements made on grasshopper low altitude landing demonstrator spacex announced it believed it was ready to test a full land recovery of a booster stage based on positive results from first high altitude flight test spacex advanced expected date of a test from mid 2014 to early 2015 with intention of doing so on next space station cargo resupply flight pending regulatory approvals that flight took place on april 18 2014 musk stated in may 2013 that goal of program is to achieve full and rapid reusability of first stage by 2015 and to develop full launch vehicle reusability following that as part of a future design architecture in september 2013 spacex said that if all aspects of test program were successful and if a customer is interested first reflight of a falcon 9 booster stage could happen as early as late 2014 in february 2014 spacex made explicit that newly defined super heavy launch vehicle for what was then called mars colonial transporter would also make use of reusable technology this was consistent with musk s strategic statement in 2012 that revolutionary breakthrough will come with rockets that are fully and rapidly reusable we will never conquer mars unless we do that it ll be too expensive american colonies would never have been pioneered if ships that crossed ocean hadn t been reusable also in may 2014 spacex publicly announced an extensive test program for a related reusable technology a propulsively landed space capsule called dragonfly tests were to be run in texas at mcgregor rocket test facility in 2014 2015 in june 2014 coo gwynne shotwell clarified that all funding for development and testing of reusable launch system technology development program is private funding from spacex with no contribution by us government as of 2017 spacex had spent over a billion dollars on development program for first time spacex stated in july 2014 that they are highly confident of being able to land successfully on a floating launch pad or back at launch site and refly rocket with no required refurbishment by late 2014 spacex suspended or abandoned plan to recover and reuse falcon 9 second stage additional mass of required heat shield landing gear and low powered landing engines would incur too great a performance penalty while idea was mentioned again later it was ultimately abandoned as starship development made progress in december 2015 following recovery of first stage from december 22 launch spacex projected that first reflight of a recovered booster would likely occur in 2016 but that their plan was to not refly december 22 recovered stage for that purpose in september 2016 spacex announced that development was underway to extend reusable flight hardware to second stages a more challenging engineering problem because vehicle is travelling at orbital velocity reusable technology was to have been extended to 2016 designs of both tanker and crewed spaceship upper stage variants as well as first stage of its launch vehicle for interplanetary transport system and is considered paramount to plans elon musk is championing to enable settlement of mars in 2016 initial test flights of an interplanetary transport system vehicle were expected no earlier than 2020 in 2017 spacex was making test flight progress in incrementally and developing a fairing recovery system in july 2017 musk said we are quite close to being able to recover fairing we ve got a decent shot of recovering a fairing by end of year and reflight by late this year or early next cost savings to spacex of recovering fairing is expected to be on order of together booster stage and fairing make up approximately 80 percent of cost of a launch fairings are equipped with a steerable parachute and fall towards a ship equipped with a big net intact fairings could be recovered from ocean starting in 2017 with landings in net from 2019 on technologies several new technologies needed to be developed and tested to facilitate successful launch and recovery of first stages of falcon 9 and falcon heavy and both stages of starship recovery and reuse of first stage of falcon rockets has become routine thumb falcon 9 booster stage re entry with grid fins february 2015 following launch of mission technologies that were developed for falcon 9 some of which are still being refined include restartable ignition system for first stage booster restarts are required at both supersonic velocities in upper atmosphere in order to reverse high velocity away from launch pad and put booster on a descent trajectory back toward launch pad and at high transonic velocities in lower atmosphere in order to slow terminal descent and to perform a soft landing if booster returns to a landing site on land another burn is needed shortly after stage separation to reverse flight direction of booster for a total of four burns for center engine new attitude control technology for booster to bring descending rocket body through atmosphere in a manner conducive both to non destructive return and sufficient aerodynamic control such that terminal phase of landing is possible this includes sufficient roll control authority to keep rocket from spinning excessively as occurred on first high altitude flight test in september 2013 where roll rate exceeded capabilities of booster attitude control system acs and fuel in tanks to side of tank shutting down single engine involved in low altitude deceleration maneuver technology needs to handle transition from vacuum of space at hypersonic conditions decelerating to supersonic velocities and passing through transonic buffet before relighting one of main stage engines at terminal velocity hypersonic grid fins were added to booster test vehicle design beginning on fifth ocean controlled descent test flight in 2014 in order to enable precision landing arranged in an x configuration grid fins control descending rocket s lift vector once vehicle has returned to atmosphere to enable a much more precise landing location iteration on design continued into 2017 larger and more robust grid fins made from forged titanium and left unpainted were first tested in june 2017 and has been used on all reusable block 5 falcon 9 first stages since may 2018 thumb left falcon 9 v1 1 with landing legs attached in stowed position as rocket is prepared for launch in its hangar rocket engine needs to be throttleable to achieve zero velocity at same time rocket reaches ground even lowest possible thrust of a single merlin 1d engine exceeds weight of nearly empty falcon 9 booster core therefore rocket cannot hover terminal guidance and landing capability including a vehicle control system and a control system software algorithm to be able to land a rocket with thrust to weight ratio of vehicle greater than one with closed loop thrust vector and throttle control navigation sensor suite for precision landing thumb autonomous spaceport drone ship in port in january 2015 a large floating landing platform for launches where first stage does not have sufficient fuel to return to launch site spacex built two autonomous spaceport drone ships one for each coast of united states a thermal protection system to avoid damage to first stage when re entering atmosphere lightweight deployable landing gear for booster stage in may 2013 design was shown to be a nested telescoping piston on an a frame total span of four carbon fiber aluminum extensible landing legs is approximately and weigh less than deployment system uses high pressure helium as working fluid with flight 25 it was announced that each landing leg contained a crush core to absorb impact of landing for particularly hard landings economics of rocket reuse in order to make falcon 9 reusable and return to launch site extra propellant and landing gear must be carried on first stage requiring around a 30 percent reduction of maximum payload to orbit in comparison with expendable falcon 9 reflight of a previously used stage on a subsequent flight is dependent on condition of landed stage and is a technique that has seen little use outside of space shuttle s reusable solid rocket boosters musk projected in 2015 that reflight step of program would be straightforward because of multiple full duration firings of engines that had been done on ground and multiple engine restarts that had been demonstrated by that time with no significant degradation seen in 2015 industry analysts continued to forecast problems that could prevent economic reuse because costs to refurbish and relaunch stage were not yet demonstrated and economic case for reuse would necessarily be highly dependent on launching frequently spacex is expected to significantly reduce cost of access to space and change increasingly competitive market in space launch services michael belfiore wrote in foreign policy in 2013 that at a published cost of per launch to low earth orbit falcon 9 rockets are already cheapest in industry reusable falcon 9s could drop price by an order of magnitude sparking more space based enterprise which in turn would drop cost of access to space still further through economies of scale even for military launches which have a number of contractual requirements for additional launch services to be provided spacex s price is under thumb upright 2 depiction of falcon 9 landing trajectory for some of floating platform recovery tests space industry analyst ajay kothari has noted that spacex reusable technology could do for space transport what jet engines did for air transportation sixty years ago when people never imagined that more than 500 million passengers would travel by airplanes every year and that cost could be reduced to level it is all because of passenger volume and reliable reusability spacex said in january 2014 that if they are successful in developing reusable technology launch prices of around for a reusable falcon 9 were possible and following successful first stage recovery in december 2015 musk said that potential cost reduction over long term is probably in excess of a factor of 100 launch service providers who compete with spacex were not planning to develop similar technology or offer competing reusable launcher options neither ils which markets launches of russian proton rocket arianespace nor were planning on developing and marketing reusable launch vehicle services spacex was only competitor that projected a sufficiently elastic market on demand side to justify costly development of reusable rocket technology and expenditure of private capital to develop options for that theoretical market opportunity in 2014 falcon 9 v1 1 rocket was designed with about 30 percent more capacity than its official payload specifications additional performance was reserved for spacex to perform first stage re entry and landing tests towards reusability while still achieving specified orbital payload delivery for customers in order to achieve full economic benefit of reusable technology it is necessary that reuse be both rapid and complete without long and costly refurbishment period or partially reusable design that plagued earlier attempts at reusable launch vehicles spacex has been explicit that huge potential to open up space flight is dependent on achieving both complete and rapid reusability ceo musk stated in 2014 that success with technology development effort could reduce cost of spaceflight by a factor of 100 because cost of propellant oxidizer on falcon 9 is only 0 3 percent of total cost of vehicle separate from market competition brought about by spacex lower launch prices and potential future of even more radically lower launch prices if technology can be completed successfully aviation week said in 2014 that spacex reusable launch work is an r d model audacity of concept and speed of program s progress make it an exemplar breakneck pace of development has been almost apollo like in its execution even while success is far from guaranteed on march 9 2016 spacex president gwynne shotwell gave a more realistic appraisal of potential savings of a reused launch now that attempts to reuse second stage had been abandoned due to cost and weight issues she said at cost of refueling and cost of refurbishing a used first stage could potentially allow a launch to be priced as low as a 30 saving spacex biggest customer ses said it wants to be first to ride a reused vehicle however it wants a launch price of or a 50 saving to offset risk of pioneering process according to elon musk almost every piece of falcon should be reused over 100 times heat shields and a few other items should be reused over 10 times before replacement in march 2017 spacex announced progress in their experiments to recover and eventually reuse 6 million dollar payload fairing on ses 10 mission one of fairing halves performed a controlled atmospheric reentry and splashdown using thrusters and a steerable parachute fairings are eventually slated to land on a floating bouncy castle structure spacex began re flight of previously launched booster stages in 2017 first re flight was accomplished in march 2017 nearly a year after booster s maiden flight second was in june 2017 only five months after its maiden flight both were successful and both insurers and launch service customers are readily supporting newly emerging market in launch services provided by multiple use boosters technical feasibility prior to reusability program s success in december 2015 return of an orbital launch system booster rocket had never been accomplished and many questioned both technical and economic feasibility and even after this success rapid reuse of a rocket has not been attempted developing a reusable rocket is extremely challenging due to small percentage of a rocket s mass that can make it to orbit typically a rocket s payload is only about 3 of mass of rocket which is also roughly amount of mass in fuel that is required for vehicle s re entry elon musk said at beginning of program that he believed return vertical landing and recovery was possible because spacex manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding typical 3 margin a spacex rocket operating in reusable configuration has approximately 30 less payload lift capacity than same rocket in an expendable configuration although reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for first stages of falcon family of rockets it is particularly well suited to falcon heavy where two outer cores separate from rocket earlier in flight and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation for example on falcon 9 flight 20 speed at separation was close to 6000 km h and this allowed a return to near launch site on flight 22 going to a more energetic gto orbit higher velocity at separation was between 8000 and 9000 km h at these faster speeds it is not possible to return booster to near launch site for a landing if a landing is attempted it needs to be hundreds of kilometers downrange on an autonomous droneship reuse also has an impact on risk estimates while early customers of reused rockets asked for a lower price a booster that has flown already has demonstrated to work under realistic flight conditions some customers now prefer reused boosters over new boosters test program in 2013 spacex was testing reusable technologies both for its first stage booster launch vehicle designs with three test vehicles grasshopper f9r dev1 and f9r dev2 and for its new reusable dragon 2 space capsule with a low altitude test vehicle called dragonfly spacex has publicly disclosed a multi element incremental test program for booster stages that includes four aspects low altitude less than low velocity testing of its single engine grasshopper technology demonstrator at its texas test site low altitude less than low velocity testing of a much larger second generation three engine test vehicle called f9r dev1 second generation vehicle includes extensible landing legs and will be tested at texas test site high altitude mid velocity testing was planned but cancelled in favor of post mission re entry tests of first stage boosters it would have used f9r dev2 at a spacex leased facility at spaceport america in new mexico high altitude very high velocity approximately ballistic reentry controlled deceleration and controlled descent tests of post mission spent falcon 9 booster stages following a subset of falcon 9 launches that began in 2013 eight low altitude booster flight tests were made by grasshopper in 2012 and 2013 first booster return controlled descent test from high altitude was made in september 2013 with a second test in april a third test flight in july and a fourth test in september 2014 all four test flights to date were intended to be over water simulated landings five low altitude booster flight tests of f9r dev1 were flown during april august 2014 before vehicle self destructed for safety reasons on fifth flight flight test vehicles thumb grasshopper rocket performing a 325 meter flight followed by a soft propulsive landing in an attempt to develop technologies for a reusable launch vehicle spacex used a set of experimental technology demonstrator suborbital reusable launch vehicles rlv to begin flight testing their reusable booster technologies in 2012 two versions of prototype reusable test rockets were built tall grasshopper formerly designated as grasshopper v1 0 and tall falcon 9 reusable development vehicle or f9r dev1 formerly known as grasshopper v1 1 as well as a capsule prototype for testing propulsive landings of dragon crew and cargo capsule for falcon 9 dragonfly grasshopper was built in 2011 2012 for low altitude low velocity hover testing that began in september 2012 and concluded in october 2013 after eight test flights second prototype vehicle design f9r dev1 was built on much larger falcon 9 v1 1 booster stage was used to further extend low altitude flight testing envelope on a vehicle that better matched actual flight hardware and made five test flights in 2014 low altitude low speed flights of test vehicle rockets and capsule were conducted at spacex rocket test facility in mcgregor texas spacex indicated in november 2018 that they considered testing a heavily modified falcon 9 second stage that would look like a mini bfr ship and be used for atmospheric reentry testing of a number of technologies needed for full scale spaceship including an ultra light heat shield and high mach control surfaces spacex to build small version of bfr s spaceship for use on falcon 9 says elon musk eric ralph teslarati 7 november 2018 but two weeks later musk dismissed approach in favor of using a full diameter bfr instead spacex ceo elon musk kills mini bfr spaceship 12 days after announcing it eric ralph teslarati 20 november 2018 grasshopper grasshopper company s first vtvl test vehicle consisted of a falcon 9 v1 0 first stage tank a single merlin 1d engine and four permanently attached steel landing legs it stood tall spacex built a concrete launch facility at its rocket development and test facility in mcgregor texas to support grasshopper flight test program grasshopper was also known as grasshopper version 1 0 or grasshopper v1 0 prior to 2014 during time grasshopper class test vehicles were being built in addition to three test flights in 2012 five additional tests were successfully flown by end of october fourth test overall in march 2013in which grasshopper doubled its highest leap to rise to with a 34 second flight in seventh test in august 2013 vehicle flew to during a 60 second flight and executed a lateral maneuver before returning to pad grasshopper made its eighth and final test flight on october 7 2013 flying to before making its eighth successful landing grasshopper test vehicle is now retired falcon 9 reusable development vehicle as early as october 2012 spacex discussed development of a second generation grasshopper test vehicle which was to have lighter landing legs that fold up on side of rocket a different engine bay and would be nearly 50 longer than first grasshopper vehicle in march 2013 spacex announced that larger grasshopper class suborbital flight vehicle would be constructed out of first stage tank that was used for qualification testing at spacex rocket development and test facility in early 2013 it was rebuilt as with extensible landing legs five test flights occurred in 2014 second vtvl flight test vehicle f9r dev1 built on much longer falcon 9 v1 1 first stage tank with retractable landing legs made its first test flight on april 17 2014 f9r dev1 was used for low altitude test flights in mcgregor texas area projected maximum altitude below with a total of five test flights all made during 2014 this vehicle self destructed as a safety measure during its fifth test flight on august 22 2014 by april 2014 a third flight test vehicle f9r dev2 was being built and was planned to be flown at high altitude test range available at spaceport america in new mexico where it was expected to be flown at altitudes up to plus it was never flown as spacex moved high altitude testing program to its controlled descent testing of used boosters following their use on a paid orbital launch and ascent dragonfly dragonfly was a prototype test article for a propulsively landed version of spacex dragon capsule a suborbital reusable launch vehicle rlv intended for low altitude flight testing it was planned to undergo a test program in texas at mcgregor rocket test facility during 2014 2015 dragonfly test vehicle is powered by eight superdraco engines arranged in a redundant pattern to support fault tolerance in propulsion system design utilize a propellant mixture of monomethyl hydrazine mmh fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer same propellants used in much smaller draco thrusters used for attitude control and maneuvering on first generation dragon spacecraft while superdraco engines are capable of of thrust during use on dragonfly flight test vehicle each will be throttled to less than to maintain vehicle stability a test flight program of thirty flights was proposed in 2013 2014 including two propulsive assist parachutes plus thrusters and two propulsive landing no parachutes on flights dropped from a helicopter at an altitude of approximately other 26 test flights were projected to take off from a pad eight to be propulsive assist hops landing with parachutes plus thrusters and 18 to be full propulsive hops similar to grasshopper and f9r dev booster stage test flights dragonfly test program was not expected to start until after completion of f9r dev1 booster testing at mcgregor facility starhopper thumb starhopper thumb spacex starhopper configuration as flown in august 2019 construction of starhopper was begun in early december 2018 and external frame and skin was complete by 10 january 2019 constructed outside in open on a spacex property just from boca chica beach in south texas external body of rocket rapidly came together in less than six weeks originally thought by watchers of construction at spacex south texas launch site to be initial construction of a large water tower stainless steel vehicle was built by welders and construction workers in more of a shipyard form of construction than traditional aerospace manufacturing full starhopper vehicle is in diameter and was originally tall in january 2019 subsequent wind damage to nose cone of vehicle resulted in a spacex decision to scrap nose section and fly low velocity hopper tests with no nose cone resulting in a much shorter test vehicle from mid january to early march a major focus of manufacture of test article was to complete pressure vessel construction for liquid methane and liquid oxygen tanks including plumbing up system and moving lower tank section of vehicle to launch pad on 8 march integrated system testing of starhopper with newly built ground support equipment gse at spacex south texas facilities began in march 2019 these tests involved fueling starhopper with lox and liquid methane and testing pressurization systems observed via icing of propellant lines leading to vehicle and venting of cryogenic boil off at launch test site during a period of over a week starhopper underwent almost daily tests wet dress rehearsals and a few pre burner tests following initial integrated system testing of starhopper test vehicle with raptor engine serial number 2 raptor s n 2 in early april engine was removed for post test analysis and several additions were made to starhopper attitude control system thrusters were added to vehicle along with shock absorbers for non retractable landing legs and quick disconnect connections for umbilicals raptor s n 4 was installed in early june for fit checks but first test flight that is not tethered was expected to fly with raptor s n 5 until it suffered damage during testing at spacex rocket development and test facility in mcgregor texas subsequently raptor s n 6 was engine used by starhopper for its untethered flights falcon 9 booster post mission flight tests thumb upright 0 6 crs 6 booster landing attempt in an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles spacex began in 2013 using some first stages of falcon 9 v1 1 rockets for propulsive return controlled descent flight tests after they completed boost phase of an orbital flight since advent of spaceflight in 1957 launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way over water tests started by spacex took place in pacific and atlantic oceans south of vandenberg air force base and east of cape canaveral air force station first flight test occurred on september 29 2013 after second stage with and payloads separated from booster these descent and simulated landing tests continued over next two years with second flight test taking place on april 18 2014 two more test in 2014 and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015 spacex continued to make iterative and incremental changes to booster design as well as specific reusable technologies descent profile and propellant margins on some 2016 2018 falcon 9 and falcon heavy flights to tweak design and operational parameters many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for spacex customers as booster reentered atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings re entry and controlled descent development following analysis of flight test data from first booster controlled descent in september 2013 spacex announced it had successfully tested a large amount of new technology on flight and that coupled with technology advancements made on grasshopper low altitude landing demonstrator they were ready to test a full recovery of booster stage first flight test was successful spacex said it was able to successfully transition from vacuum through hypersonic through supersonic through transonic and light engines all way and control stage all way through atmosphere musk said next attempt to recovery sic falcon 9 first stage will be on fourth flight of upgraded rocket this would be third commercial dragon cargo flight to iss this second flight test took place during april 2014 dragon flight to iss spacex attached landing legs to first stage decelerated it over ocean and attempted a simulated landing over water following ignition of second stage on third cargo resupply mission contracted to nasa first stage was successfully slowed down enough for a soft landing over atlantic ocean spacex announced in february 2014 intent to continue tests to land first stage booster in ocean until precision control from hypersonic all way through subsonic regimes has been proven five additional controlled descent tests were conducted in remainder of 2014 through april 2015 including two attempts to land on a floating landing platform a spacex built autonomous spaceport drone ship on atlantic ocean east of launch site both of which brought vehicle to landing platform but neither of which resulted in a successful landing first landing on ground pad thumb falcon 9 flight 20 s first stage landing viewed from a helicopter december 22 2015 during 2015 launch hiatus spacex requested regulatory approval from faa to attempt returning their next flight to cape canaveral instead of targeting a floating platform in ocean goal was to land booster vertically at leased landing zone 1 facility former launch complex 13 where spacex had recently built a large rocket landing pad faa approved safety plan for ground landing on december 18 2015 first stage landed successfully on target at 20 38 local time on december 21 01 38 utc on december 22 first stage booster b1019 never flew again after flight rather rocket was moved a few miles north to spacex hangar facilities at launch pad 39a recently refurbished by spacex at adjacent kennedy space center where it was inspected before being used on january 15 2016 to conduct a static fire test on its original launchpad launch complex 40 this test aimed to assess health of recovered booster and capability of this rocket design to fly repeatedly in future tests delivered good overall results except for one of outer engines experiencing thrust fluctuations elon musk reported that this may have been due to debris ingestion booster was then retired to spacex facility in hawthorne california thumb first stage of falcon 9 flight 21 descending over floating landing platform january 17 2016 immediately prior to a soft touchdown followed by deflagration of rocket after a landing leg failed to latch causing rocket to tip over near misses on oceans falcon 9 flight 21 launched jason 3 satellite on january 17 2016 and attempted to land on floating platform just read instructions located for first time about out in pacific ocean approximately 9 minutes into flight live video feed from drone ship went down due to losing its lock on uplink satellite vehicle landed smoothly onto vessel but one of four landing legs failed to lock properly reportedly due to ice from heavy pre launch fog preventing a lockout collet from latching consequently booster fell over shortly after touchdown and was destroyed in a deflagration upon impact with pad flight 22 was carrying a heavy payload of to geostationary transfer orbit gto this was heavier than previously advertised maximum lift capacity to gto being made possible by going slightly following delays caused by failure of flight 19 spacex agreed to provide extra thrust to ses 9 satellite to take it as a result of these factors there was little propellant left to execute a full reentry and landing test with normal margins consequently falcon 9 first stage followed a ballistic trajectory after separation and re entered atmosphere at high velocity making it less likely to land successfully atmospheric re entry and controlled descent were successful despite higher constraints on first stage due to extra speed however rocket was moving too fast and was destroyed when it collided with drone ship spacex collected valuable data on extended flight envelope required to recover boosters from gto missions landings at sea thumb right first stage of falcon 9 flight 23 landed on autonomous droneship starting in january 2015 spacex positioned stable floating platforms a few hundred miles off coast along rocket trajectory those transformed barges were called autonomous spaceport drone ships on april 8 2016 falcon 9 flight 23 third flight of full thrust version delivered spacex crs 8 cargo on its way to international space station while first stage conducted a boostback and re entry maneuver over atlantic ocean nine minutes after liftoff booster landed vertically on drone ship of course i still love you 300 km from florida coastline achieving a long sought after milestone for spacex reusability development program a second successful drone ship landing occurred on may 6 2016 with next flight which launched jcsat 14 to gto this second landing at sea was more difficult than previous one because booster at separation was traveling about compared to on crs 8 launch to low earth orbit pursuing their experiments to test limits of flight envelope spacex opted for a shorter landing burn with three engines instead of single engine burns seen in earlier attempts this approach consumes less fuel by leaving stage in free fall as long as possible and decelerating more sharply thereby minimizing amount of energy expended to counter gravity elon musk indicated this first stage may not be flown again instead being used as a life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good a third successful landing followed on 27 may again following deceleration from high speed required for a gto launch landing crushed a crush core in one leg leading to a notable tilt to stage as it stood on drone ship routine procedure over subsequent missions landing of first stage gradually became a routine procedure and since january 2017 spacex ceased to refer to their landing attempts as experimental low energy missions to iss fly back to launch site and land at lz 1 whereas more demanding satellite missions land on drone ships a few hundred miles downrange occasional missions with heavy payloads such as echostar 23 do not attempt to land flying in expendable configuration without fins and legs further successful landings occurred on lz 1

ships helping them optimize procedures needed to re use boosters rapidly in january 2016 elon musk estimated likelihood of success at 70 percent for all landing attempts in 2016 hopefully rising to 90 percent in 2017 he also cautioned that we should expect a few more rapid unscheduled disassembly musk s euphemism to denote destruction of vehicle on impact musk s prediction was vindicated as 5 out of 8 flown boosters were recovered in 2016 and 14 out of 14 in 2017 three gto missions for heavy payloads echostar 23 in march 2017 inmarsat 5 f4 in may 2017 and intelsat 35e in july 2017 were flown in an expendable configuration not equipped for landing one booster which could have been recovered was intentionally flown without legs and left to sink after a soft touchdown in ocean booster b1036 for iridium next 31 40 mission in december 2017 first stage reuse spacex had recovered 21 first stage boosters from previous missions of which six were recovered twice yielding a total 27 landings in 2017 spacex flew a total of 5 missions out of 20 with re used boosters in total 14 boosters have been re flown on july 28 2016 first stage from jcsat 2b mission was successfully test fired for a full duration at spacex mcgregor facility first reuse attempt occurred on 30 march 2017 with launch of ses 10 resulting in a successful flight and second landing of b1021 first stage recovered from crs 8 mission of april 2016 another reflight succeeded in june 2017 with bulgariasat 1 riding b1029 booster from january 2017 iridium next mission booster b1031 flew crs 10 mission to iss in february 2017 and helped loft communications satellite ses 11 to geostationary orbit in october 2017 boosters b1035 and b1036 were flown twice each for same customer b1035 for nasa missions crs 11 and crs 13 in june and december 2017 and b1036 for two batches of 10 iridium next satellites also in june and december 2017 b1032 was re used for 1 in january 2018 after nrol 76 in may 2017 finally b1023 and b1025 were re used as side boosters on falcon heavy test flight in february 2018 spacex spent four months refurbishing first booster to be re used b1021 and launched it again after approximately one year second booster to be flown again b1029 was refurbished in only a couple of months and re launched after five months elon musk has stated a goal to turn around a first stage within 24 hours musk remains convinced that this long term goal can be met by spacex rocket technology but has not stated that goal would be achieved with falcon 9 design boosters b1019 and b1021 were retired and put on display b1029 was also retired after bulgariasat 1 mission b1023 b1025 b1031 and b1035 were recovered a second time while b1032 and b1036 were deliberately sunk at sea after a soft ocean touchdown by mid 2019 having reflown any single booster only three times to date spacex indicated that they plan to reuse a single booster at least five times by end of 2019 block 5 boosters with a streak of 17 successful recovery attempts of first stage throughout 2017 spacex has focused on rapid reusability of first stage boosters block 3 and block 4 proved economically feasible to be flown twice as 11 such boosters have been reflown in 2017 and 2018 block 5 has been designed with multiple reuses in mind up to 10 reuses with minimal inspection and up to 100 uses with refurbishment spacex test fires new falcon 9 block 5 rocket ahead of maiden flight updated robin popular mechanics 4 may 2018 new aggressive reentry profiles were experimented with expendable block 3 and block 4 boosters in early 2018 to test out limitations on range of recoverable launch margins that are potential for future block 5 fairing reuse payload fairings have traditionally been expendable where they have either burned up in atmosphere or were destroyed upon impacting ocean as early as mid 2015 musk hinted that spacex might be working on fairing reusability following discovery of wreckage of an unidentified falcon 9 launch vehicle section off coast of bahamas and was subsequently confirmed by spacex to be a component of a payload fairing that had washed ashore by april 2016 spacex had publicly announced falcon 9 fairing recovery as an objective cost of fairing is about 6 million per launch which accounts for approximately ten percent of overall launch costs in march 2017 as part of ses 10 mission spacex for first time performed a controlled landing of payload fairing and successfully recovered a fairing half aided by attitude control thrusters and a steerable parachute helping it glide towards a gentle touchdown on water company announced intent to land fairings eventually on a dry flexible structure jokingly described by musk as a floating bouncy castle with aim of full fairing reuse with successive tests and refinements on several flights intact fairing recovery was stated as an objective for 2017 with reflight of a recovered fairing planned in 2018 bouncy castle idea was superseded by a net strung between large arms of a fast platform supply vessel named mr steven recovery vessel is equipped with dynamic positioning systems and was tested after launch of paz satellite from vandenberg air force base in 2017 this mission was also first to use a version 2 fairing explicitly designed to improve survivability for post launch recovery attempts and to be reusable on future missions this recovery attempt was not fully successful fairing missed boat by a few hundred meters but landed intact in water before being recovered and taken back to port all four attempts by spacex to land a fairing on a recovery ship had failed despite fitting mr steven with larger nets before july 2018 attempt in october 2018 at least two fairing recovery tests were performed involving mr steven and a helicopter which would drop a fairing half from height of about 3300 meters actual outcome of tests is unclear in april 2019 during second falcon heavy mission recovery boat go searcher fished fairing halves out of sea and it was announced fairings would be used on a starlink mission these fairings were reused in a starlink mission on 11 november 2019 in june 2019 following third falcon heavy launch first successful fairing catch was made images posted to twitter hours after launch showed one half of fairing nestled in net of recovery vessel go ms tree formerly mr steven second stage reuse despite early public statements that spacex would endeavor to make falcon 9 second stage reusable as well by late 2014 they determined that mass needed for a re entry heat shield landing engines and other equipment to support recovery of second stage as well as diversion of development resources from other company objectives was at that time prohibitive and indefinitely suspended their second stage reusability plans for falcon rockets however in july 2017 they indicated that they might do experimental tests on recovering one or more second stages in order to learn more about reusability to inform their starship development process and in may 2018 provided additional details about how they might carry out some of that testing starship is planned to replace all existing spacex launch and space vehicles after mid 2020s falcon 9 falcon heavy and dragon spacecraft aimed initially at earth orbit launch market but with capability to support long duration spaceflight in cislunar and mars mission environments both stages will be fully reusable integrated second stage with spaceship design has not been used in previous launch vehicles operational flow in first year of successful stage return from experimental test flights spacex performed ad hoc and flight specific evaluation and component testing on each successfully landed stage stages were processed and initially evaluated in either launch hangars or for cape canaveral landings in new hangar spacex recently completed at kennedy space center launch complex 39 returned rocket parts have also been transported to spacex hawthorne and spacex mcgregor for engineering evaluation and testing in february 2017 after eight rocket cores had successfully landed seven of them having launched from cape canaveral spacex announced plans to expand their physical facilities to process and refurbish rockets they will do so in both leased space and in a new building to be built in port canaveral
