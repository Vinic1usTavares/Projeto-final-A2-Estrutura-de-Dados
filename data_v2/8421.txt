itself was a long brick depot three stories tall and topped with a french roof station sat alongside railroad tracks and was called orange hotel dining room of new structure was able to hold 500 people at a time and accommodate them with good food during planning of erie there was some concern to whether or not railroad would work its way through harriman at all instead bypassing nearby goshen and middletown in favor of a terminus at newburgh also on hudson river train service to harriman began in 1841 when new york and lake erie ran its first trains on june 30 1841 from piermont on hudson determined eastern terminus to goshen western end construction progressed on erie railroad and by end of 1841 grading from middletown to goshen was in progress and 410 of chartered for new

on may 12 1851 just about a month after completion a completion gala was held from washington d c then president millard fillmore and several members of his cabinet along with several former governors of new york attended several other distinguished individuals came from around united states on may 14 tour arrived in new york city and began their trip on first ride at piermont at 7 45 that morning fillmore train arrived at dunkirk just past 4 00 pm next afternoon charles minot and telegraph right thumb monolith that once held a plaque commemorating charles minot s 1851 achievement in 1847 ezra cornell of ithaca new york worked to expand telegraphic communication through new york and lake erie railroad right of way with western union telegraph company saving a telegraph line he built from new york city to fredonia new telegraph was an instant hit and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting then superintendent of new york and lake erie charles minot looked to expand this new technology with railroad he developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches for use when trains would want to pass one another along line such as at stations two letter telegraph codes were designated and new modern system was set up for ten years of new railroad s existence passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them this new system would relieve this issue on september 22 1851 minot was in a parked passenger train at turner station he glanced out window of train and saw new telegraph wires departing train minot ran into station got on new telegraph and wired next station along line monroe to see if eastbound train to piermont on hudson had gone past station agent said no at that point minot ordered engineer of train to proceed on their way to goshen engineer refused to take minot s order and instead minot got into cab car himself and drove train himself to port jervis hours ahead of planned scheduled time of arrival this was second of several firsts erie railroad created in its time along with shipment of milk by rail at chester station in 1842 use of telegraph and minot s system remained until 1888 when a new system of block signaling developed by competitor pennsylvania railroad helped expand minot s use of telecommunications to control rail traffic naming controversy right thumb orange hotel prior to fire shown in a montage from a june 1910 new york times article around 6 30 pm on evening of friday december 26 1873 three story orange hotel station depot caught fire some staff of re christened erie railroad were examining a room in roof of building and upon looking into it found it engulfed in smoke fire quickly spread consuming entire story there was a lull but building re ignited as flames continued through building mansard roof on top of building was destroyed by flames no fire ridding materials to douse blaze were available to staff and no one could get near building to inspect where flames were flames finally destroyed entire building and just two hours after fire was discovered walls began to collapse on structure within a half hour entire hotel depot had collapsed and was a pile of brick ruins train service on erie main line was disrupted for several hours due to fire and station depot collapse a later study determined station depot burned down due to a defective flue station depot was replaced by a wooden one story depot referred to by locals as a shack along side of tracks in downtown turner new station itself lasted around same amount of time that its predecessor station depot had however widow of edward henry harriman d september 9 1909 a local railroad executive whose arden estate was in nearby hills donated land in february 1910 in a different portion of turner to build a brand new station to east old one story depot had a roof and structural supports that were aging and on verge of collapsing to ground plans for a new station didn t come without controversy though as in 1910 with death of e h harriman there was a proposal by turner village improvement association to rename borough from turner to harriman as an honor to late executive on may 25 1910 association voted 58 to 13 to change name harriman s widow said if they changed name she d donate 25 000 1910 usd equivalent to in to help improvement look and design of village and 6 000 1910 usd equivalent to in more for a brand new railroad station it was proposed that by having erie railroad change station name on decrepit depot from turner to harriman local post office would adopt new name almost immediately erie conductors were told upon approaching turner station to call name harriman however a local priest at forefront of controversy father mcaran thought entire situation regarding train from new york was a joke to add to annoyance of priest old sign attached to 1873 depot was replaced by a brand new one saying harriman left thumb 1873 station depot as photographed with harriman name sign in june 1910 during naming debates between turner and harriman on morning of may 26 erie railroad sent a statement out from pavonia terminal in jersey city new jersey to disregard order from previous day new sign came down instantly and conductors continued to call station turner once again old time locals felt name turner had more value to them and shouldn t be touched a self appointed committee run by priest proposed a meeting on saturday june 4 1910 at nearby gillette hall to protest name change priest also offered that if name was to remain turner s he would contribute 500 towards construction of a new station post office also said they would remain named turner even if signage on erie railroad station went back to harriman name sometime during night between june 1 and june 2 erie railroad took station depot sign for turner down once again and re attached harriman sign to station depot local resolutions were sent to erie showing citizens displeasure at changing signage once again order from erie stated that beginning on july 15 station name would remain harriman permanently father mcaran returned to his outrage and continued to go to press and give interviews on issue at hand to wrap issue up a sign in front of local church proclaiming long live turner was destroyed this hurt enthusiasm of locals who suggested renaming local arden station near harriman estate instead new station opens at harriman a year after great naming controversy and station permanently being established as harriman construction began on a new station to replace disgraceful shack that residents called harriman that year a new station built with 6 000 from edward henry harriman s widow was constructed of brick with a stucco outlier roof of one story depot was

railroad community was honored and a bronze tablet on a stone backing was unveiled as a monument to him at this point erie railroad continued on with a new station at harriman which remained prosperous for years to come in june 1931 james gorney a resident of pine island allegedly attempted to rob station and station agent harriman police shot gorney in leg which was crippling enough that it required amputation of leg his lawyer who got him off third degree burglary charges and several acquittals also negotiated a payment of 20 000 to gorney from harriman for pain and suffering of
