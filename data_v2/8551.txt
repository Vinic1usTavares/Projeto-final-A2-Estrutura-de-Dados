1966 nasa t 38 crash occurred when a nasa northrop t 38 talon crashed at lambert field in st louis missouri on february 28 1966 killing two project gemini astronauts elliot see and charles bassett aircraft piloted by see crashed into mcdonnell aircraft building where their gemini 9 spacecraft was being assembled weather was poor with rain snow fog and low clouds a nasa panel headed by chief of astronaut office alan shepard investigated crash while panel considered possible medical issues or aircraft maintenance problems in addition to weather and air traffic control factors end verdict was that crash was caused by pilot error in aftermath of crash backup crew of thomas stafford and eugene cernan were moved up to primary position for gemini 9 mission scheduled for early june jim lovell and buzz aldrin who had formerly been backup for gemini 10 became mission s backup crew and through normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for gemini 12 without gemini experience it is unlikely that aldrin would have been assigned to apollo 11 mission during which he became second man to walk on moon accident see and bassett were prime crew assigned to gemini 9 mission they and backup crew for mission tom stafford and gene cernan were flying to st louis from their normal training base in houston texas for two weeks of simulator training for rendezvous and docking procedures at mcdonnell aircraft prime contractor for gemini spacecraft it was a routine flight that they had made many times previously see and bassett flew in one northrop t 38a talon jet trainer tail number nasa 901 air force serial number 63 with see at controls and bassett in rear seat a second t 38 nasa 907 carried stafford and cernan in same configuration two aircraft took off from ellington air force base in texas at 7 35 a m cst with see in lead and stafford in wing position weather at lambert field in st louis was poor with rain snow and fog broken clouds at and a cloud ceiling of requiring an instrument approach when two aircraft emerged below clouds shortly before 9 am both pilots realized that they had missed outer marker and overshot runway see then elected to perform a visual circling approach a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules as long as pilot can keep airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight reported weather conditions at airport were adequate for this type of approach but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly stafford began to follow see s plane but when he lost sight of it in clouds he instead followed standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up back into clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing see completed a full circle to left at an altitude of and announced his intention to land on southwest runway 24 with landing gear down and full flaps plane dropped quickly but too far left of runway see turned on his afterburner to increase power while pulling up and turning hard right seconds later at 8 58 a m cst plane struck roof of mcdonnell building 101 on northeast side of airport it lost its right wing and landing gear on impact then cartwheeled and crashed in a parking lot beyond building which was in use as a construction staging area both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in crash see was thrown clear of cockpit and was found in parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat with parachute partially open bassett was decapitated on impact his severed head was found later in day in rafters of damaged assembly building inside building 101 17 mcdonnell employees and contractors received mostly minor injuries from falling debris crash set off several small fires inside building and caused minor flooding from broken pipes and sprinklers see and bassett died within of spacecraft that they were to have flown in orbit which was in final stages of assembly in another part of building 101 spacecraft s c9 was undamaged but a piece of debris from t 38 s wing struck unfinished s c10 spacecraft stafford and cernan still circling in clouds in second t 38 had no idea what had happened to their flight partners air traffic controllers were confused by two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after initial missed approach and no one on ground knew who was in crashed plane after some delay stafford and cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land but they were not informed of crash until on ground although personally distraught over loss of his close colleagues and friends stafford acted as nasa s chief contact on scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in day investigation and aftermath nasa immediately appointed a seven member panel to investigate crash headed by their chief of astronaut office alan shepard while panel weighed possible medical issues aircraft maintenance problems weather conditions and air traffic control factors their end verdict was pilot error citing see s inability to maintain visual reference for a landing as primary cause of crash see was described as a cautious and conservative pilot in accident report in his memoir chief astronaut deke slayton was less diplomatic calling see s piloting skills old womanish others including neil armstrong who had worked with see on backup crew for gemini 5 have since defended see s piloting ability since crash did not affect space flight operations and spacecraft itself was undamaged it was shipped to nasa two days after crash accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in u s space program however loss of gemini 9 crew did cause nasa to reshuffle crew assignments for subsequent gemini and apollo missions stafford and cernan were moved up to primary position for gemini 9 re designated gemini 9a jim lovell and buzz aldrin who had formerly been backup for gemini 10 became back up crew for gemini 9a and through normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for gemini 12 without experience during gemini mission buzz aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for apollo 11 mission during which he became second man to walk on moon
