choiseul pigeon microgoura meeki is an extinct species of bird in pigeon and dove family columbidae it was endemic to island of choiseul in solomon islands although there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands last confirmed sighting was in 1904 other common names were solomons crested pigeon solomon islands crowned pigeon and choiseul pigeon was monotypic within genus microgoura and had no known subspecies its closest living relative is believed to be thick billed ground pigeon and some authors have suggested that choiseul pigeon may be a link between that species and crowned pigeons adult pigeon was largely blue grey with a buffy orange belly and a distinctive slaty blue crest it is unknown how this crest was held by bird in life bird s head sported a blue frontal shield surrounded by black feathers and a bicoloured beak wings were brown and short tail was a blackish purple it was described as having a beautiful rising and falling whistling call as bird became extinct before significant field observations could be made not much is known about its behaviour it is believed to have been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in ground it roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves it was only recorded by albert stewart meek who collected six adults and an egg from northern part of island in 1904 despite many subsequent searches bird has not been definitively reported since it is believed to have been rare when meek collected his specimens indigenous peoples reported that species was driven to extinction due to introduction of cats as pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on choiseul last unconfirmed report of a choiseul pigeon was in early 1940s and species is considered extinct taxonomy thumb left related thick billed ground pigeon trugon terrestris choiseul pigeon was described by walter rothschild in 1904 on basis of six skins three male and three female and an egg collected by albert stewart meek earlier that year it was placed in monotypic genus microgoura whose name comes from ancient greek word small and goura a new guinean aboriginal name for similarly crested crowned pigeons of genus goura rothschild named species after meek giving bird specific name meeki though its relationships are unclear choiseul pigeon is believed to have been closest to thick billed ground pigeon trugon terrestris from indonesia and papua new guinea which has similar plumage it has been suggested that choiseul pigeon was a link between thick billed ground pigeon and crowned pigeons however other sources argue that it may not have been closely related to crowned pigeons as its crest was quite different based on behavioural and morphological evidence jolyon c parish proposed that choiseul pigeon should be placed in subfamily along with pigeons dodo rodrigues solitaire and others choiseul pigeon has no known subspecies today five skins and a partial skeleton are kept in american museum of natural history while a single skin and egg are kept at natural history museum at tring choiseul pigeon is also known as solomon crowned pigeon solomon

called species either or ni lua which translates literally as pigeon belong ground description thumb upright illustration showing alternate crest arrangement choiseul pigeon was about long wing of male was tail culmen and tarsus was wing of female was tail culmen and tarsus was adult choiseul pigeons of both sexes were blue grey overall with a buffy orange belly pigeon had a distinctive long rounded crest that had a hairy texture this crest like crown was slaty blue and emerged from bird s though many artists have speculated it is unknown how pigeon held its crest in life as meek s notes did not cover this subject john gerrard keulemans who produced illustration accompanying rothschild s original description depicted crest as being flat based on meek s specimens other artists have presented it as spread and like that of crowned pigeons it has been suggested that crests of museum specimens were flattened during preparation on bird s forehead was a naked and pale chalky blue frontal shield this was surrounded by short velvety black feathers that extended from base of bill to area just below and in front of eye while area below eye was a pinkish wash bird s chin and throat were sparsely covered with black velvety feathers while neck was a slaty blue that transitioned into a brownish grey breast abdomen and undertail coverts were a rich orange while undertail was a blackish grey wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm dark brown by wingtips underwing was brown back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump while uppertail coverts were a dark sooty grey with blackish tips tail which was short and rounded was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen bill was bicoloured upper mandible was chalky blue with a black tip while lower mandible was red plumage of juvenile is unknown bird s feet were a dull purplish red and unfeathered up to heel while iris was a dark brown bird s voice was never recorded however after it became extinct indigenous peoples described it as possessing a beautiful rising and falling whistling call given from roost site every evening others described call as a low c r r ooo cr ooo or cr o o o behaviour and ecology not much is known about species behaviour as it became extinct before significant field observations could be made it is likely that choiseul pigeon was a largely terrestrial species feeding and nesting near forest floor indigenous people of town of said that pigeon would roost in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs close to ground they claimed that species was very tame allowing local hunters to approach it and pick it up off of its perch by hand they reported that species had stones in its gizzard it laid a single dark cream coloured egg in an unlined depression on ground egg was about in size which is considered small in proportion to bird distribution and habitat thumb right alt a river running through lowland forest in solomon islands lowland forest in solomon islands 2012 choiseul pigeon was non migratory and is thought to have lived on forest floor in lowland forests including coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves choiseul pigeon is usually considered to have been endemic to island of choiseul in solomon islands off coast of new guinea where only specimens were collected specimens meek acquired were likely collected near choiseul bay in northern part of island last reports of species from indigenous population came from kolombangara river it also reportedly lived on neighboring islands of santa isabel and malaita and it is suspected that it may once have lived on bougainville island however these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal it would be considered very unusual if choiseul pigeon were truly endemic to choiseul as island hosts no other endemic species and pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on island last sightings in january 1904 six specimens and an egg were collected by albert stewart meek a bird collector for lord walter rothschild near choiseul bay on choiseul several local boys told meek that pigeon was also present on nearby islands of santa isabel and malaita though meek did not travel to these islands he did search for choiseul pigeon on adjacent bougainville island but did not find any evidence of its presence no other specimens were ever collected or seen by western scientists choiseul pigeon was not searched for again until briefly in 1927 and again in october 1929 when five veteran collectors belonging to whitney south seas expedition dedicated three months to searching for pigeon in multiple locations across choiseul without success indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that pigeon was extinct in 1929 last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in early 1940s near by kolombangara river although this sighting was never confirmed searches of small cat free islands of rob roy island and off choiseul s southeast coast and choiseul s forested coastal swampland in 1960s by british ornithologist shane a parker did not discover any signs of pigeon american scientist jared diamond searched for bird in 1974 without success relationship with humans thumb choiseul pigeon on flag of choiseul province this pigeon was a source of food for local people who would locate its roosting sites either due to bird calling or by droppings that had accumulated below its perches it was well remembered by indigenous peoples and stories of delicious ground dwelling pigeon were passed down by local elders after its extinction one indigenous person implied that gizzard stones of pigeon may have had value locally after bird s extinction indigenous people have occasionally confused choiseul pigeon with arboreal crested cuckoo dove in modern folklore and several claims of pigeon s continued existence turned out to be based on cuckoo dove after its discovery several western bird collections highly desired its skins whitney south seas expedition spent three months at high expense on choiseul with primary objective being acquisition of choiseul pigeon in 2012 choiseul pigeon was commemorated on a stamp from mozambique along with several other extinct birds choiseul pigeon is depicted on flag of choiseul province extinction indigenous population believed that pigeon became extinct due to predation by feral cats and to a lesser extent feral dogs as choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals ground dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to introduced cats if pigeon existed on islands that feral cats had never reached it is believed that clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction as there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches iucn has declared it extinct as several ornithologists had visited choiseul and nearby islands prior to meek without noting any sign of bird s existence it is likely that choiseul pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904 references cited texts external links pictures of a specimen category bird extinctions since 1500 category
