of streets connecting former mining communities and mountain passes built as relief work for unemployed miners road was originally a dead end from bridgend along ogmore valley built in 19th century but concerns over travel difficulties environment and post world war i unemployment in rhondda led to a series of mountain roads being planned road was initially extended over bwlch y clawdd towards treorchy in 1928 a further section from treherbert northward to hirwaun opened following year as well as improving communications and transport a4061 allowed locals to visit mountain summits easily

nantymoel glamorgan inter valley road area was rural and sparsely populated until mid 19th century when discovery of coal led to a major industrial boom geography of narrow river valleys sandwiched between mountains meant that land space was at a premium with roads and railways struggling to find space with relatively little sunlight reaching valley floors local climate in valleys was depressing visiting a town in a neighbouring valley only a few miles away as crow flies could involve a round trip a4061 was typical of this and around 1900 it was a dead end road from bridgend to nantymoel requiring a detour via fach valley and tonyrefail to reach rhondda valley downturn of coal mining industry after world war i hit rhondda particularly hard due to its isolation and lack of access with high unemployment by 1920s in 1924 a series of new mountain roads to connect isolated valleys was proposed including a new through route from bridgend to hirwaun via rhondda as well as providing unemployment relief and connecting communities glamorgan county council hoped better access to mountain summits would provide recreation which lord temple described as a playground for all time for those people leader of opposition and labour leader ramsay macdonald was particularly keen for road to be built knowing it would be good for local economy as well as communications and he was keen to find ways of moving economy of south wales valleys away from monoculture of coal mining in addition to a4061 a4107 to and a mountain road from llyn fawr to maerdy in rhondda fach valley were planned as part of same project total estimated cost of mountain roads including neighbouring routes was around ps400 000 of which 75 was to be paid by central government and 25 by glamorgan county council

halted though pressure in parliament particularly from macdonald and sir william jenkins ensured there would be a commitment to finish road in 1928 by 1929 431 now had been spent on constructing of new road including a4107 and all connecting links bwlch y clawdd section opened at end of 1928 while rhigos road section from treherbert to hirwaun delayed by financial constraints opened on 4 november 1929 herbert morrison minister of transport visited works in 1930 and was impressed by progress and effort expended in project link road from llyn fawr to maerdy was never built recent
