pans from which he later advanced to position of domestikos of themes of west he rose in bureaucratic hierarchy until in 1321 he was appointed imperial parakoimomenos chamberlain his position made him useful to john kantakouzenos who included him in a conspiracy together with palaiologos and protostrator theodore which aimed to depose aging emperor andronikos ii palaiologos in favour of his grandson andronikos iii under threat of war emperor surrendered thrace and some districts in macedonia to rule of his grandson when andronikos iii became sole emperor in 1328 his close friend kantakouzenos became his chief minister and alexios was awarded with positions that kantakouzenos himself had formerly held head of imperial secretariat mesazon and in charge of state s finances these positions allowed him to amass a considerable personal fortune which he used to construct a personal refuge a fortified tower house at site of epibatai near selymbria at coast of sea of marmara in early 1341 shortly before andronikos s death he was rewarded with high office of megas doux giving him high command over byzantine navy he re equipped fleet paying from his own pocket 100 000 hyperpyra civil war upon andronikos s death two factions emerged at court supporters of kantakouzenos chiefly provincial magnates from macedonia and thrace and those opposed to him led mainly by patriarch john xiv kalekas who obtained support of andronikos s widow anna of savoy kantakouzenos did not claim throne for himself but demanded regency based on his close association with deceased emperor and with support of capital s troops secured it his position however was weakened by adherence of apokaukos to patriarch s camp kantakouzenos in his own account relates that apokaukos had urged him to seize throne in hopes of his own advancement and when he refused powerful chancellor switched over to his opponents camp as soon as kantakouzenos left constantinople in july 1341 to campaign against empire s enemies who were assaulting it apokaukos made his first moves although as commander of fleet it was his duty to guard dardanelles against any attempt by turks to cross into europe he deliberately allowed this to happen in order to cause disruption in thrace apokaukos tried to kidnap young john v but failed and was forced to flee to his house at epibatai however when kantakouzenos returned victorious to capital instead of depriving apokaukos of his offices and against counsel of his friends he pardoned his protege apokaukos put on an exaggerated display of deference to kantakouzenos who allowed him to resume his offices and return to constantinople while kantakouzenos left on yet another campaign thumb right 200px emperor john vi kantakouzenos r 1347 1354 apokaukos s patron and victim of his protege s ambition once back in city however patriarch and apokaukos seized power kantakouzenos s family and friends were imprisoned kantakouzenos s mother theodora would eventually die in prison and patriarch was declared regent while anna named apokaukos as urban prefect of constantinople kantakouzenos responded by having himself declared emperor at didymoteicho in october 1341 while his opponents followed with coronation of john v in november two coronations finalized split and ushered in a civil war that would byzantine empire and all of its neighbours until 1347 with kantakouzenos s victory in its course it would devastate remaining imperial possessions and create a deep rift in byzantine society aristocracy and propertied classes generally supported kantakouzenos while lower and middle classes primarily urban as well as merchants and sailors supported apokaukos and regency this gave dynastic dispute and civil war strong social overtones during war excessive wealth and perceived indifference of kantakouzenos and aristocracy towards common people became a standard fixture of apokaukos s propaganda in addition conflict acquired religious significance as well hesychast controversy divided pious byzantines and despite some important exceptions supporters of also supported kantakouzenos a few days after kantakouzenos s coronation inhabitants of adrianople rebelled against aristocracy and declared themselves for regency with apokaukos sending his younger son manuel to become city s governor in a similar development in 1342 thessalonica empire s second largest city was seized by a group known as zealots their anti aristocratic beliefs made them enemies of and earned them support of regency apokaukos himself arrived with a fleet of 70 ships to aid them and appointed his elder son john apokaukos as city s governor although latter s authority would remain only nominal in first years of war tide was in favour of regency until in summer of 1342 kantakouzenos was forced to flee to court of stefan dusan of serbia however from 1343 onwards with aid of his friend umur beg of aydin kantakouzenos began to reverse situation with initial support of stefan dusan kantakouzenos regained much of macedonia and despite his failure to take thessalonica his turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of didymoteicho in thrace gradually apokaukos s supporters abandoned him including his son manuel who deserted his post at adrianople and went over to kantakouzenos camp in early 1345 apokaukos and kalekas rejected offers of reconciliation conveyed by two franciscan friars trying to bolster his waning power apokaukos began a series of proscriptions in capital and even ordered a new prison constructed for political prisoners on 11 june 1345 apokaukos suddenly decided to inspect new prison without being escorted by his bodyguard prisoners immediately rose up and lynched him and his head was severed and stuck on a pole prisoners believed that they would be rewarded by empress anna for getting rid of hated apokaukos she however was so shocked and dismayed at loss of her principal minister that she gave apokaukos s supporters who were joined by fleet s marines free rein to avenge their leader s death as a result all prisoners some 200 in total were massacred even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery although death of apokaukos did not bring about immediate collapse of regency it removed main instigator of civil war and one of its chief protagonists and resulted in dissension and defections in regency s camp it therefore marked beginning of war s end which would come with kantakouzenos s entry into constantinople on 3 february 1347 family alexios apokaukos had two brothers john and nikephoros of whom very little is known alexios himself married twice his first wife was daughter of a priest of hagia sophia called and second whom he married sometime around 1341 cousin of megas stratopedarches georgios his first marriage produced three children and his second two john apokaukos megas and governor of thessalonica killed there in 1345 manuel apokaukos governor of adrianople defected to kantakouzenos in 1344 unnamed daughter who married first protostrator andronikos palaiologos after he drowned in 1344 she remarried sebastokrator john asan unnamed daughter married in 1341 son of patriarch john kalekas john kantakouzenos history ii 3 17 unnamed daughter married in 1341 son of one of empress anna s latin maids john kantakouzenos history ii 3 19 one of his sons married a daughter of john vatatzes assessment as a self made new man apokaukos was mistrusted by scions of aristocratic families who dominated imperial government only accounts of period of civil war kantakouzenos s memoirs and history of nikephoros gregoras with their pro aristocracy bias paint a very negative picture of man which has been adopted virtually unaltered by most modern historians as well in a dissenting view historian eva de vries van der velden believes that image of apokaukos as ungrateful protege of kantakouzenos and an inveterate schemer who was responsible for outbreak of civil war is inaccurate and largely result of distorting propaganda by kantakouzenos and gregoras however she acknowledges apokaukos as kantakouzenos s most redoubtable adversary during war and dictatorial nature of his regime after 1343 according to historian angeliki apokaukos can also be seen as exponent of a radical change in nature and direction of byzantine state in place of old agricultural empire run by a land based aristocracy he seems to have favoured a commercial maritime and likely westward looking state in emulation of italian maritime republics references sources category 1345 deaths category 14th century byzantine people category assassinated politicians category megaloi doukes category byzantine
