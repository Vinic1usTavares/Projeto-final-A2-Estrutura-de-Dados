never let me down is 17th studio album by english musician david bowie released on 20 april 1987 on label emi america bowie conceived album as foundation for a theatrical world tour writing and recording most of songs in switzerland he considered record a return to rock and roll music three singles were released from album day in day out time will crawl and never let me down which all reached uk top 40 one of bowie s better selling albums never let me down was certified gold by riaa in early july 1987 less than three months after its release date and charted in top 10 in several european countries although it only reached no 34 on us charts despite its commercial success this album was poorly received by fans and critics many of whom regard mid to late 1980s as a low point of creativity and musical integrity for bowie bowie later distanced himself from arrangement and production of finished album but also admitted a fondness for many of songs eventually remixing track time will crawl one of his favourites for inclusion on his career retrospective release iselect 2008 in support of this album bowie embarked on glass spider tour a world tour that was at that point biggest most theatrical and most elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career tour like album it supported was commercially successful but critically panned critical failure of album and tour were factors that led bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively leading him to create band tin machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances following his 1990 sound vision tour bowie did not release another solo album until black tie white noise in 1993 in july 2018 it was revealed that album would be re released as never let me down 2018 in october 2018 with a brand new production and new instrumentation overseen by producer engineer mario j mcnulty album development thumb right alt looking past a city towards a lake with mountains behind a view of montreux switzerland where bowie recorded album following rise in fame and success from his 1983 album let s dance and its subsequent serious moonlight tour bowie felt disconnected from his new found large fan base and after poor reception of tonight 1984 he was looking to make next album differently as a result bowie said he wanted to return to recording with a small rock group like he had early in his career and that he made album as a move back to rock n roll music very directly bowie felt that sound and style of his new album was reminiscent of his album scary monsters and super creeps 1980 and was less like its immediate predecessors bowie spent middle of 1986 in his home in switzerland writing songs with his friend iggy pop bowie wrote never let me down with intention of performing songs in a theatrical show he then recorded a few demos with erdal kizilcay before working on album with full band for first time since his scary monsters album bowie played instruments on record in addition to singing for some tracks on album bowie played keyboards synthesizer rhythm guitar and on two of album s tracks new york s in love and 87 and cry he played lead guitar album took three months to write and record it was recorded at mountain studios in montreux switzerland and power station studios in manhattan new york according to album musician erdal kizilcay they used to start at about 10 in morning an finish in evening about 8 o clock while recording album adding that bowie was very disciplined while recording album and was always trying something new bowie acknowledged that songs on album lacked a cohesive musical style which he claimed reflected his eclectic musical tastes at time and stated that album was a reflection of all styles of writing i ve used over last few years song development bowie wrote album s lead track day in day out because of his concern about treatment of homeless in us and he wanted to make a statement about it some networks banned song s video which bowie found ludicrous this track was also lead single for album a version of song sung in spanish was recorded to promote bowie s first ever concerts in spain during his glass spider tour was released for first time in 2007 when day in day out ep was released digitally time will crawl which bowie named as his favourite track from album was inspired by events from chernobyl disaster and idea that someone from one s own neighborhood could be responsible for end of world during production of album track was titled how we war but was changed before album was released bowie said his vocals on this song owed a lot to neil young and noted that variety of voices he used on album were a nod to musicians who had influenced him in past bowie pre recorded a performance of song for bbc show top of pops although it was not aired at time as single subsequently fell down charts this track was second single released from album title track never let me down is about bowie s long time personal assistant coco schwab bowie wrote song as a direct reference to his relationship with coco as a counterpoint to rest of songs on album which he felt were mostly allegorical song whose name was originally isolation was last one written for album written and recorded in one day during last week of mixing album at new york s power station studios bowie attributed his vocal performance on this track to john lennon bowie s performance of this song for top of pops was shown on first airing of us version of show this track was re recorded and released as third single from album one reviewer later called it one of bowie s most underrated songs bowie called song beat of your drum a lolita song a reflection on young girls christ she s only 14 years old but jail s worth it bowie biographer nicholas pegg who called song one of better tracks on album noted that beat of your drum could be called a direct ancestor both lyrically and musically to tin machine s 1991 song you belong in rock n roll song zeroes which rolling stone magazine called most heartening and successful track on album is according to bowie a nostalgia trip i wanted to put in every 60s cliche i could think of stopping and preaching and letting love in all those things i hope there s a humorous undertone to it but subtext is definitely that trappings of rock are not what they re made out to be track glass spider is a kind of mythological story based on a documentary bowie had seen about black widow spiders that said that spiders lay skeletons of their prey out on their webs bowie also thought that glass spider s web would make a good enclosure for tour thus giving supporting tour its name and stage dressing actor mickey rourke asked bowie to be involved in one of songs two having met in london where rourke was based while filming movie a prayer for dying bowie had him perform mid song rap to song shining star makin my love bowie jokingly referred to rourke s performance as method rapping bowie described song as one that reflects back to street situations and how people are trying to get together in face of so many disasters and catastrophes socially around them never knowing if they re going to survive it themselves one thing they have got to cling on to is each other although it might resolve into something terrible it s only thing that they ve got it s just a little love song coming out of that environment he rejected notion that his high little voice which he attributed to smokey robinson in song was a new character to follow behind ziggy stardust or thin white duke instead saying it was just what song needed as he had tried song in his regular voice and did not like outcome that never bothered me changing voices to suit a song you can fool about with it shining star was one of bowie s early choices to be a single for album but emi had final say and did not release song as a single a 12 remix of song was made available on itunes when never let me down ep was released digitally in 2007 bowie called new york s in love a sarcastic song about vanity of big cities pegg would later call this song a strong contender for wooden spoon of album bowie originally wrote song 87 cry as a statement about margaret thatcher who was prime minister of united kingdom at time song referred to distinction between authoritarian government and citizens dogs and bowie admitted that lyrics verged on surreal describing people eating energies of others to get to what they wanted track was released as b side to album s third single never let me down too dizzy was first song bowie and new collaborator kizilcay wrote together for album and was written in homage to 50s bowie said a real fifties subject matter was either love or jealousy so i thought i d stick with jealousy because it s a lot more interesting bowie at time called song a throwaway and seemed surprised that he included it on album song has been deleted from subsequent reissues of never let me down despite bowie s dislike for song emi briefly considered it for release as a fourth single from album and in fact it did appear as a promo release in us when asked about his choice of including iggy pop s song bang bang on album instead of perhaps co writing a new song bowie stated iggy s done so many good songs that people never get to hear i think it s one of his best songs bang bang and it hasn t been heard and now it might be bang bang was released as a promotional cd single in 1987 overall bowie summed up album after it was released in 1987 as an effort to reestablish what i used to do which was a guitar oriented album i think next album will be even more so his follow up effort was to be guitar oriented rock band album tin machine 1989 critical reception initial sales of album were strong but dropped off disappointingly as contemporary reviews of album were mixed critic ira robbins wrote although this casual loud rock outing seems on first blush to be slapdash and slight first side is actually quite good offering provocative pop culture lyrics delivered with first take enthusiasm and carefree backing in 1987 spin magazine called album an inspired and brilliantly crafted work it s charged with a positive spirit that makes art soul food imbued with contagious energy that gives ideas a leg to dance on but in 1989 a different reviewer for magazine called album disappointing rolling stone magazine called work an odd freewheeling pastiche of elements from all previous unfocused and possibly noisiest bowie album ever being noisy and sloppy isn t necessarily a bad thing but sad to say never let me down is also something of a mess another critic held a general optimism for potential of songs on album complaining only that oppressive production ruined songs billboard magazine s 1987 retrospective issue called never let me down arguably year s most underrated release and considered album a critic s choice for year bowie was not concerned with album s relative poor performance in charts saying i ve made about 20 albums during my career and so far this is my third biggest seller so i can t be that disappointed yet it is a letdown that it hasn t been as buoyant as it should be but i don t really feel that negative about it as far as i m concerned it s one of better albums i ve made as i ve said never let down has been a pretty big seller for me so i m quite happy despite growing criticism in press bowie said that never let me down was one of most enjoyable and energetic albums he had made in a long time public image bowie having just turned 40 year album was released was a common sight on magazine covers during year he appeared alongside tina turner on cover of in fashion magazine to tagline forever cool musician magazine and on cover of rolling stone s us 20th anniversary style issue part of a series of contemporary photographs of bowie taken by photographer herb ritts articles about bowie s album and tour appeared inside such teen oriented publications such as mademoiselle and teen magazines former calling bowie a leading candidate for coolest character in rock bowie was chosen as one of top male pop stars of year 1987 in billboard s end of year retrospective issue live performances thumb left alt an image of a stage with a giant luminescent spider overhead its body glowing green its head glowing red and its legs glowing blue below spider tiny human forms can be see on stage bowie bottom center on stage in berlin in support of never let me down bowie knew he d be taking this album on tour and in early interviews said i m going to do a stage thing this year which i m incredibly excited about cause i m gonna take a chance again but when pressed for details he refused to give up any saying i ll just be doing what i always did which is keeping things interesting bowie performed several of album s songs during a press tour that preceded his highly theatrical glass spider tour which played to a combined audience of as many as six million fans bowie wanted to produce a live show that picked up where his aborted 1974 diamond dogs tour left off although considered financially successful and well attended tour itself was critically dismissed bowie designed his next few tours specifically to avoid problems that glass spider tour was criticized for by avoiding overly theatrical stage presentations and focusing on his music despite criticism bowie maintained that performing on this tour was most fun he had had on tour up to that point in his career legacy initially after album s release bowie was excited to return to studio to record more material having written more songs than were recorded for album he said he wanted to record more experimental music referring to his work in 1970s with brian eno he discussed re recording some of never let me downs tracks on his next album with future collaborator reeves gabrels but gabrels talked him out of it ultimately due to poor critical reception of album and subsequent tour bowie put those plans on hold and instead formed his rock band tin machine which he used to rejuvenate himself creatively and artistically his view on album soured as years passed in 1990 during interviews for his sound vision tour bowie commented that he felt like he was in a mire while making this album and expressed disappointment at having lost good songs by allowing album s production to give songs too much of a session man feel a year later while working with tin machine on their second album he mused on his previous few albums you can tell i was terribly unhappy in late 80s i was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance it was an awful trip 1983 84 85 86 87 those five years were simply dreadful never let me down had good songs that i mistreated i didn t really apply myself i wasn t quite sure what i was supposed to be doing i wish there had been someone around who could have told me in 1993 while doing press tours for his album black tie white noise bowie acknowledged that while album sold more than any of his previous albums except let s dance he felt that while making it he had almost lost his interest in making music altogether he elaborated in end i didn t lose songs but i lost sound i literally threw them away by giving them to very good people to arrange but not being involved myself almost to point of indifference in 1995 bowie spoke more at length about how he felt his creativity and music had suffered after success of let s dance no song from this album was performed on any of bowie s tours after 1987 bowie revisited idea of re recording tracks from album in late 1980s 1990s and 2000s a project which came to fruition in 2018 with release of never let me down 2018 two years after bowie s death

met in late 1987 and considered putting some of them on his next album but gabrels talked him out of it suggesting it was too soon to do so bowie discussed recording some of tracks from never let me down with gabrels again in 1996 prior to going into studio to make his album earthling 1997 but no tracks were recorded bowie had mario j mcnulty remix track time will crawl in 2008 for his compilation of self selected favourite songs iselect and later included same mix on his career spanning 50th anniversary compilation nothing has changed at time bowie had said oh to redo rest of that album and according to parlophone label in 2018 that was beginning of desire to reimagine album in early 2018 musicians including reeves gabrels david torn sterling campbell tim lefebvre nico muhly and laurie anderson started recording in new york s electric lady studios to help fulfill that wish of these musicians torn campbell lefebvre and gabrels were all selected by bowie before he died in 2016 to take a part in project in july 2018 it was announced that a new version of album titled never let me down 2018 would be released in october of that year album includes newly remixed artwork unseen images from original album s photo shoot by photographer greg gorman and was released as part of 2018 box set loving alien 1983 1988 mcnulty used experience of making mm remix of time will crawl with bowie to influence his approach for producing this version of album he received master tapes from label and kept all of bowie s vocals some of original acoustic guitars and anything distinctive about song such as alomar s rhythm guitar on never let me down and frampton s sitar on zeroes he sent rough mixes called stems to each musician as a baseline along with ideas of what they should record each musician recorded their parts separately and were not typically in studio together although torn and gabrels did record together for one day at one point for day in day out mcnulty discovered that bowie had recorded borneo horns stanley harrison lenny pickett steve elson and arif mardin playing live but had at some point replaced them with synthesized horns mcnulty restored live horns in new version new version of song has one foot in past and another in present saying it was difficult most of lyrics are quite dark but everything else about it is almost uplifting i just thought it makes sense to do something bright for new york s in love gabrels wanted new recording to reflect change in new york saying new york isn t really about blues anymore it s more multicultural i wanted to reflect that change with what i did played i told mario put up that song and let me see what happens i soloed through whole song and tried different things and i reacted to what was going on when song ended mario looked at me and said well that one s done then laughs mcnulty replaced a lot of synthesizer parts throughout album with strings saying there were a lot of random synthesizers from labyrinth department lurking in background i was pretty confident i could do a lot of that work with strings shining star was particularly hard for mcnulty original programming is a mess and rap comes out of nowhere i was just trying to find right elements to fit song luckily i know david and laurie anderson were good friends and she said yes to this recording new vocals for song and it was really great of her original musicians alomar and kizilcay were not part of reproduction alomar approved of changes to album but kizilcay was unhappy with new arrangements and threatened a lawsuit as a result after album was released in 2018 mcnulty suggested that he might try remixing some of other songs from era including b sides julie and girls but added too dizzy that s not gonna happen release of box set was preceded by digital release of single zeroes 2018 radio edit in july 2018 and a physical 7 single in september 2018 backed with a radio edit of 2018 version of beat of your drum
