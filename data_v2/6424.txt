hms neptune was an ironclad turret ship originally designed and built in britain for brazil but acquired for royal navy in 1878 modifications to suit royal navy took three years to complete and ship did not begin her first commission until 1883 with channel fleet she was transferred to mediterranean fleet in 1885 but refitted in portsmouth in 1886 87 neptune then became coastguard ship for 1st class reserve at holyhead until 1893 when she was placed in reserve in portsmouth while she was being towed to breakers in 1903 neptune unintentionally rammed then serving as a training hulk for naval signal school collided with and narrowly missed several other ships she was scrapped in germany in 1904 design and description thumb left right elevation and deck plan with masts truncated as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1888 hms neptune was designed by sir edward reed for brazilian navy in 1872 as a masted version of a larger sea going version of breastwork monitors and was given provisional name independencia adding masts however meant adding a forecastle at bow and a poop deck at stern to provide space required for masts and rigging these blocked firing arcs of gun turrets so that they were deprived of axial fire which was original design s greatest virtue ship resembled instead an enlarged version of parkes p 277 during russo turkish war of 1877 78 tensions dramatically escalated between russia and great britain as latter feared that victorious russian armies would occupy turkish capital of constantinople something that british were not prepared to tolerate they mobilized much of royal navy in case war did break out and purchased a number of ironclads under construction including independencia in 1878 brazilians sold ship for ps600 000 nearly twice as much as ps370 000 paid for devastation a few years earlier another ps89 172 was spent to bring her up to standards of royal navy parkes pp 267 276 77 in british service she was deemed a white elephant being a thoroughly bad ship in most respects unlucky full of inherent faults and small vices and at times a danger to her own consorts neptune was long between perpendiculars she had a beam of and a draft of ship normally displaced and at deep load burt p 22 neptune proved a poor as she was wet difficult to manoeuvre and a heavy roller she had a skylight over wardroom which as a result often flooded while ship was at sea parkes p 280 propulsion neptune had one 2 cylinder trunk steam engine made by john penn and sons driving a single propeller eight rectangular boilers provided steam to engine at a working pressure of engine had a total designed output of but produced a total of during sea trials in february 1878 which gave neptune a maximum speed of ship carried of coal enough to steam at even though sir george tryon described her as a weak ship in her engines and consuming a coal mine daily parkes pp 276 279 neptune was barque rigged but her twin funnels were so close to mainmast that sails and rigging rapidly deteriorated in service mast was eventually stripped of sails and yards so that ship only used fore and mizzen masts an unsightly combination described as like a half dressed harlot during her 1886 refit ship s masts and rigging were replaced by simple pole masts with fighting tops at fore and mizzen positions only parkes p 279 80 armament brazilians had ordered four whitworth for gun turrets and a pair of breech loading guns as chase guns but these were replaced in british service hms neptune mounted a pair of muzzle loading rifles in each turret and two rifled muzzle loading guns in forecastle as chase guns these guns only traverse 45deg to side ship also had six 20 pounder armstrong guns for use as saluting guns two torpedo tubes were mounted on main deck one on each side for whitehead torpedoes parkes p 278 shell of 16 calibre 12 5 inch gun weighed while gun itself weighed it had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at muzzle 14 calibre 9 inch gun weighed and fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of it was credited with nominal ability to penetrate armour gardiner p 6 muzzle blast of main guns was more than deck immediately below muzzles could stand and full charge for guns was reduced from of powder to minimize damage armour neptune had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick amidships and thinned to and then to in steps at ends of ship armour extended above waterline and below it an armoured citadel long protected bases of gun turrets funnel uptakes and ventilation shafts for engines and boilers sides of citadel were 10 inches thick and it was closed off by transverse bulkheads thick chase guns at bow were protected by a patch of armour gardiner p 25 faces of turrets were thick while sides were thick they were backed by of teak armoured deck was outside citadel and 2 inches thick inside it neptune was provided with a conning tower protected by 6 8 inches of armour situated right in front of foremast it could be regarded as first adequately installed conning position installed in a british ironclad parkes pp 278 service hms neptune was laid down in 1873 for brazilian navy under name of independencia by j w dudgeon in cubitt town london shipyard attempted to launch her on 16 july 1874 but she stuck fast and did not budge a second attempt was made on 30 july during which ship got about one third down slipway and stuck extensively damaging her bottom plating she was finally launched on 10 september after she had been lightened and she was towed to samuda brothers for repairs and fitting out cost of accident resulted in bankruptcy of in 1875 independencia ran her sea trials in december 1877 and purchased by royal navy in march 1878 and renamed neptune after roman god of sea silverstone p 253 she was then taken to portsmouth for alterations to her armament and other equipment that took until 3 september 1881 to complete neptune was
