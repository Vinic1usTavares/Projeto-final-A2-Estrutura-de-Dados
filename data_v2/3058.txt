which used machine aesthetic of futurism and influence of cubism to great effect his fellow artist walter sickert wrote at time that nevinson s painting la mitrailleuse will probably remain most authoritative and concentrated utterance on war in history of painting in 1917 nevinson was appointed an official war artist but he was no longer finding modernist styles adequate for describing horrors of modern war and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner nevinson s later world war one paintings based on short visits to western front lacked same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him one of most famous young artists working in england shortly after end of war nevinson travelled to united states of america where he painted a number of powerful images of new york however his boasting and exaggerated claims of his war experiences together with his depressive and temperamental personality made him many enemies in both us and britain

post war career however was not so distinguished nevinson s 1937 memoir paint and prejudice although lively and colourful is in parts inaccurate inconsistent and misleading biography early life

they formed for a short while a group known as neo primitives being deeply influenced by art of early renaissance gertler and nevinson subsequently fell out when they both fell in love with carrington whilst at slade nevinson was advised by professor of drawing henry tonks to abandon thoughts of an artistic career this led to a lifelong bitterness between two and frequent accusations by nevinson who had something of a persecution complex that tonks was behind several imagined conspiracies against him thumb study for returning to trenches drawn between 1914 15 after leaving slade nevinson

a period which included start of battle of passchendaele on 31 july nevinson was billeted with other visitors in chateau d harcourt south of caen although life at chateau allowed nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to other visitors he soon transferred to 4th infantry division near arras from there he moved widely along front visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries he flew with royal flying corps and came under anti aircraft fire he spent a night in an observation balloon above somme making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy

lithographs on subject of building aircraft for war propaganda bureau portfolio of pictures britain s efforts and ideals and then spent seven months in his hampstead studio working up his sketches from front into finished pieces a number of officials from department of information visited studio and soon began complaining about these new works nevinson was now focused on individuals either as people displaying heroic qualities or as victims of warfare he did this by painting in a realistic manner using a limited colour palette sometimes only mud brown or khaki whereas for his 1916 exhibition nevinson had displayed both realistic works and pieces using cubist and futurist techniques for his 1918 exhibition all works were realistic in style and composition not only did department of information art advisors consider these new works dull but war office censors also objected to three of paintings nevinson was quite happy to reverse direction of traffic in painting road from arras to bapaume but was not prepared to compromise over other two paintings censor objected to a group of soldiers on grounds that type of man represented is not worthy of british army amid sarcasm and vitriol of nevinson s response he did make point that soldiers in painting were sketched from a group home on leave from front that he had encountered on london underground canvas was eventually passed for display not so paths of glory nevinson s painting of two fallen british soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire told at beginning of 1918 that painting would not be passed for exhibition

a single large artwork for a proposed but never built hall of remembrance he was offered an honorary commission as a second lieutenant but refused fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties a short visit over a long weekend to western front was arranged but without a commission nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he went and his movements were restricted nevinson quickly fell out with army minder assigned to him in france and claimed he was refused permission to visit casualty stations he wanted to sketch in while on trip he did sketch a line of walking wounded and some prisoners making their way to rear from an early morning offensive this became basis of painting harvest of battle which was largest single work nevinson painted it was completed in february 1919 and nevinson arranged a private view of painting in his studio on 2 april for numerous critics and journalists whilst this produced some favourable reviews notably in daily express it also led to articles claiming that painting was so grim that it was being withheld from public when painting was shown at huge nation s war paintings and drawings exhibition organised by imperial war museum in december 1919 at burlington house nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in main room but rather in a side gallery he began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult unreasonable as outrage was it did have consequences it destroyed his friendship with muirhead bone who had been on organising committee for exhibition made imperial war museum wary of dealing with him and blinded nevinson himself to high esteem in which his war paintings were held post war career thumb after push 1917 art iwm art 519 nevinson alongside edward elgar and h g wells represented british culture at celebrations of first anniversary of republic of czechoslovakia in prague in 1919 nevinson first visited new york in may 1919 and spent a month there while his world war one prints were being shown to great acclaim at frederick keppel co gallery a second exhibition at same venue in october 1920 was poorly received this led to nevinson becoming disillusioned with new york to extent he changed name of his painting new york an abstraction to soul of soulless city nevinson claimed to have been first artist to depict new york in a modernist style but in fact several british avant garde artists had painted in city before world war one in may 1919 while nevinson was in america kathleen nevinson gave birth to a baby son but child died shortly later and before his father could return to britain nevinson s boasting and exaggerated claims concerning his war experiences together with his depressive and temperamental personality made him many enemies in both us and britain roger fry of bloomsbury group was a particularly virulent critic in 1920 critic charles lewis hind observed in his catalogue introduction to an exhibition of nevinson s recent work it is something at age of thirty one to be among most discussed most successful most promising most admired and most hated british artists in september 1920 nevinson designed a

generally well received most notable of these is strand by night from 1937 his post war work generally included landscapes in a more naturalist style his large painting of 1932 and 1933 twentieth century used futurist devices to attack fascism and nazism he also produced large historic allegories which were considered inferior to his world war one paintings kenneth clark then director of national gallery made some comments on these lines and in return nevinson became a fierce critic of clark nevinson was awarded chevalier of legion d honneur in 1938 and was made an associate of royal academy in 1939 world war two thumb anti aircraft defences 1940 art iwm art at start of world war two british government created war artists advisory committee waac and appointed kenneth clark as its
