a nautical chronometer made by thomas earnshaw 1749 1828 and once part of equipment of hms beagle ship that carried charles darwin on his voyage around world is held in british museum chronometer was subject of one episode of bbc s series a history of world in 100 objects meticulous naval inventories show that hms beagle carried a total of at least 34 recorded chronometers on its three main survey voyages from 1826 to 1843 and 22 on second voyage with darwin on board when they had a dedicated cabin some were navy property and others were on loan from manufacturers as well as six on second voyage owned by captain robert fitzroy both two known survivors from second voyage are owned by british museum second is registration no cai 1743 background nautical chronometers were of great importance in 18th and 19th centuries as aids to navigation accurate measurement of time was needed for determination of longitude earnshaw was not first to make such chronometers but he was one of first to make them cheaply enough that they started to become essential equipment for a ship at sea by time beagle set sail it was being reported in nautical magazine that price of chronometers was dropping rapidly while same quality was being maintained nautical magazine 1833 p 74 chronometer had a novel escapement mechanism spring detent escapement and a bimetallic strip for temperature compensation so that it would continue to maintain accuracy in all climates around world british museum page on object beagle s chronometers beagle was sent in 1831 on a survey mission which involved circumnavigating globe a journey which lasted until 1836 and described by naturalist on board ship charles darwin in his book voyage of beagle it was on this journey that darwin began forming ideas published much later as on origin of species beagle carried twenty two chronometers taylor p p 201 reports 21 nicholas p 5 agrees 22 darwin in taylor p 35 reports 24 an unusually large number but necessary to ensure accuracy of survey three would have been commonplace on ships of time as this is minimum number required to easily identify one that has gone faulty admiralty started a general issue of chronometers to h m ships from 1825 but between about 1800 and 1840 availability could not keep up with demand admiralty therefore only issued one chronometer to each ship unless captain personally owned one in those cases admiralty would issue another to take total to three reasoning that a ship with two was no better off than with one since a faulty instrument could not be identified gould p 131 beagle however would be gone for several years and was required to take chronometers ashore and in boat expeditions up rivers to determine coordinates of specific reference points as instructed by admiralty it could not be guaranteed that any one chronometer would continue to function accurately or even survive journey at all nicholas and nicholas pp 5 6 and plates between p 74 and p 75 each chronometer was mounted on gimbals to keep it level in all sea conditions and whole assembly fixed inside a hinged wooden box for protection for additional protection they were stored in sawdust in a special cabin in captain s quarters only crew who needed to take measurements or who maintained them were allowed access measures which indicate importance attached to these instruments beagle voyage succeeded for first time in establishing a linked chain of reference points around globe of known longitude which could be used by subsequent voyages to calibrate their own chronometers taylor pp 34 35 nicholas and nicholas pp 5 6 maintenance and accuracy chronometers were maintained by an instrument maker one george james stebbing whose salary was paid for personally by captain of vessel robert fitzroy fitzroy considered post to be essential to mission but admiralty had refused to pay for it fitzroy bore cost himself as he did for much of ship s equipment but admiralty did concede that stebbing could be fed from ship s rations this concession was not extended to darwin who paid ps500 for his own keep macdonald p 14 by using his chronometers to measure time of local noon when he returned to his home port fitzroy was able to measure overall accuracy of entire voyage as he sailed west local noon occurred progressively later until finally when he had circumnavigated globe shift in local noon time as measured by his chronometers should be exactly twenty four hours in fact fitzroy s measurements exceeded this by 33 seconds which is equivalent to just this was impressive for a journey of tens of thousands of miles over five years nevertheless fitzroy considered error to be inexplicably large king p 345 history thumb page from greenwich observatory s ledger for earnshaw chronometer no 509 thomas earnshaw s marine chronometer no 509 was manufactured around 1800 and served on a number of royal navy ships william edward parry while exploring baffin bay in july 1819 during his first attempt to find northwest passage mentions that earnshaw s chronometer had been used in 1818 to determine longitude of a spot to within of his own measurement he does not however say which ship it was on board parry pp 26 27 at this early time all royal navy purchased chronometers were issued by greenwich observatory who also checked their rates and sent them out for cleaning between voyages initially greenwich issued chronometers directly to ships but later as chronometers became more common they were sent from greenwich to other royal navy ports and dockyards for issue locally first recorded issue from greenwich was 3 july 1823 to captain frederick marryat in command of hms larne larne took part in first anglo burmese war which lasted from 1824 to 1826 naval operations of burmese war united service journal 1832 part 1 pp 10 27 london henry colburn and richard bentley chronometer was returned to greenwich 6 february 1826 and then sent to its makers for servicing it did not come back to greenwich for nearly two years on 4 march 1828 it was issued to captain j bolder in command of hms hecla at this time hecla was a famous ship under command of george francis lyon she had been part of parry s second expedition to find northwest passage over 6 000 members of public visited ship at deptford while she waited to set out on parry s third expedition in 1824 attempt ended in 1825 after leading ship hms fury was abandoned due to ice damage parry used hecla again in an 1827 attempt to reach north pole parry unwillingly gave up hecla when admiralty sent her to survey west african coast under command of bolder in july 1830 chronometer was returned from hecla and went for cleaning to robert molyneux in london it was returned to greenwich in november but not immediately issued to another ship british museum database 1958 1006 p paine hms hecla ships of world an historical encyclopedia pp 237 238 houghton mifflin

was issued to captain stokes in command of hms beagle it sailed with captain fitzroy on beagles famous second voyage and was returned to greenwich 7 november 1836 after a period at arnold and dent for cleaning it was transported by hms lightning to devonport or portsmouth for issue to ships there it was returned to greenwich 17 november 1841 and after another service by arnold and dent was issued to hms formidable on 13 january 1842 it stayed with formidable until 20 november 1845 when it was returned to greenwich it was then serviced by charles frodsham and sent for issue to ships at portsmouth it was transported back to greenwich periodically by royal navy ships for service by frodsham hms rattlesnake 11 march 1850 hms odin 27 december 1854 and finally returned from portsmouth 7 may 1857 final ship to be issued chronometer was hms pembroke who received it 20 april 1858 pembroke returned chronometer to greenwich 1 february 1867 greenwich ledger pp 165 and andrewes p 193 use on shore after serving on pembroke chronometer stayed with frodsham for over six months greenwich issued it to meteorological committee of royal society on 25 november 1867 meteorological committee used chronometer for observations at falmouth observatory it was returned to greenwich on 3 november 1886 and sent to j poole for servicing 22 november 1886 poole returned chronometer on 13 december 1886 declaring it to be beyond economic repair it was given to e dent co on 16 july 1888 in part exchange for chronometer dent it was later acquired by private collector courtenay adrian ilbert after his death in 1956 ilbert s collection was put up for auction in 1958 auction was cancelled however and collection purchased by british museum following a private donation of funds greenwich ledger p 1126
