cyathus is a genus of fungi in nidulariaceae a family collectively known as bird s nest fungi they are given this name since they resemble tiny bird s nests filled with eggs structures large enough to have been mistaken in past for seeds however these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores eggs or peridioles are firmly attached to inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus 45 species are widely distributed throughout world and some are found in most countries although a few exist in only one or two locales cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of european countries species of cyathus are also known as splash cups which refers to fact that falling raindrops can knock peridioles out of open cup fruit body internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally referred to as plicate or striate this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species generally considered inedible cyathus species are saprobic since they obtain nutrients from decomposing organic matter they usually grow on decaying wood or woody debris on cow and horse dung or directly on humus rich soil life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually with meiosis and asexually via spores several cyathus species produce bioactive compounds some with medicinal properties and several lignin degrading enzymes from genus may be useful in bioremediation and agriculture phylogenetic analysis is providing new insights into evolutionary relationships between various species in cyathus and has cast doubt on validity of older classification systems that are based on traditional taxonomic characteristics history bird s nest fungi were first mentioned by flemish botanist carolus clusius in rariorum plantarum historia 1601 over next couple of centuries these fungi were subject of some controversy regarding whether peridioles were seeds and mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature for example french botanist jean jacques paulet in his work traite des 1790 3 proposed erroneous notion that peridioles were ejected from fruit bodies by some sort of spring mechanism brodie 1975 p 15 genus was established in 1768 by swiss scientist albrecht von haller generic name cyathus is latin but originally derived from ancient greek word meaning cup structure and biology of genus cyathus was better known by mid 19th century starting with appearance in 1842 of a paper by carl johann friedrich schmitz and two years later a monograph by brothers louis rene and charles tulasne work of was thorough and accurate and was highly regarded by later researchers subsequently monographs were written in 1902 by violet s white on american species curtis gates lloyd in 1906 gordon herriot cunningham in 1924 on new zealand species and harold j brodie in 1975 brodie bird s nest fungi description species in genus cyathus have fruit bodies peridia that are vase trumpet or urn shaped with dimensions of 4 8 mm wide by 7 18 mm tall fruit bodies are brown to gray brown in color and covered with small hair like structures on outer surface some species like c striatus and c setosus have conspicuous bristles called setae on rim of cup fruit body is often expanded at base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of underlying growing surface improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain brodie 1975 pp 5 7 thumb left cyathus striatus a young and mature fruit bodies in longitudinal section b c single peridiole entire and in section immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane an that covers peridium opening when young but eventually dehisces breaking open during maturation viewed with a microscope peridium of cyathus species is made of three distinct layers endo meso and ectoperidium referring to inner middle and outer layers respectively while surface of ectoperidium in cyathus is usually hairy endoperidial surface is smooth and depending on species may have longitudinal grooves striations because basic fruit body structure in all genera of nidulariaceae family is essentially similar cyathus may be readily confused with species of nidula or crucibulum especially older weathered specimens of cyathus that may have hairy ectoperidium worn off brodie 1975 p 147 it distinguished from nidula by presence of a funiculus a cord of hyphae attaching peridiole to endoperidium cyathus differs from genus crucibulum by having a distinct three layered wall and a more intricate funiculus peridiole structure thumb right a peridiole and attached funiculus in cross section derived from greek word meaning small leather pouch alexopolous et al 1996 p 545 peridiole is egg of bird s nest it is a mass of basidiospores and glebal tissue enclosed by a hard and waxy outer shell shape may be described as lenticular like a lens and depending on species may range in color from whitish to grayish to black interior chamber of peridiole contains a hymenium that is made of basidia sterile non reproductive structures and spores in young freshly opened fruit bodies peridioles lie in a clear gelatinous substance which soon dries brodie 1975 p 6 peridioles are attached to fruit body by a funiculus a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions basal piece which attaches it to inner wall of peridium middle piece and an upper sheath called purse connected to lower surface of peridiole in purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called funicular cord attached at one end to peridiole and at other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called hapteron in some species peridioles may be covered by a tunica a thin white membrane particularly evident in c striatus and c crassimurus brodie 1975 p 129 spores typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape and are thick walled hyaline or light yellow brown in color with dimensions of 5 15 by 5 8 um habitat and distribution fruit bodies typically grow in clusters and are found on dead or decaying wood or on woody fragments in cow or horse dung dung loving coprophilous species include c stercoreus c costatus c fimicola and c pygmaeus brodie 1975 pp 102 3 some species have been collected on woody material like dead herbaceous stems empty shells or husks of nuts or on fibrous material like coconut jute or hemp fiber woven into matting sacks or cloth brodie 1975 p 105 in nature fruit bodies are usually found in moist partly shaded sites such as edges of woods on trails or around lighted openings in forests they are less frequently found growing in dense vegetation and deep mosses as these environments would interfere with dispersal of peridioles by falling drops of water brodie 1975 p 101 appearance of fruit bodies is largely dependent upon features of immediate growing environment specifically optimum conditions of temperature moisture and nutrient availability are more important factors for fruit rather than broad geographical area in which fungi are located or season examples of ability of cyathus to thrive in somewhat inhospitable environments are provided by c striatus and c stercoreus which can survive drought and cold of winter in temperate north america and species c helenae which has been found growing on dead alpine plants at an altitude of left thumb cyathus poeppigii a tropical species in general species of cyathus have a worldwide distribution but are only rarely found in arctic and subarctic brodie 1975 p 150 one of best known species c striatus has a circumpolar distribution and is commonly found throughout temperate locations while morphologically similar c poeppigii is widely spread in tropical areas rarely in subtropics and never in temperate regions brodie 1975 p 116 majority of species are native to warm climates for example although 20 different species have been reported from united states and canada only 8 are commonly encountered on other hand 25 species may be regularly found in west indies and hawaiian islands alone have 11 species brodie 1975 p 117 some species seem to be endemic to certain regions such as c novae zeelandiae found in new zealand or c crassimurus found only in hawaii however this apparent endemism may just be a result of a lack of collections rather than a difference in habitat that constitutes a barrier to spread although widespread in tropics and most of temperate world c stercoreus is only rarely found in europe this has resulted in its appearance on a number of red lists for example it is considered endangered in bulgaria denmark and montenegro and near threatened in great britain discovery of a cyathus species in dominican amber c suggests that basic form of bird s nest fungi had already evolved by cretaceous era and that group had diversified by mid cenozoic life cycle life cycle of genus cyathus which contains both haploid and diploid stages is typical of taxa in basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually via vegetative spores or sexually with meiosis like other wood decay fungi this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases vegetative stage for spread of mycelia and reproductive stage for establishment of spore producing structures fruit bodies vegetative stage encompasses those phases of life cycle involved with germination spread and survival of mycelium spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature and grow into branching filaments called hyphae pushing out like roots into rotting wood these hyphae are homokaryotic containing a single nucleus in each compartment they increase in length by adding cell wall material to a growing tip as these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points a network called mycelium develops mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and synthesis of hyphal biomass when two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate like rotting wood include suitable humidity and nutrient availability majority of cyathus species are saprobic so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides such as cellulose and lignin into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients deacon 2005 pp 231 4 after a period of time and under appropriate environmental conditions dikaryotic mycelia may enter reproductive stage of life cycle fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season which affects temperature and air humidity nutrients and light as fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing basidia upon which new basidiospores are made young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse and resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores each containing a single haploid nucleus deacon 2005 pp 31 2 dikaryotic mycelia from which fruit bodies are produced is long lasting and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as environmental conditions are favorable thumb left cyathus stercoreus development of cyathus fruit bodies has been studied in laboratory culture cyathus stercoreus has been used most often for these studies due to ease with which it may be grown experimentally in 1958 e garnett first demonstrated that development and form of fruit bodies is at least partially dependent on intensity of light it receives during development for example exposure of mycelium to light is required for fruit to occur and furthermore this light needs to be at a wavelength of less than 530 nm continuous light is not required for fruit body development after mycelium has reached a certain stage of maturity only a brief exposure to light is necessary and fruit bodies will form if even subsequently kept in dark lu suggested in 1965 that certain growing conditions such as a shortage in available nutrients shifts fungus metabolism to produce a hypothetical photoreceptive precursor that enables growth of fruit bodies to be stimulated and affected by light fungi is also positively that is it will orient its fruit bodies in direction of light source brodie 1975 pp 57 8 time required to develop fruit bodies depends on a number of factors such as temperature or availability and type of nutrients but in general most species that do fruit in laboratory culture do so best at about 25 degc in from 18 to 40 days brodie 1975 p 48 spore dispersal like other bird s nest fungi in nidulariaceae species of cyathus have their spores dispersed when water falls into fruit body fruit body is shaped so that kinetic energy of a fallen raindrop is redirected upward and slightly outward by angle of cup wall which is consistently 70 75deg with horizontal brodie 1975 p 89 action ejects peridioles out of so called splash cup where it may break and spread spores within or be eaten and dispersed by animals after passing through digestive tract this method of spore dispersal in nidulariaceae was tested experimentally by george willard martin in 1924 and later elaborated by arthur henry reginald buller who used cyathus striatus as model species to experimentally investigate phenomenon buller s major conclusions about spore dispersal were later summarized by his graduate student harold j brodie with whom he conducted several of these splash cup experiments raindrops cause peridioles of nidulariaceae to be thrown about four feet by splash action in genus cyathus as a peridiole is jerked out of its cup funiculus is torn and this makes possible expansion of a mass of adhesive hyphae hapteron which clings to any object in line of flight momentum of peridiole causes a long cord to be pulled out of a sheath attached to peridiole peridiole is checked in flight and jerk causes funicular cord to become wound around stems or entangled among plant hairs thus peridiole becomes attached to vegetation and may be eaten subsequently by herbivorous animals although it has not been shown experimentally if spores can survive passage through an animal s digestive tract regular presence of cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true alexopolous et al 1996 p 555 alternatively hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time eventually releasing spores within bioactive compounds a number of species of cyathus produce metabolites with biological activity and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus for example cyathins are compounds produced by c helenae c africanus and c earlei several of cyathins especially cyathins b3 and c3 including compounds from c striatus show strong antibiotic activity cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis and have potential to be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s disease compounds named isolated from mycelial liquid culture of c stercoreus have significant antioxidant activity as do compounds known as also from c stercoreus various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in c bulleri including derived from and various cyathus species have antifungal activity against human pathogens such as aspergillus fumigatus candida albicans and cryptococcus extracts of c striatus have inhibitory effects on nf kb a transcription factor responsible for regulating expression of several genes involved in immune system inflammation and cell death human uses edibility species in nidulariaceae family including cyathus are considered inedible as they are not sufficiently large fleshy or odorous to be of interest to humans as food brodie 1975 p 119 however there have not been reports of poisonous alkaloids or other substances considered toxic to humans brodie goes on to note that two cyathus species have been used by native peoples as an aphrodisiac or to stimulate fertility c limbatus in colombia and c microsporus in guadeloupe whether these species have any actual effect on human physiology is unknown brodie 1975 p 120 biodegradation lignin is a complex polymeric chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood resistant to biological decomposition its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light species c bulleri contains three lignin degrading enzymes lignin peroxidase manganese peroxidase and laccase these enzymes have potential applications not only in pulp and paper industry but also to increase digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle because can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants such as dyes used in textile industry c bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by escherichia coli making it first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host c pallidus can biodegrade explosive compound rdx 1 3 5 1 3 5 suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions contaminated soils agriculture thumb cyathus olla note smooth not plicate endoperidium and relatively large peridioles cyathus olla has been investigated for its ability to accelerate decomposition of stubble left in field after harvest effectively reducing pathogen populations and accelerating nutrient cycling through mineralization of essential plant nutrients infrageneric classification genus cyathus was first subdivided into two infrageneric groups i e grouping species below rank of genus by tulasne brothers eucyathus group had fruit bodies with inner surfaces folded into pleats plications while olla group lacked plications later 1906 lloyd published a different concept of infrageneric grouping in cyathus describing five groups two in eucyathus group and five in olla group in 1970s brodie in his monograph on bird s nest fungi separated genus cyathus into seven related groups based on a number of taxonomic characteristics including presence or absence of plications structure of peridioles color of fruit bodies and nature of hairs on outer peridium brodie 1975 pp 150 80 olla group species with a tomentum having fine flattened down hairs and no plications c olla c africanus c badius c canna c c confusus c earlei c hookeri c microsporus c minimus c pygmaeus pallidus group species with conspicuous long downward pointing hairs and a smooth non plicate inner peridium c pallidus c triplex group species with mostly dark colored peridia and a silvery white inner surface c triplex c setosus c sinensis gracilis group species with tomentum hairs clumped into tufts or mounds c gracilis c intermedius c crassimurus c right shaggy tomentose outer peridial surface of c striatus stercoreus group species with non plicate peridia shaggy or wooly outer peridium walls and dark to black peridioles c stercoreus c pictus c fimicola poeppigii group species with plicate internal peridial walls hairy to shaggy outer walls dark to black peridioles and large roughly spherical or ellipsoidal spores c poeppigii c crispus c limbatus c gayanus c costatus c c brunneus striatus group species with plicate internal peridia hairy to shaggy outer peridia and mostly elliptical spores c striatus c annulatus c berkeleyanus c bulleri c c ellipsoideus c helenae c montagnei c nigro albus c novae zeelandiae c pullus c rudis phylogenetic analysis 2007 publication of phylogenetic analyses of dna sequence data of numerous cyathus species has cast doubt on validity of morphology based infrageneric classifications described by brodie this research suggests that cyathus species can be grouped into three genetically related clades ollum group c africanus type c africanus f c c c c hookeri c c olla c olla f anglicus and c olla f striatum group c annulatus c crassimurus c helenae c poeppigii c c setosus c stercoreus and c triplex pallidum group c berkeleyanus c olla f c and c pallidus this analysis shows that rather than fruit body structure spore size is generally a more reliable character for segregating species groups in cyathus for example species in ollum clade all have spore lengths less than 15 um while all members of pallidum group have lengths greater than 15 um striatum group however cannot be distinguished from pallidum group by spore size alone two characteristics are most suited for distinguishing members of ollum group from pallidum group thickness of hair layer on peridium surface and outline of fruit bodies tomentum of pallidum species is thick like felt and typically aggregates into clumps of shaggy or woolly hair their crucible shaped fruit bodies do not have a clearly differentiated stipe exoperidium of ollum species in comparison has a thin tomentum of fine hairs fruit bodies are funnel shaped and have either a constricted base or a distinct stipe see also list of cyathus species references cited texts
