on a news story that simpsons writers were really obsessed with long tim 2010 commentary for half decent proposal in simpsons complete thirteenth season dvd 20th century fox episode was one of first to suggest that lenny and carl have an intimate relationship this revelation garnered scrutiny from series fans who according to jean were very angry over it half decent proposal was animated in a very complicated manner in dvd audio commentary for episode director macmullan stated that a couple of sequences in episode were reaching too far for animation process to be reassembled correctly one example she mentioned is scene in which marge remembers ziff s assault from way we was ziff s assault is shown as hands reaching for marge and was put together by macmullan in post production right after marge s sisters patty and selma send an e mail to ziff e mail s path is elaborately shown through a trip through computer wires macmullan stated that even though she found scene illogical she maintained that it was done with great effort because characters at ziff s prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe animators had to come up with new designs for character s clothes several of designs were pitched and drawn by ron hauge a former simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on series for many years dance that ziff performs at prom was pitched by macmullan and prom locale was drawn using a photo reference a scene in episode shows homer and lenny signing on to become oil workers manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking and originally macmullan suggested that manager puts his lit cigarette out in oil can next to him and blows his other arm off she pitched idea to jean who responded by writing i wouldn t episode s complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led simpsons animators to start calling macmullan lauren half decent proposal features return of artie ziff and first time since season 2 episode way we was that he was portrayed by american comedian jon lovitz even though ziff appeared in season 4 episode front as well lovitz was not available during episode s recording session and character was

kissalot who turns out to be a real person character which was pitched by former show runner david mirkin and portrayed by castellaneta has become one of writers favorites and was series animation director jim reardon s favorite joke of entire season macmullan lauren 2010 commentary for half decent proposal in simpsons complete thirteenth season dvd 20th century fox castellaneta also voiced a couple of ants who are put on fire at oil tower simpsons staff debated whether ants would speak or make any sound at all with series co creator matt groening being notably hesitant to them being
