2015 atlantic hurricane season was last of three consecutive below average atlantic hurricane seasons it produced twelve tropical cyclones eleven named storms four hurricanes and two major hurricanes accumulated cyclone energy ace for season was 68 of long term median value hurricane season officially began on june 1 2015 and ended on november 30 2015 these dates historically describe period each year when most tropical cyclones form in north atlantic basin however first named storm ana developed on may 8 nearly a month before official start of season first pre season cyclone since beryl in 2012 and earliest since ana in 2003 season concluded with kate transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on november 11 almost three weeks before official end although most of storms impacted land overall effects were minimal ana caused minor flooding and wind damage in carolinas and left two dead in north carolina tropical storm bill and its remnants caused flooding primarily in south central midwestern and mid atlantic regions of united states while its precursor also left flooding in central america and mexico storm resulted in two deaths in honduras two in guatemala one in mexico and three deaths in united states additionally united states suffered at least 100 million 2015 usd in damage claudette and danny left very minimal impact on land in late august tropical storm erika brought heavy rainfall to dominica leading to devastating floods erika caused nearly 500 million in damage and 30 fatalities making it at time island s deadliest natural disaster since hurricane david in 1979 storm also flooded other nearby islands but to a much lesser degree such as guadeloupe puerto rico and hispaniola five additional deaths occurred in haiti fred prompted a hurricane warning for cape verde for first time ever and was first storm to pass through islands as a hurricane since 1892 strong winds there left about 2 5 million in damage two deaths were presumed to have occurred after two fishermen never returned to port seven other sailors likely drowned offshore guinea bissau after their fishing boat collapsed tropical storms grace henri and ida left negligible impact on land hurricane joaquin s intensity and slow movement in vicinity of bahamas resulted in severe damage on some islands additionally american cargo ship ss el faro went missing near crooked island and eventually capsized during storm drowning 33 people rough seas in haiti also caused damage and one death from a fisherman drowning joaquin was most intense satellite era tropical cyclone of non tropical origins remnants of kate affected british isles particularly wales in united kingdom throughout season these storms collectively caused 813 9 million in damage and 89 deaths with exception of tropical storm risk s initial season prediction in december 2014 all major forecasting agencies called for a below or near average season due to strong el nino and colder than average sea surface temperatures overall forecasts were fairly accurate seasonal forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 2015 season source date named hurricanes major refaverage 1981 2010 12 1 6 4 2 7 record high

advance of and during each hurricane season several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services scientific agencies and noted hurricane experts these include forecasters from united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s national hurricane and climate prediction center tropical storm risk united kingdom s met office and philip j klotzbach william m gray and their associates at colorado state university csu forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a particular year according to noaa and csu average atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained roughly 12 tropical storms six hurricanes three major hurricanes and an accumulated cyclone energy ace index of 66 103 units noaa typically categorizes a season as either above average average or below average based on cumulative ace index but number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a hurricane season are considered occasionally as well pre season forecasts on december 9 2014 tropical storm risk tsr a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance risk management and seasonal climate forecasting at university college london issued its first outlook on seasonal hurricane activity during 2015 season in its report organization forecast activity about 20 below 1950 2014 average or about 30 below 2005 2014 average totaling to 13 4 tropical storms 6 3 hurricanes 2 2 major hurricanes and a cumulative ace index of 79 58 units this forecast was largely based on an enhancement of low level trade winds across tropical atlantic during july to september period tsr s report stressed that uncertainty in this forecast existed due to unpredictability in el nino southern oscillation and north atlantic sea surface temperatures a few months later on april 9 2015 tsr updated its report detailing its prediction of activity 45 below 1950 2014 average or about 50 below recent 2005 2014 average with 11 named storms 5 hurricanes 2 major hurricanes and a cumulative ace index of 56 units tsr cited what were expected to be cooler than average ocean temperatures across tropical north atlantic and caribbean sea as reasoning for lower activity in addition report stated that if ace forecast for 2015 were to verify total values during three year period from 2013 2015 would be lowest since 1992 1994 signalling a possible end to active phase of atlantic hurricane activity that began in 1995 on april 9 csu also released its first quantitative forecast for 2015 hurricane season predicting 7 named storms 3 hurricanes 1 major hurricane and a cumulative ace index of 40 units combination of cooler than average waters in tropical and subtropical atlantic as well as a developing el nino predicted to reach at least moderate intensity were expected to favor one of least active seasons since mid 1990s probabilities of a major hurricane striking various coastal areas across atlantic were lower than average although csu stressed that it only takes one landfalling hurricane to make it an active season for residents involved on april 13 north carolina state university ncsu released its forecast predicting a near record low season with just 4 to 6 named storms 1 to 3 hurricanes and 1 major hurricane on may 21 united kingdom met office ukmo issued its forecast predicting a season with below normal activity it predicted 8 storms with a 70 chance that number of storms would be between 6 and 10 it predicted 5 hurricanes with a 70 chance that that number would fall in range of 3 to 7 ukmo s ace index prediction was 74 units with a 70 chance of index falling in range of 40 to 108 units on may 27 noaa released its seasonal forecast predicting a below normal season with 6 to 11 named storms 3 to 6 hurricanes and 0 to 2 major hurricanes noaa indicated that there was a 70 chance of a below normal season a 20 chance of a near normal season and a 10 chance of an above normal season mid season outlooks on june 1 csu released an updated forecast increasing number of predicted named storms to 8 due to early formation of tropical storm ana while keeping predictions for hurricanes and major hurricanes at 3 and 1 respectively ace index forecast was also kept at 40 units probabilities of a major hurricane making landfall on various coastal areas remained below average on august 5 tsr updated their forecast and lowered number of hurricanes developing within basin to 4 with only 1 forecasted to be a major hurricane ace index was also reduced to 44 units seasonal summary thumb right 250px hurricane joaquin over bahamas on october 1 atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 2015 it was a near average season in which twelve tropical cyclones formed eleven of twelve designated cyclones attained tropical storm status of eight tropical storms four reached at least category 1 hurricane intensity 2015 season extended period without major hurricane landfalls in united states to ten years with last such system being hurricane wilma in 2005 lack of activity was primarily attributed to an atmospheric circulation that favored dry sinking air over low latitudes to west of 40degw and westerly wind shear enhanced by el nino a few notable events occurred during season ana was first tropical cyclone to form in off season since 2012 erika became only second storm in satellite era to be retired without reaching hurricane strength tropical storm allison was first and only third to be retired without having made landfall hurricanes klaus and fabian were first and second respectively fred was one of easternmost tropical storms recorded and made landfall in cape verde as a category 1 hurricane becoming first hurricane to strike that country since 1892 joaquin was most intense storm of non tropical origin in satellite era and strongest to affect bahamas in october since 1866 tropical cyclones of this season caused 89 deaths and at least 731 8 million in damage atlantic hurricane season officially ended on november 30 2015 tropical cyclogenesis began early with ana developing on may 8 over three weeks prior to official beginning of season and far ahead of long term climatological average of july 9 month of june featured one tropical cyclone bill which formed on june 16 claudette only system in month of july developed on july 13 rate of tropical cyclogenesis increased in august though no storms developed in first half of month danny season s first major hurricane formed on august 16 followed by erika on august 24 and fred on august 30 september which is climatological peak of hurricane season featured five additional tropical cyclones grace henri tropical depression nine ida and joaquin most intense storm of season was joaquin which peaked as a strong category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph 250 km h just short of category 5 on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale joaquin lasted into october though no other systems developed that month season s final cyclone kate developed on november 8 and became extratropical on november 11 season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 63 which was well below 1981 2010 median of 92 broadly speaking ace is a measure of power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by length of time it existed therefore a storm with a longer duration or stronger intensity such as joaquin will have high values of ace it is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph 63 km h accordingly tropical depressions are not included here after storm has dissipated typically after end of season nhc reexamines data and produces a final report on each storm these revisions can lead to a revised ace total either upward or downward compared to operational value systems tropical storm ana a low pressure area of non tropical origins developed into subtropical storm ana at 00 00 utc on may 8 while situated about 175 miles 280 km southeast of myrtle beach south carolina system was classified as subtropical due to its involvement with an upper trough as well as its large wind field throughout day convection progressively increased as ana moved north northwestward across warm sea surface temperatures associated with gulf stream at 00 00 utc on may 9 cyclone attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour 95 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of six hours later ana transitioned into a fully tropical system however storm soon began weakening after moving away from warm waters of gulf stream and increasing wind shear also contributed to deterioration of ana around 10 00 utc on may 10 system made landfall near north myrtle beach south carolina with winds of 45 mph 75 km h ana weakened to a tropical depression just eight hours later and transitioned into a remnant low near delmarva peninsula at 00 00 utc on may 12 remnant low merged with a frontal system about 24 hours later striking south carolina on may 10 ana became earliest u s landfalling system on record in state a storm surge peaking at about resulted in erosion and minor coastal flooding with roads washed out at north myrtle beach inland moderate rainfall caused a lake to rise above its bank inundating some homes and streets one drowning death occurred in north carolina after rip currents caused a man to remain underwater for more than 10 minutes rainfall in state peaked at southeast of kinston north carolina where minor street flooding took place in lenoir county local firefighters rescued several stranded individuals by boat when rising floodwaters isolated about 10 residences tropical storm force winds were confined to coastal areas with a peak gust of observed near southport an additional death occurred in north carolina after a tree fell on a car in richlands tropical storm bill national hurricane center nhc began monitoring disorganized convection across northwestern caribbean sea in association with an upper level trough on june 12 after interacting with a broad area of low pressure near yucatan peninsula an elongated area of low pressure formed in vicinity on june 13 system moved northwestward into gulf of mexico and developed a well defined circulation on early june 16 because system was already producing tropical storm force winds it was immediately classified as tropical storm bill while situated about 200 mi 320 km from us initially continuing northwestward bill re curved west northwestward later on june 16 around 12 00 utc storm peaked with winds of 60 mph 95 km h and a minimum pressure of just under five hours later bill made landfall near on matagorda island texas at same intensity cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and turned northward early on june 17 however possibly due to rare brown ocean effect bill remained a tropical cyclone until late on june 18 when it degenerated into a remnant low over eastern oklahoma remnant low moved east northeastward until dissipating over west virginia on june 21 precursor to bill produced widespread heavy rain in central america in guatemala flooding affected more than 100 homes while a landslide killed two people two others died in honduras due to flooding with two more missing heavy rains fell across parts of yucatan peninsula with accumulations peaking at in cancun highest daily total seen in city in nearly two years one person died from electrocution in city in texas flooding was exacerbated by record rainfall in some areas in may a number of roads were inundated and several water rescues were required in alice and san antonio major traffic jams occurred in houston and dallas areas coastal flooding left minor damage mostly in galveston and matagorda counties one death occurred when a boy was swept into a culvert in oklahoma numerous roads were also inundated by water interstate 35 was closed near turner falls due to a rockslide and near ardmore because of high water there were two fatalities in oklahoma both from drowning there was also flooding in several others states across united states bill was responsible for at least 100 million in damage tropical storm claudette in early july a shortwave trough embedded in westerlies crossed united states system emerged over atlantic near outer banks of north carolina on july 12 a surface low soon developed traversing gulf stream convection abruptly increased on july 13 and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed by 06 00 utc that day roughly 255 mi 410 km east northeast of cape hatteras six hours later depression intensified into a tropical storm and was assigned name claudette sudden development of cyclone was not well forecast and claudette was not operationally warned upon until it was already a tropical storm embedded within southwesterly flow ahead of mid latitude trough storm moved generally northeast claudette reached its peak intensity around 18 00 utc with winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a pressure of 1003 mbar hpa 29 62 inhg increasing wind shear on july 14 prompted weakening displacing convection from storm s center it subsequently degenerated into a remnant low by 00 00 utc on july 15 remnants of claudette were absorbed into a frontal boundary just south of newfoundland later that day foggy and wet conditions associated with claudette forced flight cancellations and travel delays across portions of eastern newfoundland hurricane danny a tropical wave emerged off western coast of africa in mid august acquiring sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 06 00 utc on august 18 while located about 765 mi 1 230 km southwest of cape verde depression intensified into tropical storm danny six hours later steered generally westward cyclone initially struggled to intensify quickly in midst of abundant saharan air layer but it managed to attain hurricane intensity around 12 00 utc on august 20 thereafter danny began a period of rapid deepening becoming a category 3 hurricane and attaining peak winds of 125 mph 205 km h early on august 21 negative effects of dry air and increased shear began to affect cyclone after peak early on august 22 storm weakened to a category 2 and further to a category 1 hurricane several hours later danny then deteriorated to a tropical storm by 00 00 utc on august 23 after about twelve hours cyclone weakened to a tropical depression as it moved through leeward islands danny degenerated into an open wave at 18 00 utc on august 24 remnants of danny continued to west northwest for another day and was last noted over hispaniola hurricane prompted issuance of several tropical storm warnings for lesser antilles leeward islands air transport cancelled 40 flights and sandbags were distributed in united states virgin islands danny ultimately only brought light rain to region with its effects considered beneficial due to a severe drought tropical storm erika a westward moving tropical wave developed into tropical storm erika late on august 24 while located about 1 035 mi 1 665 km east of leeward islands steered briskly westward by southerly flow associated with a subtropical ridge storm did not strengthen further despite initially favorable conditions on august 25 erika encountered wind shear and dry mid level air causing storm to weaken slightly and leaving low level circulation partially exposed contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through leeward islands just north of guadeloupe on august 27 unfavorable conditions in caribbean sea prevented erika from strengthening beyond 50 mph 85 km h late on august 28 storm degenerated into a low pressure area just south of eastern tip of hispaniola shortly thereafter remnants trekked across hispaniola and later cuba before reaching gulf of mexico on september 1 after striking florida on following day remains of erika became indistinguishable over georgia on september 3 several leeward islands experienced heavy rainfall during passage of erika especially dominica there 15 in 380 mm of precipitation fell at airport causing catastrophic mudslides and flooding a total of 890 homes were destroyed or left uninhabitable while 14 291 people were rendered homeless and entire villages were flattened with a total of 30 deaths erika was deadliest natural disaster in dominica since david in 1979 overall there was up to 500 million in damage and island was set back approximately 20 years in terms of development in guadeloupe heavy rainfall in vicinity of basse terre caused flooding and mudslides forcing roads to temporarily close approximately 200 000 people in puerto rico were left without electricity island experienced at least 17 4 million in agricultural damage in dominican republic a weather station in barahona measured 24 26 in 616 mm of rain including 8 8 in 220 mm in a single hour a total of 823 homes suffered damage and 7 345 people were displaced five people died in haiti four from a weather related traffic accident and one from a landslide hurricane fred a well defined tropical wave developed into a tropical depression just offshore africa about 190 mi 310 km west northwest of conakry guinea early on august 30 about six hours later depression intensified into a tropical storm next day fred further grew to a category 1 hurricane and several hours later peaked with winds of 85 mph 140 km h and a minimum pressure of while approaching cape verde after passing boa vista and moving away from santo antao it entered a phase of steady weakening dropping below hurricane status by september 1 fred then turned to west northwest and endured increasingly hostile wind shear but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of dissipation it fluctuated between a minimal tropical storm and tropical depression through september 4 5 before curving sharply to north by september 6 fred s circulation pattern had diminished considerably and cyclone degenerated into a trough several hours later while located about 1 210 mi 1 950 km southwest of azores remnants were soon absorbed by a frontal system at threat of hurricane all of cape verde was placed under a hurricane warning for first time in history gale force winds battered much of barlavento region through august 31 downing numerous trees and utility poles on easternmost islands of boa vista and sal fred leveled roofs and left several villages without power and phone services for several days about 70 percent of houses in povoacao velha were damaged to some degree throughout northern islands rainstorms damaged homes and roads and sao nicolau lost large amounts of its crop and livestock monetary losses reached 2 5 million across cape verde though rain s overall impact on agriculture was positive swells from hurricane produced violent seas along west african shores destroying fishing villages and submerging large swaths of residential area in senegal overall nine deaths were directly attributed to fred tropical storm grace a well organized tropical wave emerged off western coast of africa on september 3 initially disorganized with a broad area of low pressure a burst of convection on september 5 led to a more concise center and a tropical depression developed around 06 00 utc that day while positioned about 175 mi 280 km south of cape verde depression intensified into tropical storm grace twelve hours later embedded within a generally favorable environment grace strengthened to attain peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h around 12 00 utc on september 6 when a mid level eye feature was evident on satellite thereafter cooler waters and increased shear caused cyclone to weaken to a tropical depression early on september 8 and dissipate at 12 00 utc next day while located within central atlantic tropical storm henri on september 8 an upper level trough spawned a tropical depression southeast of bermuda next day it was upgraded to tropical storm henri system s circulation was disorganized with multiple vortices revolving around a mean center struggling against strong westerly wind shear henri attained a peak intensity of 50 mph 85 km h and a minimum pressure of 1003 mbar hpa possibly due to baroclinity thereafter increasing interaction with same upper level trough to west degraded henri s circulation it opened up into a trough on september 11 remnants were later absorbed into an extratropical cyclone over north atlantic several days later tropical depression nine on september 10 a strong tropical wave emerged off western coast of africa passing south of cape verde its interaction with a convectively coupled kelvin wave resulted in increased convection and formation of an area of low pressure after further organization wave acquired sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 12 00 utc on september 16 while located within central atlantic unfavorable upper level winds caused appearance of cyclone to become disheveled almost immediately after formation and despite sporadic bursts of convection atop storm s center depression dissipated at 18 00 utc on september 19 without ever attaining tropical storm intensity tropical storm ida a tropical wave emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa on september 13 wave later interacted with a kelvin wave latter of which contributed to formation of tropical depression nine moving westward with a large area of convection tropical wave and kelvin wave developed into a well defined low pressure area around midday on september 15 according to satellite imagery however disorganization prevented its classification as a tropical depression until 06 00 utc on september 18 while located about 750 mi 1 210 km south of southernmost cape verde islands depression moved west northwestward due to a subtropical ridge to north and intensified into tropical storm ida early following day westerly wind shear exposed storm s low level circulation causing ida to strengthen only slightly wind shear briefly decreased allowing cyclone to peak with winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a minimum pressure of at 12 00 utc on september 21 however shear increased later that day causing slow weakening ida then decelerated and began moving in a general eastward direction on september 22 after becoming embedded in flow associated with a mid to upper level trough early on september 24 storm weakened to a tropical depression during following day trough was replaced with a subtropical ridge causing ida to turn northwestward and then west northwestward on september 26 after shear and dry air caused much of convection to diminish ida degenerated into a remnant low around 12 00 utc on september 27 while situated about 1 000 mi 1 610 km east northeast of barbuda hurricane joaquin a non tropical low developed into a tropical depression on september 28 about 405 mi 650 km southwest of bermuda based on improved circulation on satellite imagery and deep convection forming near center storm initially moved slowly southwestward due to a blocking ridge of high pressure to north although wind shear increased slightly joaquin tracked over ocean temperatures of allowing cloud pattern to become better organized on september 30 storm intensified into a hurricane joaquin then rapidly deepened becoming a category 4 hurricane late on october 1 joaquin later weakened as it passed through bahamas but reintensified to a category 4 hurricane while recurving northeastward on october 3 maximum sustained winds peaked at 155 mph 250 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of thereafter joaquin began to rapidly weaken as it approached bermuda cyclone then turned eastward and maintained hurricane status until october 7 by following day joaquin became extratropical about 445 mi 715 km west northwest of corvo island in azores remnants later stuck portugal before dissipating over gulf of cadiz on october 15 battering bahamas s southern islands for over two days joaquin caused extensive devastation especially on acklins crooked island long island rum cay and san salvador island severe storm surge inundated many communities trapping hundreds of people in their homes flooding persisted for days after hurricane s departure prolonged intense winds brought down trees and powerlines and unroofed homes throughout affected region as airstrips were submerged and heavily damaged relief workers were limited in their ability to quickly help affected residents damage in bahamas totaled about 200 million offshore american cargo ship el faro and her 33 crew members were lost to hurricane coastal flooding also impacted turks and caicos washing out roadways compromising seawalls and damaging homes strong winds and heavy rainfall caused some property damage in eastern cuba one fisherman died when heavy seas capsized a small boat along coast of haiti storm tides resulted in severe flooding in several of haiti s departments forcing families from their homes and destroying crops joaquin also posed a threat to parts of east coast of united states state of emergencies were declared in maryland new jersey north carolina south carolina and virginia as well as a mandatory evacuation from ocracoke north carolina joaquin ultimately curved northeast and caused little direct impact in united states but another large storm system over southeastern states drew tremendous moisture from hurricane resulting in catastrophic flooding in south carolina storm brought strong winds to bermuda that cut power to 15 000 customers damage on bermuda was minor hurricane kate on october 30 a poorly defined tropical wave and its associated small area of disturbed weather emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa strong wind shear prevented significant development or organization of deep convection for a few days however by november 5 cloudiness and showers increased as system was approaching lesser antilles after a rapid increase in convection and circulation becoming more well defined on satellite imagery a tropical depression about 115 mi 190 km southeast of san salvador island in bahamas around 18 00 utc on november 8 depression strengthened into tropical storm kate early on november 9 after initially moving northwestward kate briefly accelerated northward around western periphery of a subtropical ridge over central atlantic thereafter cyclone accelerated further and curved northeastward due to mid latitude westerlies after intensification and improvements to convective banding kate was upgraded to a category 1 hurricane at 00 00 utc on november 11 twelve hours later storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph 140 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of due to very strong wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures storm began losing tropical characteristics shortly thereafter early on november 12 system became extratropical about 430 mi 690 km south southeast of cape race newfoundland late on november 13 remnants merged with a larger extratropical cyclone between november 15 and november 16 remnants of kate affected united kingdom and ireland across wales
