ok computer is third studio album by english rock band radiohead released on 16 june 1997 on emi subsidiaries parlophone and capitol records members of radiohead self produced album with nigel godrich an arrangement they have used for their subsequent albums other than song lucky recorded in 1995 radiohead recorded ok computer in oxfordshire and bath between 1996 and early 1997 mostly in historic mansion st catherine s court band distanced themselves from guitar centred lyrically introspective style of their previous album bends ok computers abstract lyrics densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid groundwork for radiohead s later more experimental work despite lowered sales estimates by emi who deemed record uncommercial and difficult to market ok computer reached number one on uk albums chart and debuted at number 21 on billboard 200 radiohead s highest album entry on us charts at time songs paranoid android karma police lucky no surprises and airbag were released as singles album expanded radiohead s international popularity and has sold at least 7 8 million units worldwide a remastered version with additional tracks oknotok 1997 2017 was released in june 2017 marking album s twentieth anniversary in 2019 in response to an internet leak radiohead released minidiscs hacked comprising hours of additional ok computer material ok computer received critical acclaim and has been cited by listeners critics and musicians as one of greatest albums of all time it was nominated for grammy award for album of year and won best alternative music album at 40th annual grammy awards in 1998 album initiated a stylistic shift in british rock away from then ubiquitous britpop genre toward melancholic atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in next decade album depicts a world fraught with rampant consumerism social alienation emotional isolation and political malaise in this capacity ok computer is often interpreted as having prescient insight into mood of 21st century life in 2014 it was included by library of congress in national recording registry as culturally historically or aesthetically significant background thumb upright thom yorke pictured in 2001 and band sought a less melancholy direction than previous album bends in 1995 radiohead toured in support of their second album bends midway through tour brian eno commissioned band to contribute a song to help album a charity compilation organised by war child album was to be recorded over course of a single day 4 september 1995 and rush released that week radiohead recorded lucky in five hours with engineer nigel godrich who had assisted producer john leckie with bends and produced several radiohead b sides godrich said of help album session those things are most inspiring when you do stuff really fast and there s nothing to lose we left feeling fairly euphoric so after establishing a bit of a rapport work wise i was sort of hoping i would be involved with next album to promote help album lucky featured as lead track on help ep which charted at number 51 after bbc radio 1 chose not to play it this disappointed radiohead singer thom yorke but he later said lucky shaped nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record lucky was indicative of what we wanted to do it was like first mark on wall radiohead found touring stressful and took a break in january 1996 they sought to distance their new material from introspective style of bends drummer philip selway said there was an awful lot of soul searching on bends to do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring yorke said at time we could really fall back on just doing another miserable morbid and negative record lyrically but i don t really want to at all and i m deliberately just writing down all positive things that i hear or see i m not able to put them into music yet and i don t want to just force it critical and commercial success of bends gave radiohead confidence to self produce their third album their label parlophone gave them a ps100 000 budget for recording equipment guitarist jonny greenwood said only concept that we had for this album was that we wanted to record it away from city and that we wanted to record it ourselves according to guitarist ed o brien everyone said you ll sell six or seven million if you bring out bends pt 2 and we re like we ll kick against that and do opposite q january 2003 a number of producers including major figures such as scott litt were suggested but band were encouraged by their sessions with godrich they consulted him for advice on what equipment to use and prepared for sessions by buying their own equipment including a plate purchased from songwriter jona although godrich had sought to focus his work on electronic dance music he outgrew his role as advisor and became album s co producer recording in july 1996 radiohead started rehearsing and recording ok computer in their canned applause studio a converted shed near didcot oxfordshire even without deadline that contributed to stress of bends band had difficulties which selway blamed on their choice to self produce we re jumping from song to song and when we started to run out of ideas we d move on to a new song stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we d move on because so much work had gone into them members worked with nearly equal roles in production and formation of music though yorke was still firmly loudest voice according to o brien selway said we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts but at same time we are all very critical about what other person is doing godrich s role as co producer was part collaborator part managerial outsider he said that radiohead need to have another person outside their unit especially when they re all playing together to say when take goes well i take up slack when people aren t taking responsibility term producing a record means taking responsibility for record it s my job to ensure that they get ideas across godrich has produced every radiohead album since and has been characterised as radiohead s sixth member an allusion to george martin s nickname as fifth beatle radiohead decided that canned applause was an unsatisfactory recording location which yorke attributed to its proximity to band members homes and jonny greenwood attributed to its lack of dining and bathroom facilities group had nearly completed four songs electioneering no surprises subterranean homesick alien and tourist at their label s request they took a break from recording to embark on a 13 date american tour in 1996 opening for alanis morissette and performed early versions of several new songs one song paranoid android evolved from a fourteen minute version with long organ solos into something closer to six minute version on album during tour filmmaker baz luhrmann commissioned radiohead to write a song for his upcoming film romeo juliet and gave them final 30 minutes of film yorke said when we saw scene in which claire danes holds colt 45 against her head we started working on song immediately soon afterwards band wrote and recorded exit music for a film track plays over film s end credits but was excluded from soundtrack album at band s request song helped shape direction of rest of album yorke said it was first performance we d ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin something i was proud of something i could turn up really really loud and not wince at any moment thumb left most of ok computer was recorded between september and october 1996 at st catherine s court a rural mansion near bath somerset radiohead resumed recording in september 1996 at st catherine s court a historic mansion near bath owned by actress jane seymour mansion was unoccupied but sometimes used for corporate functions change of setting marked an important transition in recording process greenwood comparing mansion to previous studio settings said it was less like a laboratory experiment which is what being in a studio is usually like and more about a group of people making their first record together band made extensive use of different rooms and acoustics in house vocals on exit music for a film feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase and let down was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a m isolation allowed band to work at a different pace with more flexible and spontaneous working hours o brien said that biggest pressure was actually completing recording we weren t given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted we were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff yorke was satisfied with recordings made at location and enjoyed working without audio separation meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately o brien estimated that 80 per cent of album was recorded live and said i hate doing overdubs because it just doesn t feel natural something special happens when you re playing live a lot of it is just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen many of yorke s vocals were first takes he felt that if he made other attempts he would start to think about it and it would sound really lame radiohead returned to canned applause in october for rehearsals and completed most of ok computer in further sessions at st catherine s court by christmas they had narrowed track listing to 14 songs strings were recorded at abbey road studios in london in january 1997 album was mixed over next two months at various london studios then mastered by chris blair at abbey road godrich preferred a quick and hands off approach to mixing and said i feel like i get too into it i start fiddling with things and i fuck it up i generally take about half a day to do a mix if it s any longer than that you lose it hardest thing is trying to stay fresh to stay objective music and lyrics style and influences yorke said that starting point for record was incredibly dense and terrifying sound of bitches brew 1970 avant garde jazz fusion album by miles davis he described sound of bitches brew to q it was building something up and watching it fall apart that s beauty of it it was at core of what we were trying to do with ok computer yorke identified i ll wear it proudly by elvis costello fall on me by r e m dress by pj harvey and a day in life by beatles as particularly influential on his songwriting radiohead drew further inspiration from recording style of film soundtrack composer ennio morricone and krautrock band can musicians yorke described as abusing recording process jonny greenwood described ok computer as a product of being in love with all these brilliant records trying to recreate them and missing according to yorke radiohead hoped to achieve an atmosphere that s perhaps a bit shocking when you first hear it but only as shocking as atmosphere on beach boys pet sounds they expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano mellotron cello and other strings glockenspiel and electronic effects jonny greenwood summarised exploratory approach as when we ve got what we suspect to be an amazing song but nobody knows what they re gonna play on it spin characterised ok computer as sounding like a diy electronica album made with guitars critics suggested a stylistic debt to 1970s progressive rock an influence that radiohead have disavowed according to andy greene in rolling stone radiohead were collectively hostile to seventies progressive rock but that didn t stop them from reinventing prog from scratch on ok computer particularly on six and a half minute paranoid android writing in 2017 new yorkers kelefa sanneh said ok computer was profoundly prog grand and dystopian with a lead single that was more than six minutes long lyrics album s lyrics written by yorke are more abstract compared to his personal emotional lyrics for bends critic alex ross said lyrics seemed a mixture of overheard conversations techno speak and fragments of a harsh diary with images of riot police at political rallies anguished lives in tidy suburbs yuppies freaking out sympathetic aliens gliding overhead recurring themes include transport technology insanity death modern british life globalisation and anti capitalism yorke said on this album outside world became all there was i m just taking polaroids of things around me moving too fast he told q it was like there s a secret camera in a room and it s watching character who walks in a different character for each song camera s not quite me it s neutral emotionless but not emotionless at all in fact very opposite yorke also drew inspiration from books including noam chomsky s political writing eric hobsbawm s age of extremes will hutton s state we re in jonathan coe s what a carve up and philip k dick s valis songs of ok computer do not have a coherent narrative and album s lyrics are generally considered abstract or oblique nonetheless many musical critics journalists and scholars consider album to be a concept album or song cycle or have analyzed it as a concept album noting its strong thematic cohesion aesthetic unity and structural logic of song sequencing conversely other critics have also argued that ok computer is a concept album only in part or in a nontraditional or qualified sense or is not a concept album at all although songs share common themes radiohead have said they do not consider ok computer a concept album and did not intend to link songs through a narrative or unifying concept while it was being written jonny greenwood said i think one album title and one computer voice do not make a concept album that s a bit of a red herring however band intended album to be heard as a whole and spent two weeks ordering track list o brien said context of each song is really important it s not a concept album but there is a continuity there composition tracks 1 6 opening track airbag is underpinned by a beat built from a seconds long recording of selway s drumming band sampled drum track with a sampler and edited it with a macintosh computer inspired by music of dj shadow but admitted to making approximations in emulating shadow s style due to their programming inexperience bassline stops and starts unexpectedly achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub song s references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled an airbag saved my life and tibetan book of dead yorke wrote airbag about illusion of safety offered by modern transit and idea that whenever you go out on road you could be killed bbc wrote of influence of j g ballard especially his 1973 novel crash on song s lyrical content music journalist tim footman notes song s technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrate key paradox of album musicians and producer are delighting in sonic possibilities of modern technology singer meanwhile is railing against its social moral and psychological impact it s a contradiction mirrored in culture clash of music with real guitars negotiating an uneasy stand off with hacked up processed drums split into four sections with an overall running time of 6 23 paranoid android is among band s longest songs unconventional structure was inspired by beatles happiness is a warm gun and queen s bohemian rhapsody which also eschew a traditional verse chorus verse structure its musical style was also inspired by music of pixies song was written by yorke after an unpleasant night at a los angeles bar where he saw a woman react violently after someone spilled a drink on her its title and lyrics are a reference to marvin paranoid android from douglas adams s hitchhiker s guide to galaxy series use of electric keyboards in subterranean homesick alien is an example of band s attempts to emulate atmosphere of bitches brew its title references bob dylan song subterranean homesick blues and lyrics describe an isolated narrator who fantasises about being abducted by extraterrestrials narrator speculates that upon returning to earth his friends would not believe his story and he would remain a misfit lyrics were inspired by an assignment from yorke s time at abingdon school to write a piece of martian poetry a british literary movement that humorously mundane aspects of human life from an alien perspective william shakespeare s romeo and juliet inspired lyrics for exit music for a film initially yorke wanted to work lines from play into song but final draft of lyrics became a broad summary of narrative he said i saw zeffirelli version when i was 13 and i cried my eyes out because i couldn t understand why morning after they shagged they didn t just run away it s a song for two people who should run away before all bad stuff starts yorke compared opening of song which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar to johnny cash s at folsom prison mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout track song climaxes with entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal climactic portion of song is an attempt to emulate sound of trip hop group portishead but in a style that bass player colin greenwood called more stilted and leaden and mechanical song concludes by fading back to yorke s voice acoustic guitar and mellotron let down contains multilayered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano jonny greenwood plays his guitar part in a different time signature to other instruments o brien said song was influenced by phil spector a producer and songwriter best known for his reverberating wall of sound recording techniques song s lyrics are yorke said about that feeling that you get when you re in transit but you re not in control of it you just go past thousands of places and thousands of people and you re completely removed from it of line don t get sentimental it always ends up drivel yorke said sentimentality is being emotional for sake of it we re bombarded with sentiment people emoting that s let down feeling every emotion is fake or rather every emotion is on same plane whether it s a car advert or a pop song yorke felt that scepticism of emotion was characteristic of generation x and said that it informed not just let down but band s approach to whole album karma police has two main verses that alternates with a subdued break followed by a different ending section verses centre around acoustic guitar and piano with a chord progression indebted to beatles sexy sadie starting at 2 34 song transitions into an orchestrated section with repeated line for a minute there i lost myself it ends with guitarist ed o brien generating feedback using a delay effect title and lyrics to karma police originate from an in joke during bends tour jonny greenwood said whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way we d say karma police will catch up with him sooner or later tracks 7 12 thumb a 1990s era macintosh lc ii system radiohead used synthesised voice of fred included with older macintosh software to recite lyrics of fitter happier fitter happier is a short musique concrete track that consists of sampled musical and background sound and spoken word lyrics recited by fred a synthesised voice from macintosh application yorke wrote lyrics in ten minutes after a period of writer s block while rest of band were playing he described words as a checklist of slogans for 1990s and he considered lyrics most upsetting thing i ve ever written and said it was liberating to give words to a neutral sounding computer voice among samples in background is an audio loop from 1975 film three days of condor band considered using fitter happier as album s opening track but decided effect was off putting steve lowe called song penetrating surgery on pseudo meaningful corporations lifestyles with a repugnance for prevailing social values among loosely connected imagery of lyrics footman identified song s subject as materially comfortable morally empty embodiment of modern western humanity half half stepford wife destined for metaphorical farrowing crate propped up on prozac viagra and anything else his insurance plan can cover sam steele called lyrics a stream of received imagery scraps of media information interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence it is hum of a world buzzing with words one of messages seeming to be that we live in such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice electioneering featuring a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo is album s most rock oriented track and one of heaviest songs radiohead has recorded it has been compared to radiohead s earlier style on pablo honey cynical electioneering is album s most directly political song with lyrics inspired by poll tax riots song was also inspired by chomsky s manufacturing consent a book analysing contemporary mass media under propaganda model yorke likened its lyrics which focus on political and artistic compromise to a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones regarding its oblique political references yorke said what can you say about imf or politicians or people selling arms to african countries employing slave labour or whatever what can you say you just write down cattle prods and imf and people who know know o brien said song was about promotional cycle of touring after a while you feel like a politician who has to kiss babies and shake hands all day long upright left thumb threnody to victims of hiroshima by krzysztof penderecki pictured inspired string arrangement on climbing up walls climbing up walls described by melody maker as monumental chaos is layered with a string section ambient noise and repetitive metallic percussion string section composed by jonny greenwood and written for 16 instruments was inspired by modern classical composer krzysztof penderecki s threnody to victims of hiroshima greenwood said i got very excited at prospect of doing string parts that didn t sound like eleanor rigby which is what all string parts have sounded like for past 30 years select described yorke s distraught vocals and atonal strings as thom s voice dissolving into a fearful blood clotted scream as jonny whips sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo for lyrics yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during care in community policy of mental health patients and a new york times article about serial killers he said no surprises recorded in a single take is arranged with electric guitar inspired by beach boys wouldn t it be nice acoustic guitar glockenspiel and vocal harmonies band strove to replicate mood of louis armstrong s 1968 recording of what a wonderful world and soul music of marvin gaye yorke identified subject of song as someone who s trying hard to keep it together but can t lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery one of key metaphors in song is opening line a heart that s full up like a landfill according to yorke song is a fucked up nursery rhyme that stems from my unhealthy obsession of what to do with plastic boxes and plastic bottles all this stuff is getting buried debris of our lives it doesn t rot it just stays there that s how we deal that s how i deal with stuff i bury it song s gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics steele said even when subject is suicide o brien s guitar is as soothing as balm on a red raw psyche song rendered like a bittersweet child s prayer lucky was inspired by bosnian war sam taylor said it was one track on help album to capture sombre terror of conflict and that its serious subject matter and dark tone made band too real to be allowed on britpop gravy train lyrics were pared down from many pages of notes and were originally more politically explicit lyrics depict a man surviving an aeroplane crash and are drawn from yorke s anxiety about transportation musical centerpiece of lucky is its three piece guitar arrangement which grew out of high pitched chiming sound played by o brien in song s introduction achieved by strumming above guitar nut critics have compared its lead guitar to pink floyd and more broadly arena rock album ends with tourist which jonny greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where something doesn t have to happen every three seconds he said tourist doesn t sound like radiohead at all it has become a song with space lyrics written by yorke were inspired by his experience of watching american tourists in france frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible he said it was chosen as closing track because a lot of album was about background noise and everything moving too fast and not being able to keep up it was really obvious to have tourist as last song that song was written to me from me saying idiot slow down because at that point i needed to so that was only resolution there could be to slow down unexpectedly bluesy waltz draws to a close as guitars drop out leaving only drums and bass and concludes with sound of a small bell title title ok computer is taken from 1978 hitchhiker s guide to galaxy radio series in which character zaphod speaks phrase okay computer i want full manual control now members of radiohead listened to series on bus during their 1996 tour and yorke made a note of phrase ok computer became a working title for b side palo alto which had been considered for inclusion on album title stuck with band according to jonny greenwood it started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with what we were trying to do yorke said title refers to embracing future it refers to being terrified of future of our future of everyone else s it s to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on and sound it makes he described title as a really resigned terrified phrase to him similar to coca cola advertisement i d like to teach world to sing wired writer leander suggests that it is an homage to macintosh computers as mac s speech recognition software responds to command ok computer as an alternative to clicking ok button other titles considered were ones and zeroes a reference to binary numeral system and your home may be at risk if you do not keep up payments artwork thumb a page of ok computer booklet with logos white scribbles and text in esperanto and english motif of two stick figures shaking hands repeated on compact disc was described by yorke as symbolising exploitation ok computer artwork is a computer generated collage of images and text created by stanley donwood and yorke latter credited under pseudonym white chocolate farm yorke commissioned donwood to work on a visual diary alongside recording sessions yorke explained if i m shown some kind of visual representation of music only then do i feel confident up until that point i m a bit of a whirlwind blue and white palette was according to donwood result of trying to make something colour of bleached bone image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in booklet and on compact disc itself yorke explained image as emblematic of exploitation someone s being sold something they don t really want and someone s being friendly because they re trying to sell something that s what it means to me explaining artwork s themes yorke said it s quite sad and quite funny as well all artwork and so on it was all things that i hadn t said in songs visual motifs in artwork include motorways aeroplanes families with children corporate logos and cityscapes photograph of a motorway on cover was likely taken in hartford connecticut where radiohead performed in 1996 words lost child feature prominently on cover and booklet artwork contains phrases in constructed language esperanto and health related instructions in both english and greek uncut critic david cavanagh said use of non sequiturs created an effect akin to being lifestyle coached by a lunatic white scribbles donwood s method of correcting mistakes rather than using computer function undo are present everywhere in collages liner notes contain full lyrics rendered with atypical syntax alternate spelling and small annotations for example line in a deep deep sleep of innocent from airbag is rendered as in a deep deep of ent completely terrified see footman 2007 p 45 lyrics are also arranged and spaced in shapes that resemble hidden images in keeping with band s then emerging anti corporate stance production credits contain ironic copyright notice lyrics reproduced by kind permission even though we wrote them release and promotion commercial expectations according to selway radiohead s american label capitol saw album as commercial suicide they weren t really into it at that point we got fear how is this going to be received yorke said when we first gave it to capitol they were taken aback i don t really know why it s so important now but i m excited about it capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million to half a million in o brien s view only parlophone band s british label remained optimistic while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates label representatives were reportedly disappointed with lack of marketable singles especially absence of anything resembling radiohead s hit creep ok computer isn t album we re going to rule world with colin greenwood predicted at time it s not as hitting everything loudly whilst waggling tongue in and out like bends there s less of van halen factor marketing thumb lyrics to fitter happier and images adapted from album artwork were used on advertisements in music magazines signs in london underground and shirts shirt design pictured parlophone launched an unorthodox advertising campaign taking full page advertisements in high profile british newspapers and tube stations with lyrics for fitter happier in large black letters against white backgrounds same lyrics and artwork adapted from album were repurposed for shirt designs yorke said they chose fitter happier lyrics to link what a critic called a coherent set of concerns between album artwork and its promotional material other unconventional merchandise included a floppy disk containing radiohead screensavers and an fm radio in shape of a desktop computer in america capitol sent 1 000 cassette players to prominent members of press and music industry each with a copy of album permanently glued inside capitol president gary gersh said our job is just to take them as a left of centre band and bring centre to them that s our focus and we won t let up until they re biggest band in world radiohead chose paranoid android as lead single despite its unusually long running time and lack of a catchy chorus colin greenwood said song was hardly radio friendly breakthrough buzz bin unit shifter radio stations can have been expecting but that capitol supported choice song premiered on radio 1 programme evening session in april 1997 and was released as a single in may 1997 on strength of frequent radio play on radio 1 and rotation of song s music video on mtv paranoid android reached number three in uk giving radiohead their highest chart position tour radiohead embarked on a world tour in promotion of ok computer against demons tour commencing at album launch in barcelona on 22 may 1997 tour took band across uk and ireland continental europe north america japan and australasia concluding on 18 april 1998 in new york it also saw radiohead s first headline glastonbury festival performance despite technical problems that almost caused yorke to abandon stage performance was acclaimed and cemented radiohead as a major live act tour was taxing for band particularly yorke who said that tour was a year too long i was first person to tire of it then six months later everyone in band was saying it then six months after that nobody was talking any more commercial performance ok computer was released in japan on 21 may in uk on 16 june in canada on 17 june and in us on 1 july it was released on cd double lp vinyl record cassette and minidisc it debuted at number one in uk with sales of 136 000 copies in its first week in us it debuted at number 21 on billboard 200 it held number one spot in uk for two weeks and stayed in top ten for several more ultimately becoming year s bestselling record there karma police was released in august 1997 and no surprises in january 1998 both singles charted in uk top ten and karma police peaked at number 14 on billboard modern rock tracks chart lucky was released as a single in france but did not chart let down considered for release as lead single charted on modern rock tracks chart at number 29 band planned to produce a video for every song on album but project was abandoned due to financial and time constraints also considered but scrapped were plans for trip hop group massive attack to remix album meeting people is easy grant gee s rockumentary following band on their ok computer world tour premiered in november 1998 by february 1998 ok computer had sold at least half a million copies in uk and 2million worldwide by september 2000 billboard reported that album had sold 4 5million copies worldwide los angeles times reported that by june 2001 it had sold 1 4 million copies in us and in april 2006 ifpi announced album had sold 3 million copies across europe it has been certified triple platinum in uk and double platinum in us in addition to certifications in other markets by may 2016 nielsen soundscan figures showed ok computer had sold 2 5million digital album units in us plus an additional 900 000 sales measured in album equivalent units twenty years to week after its initial release official charts company had recorded total uk sales of 1 5million including album equivalent units tallying american and european sales ok computer has sold at least 6 9 million copies worldwide or 7 8 million with album equivalent units la times reported us sales of 1 4 million in 2001 before nielsen soundscan had begun tracking digital sales in 2003 therefore this amount only included non digital sales on cd cassette and lp forbes reported 2 5 million in digital sales and 900 000 in album equivalent units in 2016 bringing us total to at least 3 9 million or 4 8 million with album equivalent units bbc news reported 3 million in sales across europe in 2006 bringing worldwide total to at least 6 9 million or 7 8 million with album equivalent units music week reported that album had sold 1 5 million units in uk by 2017 however 2006 european sales figure included uk sales up to that time and as such adding 2017 uk sales figure to total would result in erroneous double counting of uk units sold before 2006 exact sales figures from other territories are not known ok computer has certainly sold more than 7 8 million units worldwide but it is impossible to say how many more with any certainty critical reception ok computer received critical acclaim critics in british and american press generally agreed that album was a landmark and would have far reaching impact and importance and that its experimentalism made it a challenging listen according to tim footman not since 1967 with release of sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band had so many major critics agreed immediately not only on an album s merits but on its long term significance and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history in english press album garnered favourable reviews in nme melody maker guardian and q nick kent wrote in mojo that others may end up selling more but in 20 years time i m betting ok computer will be seen as key record of 1997 one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song structures from an earlier era john harris in select wrote every word sounds achingly sincere every note spewed from heart and yet it roots itself firmly in a world of steel glass random access memory and prickly skinned paranoia album was well received by critics in north america rolling stone spin pittsburgh post gazette pitchfork and daily herald published positive reviews in new yorker alex ross praised its progressiveness and contrasted radiohead s risk taking with musically conservative of their contemporaries oasis ross wrote that throughout album contrasts of mood and style are extreme this band has pulled off one of great art pop balancing acts in history of rock reviews for entertainment weekly chicago tribune and time were mixed or contained qualified praise robert christgau from village voice said radiohead immersed yorke s vocals in enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month and to compensate for how soulless songs are resulting in arid art rock in an otherwise positive review andy gill wrote for independent for all its ambition and determination to break new ground ok computer is not finally as impressive as bends which covered much same sort of emotional knots but with better tunes it is easy to be impressed by but ultimately hard to love an album that so readily in its own despondency accolades ok computer was nominated for grammy awards as album of year and best alternative music album at 40th annual grammy awards in 1998 winning latter it was also nominated for best british album at 1998 brit awards album was shortlisted for 1997 mercury prize a prestigious award recognising best british or irish album of year day before winner was announced oddsmakers had given ok computer best chance to win among ten nominees but it lost to new forms by roni size album appeared in many 1997 critics lists and listener polls for best album of

maker rolling stone village voice spin and uncut q and les inrockuptibles both listed album in their unranked year end polls praise for album overwhelmed band greenwood felt praise had been exaggerated because bends had been under reviewed possibly and under received they rejected links to progressive rock and art rock despite frequent comparisons made to pink floyd s 1973 album dark side of moon yorke responded we write pop songs there was no intention of it being art it s a reflection of all disparate things we were listening to when we recorded it he was nevertheless pleased that listeners identified album s influences what really blew my head off was fact that people got all things all textures and sounds and atmospheres we were trying to create legacy retrospective acclaim ok computer has appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums a number of publications including nme melody maker alternative press spin pitchfork time metro weekly and slant magazine placed ok computer prominently in lists of best albums of 1990s or of all time it was voted number 4 in colin larkin s all time top 1000 albums 3rd edition 2000 rolling stone ranked it 162 on its list of 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003 and 2012 retrospective reviews from bbc music a v club and slant received album favourably likewise rolling stone gave album five stars in 2004 edition of rolling stone album guide with critic rob sheffield saying radiohead was claiming high ground abandoned by nirvana pearl jam u2 r e m everybody and fans around world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering most would rate ok computer apogee of texture christgau said in retrospect according to acclaimed music a site which uses statistics to numerically represent reception among critics ok computer is 8th most celebrated album of all time in 2014 united states national recording preservation board selected album for preservation in national recording registry of library of congress which designates it as a sound recording that has had significant cultural historical or aesthetic impact in american life album has been cited by some as undeserving of its acclaim in a poll surveying thousands conducted by bbc radio 6 music ok computer was named sixth most overrated album in world david h green of daily telegraph called album self indulgent whingeing and maintains that positive critical consensus toward ok computer is an indication of a 20th century delusion that rock is bastion of serious commentary on popular music to detriment of electronic and dance music album was selected as an entry in sacred cows an nme column questioning critical status of revered albums in which henry yates said there s no defiance gallows humour or chink of light beneath curtain just a sense of meek resigned despondency and criticised record as moment when radiohead stopped being good compared to bends and started being important in a spin article on myth that radiohead can do no wrong chris norris argues that acclaim for ok computer inflated expectations for subsequent radiohead releases in christgau s opinion reason readers of british magazine q absurdly voted ok computer greatest album of 20th century is that it integrated what was briefly called electronica into rock having deemed it self regarding and overrated he later warmed to record a little bit specifically three or four songs while finding music in general to be indicative of radiohead s cerebral sensibility and rife with discrete pleasures and surprises commentary and interpretation thumb in interviews at time thom yorke criticised tony blair pictured in 1998 and his new labour government ok computer was recorded in lead up to 1997 general election and released a month after victory of tony blair s new labour government album was perceived by critics as an expression of dissent and scepticism toward new government and a reaction against national mood of optimism dorian lynskey wrote on may 1 1997 labour supporters toasted their landslide victory to sound of things can only get better a few weeks later ok computer appeared like banquo s ghost to warn no things can only get worse according to amy britton album showed not everyone was ready to join party instead tapping into another feeling felt throughout uk pre millennial angst huge corporations were impossible to fight against this was world ok computer soundtracked not wave of british optimism in an interview yorke doubted that blair s policies would differ from preceding two decades of conservative government he said public reaction to death of princess diana was more significant as a moment when british public realised royals had had us by balls for last hundred years as had media and state band s distaste with commercialised promotion of ok computer reinforced their anti capitalist politics which would be further explored on their subsequent releases critics have compared radiohead s statements of political dissatisfaction to those of earlier rock bands david stubbs said that where punk rock had been a rebellion against a time of deficit and poverty ok computer protested mechanistic convenience of contemporary surplus and excess alex ross said album pictured onslaught of information age and a young person s panicky embrace of it and made band into poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation as talking heads and r e m had been before jon pareles of new york times found precedents in work of pink floyd and madness for radiohead s concerns about a culture of numbness building docile workers and enforced by self help regimes and anti depressants many felt tone of album was millennial or futuristic anticipating cultural and political trends according to a v club writer steven hyden in feature whatever happened to alternative nation radiohead appeared to be ahead of curve forecasting paranoia media driven insanity and omnipresent sense of impending doom that s subsequently come to characterise everyday life in 21st century in 1000 recordings to hear before you die tom moon described ok computer as a prescient dystopian essay on darker implications of technology oozing with a vague sense of dread and a touch of big brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to constant disquiet of life on security level orange post 9 11 chris martin of coldplay remarked that it would be interesting to see how world would be different if dick cheney really listened to radiohead s ok computer i think world would probably improve that album is fucking brilliant it changed my life so why wouldn t it change his album inspired a radio play also titled ok computer which was first broadcast on bbc radio 4 in 2007 play written by joel chris perkins al smith and chris thorpe interprets album s 12 tracks into a story about a man who awakens in a berlin hospital with memory loss and returns to england with doubts that life he s returned to is his own influence release of ok computer coincided with decline of britpop britpop which reached its peak popularity in mid 1990s and was led by bands such as oasis blur and pulp was typified by nostalgic homage to british rock of 1960s and 1970s genre was a key element of broader cultural movement cool britannia starting in 1997 a number of events marked end of genre

arrangements for example post britpop band travis worked with godrich to create languid pop texture of man who which became fourth best selling album of 1999 in uk some in british press accused travis of appropriating radiohead s sound steven hyden of av club said that by 1998 starting with man who what radiohead had created in ok computer had already grown much bigger than band and that album went on to influence a wave of british rock balladeers that reached its zenith in 00s ok computers popularity influenced next generation of british alternative rock bands specifically critics have cited

one reason to break with style of ok computer for their next album kid a although ok computers influence on rock musicians is widely acknowledged several critics believe that its experimental inclination was not authentically embraced on a wide scale footman said radiohead lite bands that followed were missing ok computer sonic inventiveness not to mention lyrical substance david cavanagh said that most of ok computers purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from ballads on bends according to cavanagh populist albums of post ok computer era verve s urban hymns travis s good feeling stereophonics word gets around robbie williams life thru a lens effectively closed door that ok computers esque inventiveness had opened john harris believed that ok computer was one of fleeting signs that british rock music might have been returning to its inventive traditions in wake of britpop s demise while harris concludes that british rock ultimately developed an altogether more conservative tendency he said that with ok computer and their subsequent material radiohead provided a clarion call to fill void left by britpop ok computer triggered a minor revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums with a new wave of prog influenced bands crediting ok computer for enabling their scene to thrive brandon curtis of secret machines said songs like paranoid android made it ok to write music differently to be more experimental ok computer was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures steven wilson of porcupine
