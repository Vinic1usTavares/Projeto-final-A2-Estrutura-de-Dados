wrote unearthed while producer frederick e o toye worked as episode director unearthed was last episode filmed during first season schedule although it was filmed during first season unearthed aired during following season on monday january 11 2010 a departure from its normal timeslot on thursdays actor joshua jackson explained move in april 2009 it s for boring reasons they only had 22 airdates for our show this year but they ordered 23 episodes so we shot one for next year which is just silly tv network stuff it s not for any cool reason like we had something we needed in new york that we couldn t shoot elsewhere it s just an accounting issue that same month executive producer showrunner jeff pinkner further commented on episode chronology for new season it won t be first episode and it probably won t be second but it ll be somewhere in first batch of episodes it s a stand alone but it still honors condition that we know it will fall into world fox issued a press release on january 11 previewing episode s plot it concluded while girl s mind bending condition intensifies walter dusts off some old lab videos and hypothesizes unthinkable sending olivia and peter to investigate bewildering case in an original unearthed episode of fringe and here s another mystery is it an unaired episode from season one or is it from an alternate universe as press release purposely alluded to whether episode was indeed originally part of first season or from parallel universe one critic wrote that fox was just having fun with fact that fringe has alternate universes and that readers of press release should take this with a grain of salt according to fox s media site unearthed was listed as 21st episode of season one despite its broadcast during second season and inclusion in that season s dvd release as a special feature though one character had been killed off earlier in second season a former series regular appeared in episode sparking confusion among some viewers as broadcasting change went unexplained at time one media outlet speculated it was a marketing ploy on network s part believing episode title was more than a stunning coincidence and that it was a reference to co creator j j abrams other television series lost reception ratings on its initial broadcast in united states unearthed was watched by an estimated 7 79 million viewers earning a 2 8 7 share among viewers aged 18 49 episode aired on a monday night which was a departure from its usual timeslot on thursdays this led it temporarily into direct competition with another science fiction series heroes fringe easily won as heroes had its lowest rated airing in show s history while according to sfscope s sarah stegall unearthed gave fringe a whopping 24 percent improvement over its best ratings this season reviews critical reception to episode was generally negative a v club s noel murray graded episode with a c explaining he didn t want to watch a season one cast off and that some of episode moments were generic ally embarrassing such as when olivia tricked someone into telling her rusk was sick and when rusk failed to kill his wife after falling into old fallacy of talking killer cliche new yorks tim grierson thought it was lamest in recent memory and a stinker that should have remained safely out of public view he did however remark that episode allowed him to see how far show had improved since its first season in a slightly more positive review mtv s josh wigler wrote as far as standard installments of fringe go unearthed ranks somewhere in middle of pack but quality diminishes due to its awkward placement in middle of season two ign s ramsey isler rated episode 6 4 10 commenting that it was cheesy with mediocre writing and some fairly bad performances from guest supporting cast isler found little to redeem episode and wished story s partial focus on intersection of science and faith had been further explored andrew hanson from los angeles times thought premise was a little thinly stretched over hour and believed it would have been overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one but was glad to have another hour of fringe regardless sfscope contributor sarah stegall disliked that network failed to issue a disclaimer about episode s production date stating maybe producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to franchise or perhaps unhappily it is a sign that fox has given up on this show and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused she concluded as a standalone episode this one was of middling interest and i can see why fox would have dropped it from season one lineup fans looking eagerly for more mythology episodes where links between fringe team massive dynamics nina sharpe william bell and for all i know illuminati are explored may be disappointed jane boursaw of aol tv was also critical of fox for giving no warning about episode and thought it should actually have been titled walter vs priest she continued whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith not to mention whole being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death thing you can tell it was vintage fringe if indeed it was because storylines are more complex than that these days what with alternate universe and leonard nimoy and all various critics noted guest actress alice kremelberg s performance particularly when she had to give impression she was possessed by a male ghost most reviews were negative though boursaw praised it giving kremelberg high fives
