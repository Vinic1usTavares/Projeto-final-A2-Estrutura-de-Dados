physical graffiti is sixth studio album by english rock band led zeppelin it was released as a double album on 24 february 1975 by group s new record label swan song records band wrote and recorded eight new songs for album in early 1974 at headley grange a country house in hampshire which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording total playing time covered three sides of an lp so they decided to expand it into a double by including previously unreleased tracks from sessions for earlier albums led zeppelin iii led zeppelin iv and houses of holy album covered a range of styles including hard rock progressive rock rock n roll and folk album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end of year release it was delayed because of sleeve which was designed by peter corriston and featured a theme around a tenement block in manhattan new york physical graffiti was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in both us and uk it was promoted by a successful us tour and a five night residency at earl s court london and has since been viewed as one of group s strongest albums and artistic peak of their career album has been reissued on cd several times including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015 physical graffiti was later certified 16x platinum in united states by recording industry association of america riaa in 2006 signifying shipments of over eight million copies recording first attempt by led zeppelin to record songs for physical graffiti took place in november 1973 at headley grange in hampshire england where they had previously recorded their untitled fourth album recording equipment consisted of ronnie lane s mobile studio guitarist and producer jimmy page and drummer john bonham recorded an instrumental which was later reworked as kashmir during this visit however these sessions came to a halt quickly and studio time was turned over to bad company who used it to record songs for their eponymous debut album press reported that bassist keyboardist john paul jones was ill and unable to record however he became disillusioned with group and fed up with touring and told manager peter grant he was considering quitting grant asked him to reconsider and take rest of year off to recuperate group reconvened at headley grange in january and february 1974 where they recorded eight tracks engineered by ron nevison lead singer robert plant later referred to these eight tracks as belters including off wall stuff that turned out really nice as with previous sessions at headley grange informal atmosphere allowed group to improvise and develop material while recording sometimes group would rehearse or record a track several times discuss what went wrong or what could be improved and then realised they had worked out an alternative arrangement for it which was better bonham was a driving force at sessions regularly suggesting ideas or best ways in which a complicated arrangement could be played successfully this led to him getting a lead songwriting credit on several tracks eight songs extended beyond length of a conventional album spanning three sides of an lp so group decided to create a double album adding material they had recorded for previous albums but never issued this included various jam sessions such as boogie with stu which page thought would be unsuitable as a track on a single album additional overdubs were laid down and final mixing of album was performed in july 1974 by keith harwood at olympic studios london title physical graffiti was coined by page to illustrate whole physical and written energy that had gone into producing set songs thumb right bron yr aur cottage was birthplace of rover bron yr aur and down by seaside album spanned several years of recording and covered a range of musical styles including hard rock custard pie rover wanton song sick again houses of holy eastern influenced orchestral rock kashmir progressive rock in light driving funk trampled under foot acoustic rock and roll boogie with stu black country woman love ballad ten years gone blues rock in my time of dying soft rock down by seaside country rock romp night flight and acoustic guitar instrumental bron yr aur review at allmusic several tracks from album became live staples at led zeppelin concerts in particular in my time of dying trampled under foot kashmir ten years gone black country woman and sick again became regular components of band s live concert set lists following release of album side one custard pie was recorded at headley grange in early 1974 first take was played at a faster tempo than finished version with various improvised vocals after a basic run through group then discussed possibilities for rearranging it page played guitar solo through an arp synthesiser while jones overdubbed a hohner clavinet part and plant played harmonica rover was written in 1970 at bron yr aur a cottage near machynlleth wales it was first recorded at headley grange in may 1970 as an acoustic number for led zeppelin iii it was reworked as an electric number in 1972 for houses of holy which formed basis for backing track page subsequently added guitar overdubs in 1974 with keith harwood engineering in my time of dying is based on a traditional song that bob dylan recorded on his debut album in 1962 track was recorded live with page later adding further slide guitar overdubs arranging and structuring was led by bonham who worked out where various stop start sections in track should be and how group would know where to come back in very end of song features his off mic cough causing rest of group to break down at that point bonham subsequently shouted that s got to be one hasn t it feeling it was best take it was left on album to show fans that led zeppelin were a working band that took care in their recordings side two houses of holy was recorded as title track for album of same name in june 1972 at electric lady studios with eddie kramer engineering it was left off that album because of its similarity to other tracks such as dancing days which were felt to be better unlike some of other older material on physical graffiti it required no further overdubbing or remixing trampled under foot developed from a jam session driven by jones at clavinet song went through several arrangement changes before arriving at version heard on album with group rehearsing various different ideas and arguing about overall style bonham decided track was too and rearranged it into a funk style suggesting that page should play a guitar riff throughout in place of chords lyrics are a series of double entendres around driving and cars song quickly became a popular live piece that was played at every live show from 1975 onwards and was later revived by plant for his solo tours it was released as a single in us on 2 april with black country woman as b side and was a top 40 hit kashmir was an idea from page and bonham and was first attempted as an instrumental demo in late 1973 plant wrote lyrics while on holiday in morocco jones played mellotron on track and arranged strings and brass parts that were played by session musicians song was one of most critically acclaimed on album and was played at every gig from 1975 onwards page and plant played it on their 1994 tour and it was reworked in 1998 by sean puffy combs for his single come with me which featured page on guitar side three in light was recorded at headley grange in early 1974 it was initially called in morning and went through several rehearsals and takes to work out a basic structure a drone chant introduction was later added to piece bron yr aur was a solo acoustic piece by page named after cottage where he had composed and arranged much of led zeppelin iii with plant it was recorded at island studios in mid 1970 track was later used as background music in group s film song remains same down by seaside was originally written as an acoustic track at bron yr aur in 1970 and was influenced by neil young it was reworked as an electric track during sessions for fourth album following year page and bonham led arranging changing tempo from slow to fast section and then back again ten years gone was mostly composed by plant about an old love affair and was combined with an instrumental piece from page featuring overdubbed electric and acoustic guitar parts when track was performed live jones played a triple neck guitar featuring mandolin six and twelve string guitars in order to try to reproduce various guitar overdubs on studio recording side four thumb some older material for physical graffiti was recorded at stargroves night flight was recorded at headley grange in 1971 for fourth album jones plays hammond organ on track and page plays guitar through a leslie speaker plant wrote lyrics after reading a news headline entitled nuclear damage test threat and wondered why there seemed to be little peace and love in world wanton song was built around a page guitar riff unlike some of other tracks recorded at 1974 headley grange sessions it was straightforward to arrange with group building song around riffs boogie with stu was a jam session with rolling stones pianist ian stewart based around ritchie valens song ooh my head it was recorded in 1971 at headley grange during same session that produced rock and roll for fourth album it did not credit valens or bob keane instead crediting valens mother eventually a lawsuit was filed by keane and half of award went to valens mother although she was not part of suit black country woman was recorded in garden at stargroves in 1972 for houses of holy as part of group s desire to work in off wall locations outside a traditional studio environment track was nearly abandoned when an aeroplane cruised overhead but it was left on final recording for effect sick again was written by page and plant about 1973 tour and their experience with meeting groupies track was driven by bonham s drumming and page s guitar riffs arrangement had been worked out before recording and was straightforward to put down on tape unreleased material as physical graffiti collected various out takes from earlier albums little was left over from recording sessions that was not eventually released an early arrangement of custard pie different from final version was reworked as hots on for nowhere on following album presence a number of other outtakes from earlier album sessions that had not been put on physical graffiti were later included on 1982 album coda artwork and packaging thumb right upright 96 and 98 east 8th street st mark s place manhattan album was originally released with a die cut sleeve design depicting a

sleeves that could be placed under main cover and filling windows with various pieces of information blockquote two five storey buildings photographed for album cover are located at 96 and 98 st mark s place in new york city original photograph underwent a number of tweaks to arrive at final image fifth floor of building had to be cropped out to fit square album cover format eschewing usual
