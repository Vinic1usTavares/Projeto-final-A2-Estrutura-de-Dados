build up in south vietnam s northern provinces however first camp at lang vei proved to be only temporary when pavn attacked camp on 4 may 1967 even though pavn attack had been repelled damage to camp was extensive since original camp site had lacked good observation and fields of fire beyond barbed wire perimeter 5th special forces group commander decided to move camp to a more suitable area about 1 000 meters to west new camp situated on highway 9 about to west of khe sanh was completed in 1967 in 1967 captain franklin c willoughby assumed command of detachment a 101 at lang vei which had a

village pavn 304th division moved against their next target small laotian outpost at ban houei sane prior to 1968 laotian forces at ban houei sane had played an important role in war watching pavn infiltration into south vietnam from a section of ho chi minh trail running through laos outpost was manned by 700 laotian soldiers of bv 33 elephant battalion royal laos army led by lieutenant colonel phetsampou as night fell pavn 3rd battalion 24th regiment began attacking outpost 198th tank battalion which was tasked with supporting 24th regiment was delayed as their tank crews tried to navigate their pt 76 amphibious tanks through rough local terrain however confusion quickly descended on laotian defenders as pt 76 tanks turned up outside their outpost after three hours of fighting lt col phetsampou decided to abandon his outpost so he radioed lang vei camp and requested helicopters to evacuate his men and their families however as helicopters were unavailable laotians decided to move eastward by foot along highway 9 in an attempt to reach lang vei just across border in south vietnam following loss of both khe sanh village and ban houei sane thousands of civilian refugees made their way towards lang vei village and special forces camp with an estimated 8 000 non combatants within a thousand meters of his camp willoughby radioed da nang for assistance this arrived on january 25 in form of food and medical supplies along with a six man special forces augmentation team laotian soldiers of bv 33 with assistance from new special forces team were given materials to restore old lang vei camp where they would remain until further orders were issued from da nang laotian soldiers and their families brought with them stories of a pavn attack supported by tanks which was a cause for concern for willoughby because ban houei sane was only away across border on 30 january willoughby s fears were confirmed when a pavn deserter private luong dinh du surrendered himself to u s special forces in lang vei under interrogation private du revealed that tracked vehicles had positioned near his unit but a planned attack was canceled twice for unknown reasons battle thumb

wounding eight camp strike force soldiers that afternoon lt col daniel f shungel commander of company c 5th special forces group flew into lang vei from da nang as a diplomatic gesture towards laotian commander lt col phetsampou at 18 10 hours pavn followed up their morning mortar attack with an artillery attack from 152mm howitzers firing 60 rounds into camp bombardment wounded two more strike force soldiers and damaged two bunkers then at 23 30 pavn artillery started pounding camp which covered movement of 24th regiment and 3rd battalion 101d regiment from an observation post above tactical operations centre sergeant nickolas saw first pavn tanks moving along lang troai road attempting to breach barbed wires just in front of company 104 he immediately went down to tactical operations center and described what he had witnessed to willoughby shungel then advised willoughby to concentrate all available artillery and air support on pavn formation just in front of company 104 soon afterwards three pt 76 tanks were knocked out by a 106mm recoilless rifle manned by sergeant first class james w holt but barbed wire in front of company 104 was quickly overcome by combined pavn tank infantry attack thumb right 250px a pt 76 tank destroyed by american anti tank weapons lies dormant along a road after battle at lang vei special forces camp meanwhile from inside tactical operations center willoughby was busy calling in air and artillery support he also radioed 26th marines at khe sanh to request deployment of two rifle companies as part of reinforcement plan but his request was denied believing that attack on company 104 was enemy s main effort willoughby concentrated his artillery support there during early stages of battle about 10 minutes after artillery had begun firing a u s air force forward air controller arrived over lang vei along with a and an ac 119 shadow gunship willoughby then requested air strikes on ravines located north of camp on lang troai road and areas west of early warning outpost manned by hre soldiers of mobile strike force despite ferocity of air strikes and artillery fire pavn managed to break through company 104 area forcing defenders to retreat into 2nd and 3rd combat reconnaissance platoon positions behind them by 01 15 pavn had captured entire eastern end of special forces camp and from company 104 area began pouring fire on company 101 at opposite end of camp three pt 76 tanks rolled through barbed wire barrier in front of company 102 and 103 from point blank tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns forcing soldiers of company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions those who survived onslaught either retreated to reconnaissance positions or along highway 9 toward khe sanh in east about 800 meters to west sergeant first class charles w lindewald an adviser to mobile strike force also reported back to willoughby that early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun to save it lindewald directed artillery strikes on pavn troops moving up towards his outpost but he later died from a gunshot wound to stomach as pavn overran outpost at about 01 30 shungel and his hastily organized tank killer teams were busy engaging tanks that were roaming company 104 area on many occasions m 72 rockets fired by americans either missed completely jammed misfired or simply failed to knock out enemy tanks by 02 30 pavn had broken through inner perimeter of camp and began harassing soldiers trapped inside tactical operations center which included willoughby along with seven other americans three south vietnamese special forces and 26 cidg soldiers thumb right 250px photograph taken by u s air force reconnaissance aircraft showing 2 destroyed pt 76 tanks in lang vei above ground u s and arvn soldiers who had escaped death or capture tried to escape from pavn from team house a group of four americans and about 50 cidg soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave camp through northern perimeter where there was no visible sign of pavn without much difficulty americans and cidg soldiers were able to make it through barbed wire barrier but pavn soldiers on eastern side of camp had detected their movement and began firing on group ultimately only two americans and about 10 vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from camp taking refuge in a dry creek bed that offered some cover and concealment at around 03 30 am willoughby made another request for marines at khe sanh to send reinforcements but again his request was turned down in an attempt to save defenders at lang vei company c headquarters in da nang tried to call for reinforcements from marines at khe sanh but its request was also turned down finally company c headquarters placed another mobile strike force company and a company sized unit on standby alert in da nang to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available back in lang vei pavn continued to harass small force of soldiers still trapped in command bunker with hand grenades explosives and bursts of gunfire down stairwell that led into bunker shortly after 06 00 am pavn threw several fragmentation grenades and tear gas grenades down stairwell then a voice called down stairwell in vietnamese demanding american led forces give up at once following a quick discussion with his cidg soldiers south vietnamese special forces commander led his troops up stairwell to surrender but were killed by pavn soldiers leaving behind their american counterparts after south vietnamese had gone up there was another short verbal exchange between americans in bunker and pavn in english which was followed by another fire fight when americans refused surrender at 06 30 am pavn successfully blasted a hole on northern wall gaining direct access into command bunker however instead of launching a direct attack on last american stronghold pavn continued to throw grenades through wall at dawn sergeant first class eugene ashley jr assembled about 100 laotian soldiers of bv 33 at old lang vei camp in order to launch a rescue operation and if possible recapture special forces camp from pavn even though lt col phetsampou had initially refused to take part in operation americans held him to his earlier promise of providing them with troops after ashley had formed laotian soldiers into a skirmish line he radioed forward air controllers overhead to direct strafing runs on special forces camp to soften up enemy meanwhile as comusmacv general william westmoreland learned of pavn attack on lang vei and s refusal to send a relief force he ordered u s marines to supply enough helicopters to airlift a 50 man strike force with aim of rescuing survivors subsequently colonel jonathan f ladd commanding officer of 5th special forces group and major general norman j anderson commander of 1st marine aircraft wing were directed to formulate a rescue plan while willoughby and his men waited for help in command bunker ashley and his laotian contingent cautiously entered special forces camp laotian soldiers were evidently reluctant to advance on pavn and only inched forward when americans ordered them to do so in their first attempt to break through pavn lines ashley and his men were beaten back undeterred american led forces tried to penetrate pavn positions several times and only stopped after ashley was shot in chest and later killed by an exploding artillery round ashley was later posthumously awarded medal of honor laotians who feared pavn disengaged from fight and fled after ashley s final attack had failed willoughby and his men made decision to abandon their position however after specialist four james l moreland was mortally wounded captain willoughby decided to leave him in bunker because remaining americans were in no physical condition to carry out wounded man under cover of u s air strikes willoughby and other american survivors ran towards old lang vei camp which was evacuated by marine ch 46s from hmm 262 which lifted in a 50 man reaction force by 17 30 on 7 february all known survivors had been evacuated to khe sanh aftermath fight for lang vei though short in duration was a

fight was over for military forces ordeal continued for civilians who were caught in fighting an estimated 6 000 survivors from old lang vei camp including cidg soldiers and their families montagnard tribesmen and laotians followed americans and descended on khe sanh combat base however when they reached american compound lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that pavn soldiers may have mingled with crowd instead lownds ordered his soldiers to herd civilians into bomb craters disarmed local soldiers and kept them under guard even though pavn artillery shells continued to rain down on base no food or medical aid was given to civilians as they were kept outside wires of american compound frustrated by lack of support and poor treatment by americans phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy on 10 february laotian civilian refugees started walking back to laos along highway 9 because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their
