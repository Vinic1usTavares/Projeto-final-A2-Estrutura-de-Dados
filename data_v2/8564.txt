meeting frodo baggins he is presented with a temptation to take possession of one ring in return of king he led forces of gondor during war of ring coming near to death and eventually succeeded his father as steward and won love of eowyn of rohan in history of lord of rings series christopher tolkien recorded that his father had not foreseen emergence of faramir during writing of book only inventing him at actual point of his appearance in two towers j r r tolkien noted that introduction of faramir had led to postponement of book s denouement and to further development of background for gondor and rohan long after completing lord of rings tolkien would write that of all characters faramir resembles author most and that he had deliberately bestowed upon character several traits of his own literature background early years of faramir s life are described in main narrative of lord of rings only with more detail revealed in appendices it is stated that faramir was born in year of third age his father denethor ii was a man of noble descent and heir to stewardship of gondor ascending a year after faramir s birth denethor had married daughter of prince of dol amroth however she died untimely when faramir was five and is said to have remained to him but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief after her death denethor became sombre cold and detached from his family but relationship between faramir and boromir who was five years older only grew closer brothers greatly loved and highly esteemed each other and neither in childhood nor in later years was there any jealousy or rivalry between them even though denethor openly favoured his elder son tolkien wrote that faramir was used to giving way and not airing his own opinions among other things faramir displeased his father in that he welcomed wizard gandalf who occasionally visited minas tirith capital of gondor being eager for knowledge faramir learned much from gandalf about history of realm and about death of isildur gondor had long been threatened by nearby realm of mordor and in dark lord sauron began war of ring attacking ruined city of osgiliath that guarded passage to minas tirith faramir and boromir commanded defence and were among those few who survived when eastern half of osgiliath was captured and bridges across river anduin were destroyed in fellowship of ring it is recounted that shortly before battle faramir had a prophetic dream which later often recurred to him and once to boromir in this dream a voice spoke about a sword that was broken that was to be found at imladris far to north about awakening of isildur s bane approach of doom and appearance of faramir decided to journey to imladris and seek advice of elrond half elven but boromir claimed errand for himself fearing for his brother and was approved by denethor and a council of elders faramir remained to defend gondor two towers faramir first encountered hobbits frodo baggins and samwise gamgee in ithilien and recognized them to be halflings mentioned in his dreams faramir questioned frodo of his quest and frodo revealed that he along with eight other companions including boromir had set out from rivendell during interrogation faramir asked often about boromir since he knew although frodo at that point did not that boromir was already dead one night while on guard faramir waded down to anduin river after seeing a boat there it contained dead body of his brother who had been killed by orcs after frodo left group faramir also asked about purpose of frodo s mission but frodo tried to avoid subject faramir determined that frodo was carrying one of sauron s great weapons in rangers secret refuge behind waterfall sam accidentally spoke of boromir s desire for one ring thus revealing item frodo was carrying faramir then showed crucial difference between him and his proud brother despite hobbits fears faramir was wise enough to realize that such a weapon was not to be used and if desired should be resisted with this knowledge he also realized what his brother had to face and wished that he had gone on quest himself knowing that boromir would not have been able to resist temptation to seize ring for himself giving hobbits provisions he sent them on their way to continue their quest but warned frodo that their guide gollum was a treacherous creature and that an unknown terror lived in cirith ungol where gollum was leading them return of king following evening in cair andros faramir sent his company south to reinforce garrison at osgiliath while he and three of his men rode to minas tirith along way they were pursued by sauron s servants nazgul faramir rode back to help fallen immediately gandalf rode out to their aid temporarily banishing nazgul faramir arrived at minas tirith and reported to denethor and gandalf of his encounter with frodo and sam denethor became angry that faramir had let frodo and sam pass into mordor with ring instead of bringing ring to minas tirith to be hidden sauron s second in command witch king of angmar led a much larger force from minas morgul and attacked osgiliath after osgiliath was conquered faramir decided to stay with rearguard in order to make sure that retreat over pelennor would not turn into a rout he was gravely wounded by a arrow and black breath of nazgul fortunately all of mounted soldiers in city rode to his aid and brought him back to denethor in minas tirith when faramir returned unconscious denethor believed him to be fatally injured that blow coupled with a vision in palantir of forces arrayed against him drove him insane he ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre in house of stewards for him and his son denethor s temporary servant hobbit peregrin took went to alert gandalf and beregond one of tower guards he had befriended gandalf and beregond stopped impending sacrifice just in time mad with grief denethor jumped onto lit pyre burning himself alive two days later battle over aragorn came and revived faramir with in houses of healing during his subsequent recuperation there faramir met lady eowyn of rohan moved by her sorrow pride and beauty he eventually fell in love with her at first eowyn refused his advances only desiring to go to war to find honour in death but soon eowyn realized that she had come to love him in return faramir took up his office as steward and began preparing city for arrival of aragorn who was now king of gondor on day of king s official coronation faramir surrendered his office aragorn however renewed office and announced that as long as his line would last faramir and his descendants would be stewards of gondor in addition aragorn created faramir prince of ithilien and appointed beregond captain of faramir s guard white company faramir as prince of ithilien together with prince of dol amroth became king elessar s chief commanders in a draft letter to a reader of lord of rings j r r tolkien writes that as prince of ithilien faramir s duties also included acting as resident march warden of gondor s main eastward outpost rehabilitating lost territories as well as clearing it of outlaws and orcs and cleansing minas morgul an old gondorian city once named minas that sauron had taken of evil remnants faramir also fulfilled traditional role of steward acting as king s chief counsellor and ruling gondor in his absence with eowyn he settled in emyn arnen where two had a son named after faramir s death at age of 120 his son succeeded him in all of his titles faramir s grandson wrote tale of aragorn and arwen which was inserted in an abbreviated form in thain s book by writer and appears in lord of rings as part of appendix a characteristics faramir s personality is prominently described in appendices to lord of rings tolkien recorded that faramir greatly resembled boromir in appearance who in his turn is described as a tall man with a fair and noble face dark haired and grey eyed proud and stern of glance members of line of stewards were wont to be of a nobler appearance and bearing than most of inhabitants of gondor in case of faramir it is stated that by some chance blood of ran nearly true in him which was rare this trait was elaborated by tolkien through speech of pippin faramir s leadership skill in arms and swift but hardy judgement proved valuable in battle and earned him gondor s respect during war of ring he defended gondor from sauron on many fronts but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake long after completing lord of rings tolkien would write as far as any character is like me it is faramir faramir s relationship to war in tolkien s story reflected that of author himself who served as an officer in british army during first world war and fought in battle of somme in latter half of 1916 tolkien bestowed his dream of darkness unescapable upon faramir s character who relates it to eowyn in chapter steward and king in return of king of this tolkien wrote for when faramir speaks of his private vision of great wave he speaks for me that vision and dream has been ever with me and has been inherited as i only discovered recently by one of my children michael names and titles meaning of name faramir was not explained by tolkien apparently he intended it to come from sindarin an elven language constructed by him and stated to have been used by stewards of gondor for naming first part of faramir could have been derived from sindarin stems meaning suffice and hunt and final syllable is likely to have been same as in his brother s name boromir was described by tolkien as a name of mixed form and possibly combines sindarin bor on steadfast with either sindarin mir or quenya mire jewel however it is also stated that stewards of gondor often bore names remembered in songs and histories of first age without paying a special attention to meaning thus one boromir appears in silmarillion and appendices to lord of rings introduce faramir son of king ondoher of gondor although in this case name was supposedly in quenya as kings are stated to have borne high elven names and similarly did ondoher s elder son throughout lord of rings faramir is given several titles and ranks such as captain of gondor and captain of white tower boromir is given latter title at an earlier point in storyline and in two towers he is referred to as captain general of gondor and high warden of white tower after his father s death faramir became steward of gondor but only briefly as he laid down his office at crowning of aragorn tolkien stated that it was denethor who was last of ruling stewards later aragorn renewed faramir s hereditary appointment as steward to king and granted him titles of prince of ithilien and lord of emyn arnen concept and creation faramir s decision to reject one ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to tolkien from medieval poem battle of maldon by not taking ring faramir rejects desire for power and glory and desire for renown which a defeat of sauron would bring him speed of relationship of faramir and eowyn reflects a culture which tolkien describes to be less corrupt and nobler in which petty fencing and approaches of courtly love is disregarded a factor in development of their love came from tolkien s personal belief that feelings grew quickly in periods of great stress and under expectation of death originally tolkien employed use of thou and thee in lord of rings to show a deliberate change to a form of affection or endearment see t v distinction his son has presented original drafts for chapter steward and king in which such usage was employed to emphasize relationship s development portrayal in adaptations art thumb right 230px anke eissmann s portrayal of faramir interrogating frodo faramir appears in several illustrations created by john howe ted nasmith and anke eissmann for lord of rings and related products see illustrations by john howe one of scenes from book that received many depictions is faramir and eowyn s meeting at top of minas tirith anke eissmann s gallery for book 6 of lord of rings and ted nasmith s eowyn and faramir and sun unveiled are prominent examples of art illustrating their meeting eissmann apparently follows book in presenting faramir as dark haired and beardless also emphasising his recent recovery in illustration for dialogue with eowyn nasmith depicts faramir as bearded and brown haired radio in bbc s 1981 radio adaptation of lord of rings faramir is voiced by andrew radio drama is known for adhering faithfully to books and peter jackson gives bbc s 1981 radio adaptation credit in production of his film trilogy characterisation of faramir follows that of original closely character is able to resist one ring in direct contrast to portrayal in peter jackson s lord of rings film trilogy film in rankin bass 1980 adaptation of return of king a dark haired man is shown next to eowyn in greeting aragorn as he arrives to minas tirith this character could be interpreted as faramir com thumb right 240px david wenham as faramir in peter jackson s lord of rings return of king in lord of rings movie trilogy directed by peter jackson faramir is played by david wenham actor jokes that he got role because he and sean bean who played boromir both had large noses cameras in middle earth filming two towers dvd documentary faramir and his brother s appearances were slightly altered from book in films they have fair hair and are slightly bearded whereas in book they were dark haired and following a statement in unfinished tales lacked beards plot of second film lord of rings two towers introduces a significant deviation from book faramir does not at first let frodo sam and gollum go but decides to bring them and ring to gondor he takes them to osgiliath and not until nazgul attack city and frodo comes under threat of capture does he release them jackson s explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay frodo and sam because episode at cirith ungol was moved to third movie and so a new climax was needed in fact according to timeline given by tolkien frodo and sam had only reached black gate at time of fall of isengard jackson also argues that it was necessary for faramir to be tempted by ring because in his films everyone else was tempted and letting faramir be immune would be inconsistent in eyes of a film audience co screenwriter philippa boyens and actor david wenham defended changes to faramir s character in order to increase dramatic tension faramir s sea green incorruptible nature in book would not have translated well wenham who had not read book until after filming had commenced also found tolkien s original dramatically dead many readers remain unconvinced by cast and crew s justifications and others note that faramir was rendered too much like boromir and thus contrast between two was severely weakened a scene that received additional criticism is rangers treatment of gollum who is beaten up and faramir s implicit compliance in book faramir calls creature smeagol instead of gollum and tells his men to treat him gently but watch him in extended edition of two towers jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that denethor had neglected him in favour of boromir when sending him to rivendell so that faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him ring relationship is similarly strained in book but his father s favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in ithilien reviewers have opined that extended edition presents faramir in a more favourable light video games faramir is a bonus playable character in video game return of king in a bonus video track within this game wenham says that faramir and boromir were brothers and it isn t beyond possibility that faramir would have gone to rivendell instead and if that happened faramir could have survived and returned to gondor he also appears as a playable hero in e a s battle for middle earth and battle for middle earth ii as well as its expansion pack rise of witch king faramir has unique ability within game to change between three different classes at beginning of battle faramir is set as an archer but can be changed to use his sword for melee combat and can change to a rider for cavalry assaults while in archer form he has reasonable attack strength but lacks speed of legolas faramir has ability to raise experience of a select group of archers once he reaches a certain level faramir appears as a playable hero in lord of rings conquest faramir can be controlled in osgiliath level where you need to defend city against battalions of orcs and afterwards defend ring bearer frodo until he reaches city limits he also makes a guest hero appearance twice in lord of rings third age as with conquest faramir appears to help you during osgiliath level and helps party take on orc leader gothmog faramir is also featured as a playable character in lego lord of rings in which his role is quite similar to that played in peter jackson films namesakes international astronomical union names all colles small hills on saturn s
