hurricane karl was a late season and unusual tropical cyclone that formed during 1980 atlantic hurricane season a marginal category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale karl developed at center of another larger extratropical cyclone over north atlantic after being classified a subtropical cyclone on november 25 it became more independent of its parent storm and grew into a full fledged hurricane it peaked in intensity on november 26 and ultimately dissipated on november 29 as it merged with another system karl holds record for northernmost formation of a november tropical or subtropical cyclone in atlantic ocean it also attained hurricane strength at an unusual latitude and contributed to one of most active on record in terms of tropical cyclones however it stayed over open waters and did not have any effects on land it was 11th named storm of season and due to lack of damage its name was not retired meteorological history hurricane karl originated in a low pressure area that formed along a frontal boundary near southeastern united states it approached canadian maritimes next day and strengthened to below 1000 millibars on november 24 broad cyclone was located south of newfoundland and early next day a mass of convection developed near core it evolved into a separate vortex and due to lack of inhibiting wind shear a small cyclone developed it became a subtropical storm at 00 00 utc before executing a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within larger cyclone about 18 hours later storm strengthened and gained enough tropical characteristics to be designated a hurricane accompanied by formation of a pronounced eye feature at time it was situated around 610 miles 1 110 km west southwest of azores although development of a tropical cyclone within a non tropical storm is rare it is not unprecedented an unnamed hurricane in november 1991 also formed in this manner after being classified as a hurricane karl gradually strengthened and its circulation became more distinguished from surrounding cloudiness a trough that emerged from north america steered hurricane eastward and on november 26 it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph 140 km h and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar hpa 29 09 inhg karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards northeast on november 27 storm s eye became more ragged as cyclone passed within 230 miles 370 km of azores and started to show signs of deterioration trough over north atlantic developed into dominant low pressure area and karl turned northward around its periphery karl became extratropical on november 28 and later merged with another approaching system within a day and was declared dissipated by november 29 records and impact right thumb oblique view of hurricane near its peak hurricane karl was unusual in several aspects it developed late in hurricane season which runs from june 1 through november 30 over waters colder than standard limit for tropical cyclone formation it marked farthest north development of a november tropical or subtropical cyclone on record while 1991 unnamed hurricane was farther north it became a subtropical storm late on october 31 and had moved south by november 1 karl was reported at time to be farthest east hurricane during last 10 days of month of november additionally it maintained hurricane intensity until reaching 45 0degn at which point it became extratropical only hurricane lois in 1966 lasted as a hurricane farther north in month of november when karl became a hurricane on november 25 1980 season became notable for having two november hurricanes other was jeanne this tied 1932 and 1969 for record of most november hurricanes which was later accomplished during 1994 season later 2001 broke this record with three hurricanes cyclone never affected land and as a result no deaths or damages occurred one ship to northwest of karl s center recorded 35 mph 55 km h winds and an air pressure of 993 mbar see also 1980 atlantic hurricane season other tropical cyclones named karl references external links preliminary report advisory archive hurricane database karl karl 1980
