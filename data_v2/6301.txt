razing of friesoythe took place on 14 april 1945 during western allies invasion of germany towards end of world war ii in mid april 4th canadian armoured division advancing into north west germany attacked german held town of friesoythe argyll and sutherland highlanders of canada captured town during fighting battalion s commander was killed by a german soldier but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian under this mistaken belief division s commander major general christopher vokes ordered that town be razed in retaliation and it was substantially destroyed twenty german civilians died in friesoythe and surrounding area during two days of fighting and its aftermath similar if usually less extreme events occurred elsewhere in germany as allies advanced in closing weeks of war rubble of town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for division s tanks and heavy vehicles a few days earlier division had destroyed centre of sogel in another reprisal and also used rubble to make roads passable little official notice was taken of incident and canadian army official history glosses over it it is covered in regimental histories of units involved and several accounts of campaign forty years later vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had no great remorse over elimination of friesoythe context allied tactics by september 1944 western allies had reached germany s western border and by end of october had captured aachen first major german city to fall to them over following six months they overran much of western germany in november supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force shaef publicly stated that forces of western allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians however shaef s manual combating guerrilla stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take stern measures against civilians as a rapid response to guerilla attacks although this was in breach of hague conventions frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within western allied forces following shaef s policy united states army forces destroyed german buildings on several occasions sometimes entire villages and took other measures against german civilians french troops took a similar if more rigorous approach to that of americans british commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians and british troops carried out few reprisals first canadian army served in predominately british 21st army group and more frequently retaliated against german civilians than british commander of 4th canadian armoured division major general christopher vokes believed that destroying property was most appropriate way of responding to resistance by german civilians division carried out actions against german property more often than any other canadian formation soviet forces more frequently conducted retaliatory actions than those of western allies soviet union s leadership was concerned about threat of a german resistance movement and soviet forces killed raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks allied attitudes attitude towards germans throughout allied ranks was harsh there was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause anger at casualties they inflicted when war was widely and correctly perceived to be almost over and a general feeling that severe even ruthless treatment of german soldiers and civilians was justified on 15 april british reached bergen belsen concentration camp where inmates had been reduced to cannibalism historian rick atkinson wrote that revelations of april sparked enduring outrage this was case at all levels an american officer wrote attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people should be made to feel full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people us general george patton wrote in his diary in hundreds of villages most of houses are heaps of stone i did most of it when a sniper fired at one of his officers he ordered several german houses to be burnt when commander of us 3rd armored division was killed in action inside germany on 30 march several villages were razed by his irate troops wounded germans captured were shot on spot and at least 45 germans were executed after surrendering an artillery officer wrote home in april we should fire about a thousand rounds into every german town do them good at least one british battalion refused to take waffen ss prisoners shooting those who surrendered an officer of battalion blamed this on ss a british battalion commander summed up risk averse attitude within his unit at this stage of war no one was very keen to earn medals a british pilot wrote it seemed a stupid time to die a british corporal spoke for many when he wrote why don t silly bastards give up some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid april historian max hastings wrote final anglo american drive across germany offered many foolish little battles which wasted men s lives battle for sogel thumb upright 1 15 right alt major general christopher vokes in discussion with brigadier robert standing in a street in sogel on 10 april 1945 in early april 1945 4th canadian armoured division as part of ii canadian corps moved out of eastern netherlands in wake of allied crossing of rhine in operation plunder canadian official history described circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that end of world war ii in europe was close on 4 april argyll and sutherland highlanders of canada part of 10th canadian infantry brigade one of two brigades in division made an assault crossing of ems river and captured town of meppen suffering only one casualty german prisoners included several 17 year old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience division advanced a further to sogel which 1st battalion of lake superior regiment motor captured on 9 april following day it repulsed several german counter attacks before town was declared cleared some german civilians joined fighting and were believed to have killed several canadian soldiers vokes believing civilians needed to be taught a lesson ordered destruction of centre of town this was accomplished with several truck loads of dynamite vokes was aware that these actions violated hague conventions and took care not to issue written instructions soldiers of division started referring to vokes as sod of sogel canadian army official history states battle for friesoythe canadian advance continued across westphalian lowland reaching outskirts of friesoythe a strategic crossroads on 13 april as it was early spring ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off main roads this made friesoythe west of oldenburg on river a potential bottleneck if germans were to hold it bulk of canadians would not be able to continue their advance most of population of 4 000 had evacuated to countryside on 11 12 april several hundred paratroopers from battalion raabe of german 7th parachute division and a number of anti tank guns defended town paratroopers repelled an attack by lake superior regiment which suffered a number of killed and wounded german casualties are unknown vokes ordered resumption of attack by 1st battalion argyll and sutherland highlanders princess louise s commanded by lieutenant colonel frederick wigle argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14 april attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison and argylls secured town by 10 30 during confused fighting approximately 50 german soldiers caught wigle s tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08 30 a firefight broke out resulting in death of wigle and several other soldiers a rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot wigle destruction of friesoythe vokes was furious when he heard of wigle s death he wrote in his autobiography that a first rate officer of mine for whom i had a special regard and affection and in whom i had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command was killed not merely killed it was reported to me but sniped in back vokes wrote i summoned my mac i roared at him i m going to raze that goddam town tell em we re going to level fucking place get people hell out of their houses first vokes s gso1 head of operations staff lieutenant colonel mackenzie robinson obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to local civilians author max hastings writes that earlier incident at sogel contributed to vokes s fury argylls had spontaneously begun to burn friesoythe in reprisal for death of their commander after vokes issued his order town was systematically set on fire with flamethrowers mounted on wasp carriers in side streets soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with phosphorus grenades attack continued for over eight hours and friesoythe was almost totally destroyed as commanding officer of 1st battalion algonquin regiment later wrote raging highlanders cleared remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries we venture to say war diary of 4th canadian armoured brigade records when darkness fell friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of dante s inferno canadian official history states that friesoythe was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal rubble was used to reinforce local roads for division s tanks and heavy transport which had been unable to move up due to main roads near town being badly cratered and smaller roads not being able to stand their weight civilian casualties and damage during fighting around friesoythe and its aftermath ten civilians from town and another ten from surrounding villages were killed there were reports of civilians lying dead in streets according to one german assessment 85 90 percent of town was destroyed during reprisal estimates destruction to have been as high as 90 percent town s website records that of in town proper destroyed and another 30 badly damaged a few days later a canadian nurse wrote home that convent on edge of town was only building left standing in suburb of and buildings were destroyed in 2010 author mark suggested that not all of friesoythe was burnt but its centre was destroyed aftermath argyll s war diary made no mention of their afternoon s activity noting in passing that many fires were raging there is no record of deliberate destruction at division corps or army level war diary of division s 8th anti aircraft regiment records argylls were attacked in that town yesterday by german forces assisted by civilians and today whole town is being systematically razed a stern atonement 1st battalion argyll and sutherland highlanders princess louise s were awarded battle honour friesoythe as were 1st battalion lake superior regiment motor and 1st battalion lincoln and welland regiment on 16 april lincoln and welland regiment attacked garrel south west of friesoythe after a german act of mayor surrendered town but first tank to enter was destroyed by a battalion commander wigle s brother in law ordered that every building which did not show a white flag be fired before it could be carried out order was countermanded and village was spared a canadian force was also authorized to burn down village of mittelsten following what historian perry calls an unnamed transgression they were talked out of this by a canadian engineer unit as mittelsten s civilians were running an army sawmill post war in early 1946 vokes heard an appeal against death sentence of convicted german war criminal kurt meyer referring to his discussions about this vokes said to canadian high commissioner in london i told them of sogel and friesoythe and of prisoners and civilians that my troops had killed in italy and northwest europe vokes commuted sentence to life imprisonment saying there isn t a general or colonel on allied side that i know of who hasn t said well this time we don t want any prisoners canadian army official historian colonel charles stacey visited friesoythe on 15 april he wrote in canadian army official history which was published in 1960 that there is no record of how this destruction came about responding to this historian mark zuehlke wrote that there were records of events in war diaries of several units however he did not believe that stacey s vagueness was an attempt at a cover up in his 1982 memoirs stacey expanded upon official history to comment that only time he saw what could be considered a war crime committed by canadian soldiers was when vokes commented in his autobiography written forty years after event that he had a feeling of no great remorse over elimination of friesoythe be that as it may this position may have been motivated by a continued belief that retaliatory
