writing process after lunch with groening and jean in early 2004 gervais began coming up with a storyline because simpsons had been airing for such a long time he found it difficult to think of a story that had not been done before he finally based plot on british reality series wife swap after a suggestion from his girlfriend jane fallon and wrote character charles to resemble david brent character gervais played on office while working on episode gervais made sure to make use of his favorite characters from simpsons such as lenny he revealed to press for first time in december 2004 that he was writing an episode commenting that i ve got rough idea but this is most intimidating project of my career simpsons is greatest tv show of all time when he showed his first work to groening and jean they liked it groening told press that we could never have written his character way he did and that he caught our tone exactly and then added his own ricky gervais david brent although gervais came up with plot of episode and wrote parts of it on his own whole writing team of simpsons worked on script and pitched ideas as is done with all episodes gervais has said in interviews that he thinks he received too much credit for writing episode claiming he merely sent his plot ideas along with some written scenes to jean through email and it was then staff of show that made it look like a simpsons script he commented in a dazed confused article that i m going to get credit but i think everyone in industry knows it was a joint effort one of scenes that gervais wrote himself was charles love song for marge which later appeared on 2007 soundtrack album simpsons testify impact thumb upright simpsons creator matt groening enjoyed gervais performance alt a smiling man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone when asked in an interview if simpsons staff learned anything from experience of having gervais contribute to show groening said they found out that we could stay true to simpsons sensibility with high velocity visual gags but also honor what ricky does with subtlety and nuance jean added that there was a scene with ricky and julie kavner who plays marge which was longer than scenes we normally do and slower paced but it got a bigger laugh according to don kaplan writing for new york post gervais said to a british newspaper in late 2005 that as a result of working on simpsons and other american shows his connection with american television is deeper than his connection with british television in july 2007 groening stated that he would like to see gervais appear on show again because staff enjoyed his performance he also said that gervais could decide himself if he wanted to return as charles or a new character should he choose to lend

entertainment weekly named gervais one of 21 best simpsons guest stars and in 2007 simon crerar of times listed performance as one of funniest cameos in history of show gervais character charles was cited by guardians johnny dee as one of most memorable characters from simpsons episode on other hand has received mixed response larissa dubecki of age gave it a negative review commenting that this cross pollination of stellar us and british comedies simpsons and office gives rise to great expectations but there s a massive letdown in store for anyone hoping for something approaching even middling efforts of two comedic benchmarks she added that this effort proves that office and simpsons are comedic equivalent of oil and water with former s wry observational style sitting oddly with latter s pop culture pie eating competition dee was more positive writing that he enjoyed it very much and that there were some lovely gags he noted however that he felt it took slightly too much time to set up episode though after wife swap it marched along times critic dominic maxwell thought languid timing that gervais brings to extras and office was wrong here simpsons cameos are normally lean but gervais s shtick ran rampant through second half turning regulars into extras maxwell did find episode fairly entertaining though stating that it was a decent late period simpsons episode and that it featured some fine jokes he concluded that even a middling simpsons episode is still bright and tight and brilliantly rendered so even if this one didn t really work it was still a lot more fun
