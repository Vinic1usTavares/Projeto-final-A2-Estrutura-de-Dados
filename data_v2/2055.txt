battle of heligoland or helgoland was fought on 9 may 1864 during second schleswig war between a danish squadron led by commodore edouard suenson and a joint austro prussian squadron commanded by austrian commodore wilhelm von tegetthoff action came about as a result of danish blockade of german ports in north sea austrians had sent two steam frigates and to reinforce small prussian navy to help break blockade after arriving in north sea tegetthoff joined a prussian aviso and a pair of gunboats to oppose him suenson had available steam frigates and and corvette on morning of 9 may two squadrons encountered each other off island of heligoland then controlled by neutral great britain tegetthoff attacked with his two frigates while slower prussian vessels lagged behind unable to effectively engage danish warships tegetthoff s flagship schwarzenberg bore brunt of danish gunfire and caught fire three times last of which could not be put out quickly and forced tegetthoff to seek shelter in neutral waters around heligoland though denmark claimed a tactical victory in battle danes were forced to end blockade of german coast an armistice came into effect three days after battle of heligoland by time fighting broke out again in june further austrian warships had arrived to strengthen austro prussian naval forces and danes did not seek to challenge them historians opinions on outcome of battle are mixed with some citing withdrawal of tegetthoff s ships and greater damage they sustained as evidence of a tactical victory for suenson other naval historians cite lifting of blockade as a strategic victory for austrians and prussians and others still describe battle as inconclusive battle of heligoland was last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships and it was also last time danish warships fought a major action jylland is preserved in ebeltoft last surviving wooden hulled screw driven warship background in late 1863 tensions began to increase between

schleswig war sondhaus 1997 p 72 crisis erupted in second schleswig war which began on 1 february 1864 after prussian and austrian empires delivered an ultimatum to denmark to cede disputed duchies to austro prussian control at time danish fleet was far superior to prussian naval forces initially available which allowed danes to blockade german coast greene massignani pp 197 198 bulk of prussian fleet was concentrated in baltic sea and austrian fleet was primarily stationed in mediterranean sea also in mediterranean were prussian aviso and gunboats and these vessels were immediately recalled to german waters sondhaus 1997 pp 76 77 in meantime on 30 march danish fleet formed north sea squadron which at time consisted of steam frigate and steam corvettes and commanded by commodore edouard suenson on 6 may frigate relieved dagmar allowing her to be transferred to baltic sea embree p 281 by this time danish squadron had captured fifteen german prizes along with four blockade runners from neutral countries additionally ports of hamburg and bremen were effectively closed to traffic olivier p 56 to reinforce their prussian allies and break blockade austrians assembled a powerful squadron which equaled danish fleet and ordered it to steam from mediterranean sea to north sea to break blockade squadron was to comprise ship of line armored frigates and screw frigates and screw corvette sidewheel gunboats and and gunboats and initially only austrian levant squadron commanded by commodore wilhelm von tegetthoff was ready and so those ships were ordered north in advance of rest of squadron levant squadron centered on schwarzenberg and radetzky arrived in north sea on 1 may tegetthoff s other two vessels corvette and gunboat were unavailable due to boiler trouble and a grounding respectively austrian and prussian squadrons rendezvoused in texel netherlands and tegetthoff added preussischer adler blitz and basilisk to his force tegetthoff took his flotilla to attack danish north sea squadron embree pp 280 massignani p 205 on morning of 7 may tegetthoff s ships spotted british frigate off island of heligoland after tegetthoff closed to determine that aurora was a neutral warship he took his squadron to anchor off island of sylt aurora commanded by francis leopold mcclintock encountered suenson s squadron next day mcclintock informed of last known location of austro

and aurora which had been observing danish squadron took up a position to delineate neutral waters around island a little after 13 30 austrian prussian and danish commanders all ordered their crews to clear for action austro prussian squadron opened fire first at 13 57 with bow guns at a range of about two squadrons in line ahead formation with prussian vessels lagging behind closed to about and passed in opposite directions firing broadsides at each other a shell from niels juel struck schwarzenberg and killed or wounded most of men on one of her starboard guns embree pp 282 283 turned his ships back to south to chase suenson who in turn altered course to try to cut off prussian gunboats as schwarzenberg turned distance closed to just over and she came under fire from all three danish vessels jylland and then shifted fire to radetzky prussian vessels remained on disengaged side of austrian frigates firing at danish vessels with little effect one of austrian vessels scored a hit on jylland that killed or wounded all men in one of her gun crews crews of guns on either side fled their positions at sight of carnage until one of men returned calling his comrades to join him during this period of battle schwarzenberg suffered multiple shell hits and was set afire three times her crew extinguished first two but third in her proved to be too difficult to fight embree pp 283 284 by 16 00 schwarzenberg began to withdraw from action her forward rigging and forecastle burning badly tegetthoff decided to break off engagement and fled to neutral waters around heligoland as tegetthoff s ships began with withdraw one of them scored a hit on jyllands rudder which prevented suenson from being able to effectively pursue retreating austrians and prussians greene massignani pp 207 208 mcclintock took aurora between two squadrons to deter suenson from pursuing tegetthoff in violation of british neutrality two austrian frigates had suffered a total of 36 men killed and 108 wounded of those 31 killed and 81 wounded aboard schwarzenberg and both vessels were damaged danish vessels suffered 14 men killed and 54 wounded and only niels juel was damaged in action warren gould p 966

suenson waited outside british zone of but austrian prussian squadron was able to escape during night to cuxhaven arriving at about 04 00 on 10 may on reaching port austrian ships began to repair damage sustained in battle suenson sent his casualties ashore and resumed patrolling in southern north sea between heligoland and elbe day of battle two sides had signed an armistice in london that took effect on 12 may temporarily ending fighting greene massignani p 208 armistice lasted until 26 june when fighting broke out again on land following day a second austrian squadron which included ship of line kaiser armored frigate don juan d austria and two smaller vessels under vice admiral bernhard von wullerstorf urbair arrived to reinforce tegetthoff s ships now outnumbered danish fleet remained in port for rest of war and did not seek battle with austro prussian squadron instead austrian and prussian naval forces supported operations to capture islands off western danish coast these advances coupled with capture of island of als in baltic sea forced danes to seek a second armistice on 29 june greene massignani pp 210 211 denmark claimed to have won battle of heligoland though they were no longer able to enforce a blockade on northern german ports tegetthoff himself claimed a draw but he was promoted to rear admiral as a reward for his actions during battle sondhaus 2001 p 93 opinions of naval historians on outcome of battle are similarly mixed anthony sokol a historian of austrian navy states that in spite of damage they had sustained austrians had won a strategic victory citing fact that danish blockade had been lifted sokol p 34 john greene and massignani state that heligoland was tegetthoff s day though noting that suenson could have won a victory had jylland not been rendered unmaneuverable at end of action on other hand david zabecki affirms argument that battle was a tactical danish victory while noting lifting of blockade david olivier described battle as inconclusive though also noted end of blockade jylland is today located in a drydock in a maritime museum in ebeltoft denmark she is last surviving screw driven wooden hulled
