stephen anthony mcnallen born october 15 1948 is an american proponent of modern pagan new religious movement of heathenry and a white nationalist activist he founded asatru folk assembly afa which he led from 1994 until 2016 having previously been founder of viking brotherhood and asatru free assembly born in breckenridge texas mcnallen developed an interest in pre christian scandinavia while in college in 1969 70 he founded viking brotherhood through which he printed a newsletter runestone to promote a form of heathenry that he called asatru after spending four years in united states army he transformed viking brotherhood into asatru free assembly afa through which he promoted heathenry within american pagan community he espoused belief which he named metagenetics that religions are connected to genetic inheritance thus arguing that heathenry was only suitable for those of northern european ancestry a growing membership generated internal conflict within afa resulting in mcnallen s decision to expel those with neo nazi and racial extremist views from organisation under increasing personal strain in 1987 he disbanded assembly moving to northern california mcnallen began a career as a school teacher during summer vacations he travelled world as a military journalist writing articles for soldier of fortune magazine concerned by what he saw as growth of liberal universalist ideas in heathenry he returned to active involvement in heathen movement in mid 1990s establishing asatru folk assembly which was headquartered in grass valley california in 1997 he was involved in establishment of international asatru odinist alliance alongside valgard murray s asatru alliance and british odinic rite he brought greater attention to his group after they became involved in debate surrounding kennewick man arguing that it constituted evidence for a european presence in prehistoric america in 21st century he became more politically active becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and white nationalist groups linked to alt right movement mcnallen is a controversial figure in heathen and wider pagan community his espousal of right wing ethnonationalist ideas and his insistence that heathenry should be reserved for those of northern european ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both pagans and mainstream media conversely many on extreme right of heathen movement have accused him of being a race traitor for his opposition to neo nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism biography early life 1948 76 mcnallen was born in rural town of breckenridge texas on october 15 1948 to a family of practicing roman catholics after high school he attended midwestern state university in wichita falls texas while there he began to investigate alternative religions reading about modern pagan religion of wicca and writings of occultist aleister crowley in his freshman year of college he read a novel viking by edison marshall which generated his interest in societies of pre christian scandinavia according to him upon reading this book he got hooked on spirit of north being attracted to vikings by what he perceived as their warlike nature their will to power and their assertion of self in 1968 or 1969 he dedicated himself to worship of deities found in norse mythology and remained a solitary devotee of theirs for about two years he later noted that on initially becoming a heathen he went through a stridently anti christian phase and that while he later mellowed in his opinion of christianity and christians he still believed religion to be a faulty faith a foreign imposition on european soil which had eroded our traditional culture and done us great damage in 1969 70 mcnallen founded viking brotherhood issuing a viking manifesto in which he stated that brotherhood was dedicated to preserving promoting and practicing norse religion as it was epitomized during viking age and to further moral and ethical values of courage individualism and independence which characterized viking way of life while group placed greater emphasis on promoting what mcnallen perceived as viking ideals courage honor and freedom rather than on explicitly religious goals in 1972 they gained tax exempt status as a religious organization from internal revenue service in winter of 1971 72 he began publishing a newsletter runestone using a typewriter and mimeograph machine he gained his first eleven subscribers through an advert that he placed in fate magazine he initially used term norse religion to describe heathen religion that he was practicing before later adopting term from work of danish heathen else christensen he then changed it once again this time to asatru which he had discovered in magnus magnusson s book hammer of north and subsequently popularized within american heathen community during his college years mcnallen had been a cadet in reserve officers training corps and on completion received a degree in political science after completing his college education he joined united states army remaining with them for four years volunteering for service in vietnam war before being stationed in west germany although frustrated at what he described as authoritarian stupidity of army it impacted his views on warrior ethics and warrior ideals he retained his interest in heathenry while a member of army and circa 1974 adopted belief that there was an intrinsic connection between norse gods and humans of northern european descent after his discharge from army in 1976 mcnallen hitchhiked across sahara desert before returning to europe and then to united states there he settled in berkeley california asatru free assembly and journalistic career 1976 93 on his return to united states in 1976 he transformed his viking brotherhood into asatru free assembly afa sociologist of religion jennifer snook described it as first national heathen organization in united states while according to religious studies scholars michael f strmiska and baldur a sigurvinsson afa established many of important organizational and ritual structures that remain operative in american heathenry into 21st century initially meeting in backroom of an insurance agency owned by group member dick johnson group later established a store front office in breckenridge while through afa mcnallen continued publishing runestone and produced booklets on asatru he also began conducting religious ceremonies or blots and lectured at pagan events across u s he established groups known as guilds within afa to focus on particular endeavours such as mead brewing guild and warrior guild latter published a quarterly wolf age in which mcnallen displayed his fascination for warrior ethics in early 1980s mcnallen used runestone to promote his theory of metagenetics idea that spirituality or religion was encoded in genetic material and thus passed down to one s descendants in formulating this concept he was influenced by his reading of jungian psychology with its concept of archetypes existing within a collective unconscious accordingly he described asatru as an expression of soul of our nordic race and thought that it was a real mistake for anyone not of northern european ancestry to follow heathenry not everyone in afa embraced this theory with it being rejected for instance by prominent afa member robert stine although it would later be developed in new directions by heathen academic observers have characterised metagenetics as racist and as pseudoscience one commentator noted that afa membership at time was largely a mix of hippies and neo nazis as membership of afa grew there were an increased number of internal conflicts often along ideological lines this was exacerbated by fact that all affiliated groups known as kindreds were autonomous while afa promoted an individualistic ethos which allowed for a diversity of opinions this generated conflicts at afa s annual meetings or althings for instance when michael valgard murray one of neo nazis within afa threatened to kill a fellow member of assembly because he was gay mcnallen did not share these nazi sympathies disapproving of nazi ideal of a centralized totalitarian state which he believed was anathema to heathen ideal of freedom he also wanted to keep his religion apart from become an adjunct to a specifically political movement accordingly he sought to push out neo nazis and other racial extremists from group in 1978 he demanded that afa members be prohibited from wearing nazi uniforms and insignia at their events among those who left afa as a result were wyatt who was appalled by what he described as mcnallen s soft stance on race and middle of road politics and neo nazi heathen jost turner who was mcnallen s brother in law mcnallen nevertheless remained close to turner and his family after division as a result of such changes by late 1970s there was a clear division between mcnallen s afa which emphasized religious over racial political aims and christensen s odinist fellowship which placed far greater emphasis on latter while autonomous nature of different afa affiliated individuals and groups meant that mcnallen and his wife maddy hutter had little power they bore brunt of responsibility of running assembly and organizing its althings they were also impacted by a downturn in texan economy with mcnallen losing his job as a jail guard bankrupt and frustrated mcnallen and other senior figures in afa found that they were unable to organise group s seventh althing for 1987 seeking to ensure that it would continue regardless mcnallen assembled a committee of afa members southern heathen leadership conference which issued a document declaring that new membership would be frozen that afa responsibilities would be divided more widely and that mcnallen and hutter should take a vacation from their organizational chores however in 1987 mcnallen shut down runestone and dissolved afa altogether relocating to northern california however according to strmiska and sigurvinsson afa had planted seeds that would take strong root as a replacement for assembly murray established asatru alliance which organised eighth american althing for arizona in june 1988 in 1986 87 mcnallen worked as a peace officer in stephens county texas sheriff s office jail and sheila kept books for an oil company in 1986 he and sheila moved to semi deserted mining town of forest in mountains of california and there he earned teaching credentials before teaching science and mathematics at a junior high school for six years during his summer vacations he travelled abroad during which he met with guerrilla groups active in various parts of world writing articles about them for magazines like soldier of fortune he later related that this experience convinced him of need for and ethnic separatism across world mcnallen also joined u s national guard and was called up during 1992 los angeles riots return to heathenry 1994 2016 in mid 1990s mcnallen returned to an active involvement in u s pagan scene aided by his new partner sheila edlund they established their own heathen group kindred which they affiliated to murray s aa he was upset by growth of a universalist heathen group that welcomed members regardless of ethnic or racial background he later referred to this as a corrupt faction that denied innate connection of germanic religions and germanic people expressing anger at increasing domination of heathenry by liberals affirmative action black and new agers in response to this he decided to re establish afa in 1994 this time calling it asatru folk assembly this group based its headquarters in grass valley and was structurally very similar to old afa reviving mcnallen s runestone publication albeit in a yearbook format afa served much same constituency as established aa with religious studies scholar jeffrey kaplan believing that its purpose in heathen community was therefore largely superfluous seeking to promote heathenry to a wider audience mcnallen also established asatru community church which held sunday services twice a month in community room of nevada county library he later acknowledged that it was not particularly successful thumb left 300px mcnallen left with michael valgard murray center and eric wood at 2000 iaoa althing during 1990s mcnallen befriended prominent heathen michael moynihan later recommending and selling moynihan s journal tyr on afa s website mcnallen and afa also appear to have cordial relations with racial extremist ron mcvan co founder of wotansvolk publishing some of mcvan s writings in runestone when in 1990s christensen was arrested for drug smuggling mcnallen teamed up with murray to form a defense fund for her in september 1997 he was a signatory to foundation of international asatru odinist alliance iaoa a global union of folkish heathen groups alongside murray of aa and of british odinic rite they were later joined by representatives of french and german branches of odinic rite before union terminated several years later alliance convened an international meeting or althing every three years in 1997 mcnallen married sheila edlund at seventeenth althing held in utah ceremony was officiated by murray in 1999 afa purchased land in higher sierra of northern california there establishing a space where heathen kindreds could meet together to practice their religion in keeping with his ethnonationalist beliefs mcnallen endorsed a 1993 declaration of war against exploiters of lakota spirituality expressing opinion that white people should resurrect religions of their european ancestors rather than adopting belief systems of native americans however he came into conflict with native american communities over discovery of kennewick man a prehistoric skeleton unearthed in washington state while local native communities viewed body as one of their ancestors and sought its repatriation to them mcnallen argued that it was caucasian in october 1996 afa filed a suit in u s district court of portland to prevent kennewick man being given to native communities under native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra court ruled that human remains were not native american within meaning of nagpra mcnallen expressed view that native american communities wanted to prevent forensic testing of kennewick man s body because they feared that it would prove that he had been caucasian thus establishing that there had been a caucasian presence in prehistoric americas he believed that caucasians had entered americas via bering strait at around same time as ancestors of native americans did but that caucasians were subsequently wiped out he warned that that can happen to us too and thus steps should be taken to preserve existence of north america s european population in 2000 afa withdrew from its involvement in kennewick man legal case stating that it had run out of funds to continue publicity surrounding case nevertheless brought afa to far greater attention during late 1990s afa began promoting what it termed tribalism encouraging heathens to form networks of extended families to help secure religion s future by mid 2001 mcnallen and other figures in leadership felt that they were again overworked and overstretched and so tried to reduce group s hierarchical structure by abandoning concept of membership in 21st century afa made significant inroads online establishing a homepage blog podcast online radio as well as accounts on facebook and youtube around same time it began to promote writings of nouvelle droite authors such as alain de benoist selling an english language translation of latter s being a pagan on its website growing political activity at turn of 21st century mcnallen decided to embark on more specifically political activity becoming president of european american issues forum a group devoted to advancing rights of white americans of which he had been a longstanding member group a scholar of religion later noted rode dangerous margins of racist politics however finding job stressful and afflicted with colon cancer he later resigned from presidency in 2009 mcnallen was invited to international asatru summer camp but this was opposed by many of groups attending who argued that he should not be invited because of what they perceived as his racist views a number of european heathen groups such as norway s bifrost and swedish sas threatened to boycott event as a result of mcnallen s invite in 2010 he contributed an article to newly founded webzine com founded by white nationalist richard b spencer which was featured alongside articles by other white nationalists like jared taylor and kevin b macdonald spencer noted that initial articles for this website represented first stage of alt right movement in 2011 afa sent a contingent to annual conference of a spencer s white nationalist organization national policy institute in what some figures close to mcnallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members after this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against mcnallen and afa from various parts of pagan blogosphere in december 2012 mcnallen created facebook page green asatru to promote environmental ideas within heathenry in june 2013 mcnallen started non profit organization forever elephants to combat ivory poaching in africa using facebook to promote this cause in 2014 he retired from his profession as a juvenile corrections officer where he had been employed for previous five years in 2015 he published asatru a native european spirituality it was reviewed by religious studies scholar jefferson calico for pomegranate international journal of pagan studies in which he noted that book was an important moment for heathen movement being comprehensive and expansive touching thoughtfully on numerous important aspects of faith calico also noted that mcnallen clearly has his legacy in view throughout this book apparent in self referential tone that occasionally surfaces retirement 2016 present in 2016 mcnallen stood down as head of afa and was replaced by matt flavel allen turnage and patricia hall he initially announced his desire to focus on new projects as a writer and religious leader that year he angered many universalist heathens with a facebook post responding to alleged sexual assault of white women by arab men in germany germany that is german people not sellout traitors like merkel deserve our full support where are freikorps when we need them positive reference to freikorps right wing paramilitaries who carried out street violence and political assassinations between world wars brought much criticism several months after mcnallen s resignation from afa leadership group posted a message online stating that afa would like to make it clear that we believe gender is not a social construct it is a beautiful gift from holy powers and from our ancestors afa celebrates our feminine ladies our masculine gentlemen and above all our beautiful white children post brought accusations of racism heathens who had not commented on afa before denounced it afa in turn called its critics social justice warriors in march 2017 mcnallen spoke out on issue in a youtube video here he claimed allegiance to white race and to white nationalist politics also expressing allegiance to 14 words a prominent slogan in white supremacist circles in 2018 southern poverty law center added asatru folk assembly to its list of hate groups describing it as a neo volkisch hate group splc neo volkisch online accessed 6 august 2018 personality and personal life calico described mcnallen as having a highly eclectic personality fascinated by political cultural technological and occult issues he characterized him as a genuinely charismatic man who commands a presence and who was also a man of both vision and perseverance he also noted that when mcnallen was writing about himself using third person he betrayed sort of narcissistic self involvement that might characterize psychology of a charismatic religious leader founder of a religious movement views on race and politics in an online video mcnallen insisted that race is real it is not a social construct and has pointed to writers like nicholas wade in defense of this point mcnallen also believes in an integral link connecting one s genetic or racial heritage to one s religion he thus considers ancient religion of aztecs to be inscribed on subconscious of contemporary mexicans and ancient religion of norse to be inscribed on subconscious of those descended from ancient north europeans he regards heathenry as belonging to all people descended from ancient northern europeans and wants to make it as accessible as possible to this demographic arguing that it is religion best suited to fill spiritual yearning of many white americans while typically linking heathenry to peoples descended from ancient northern europeans in some contexts mcnallen has referred to a broader pan european identity stating that european cultures are all unique unique that is as variants on basic european pattern he has sought to provide a theoretical basis for this folkish heathen belief calling it metagenetics this is belief that religious and cultural practices become encoded in dna and are passed down generations in this manner he also ties this idea in with concepts drawn from jungian psychology arguing that archetypes are distinct to specific racial groups and are passed down genetically while initially presenting this idea using scientific language during 1980s calico noted that mcnallen s later discussions on subject appeared more like race mysticism his motivation in devising metagenetics was in part to make his religion more appealing to a broader range of americans and to distance his movement from neo nazi and other explicitly white supremacist movements who wanted to incorporate it into their ideas of race war he has expressed view that his afa exhibits middle ground on racial issues on one hand we were proud of our european heritage and we actively espoused interests of european descended peoples on other hand we opposed totalitarianism and racial hatred convinced that decency and honor required us to treat individuals of all racial groups with respect according to southern poverty law center although mcnallen has attempted to evade nazi odinist identification he has expressed sympathy with what he sees as legitimate frustrations of white men who are concerned for their kind for mcnallen white americans are essentially europeans because of their genetic ancestry he has penned articles on what he fears is coming extinction of white race arguing that in united states white people will be largely replaced by hispanics with concomitant demographic shift resulting in a decreased political influence for country s white population he claims that a lack of clear ethnic identity has left european americans in a socially disadvantaged position claiming that results are clear for all to see more of us are dying than are being born our children look to other peoples and cultures for their models our heritage and history are steadily displaced this is road to marginalization and extinction according to snook mcnallen s concerns reflect white american resentment of a perceived loss of status and privilege in modern multicultural society in particularly divisive political times she added that a repeated element of his argument presentation of white people as victims was common throughout white supremacist discourse mcnallen does not consider himself to be a racist arguing that racism entails expressing a belief in racial superiority a viewpoint he does not hold he insists that his support for racial separatism does not necessitate a dislike much less hatred for other racial groups however in may 2015 magazine vice published an article in which it accused mcnallen of being a racist who manipulated ancient norse beliefs for his own hateful devices american heathen collective circle issued articles in which they described mcnallen as an active participant in american neo fascist radical traditionalist movement and an unapologetic advocate for white nationalism conversely many in extreme racialist wing of heathenry have accused mcnallen of being a race traitor because he has not unequivocally endorsed white supremacist and neo nazi perspectives they have commented negatively on his refusal to work for survival of aryan race and accused him of promoting cowardly pc politics religious studies scholar jeffrey kaplan stated that mcnallen s politics fit comfortably into right wing of political spectrum although added that in heathen community mcnallen suddenly becomes very much man of centre and is thus a legitimate target for both sides historian of religion mattias gardell characterized mcnallen as a libertarian mcnallen rejects descriptor conservative expressing view that there is little in modern western society worthy of conserving mcnallen envisions a future stateless american confederacy based on ecologically sustainable decentralized tribal groups he has also expressed support for all ethnic separatist movements across world including those of tibetan igbo karen and afrikaner people this has attracted criticism from racial extremist wing of heathen community who have claimed that it detracts from focus on white or aryan struggle against other racial groups according to katja lane co founder of extreme racialist wotansvolk mcnallen is promoting everything but aryan cause however in writings and youtube videos stephen mcnallen has spoken favorably of and fourteen words of david lane networking with red ice tv a social media outlet of alt right in early 2017 asatru folk assembly updated its declaration of purpose primary change in document was northern european folk being changed to ethnic european folk with an indication in text of that meaning white people http www runestone org about purpose html declaration of purpose reception and legacy calico noted that mcnallen represented torchbearer for folkish heathenry in united states he added that mcnallen s was one name associated with birth growth and controversy of american asatru more than any other some u s heathens regard him as father of american heathenry although his place in movement is disputed by many practitioners who reject his folkish approach to religion calico thought that mcnallen deserves to be noted as one of many american religious dissenters who because of strong personal conviction and vision stood their ground in face of hardship and opposition bibliography a bibliography of mcnallen s works have been provided on afa s website year of
