scelidosaurus with intended meaning of limb lizard from greek skelis skelis meaning rib of beef and sauros sauros meaning lizard liddell scott 1980 greek english lexicon abridged edition oxford university press oxford uk is a genus of herbivorous armoured ornithischian dinosaur from jurassic of england scelidosaurus lived during early jurassic period during sinemurian to pliensbachian stages around 191 million years ago this genus and related genera at time lived on supercontinent laurasia its fossils have been found near charmouth in dorset england and are known for their excellent preservation scelidosaurus has been called earliest complete dinosaur norman david 2001 scelidosaurus earliest complete dinosaur in armored dinosaurs pp 3 24 bloomington indiana university press same claim has been made for compsognathus it is most completely known dinosaur of british isles scelidosaurus is currently only classified dinosaur found in ireland despite this a modern description is still lacking after initial finds in 1850s comparative anatomist richard owen named and described scelidosaurus in 1859 only one species scelidosaurus harrisonii named by owen in 1861 is considered valid today although one other species was proposed in 1996 scelidosaurus was about long it was a largely quadrupedal animal feeding on low scrubby plants parts of which were bitten off by small elongated head to be processed in large gut scelidosaurus was lightly armoured protected by long horizontal rows of keeled oval scutes that stretched along neck back and tail one of oldest known and most primitive of thyreophorans exact placement of scelidosaurus within this group has been subject of debate for nearly 150 years this was not helped by limited additional knowledge about early evolution of armoured dinosaurs today most evidence indicates that scelidosaurus is sister taxon to two main clades of thyreophora stegosauria and ankylosauria description size and posture thumb right size comparison a full grown scelidosaurus was rather small compared to most later non avian dinosaurs but it was a medium sized species in early jurassic some scientists have estimated a length of 4 metres 13 ft in 2010 gregory s paul gave a body length of 3 8 metres 12 5 ft and a weight of 270 paul g s 2010 princeton field guide to dinosaurs princeton university press p 217 scelidosaurus was quadrupedal with hindlimbs longer than forelimbs it may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees but its arms were relatively long indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture a trackway from holy cross mountains of poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner hinting that scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought skull thumb left skull cast of main david sole specimen head of scelidosaurus was small about twenty centimetres long and elongated skull was low in side view and triangular in top view longer than it was wide similar to that of earlier ornithischians snout largely formed by nasal bones was flat on top scelidosaurus still had five pairs of fenestrae skull openings seen in basal ornithischians apart from nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs fenestra and upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown as with many later armoured forms in fact upper temporal fenestrae were very large forming conspicuous round openings in top of rear skull serving as attachment areas for powerful muscles that closed lower jaws eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by prefrontal bone behind it upper rim of eye socket was formed by supraorbital bone a study by susannah maidment e a concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements one in front next in rear and third at inner side maidment s c r porro l b 2010 homology of palpebral and origin of supraorbital ossifications in ornithischian dinosaurs 43 95 111 premaxilla bone forming snout tip was short and no predentary bone core of lower beak on tip of stout lower jaws has been found so horny beak that is assumed present with all ornithischians was likely very short its teeth were longer and more triangular in side view than in later armoured dinosaurs there were at least five teeth in each premaxilla and at least nineteen in maxilla and sixteen in dentary of lower jaw however number of maxillary and dentary teeth were established with incomplete skull of one of first specimens found actual numbers might have ranged up to about two dozen premaxillary teeth were somewhat longer and recurved to rear they gradually approach form of maxillary teeth beginning to show denticles crowns of maxillary and dentary teeth have denticles on their edges and a swollen basis postcranial skeleton thumb thorax of neotype vertebral column of scelidosaurus contained at least six neck vertebrae seventeen dorsal vertebrae four sacral vertebrae and at least thirty five tail vertebrae though perhaps actual total of cervical vertebrae was as high as seven or eight neck was only moderately long torso was relatively flat in side view however despite belly being broad it was not extremely vertically compressed as with ankylosaurs but taller than wide last three dorsal vertebrae had no ribs spines of sacral vertebrae touched each other but were not fused into a plate quickly tapering tail was relatively short probably representing about half of body length tail chevrons were strongly inclined to rear hip area and tail base were stiffened by large numbers of ossified tendons thumb upright left leg of s harrisonii scapula was short with a moderately expanded upper end coracoid was circular in side view elements of forelimb were generally moderately long straight and stout hand is only known from recent discoveries and has not yet been described in rather wide pelvis ilium was straight in side view its front blade was rod shaped and moderately splayed to outside creating room for belly this was reinforced by sacral ribs becoming longer towards front sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with ilium but were not fused into a sacral yoke pubis featured a short prepubis pubis shaft was straight running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end thighbone was straight in side view in front view it was somewhat bowed to outside its head was not separated from shaft by a real neck while major trochanter was at about same level as head lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft at it rear side femur mid shaft featured a well developed drooping fourth trochanter a process for attachment of retractor tail muscle musculus caudofemoralis longus lower leg was somewhat shorter than thighbone tibia had a wide upper end with a cnemial crest protruding well to front tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70deg compared to upper part turning foot strongly to outside foot was very large and wide fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but other four were robust scelidosaurus had four large toes with innermost digit being smallest fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to outside of foot to improve stability claws were flat hoof shaped and curved to inside armour thumb cast of a nearly complete skeleton found in 2000 by david sole showing fossilised bony scutes charmouth heritage coast centre most obvious feature of scelidosaurus is its armour consisting of bony scutes embedded in skin these osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel rows down animal s body osteoderms are today found in skin of crocodiles armadillos and some lizards osteoderms of scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape most were smaller or larger oval plates with a high keel on outside highest point of keel positioned more to rear some scutes were small flat and hollowed out at inside larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal rows there were three rows of these along each side of torso scutes of lowest lateral row were more conical rather than blade like osteoderms of scutellosaurus martill d

of smaller oval keeled scutes were present there were in total four rows of large scutes on tail one at top midline one at midline of underside and one at each tail side whether midline tail scutes continued over torso and neck to front is unknown and unlikely for neck though scelidosaurus is often pictured this way thumb left restoration showing bipedal posture as indicated by a fossil trackway neck had at each side two rows of large scutes osteoderms of lower neck row were very large flat and plate like first osteoderms of top neck rows formed a pair of unique three pointed scutes directly behind head these points seem to have been connected by tendons to rear joint processes postzygapophyses of axis vertebra in general scutes were larger at front of torso osteoderms diminishing towards rear especially on surface of thighs smallest flat round scutes might have filled room between larger osteoderm rows perhaps a row of vertical osteoderms was present on upper arms compared to later ankylosauria scelidosaurus was lightly armoured without continuous plating spikes or pelvic shield rough areas on skull and lower jaws indicate presence of skin ossifications some of latest specimens found show partly different osteoderms including scutes on which keel is more like a thorn or spike these specimens also seem to have little horns on rear corners of head placed on squamosal bones fossilized skin impressions have also been found between bony scutes scelidosaurus had rounded non overlapping scales like present gila monster lambert d 1993 ultimate dinosaur book dorling kindersley

larger scutes fusing into multi plate armour seen in genera such as ankylosaurus history of discovery thumb lithograph of partial neotype skull during 1850s quarry owner james harrison of charmouth west dorset of england found fossils from cliffs of black ven between charmouth and lyme regis that were quarried possibly for raw material for manufacture of cement some of these he gave to collector and retired general surgeon henry norris in 1858 norris and harrison sent some fragmentary limb bones to professor richard owen of british museum natural history london today natural history museum

stressed how remarkable it is that owen who previously had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals largely neglected scelidosaurus though it could serve as a prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil was one of most complete dinosaurs found at that time norman explained this by owen s excessive workload in this period including several administrative functions polemics with fellow scientists and study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals such as archaeopteryx norman d b 2000 professor richard owen and important but neglected dinosaur scelidosaurus harrisonii historical biology 14 235 253 norman also pointed out that owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas it would have been a fish eater and partially sea dwelling thumb left bmnh 39496 first lectotype of scelidosaurus that proved to be a theropod instead owen had not indicated a holotype in 1888 richard lydekker while cataloguing bmnh fossils designated some of hindlimb fragments described in 1861 specimen bmnh 39496 consisting of a lower part of a femur and an upper part of tibia and fibula together forming a knee joint as type specimen hereby implicitly choosing them as lectotype of scelidosaurus lydekker gave no reason for this choice lydekker r 1888 catalogue of fossil reptilia and amphibia in british

considered a member of scelidosauridae in later twentieth century term was used for an assembly of primitive ornithischians close to ancestry of ankylosaurs and stegosaurs such as scutellosaurus

thulborn of university of queensland attempted to reclassify scelidosaurus as an ornithopod similar to tenontosaurus or iguanodon thulborn argued scelidosaurus was a lightly built bipedal dinosaur adapted for running thulborn s 1977 theories on genus have since been rejected this debate is still ongoing at this time scelidosaurus is considered to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids

thyreophoran trackway in hettangian of central france c r acad sci paris 2 328 215 219 ancestors of these basal thyreophorans evolved from early ornithischians similar to during late triassic paleobiology thumb close up of tooth and left side of neotype skull diet like most other thyreophorans scelidosaurus is known to be herbivorous however while some later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material scelidosaurus had smaller less complex leaf shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement due to a short jaw joint paul barrett concluded that scelidosaurus fed with a puncture crush system of tooth on tooth action with a precise but simple up and down jaw movement in which food was mashed between inner side of upper teeth and outer side of lower teeth without teeth actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on lower teeth alone in this aspect it resembled stegosaurids which also bore primitive teeth and simple jaws its diet would have consisted of ferns or conifers as grasses did not evolve until late into cretaceous period after scelidosaurus was long extinct another similarity with stegosaurs is narrow head which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high quality fodder however barrett pointed out that for an animal size of scelidosaurus with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals that are often critically dependent on it norman concluded that scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation with a height up to one metre raising itself on its hindlimbs alone could have vertically increased feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible but norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour see also timeline of ankylosaur research references external links ankylosauromorpha at tree of life scelidosauridae category thyreophorans
