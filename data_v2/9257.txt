noxious weeds exotic pest plant council p 1 accessed 4 10 2010 term invasive is often poorly defined or very subjective and some broaden term to include indigenous or native species that have colonized natural areas for example deer considered by some to be their native zones and adjacent suburban gardens in northeastern and pacific coast regions of united states definition of native is also sometimes controversial for example ancestors of equus ferus modern horses evolved in north america and radiated to eurasia before becoming locally extinct upon returning to north america in 1493 during their hominid assisted migration it is debatable as to whether they were native or exotic to continent of their evolutionary ancestors notable examples of invasive plant species include kudzu vine andean pampas grass and yellow starthistle animal examples include new zealand mud snail feral pigs european rabbits grey squirrels domestic cats carp and ferrets invasion of long established ecosystems by organisms from distant bio regions is a natural phenomenon but has been accelerated massively by humans from their earliest migrations through to age of discovery and now international trade causes scientists include species and ecosystem factors among mechanisms that when combined establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species species based mechanisms while all species compete to survive invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete native species in some cases competition is about rates of growth and reproduction in other cases species interact with each other more directly researchers disagree about usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers one study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species 86 of invasive species could be identified from traits alone another study found invasive species tended to have only a small subset of presumed traits and that many similar traits were found in noninvasive species requiring other explanations common invasive species traits include following fast growth rapid reproduction high dispersal ability phenotype plasticity ability to alter growth form to suit current conditions tolerance of a wide range of environmental conditions ecological competence ability to live off of a wide range of food types generalist association with humans prior successful invasions typically an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location at low population densities it can be difficult for introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established repeated patterns of human movement such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment also known as a high pressure an introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as nutrients light physical space water or food if these species evolved under great competition or predation then new environment may host fewer able competitors allowing invader to proliferate quickly ecosystems which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as zero sum systems in which any gain for invader is a loss for native however such unilateral competitive superiority and extinction of native species with increased populations of invader is not rule invasive species often coexist with native species for an extended time and gradually superior competitive ability of an invasive species becomes apparent as its population grows larger and denser and it adapts to its new location right thumb upright 1 8 lantana growing in abandoned citrus plantation moshav hemed israel an invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species such as deep water sources accessed by a long taproot or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types for example barbed goatgrass aegilops was introduced to california on serpentine soils which have low water retention low nutrient levels a high magnesium calcium ratio and possible heavy metal toxicity plant populations on these soils tend to show low density but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds modifying abiotic factors or affecting behaviour of herbivores creating a positive or negative impact on other species some species like produce allelopathic compounds that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species and influence some soil processes like carbon and nitrogen mineralization other species like gigantea facilitates recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development other examples are centaurea solstitialis yellow starthistle and centaurea diffusa diffuse knapweed these eastern european noxious weeds have spread through western and west coast states experiments show that 8 a chemical produced at root of c diffusa has a negative effect only on plants that have not co evolved with it such co evolved native plants have also evolved defenses c diffusa and c solstitialis do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others conversely examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation bromus tectorum originally from eurasia is highly fire adapted it not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases frequency and intensity heat of fires by providing large amounts of dry detritus during fire season in western north america in areas where it is widespread it has altered local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive frequent fires allowing b tectorum to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range ecological facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species for example zebra mussels increase habitat complexity on lake floors providing crevices in which invertebrates live this increase in complexity together with nutrition provided by waste products of mussel filter feeding increases density and diversity of benthic invertebrate communities ecosystem based mechanisms in ecosystems amount of available resources and extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines effects of additional species on ecosystem in stable ecosystems equilibrium exists in use of available resources these mechanisms describe a situation in which ecosystem has suffered a disturbance which changes fundamental nature of ecosystem when changes such as a forest fire occur normal succession favors native grasses and forbs an introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species squeezing them out nitrogen and phosphorus are often limiting factors in these situations every species occupies a niche in its native ecosystem some species fill large and varied roles while others are highly specialized some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species and they also can create new niches an example of this type can be found within delicata species of skink ecosystem changes can alter species distributions for example edge effects describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside boundary habitat one interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments when bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in population size and may constrict genetic variation individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance this conversion can actually lead to increased variance in founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution following invasion events selection may initially act on capacity to disperse as well as physiological tolerance to new stressors in environment adaptation then proceeds to respond to selective pressures of new environment these responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change or presence of native species whether it be predator or prey adaptations include changes in morphology physiology phenology and plasticity rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment intraspecific phenotypic plasticity pre adaptation and post introduction evolution are all major factors in adaptive evolution plasticity in populations allows room for changes to better suit individual in its environment this is key in adaptive evolution because main goal is how to best be suited to ecosystem that species has been introduced ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness pre adaptations and evolution after initial introduction also play a role in success of introduced species if species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to area that it is introduced it is more likely to fare better in new environment this in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction all determine if species will be able to become established in new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive ecology traits of invaded ecosystems in 1958 charles s elton claimed that ecosystems with higher species diversity were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion this debate hinged on spatial scale at which invasion studies were performed and issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011 small scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion while large scale studies tended to show reverse latter result may be a side effect of invasives ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered however this spatial scale dependent pattern of effects of invasion on diversity does not seem to hold true when invader is a vertebrate thumb right brown tree snake invasion was more likely in ecosystems that were similar to one in which potential invader evolved island ecosystems may be more prone to invasion because their species faced few strong competitors and predators or because their distance from colonizing species populations makes them more likely to have open niches an example of this phenomenon was decimation of native bird populations on guam by invasive brown tree snake invasive species animals brown tree snake national agricultural library united states department of agriculture retrieved 2010 08 31 conversely invaded ecosystems may lack natural competitors and predators that check invasives growth in their native ecosystems invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance typically human induced such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem vectors non native species have many vectors including biogenic vectors but most invasions are associated with human activity natural range extensions are common in many species but rate and magnitude of human mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces an early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced

handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries usda programs such as smuggling interdiction and trade compliance attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in america many invasive species once they are dominant in area are essential to ecosystem of that area if they are removed from location it could be harmful to that area economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction high demand for valuable chinese mitten crab is one explanation for possible intentional release of species in foreign waters within aquatic environment development of maritime trade has rapidly affected way marine organisms are transported within ocean two ways marine organisms are transported to new environments are hull fouling and ballast water transport in fact molnar et al 2008 documented pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and found that shipping was dominant mechanism for transfer of invasive species thumb cargo ship de ballasting many marine organisms have capacity to attach themselves to vessel hulls therefore these organisms are easily transported from one body of water to another and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event unfortunately controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling however governments of california and new zealand have announced more stringent control for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions other main vector for transport of non native aquatic species is ballast water ballast water taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is largest vector for non native aquatic species invasions in fact it is estimated that 10 000 different species many of which are non indigenous are transported via ballast water each day many of these species are considered harmful and can negatively affect their new environment for example freshwater zebra mussels native to black caspian and azov seas most likely reached great lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel aquatic invasive species a guide to least wanted aquatic organisms of pacific northwest 2001 university of washington zebra mussels outcompete other native organisms for oxygen and food such as algae although zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988 and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter plan had a serious flaw or loophole whereby ships loaded with cargo when they reached seaway were not tested because their ballast water tanks were empty however even in an empty ballast tank there remains a puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at next port when tank is filled with water after unloading cargo ship takes on ballast water which mixes with puddles and then everything including living organisms in puddles is discharged at next port current regulations for great lakes rely on salinity shock to kill freshwater organisms left in ballast tanks even though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against potentially invasive species there exists a loophole for organisms in 10 50 micron size class for organisms between 10 and 50 microns such as certain types of phytoplankton current regulations allow less than 10 cells per milliliter be present in discharge from treatment systems discharge gets released when a ship takes on cargo at a port so discharged water is not necessarily same as receiving body of water since many species of phytoplankton are less than 10 microns in size and reproduce asexually only one cell released into environment could exponentially grow into many thousands of cells over a short amount of time this loophole could have detrimental effects to environment for example some species in genus pseudo nitzschia are smaller than 10 microns in width and contain domoic acid a neurotoxin if toxic pseudo nitzschia spp are alive in ballast discharge and get released into their new environment they could cause domoic acid poisoning in shellfish marine mammals and birds fortunately human deaths related to domoic acid poisoning have been prevented because of stringent monitoring programs that arose after a domoic acid outbreak in canada in 1987 ballast water regulations need to be more rigorous to prevent future ramifications associated with potential release of toxic and invasive phytoplankton another important factor to consider about marine invasive species is role of environmental changes associated with climate change such as an increase in ocean temperature there have been multiple studies suggesting an increase in ocean temperature will cause range shifts in organisms which could have detrimental effects on environment as new species interactions emerge for example hua and hwang proposed that organisms in a ballast tank of a ship traveling from temperature zone through tropical waters can experience temperature fluctuations as much as 20 degc to further examine effects of temperature on organisms transported on hulls or in ballast water lenz et al 2018 carried out study where they conducted a double heat stress experiment their results suggest that heat challenges organisms face during transport may enhance stress tolerance of species in their non native range by selecting for genetically adapted genotypes that will survive a second applied heat stress such as increased ocean temperature in founder population due to complexity of climate change induced variations it is difficult to predict nature of temperature based success of non native species in situ since some studies have suggested increased temperature tolerance of hijackers on ships hulls or in ballast water it is necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as environmental conditions continue to change around world effects of wildfire and firefighting invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem wildfires roads foot trails to colonize an area large wildfires can sterilize soils while adding a variety of nutrients in resulting free for all formerly entrenched species lose their advantage leaving more room for invasives in such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage non natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout wildfires often occur in remote areas needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach site crews can bring invasive seeds with them if any of these stowaway seeds become established a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks after which controlling outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread also disturbing soil surface such as cutting firebreaks destroys native cover exposes soil and can accelerate invasions in suburban and wildland urban interface areas vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks as vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species undercarriage of vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport in response on large fires washing stations decontaminate vehicles before engaging in suppression activities large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places further increasing potential for seed transport effects

species of wetland plant known as in hawaii indigenous is regarded as a pest species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered hawaiian stilt himantopus mexicanus making these undesirable feeding areas for birds multiple successive introductions of different non native species can have interactive effects introduction of a second non native species can enable first invasive species to flourish examples of this are introductions of amethyst gem clam gemma gemma and european green crab carcinus maenas gem clam was introduced into california s bodega harbor from east coast of united states a century ago it had been found in small quantities in harbor but had never displaced native clam species spp in mid 1990s introduction of european green crab found to prey preferentially on native clams resulted in a decline of native clams and an increase of introduced clam populations in waterberg region of south africa cattle grazing over past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of original grassland resulting in a massive reduction in forage for native bovids and other grazers since 1970s large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species partial success has led to re establishment of many species that had dwindled or left region examples of these species are giraffe blue wildebeest impala kudu and white rhino invasive species can change functions of ecosystems for example invasive plants can alter fire regime cheatgrass bromus tectorum nutrient cycling smooth cordgrass spartina alterniflora and hydrology tamarix in native ecosystems invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have potential to hybridize with native species harmful effects of hybridization have led to a decline and even extinction of native species for example hybridization with introduced cordgrass spartina alterniflora threatens existence of california cordgrass spartina foliosa in san francisco bay invasive species cause competition for native species and because of this 400 of 958 endangered species under endangered species act are at risk geomorphological primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and for example kudzu pueraria montana a vine native to asia was widely introduced in southeastern usa in early 20th century to control soil erosion while primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation bioerosion and bioconstruction for example invasion of chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates economic some invaders cause negativity affect economy of local area for example in great lakes region sea lamprey is an invasive species that acts as a predator in its original habitat sea lamprey used co evolution to act as a parasite without killing host organism however in great lakes region this co evolutionary link is absent so sea lamprey acts as a predator and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12 18 month feeding period sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such as lake trout and salmon sea lampreys destructive effects on large fish negatively affect fishing industry and have helped cause collapse of population of some species economic opportunities some invasions offer potential commercial benefits for instance silver carp and common carp can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with product or processed into pet foods or mink feed water hyacinth can be turned into fuel by methane energy from vascular plant wastewater treatment systems eichhornia crassipes lemna pueraria lobata biomass harvested for fuel production by b c wolverton and r c mcdonald 1981 econ bot 35 2 224 232 cited in handbook of energy crops by j duke and other invasive plants can also be harvested and utilized as a source of bioenergy benefits although most people focus on negative effects of invasive and non native species they can actually be harmless or even beneficial in some cases ecosystems thrive because of biodiversity and some need non native species in order to succeed there are four major ways that non natives can be very beneficial for an ecosystem first is that they can provide a suitable habitat or food source for other organisms in areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored non native species can fill their role a good example of this is tamarisk a non native woody plant and southwestern willow flycatcher an endangered bird 75 of southwestern willow flycatchers were found to nest in these plants and their success was same as flycatchers that had nested in native plants removal of tamarisk would be detrimental to southwestern willow flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored second way that non native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration this is because presence of non native species increases heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem this increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems which then promotes growth and reestablishment of native species another benefit of non native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer in many cases non native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species many non native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse an example of this is aldabra giant tortoises which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over roles of herbivore and seed disperser last benefit of non native species is that they provided ecosystem services there are many examples of this major one being pollinators american honey bee was introduced in rainforest to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot also non native species can function as agents to limit effects of invasive species such as use of non native species to control agricultural pests non native species can have other benefits asian oysters for example filter water pollutants better than native oysters they also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives biologists are currently considering releasing this mollusk in chesapeake bay to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution a recent study by johns hopkins school of public health found asian oyster could significantly benefit bay s deteriorating water quality tom pelton baltimore sun may 26 2006 additionally some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their

population of lionfish by encouraging consumption of fish in recent years organizations including reef environmental educational org and institute for applied ecology among others have published cookbooks and recipes that include invasive species as ingredients costs economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry and management costs estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in u s alone amount to more than 138 billion annually economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues when economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs they are low because they do not consider environmental damage if monetary values were assigned to extinction of species loss in biodiversity and loss of ecosystem services costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase following examples from different sectors of economy demonstrate impact of biological invasions it is often argued that key to reducing costs of invasive species damage and management is early detection and rapid response meaning that incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and quickly controlling it while population is small is less expensive that managing invasive population when it is widespread and already causing damage however an intense search for invader is only important to reduce costs in cases where invasive species is 1 not frequently reintroduced into managed area and 2 cost effective to search for and find plant industry weeds reduce yield in agriculture though they may provide essential nutrients some deep rooted weeds can mine nutrients see dynamic accumulator from subsoil and deposit

implications for instance pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water biodiversity biotic invasion is considered one of five top drivers for global biodiversity loss and is increasing because of tourism and globalization this may be particularly true in inadequately regulated fresh water systems though quarantines and ballast water rules have improved situation invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via competitive exclusion niche displacement or hybridisation with related native species therefore besides their economic ramifications alien invasions may result in extensive changes in structure composition and global distribution of biota of sites of introduction leading ultimately to of world s fauna and flora and loss of biodiversity nevertheless it is difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion and few scientific studies that have done so have been with animal taxa concern over impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider actual evidence either ecological or economic in relation to potential risk thumb alien invasive species smothering native flora in tiger reserve chhattisgarh india genetic pollution native species can be threatened with extinction through process of genetic pollution genetic pollution is unintentional hybridization and introgression which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical or fitness advantage of introduced species genetic pollution occurs either through introduction or through habitat modification where previously isolated species are brought into contact with new genotypes invading species have been shown to adapt to their new environments in a remarkably short amount of time population size of invading species may remain small for a number of years and then experience an explosion in population a phenomenon known as lag effect hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can incorporate their genotypes into gene pool over time through introgression similarly in some instances a small invading population can threaten much larger native populations for example spartina alterniflora was introduced in san francisco bay and hybridized with native spartina foliosa higher pollen count and male fitness of invading species resulted in introgression that threatened native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower viability of native species reduction in fitness is not always apparent from morphological observations alone some degree of gene flow is normal and preserves constellations of genes and genotypes an example of this is interbreeding of migrating coyotes with red wolf in areas of eastern north carolina where red wolf was reintroduced end result was a decrease in stable breeding pairs of red wolf which may further complicate social stability of packs and reintroduction efforts invasive exotic diseases history is rife with spread of exotic diseases such as introduction of smallpox into indigenous peoples of americas by spanish where it obliterated entire populations of indigenous civilizations before they were ever even seen by europeans problematic exotic disease introductions in past century or so include chestnut blight which has almost eliminated american chestnut tree from its forest habitat responses to increase population of american chestnut include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced this displays both positive and negative aspects of introduced species another example is dutch elm disease which has severely reduced american elm trees in forests and cities diseases may also be vectored by invasive insects such as asian

and dominant while study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology majority of research on invasive organisms has been within field of ecology and geography where issue of biological invasions is especially important much of study of invasive species has been influenced by charles elton s 1958 book ecology of invasion by animals and plants which drew upon limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions studies on invasive species remained sparse until 1990s when research in field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day this research which has largely consisted of field observational studies has disproportionately been concerned with terrestrial plants rapid growth of field has driven a need to standardize language used to describe invasive species and events despite this little standard terminology exists within study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as invasion ecology or more generally invasion biology this lack of standard terminology is a significant problem and has largely arisen due to interdisciplinary nature of field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture zoology and pathology as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another in an attempt to avoid ambiguous subjective and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers and macisaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on biogeography rather than on taxa by discarding taxonomy human health and economic factors this model focused only on ecological factors model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species it classified each population based on its success in that environment this model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful introduced species on islands perhaps best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands depending upon isolation how far an island is located from continental native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to threat posed by exotic introductions often this can mean that no natural predator of an introduced species is present and non native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied niche an additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape danger brought to them by introduced predators tendency of rails in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable has led to disproportionate number of extinctions in that family field of island restoration has developed as a field of conservation biology and ecological restoration a large part of which deals with eradication of invasive species a 2019 study suggests that if of invasive animals were conducted on just 169 islands survival prospects of 9 4 of earth s most highly threatened
