thin man was code name for a proposed plutonium gun type nuclear bomb using plutonium 239 which united states was developing during manhattan project they aborted its development when they discovered that spontaneous fission rate of their nuclear reactor bred plutonium was too high for use in a gun type design due to high concentration of isotope plutonium 240 early decisions in 1942 prior to army taking over wartime atomic research robert oppenheimer held conferences in chicago in june and berkeley california in july at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues a gun type design was chosen in which two sub critical masses would be brought together by firing a bullet into a target idea of an implosion type nuclear weapon was suggested by richard tolman but attracted scant consideration oppenheimer reviewing his options in early 1943 gave priority to gun type weapon but as a hedge against threat of pre detonation he created e 5 group at los alamos laboratory under seth neddermeyer to investigate implosion implosion type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in bomb because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely it was decided that plutonium gun would receive bulk of research effort since it was project with least amount of uncertainty involved it was assumed that uranium gun type bomb could be more easily adapted from it gun type and implosion type designs were codenamed thin man and fat man projects respectively these code names were created by robert serber a former student of oppenheimer s who worked on manhattan project he chose them based on their design shapes thin man would be a very long device and name came from dashiell hammett detective novel thin man and series of movies by same name fat man bomb would be round and fat and was named after sydney greenstreet s character in maltese falcon little boy would come last and be named only to contrast to thin man bomb development right thumb thin man plutonium gun test casings at wendover army air field as part of project alberta in manhattan project fat man casings can be seen behind them oppenheimer assembled a team at los alamos laboratory to work on plutonium gun design that included senior engineer edwin mcmillan and senior physicists charles critchfield and joseph hirschfelder critchfield had been working with which oppenheimer believed would be required by thin man to achieve high muzzle velocities that critical assembly would require hirschfelder had been working on internal ballistics oppenheimer led design effort himself until june 1943 when navy captain william sterling parsons arrived and took over ordnance and engineering division and direct management of thin man project these four created and tested all elements of thin man design between april 1943 and august 1944 parsons who had developed proximity fuze for navy ran division and handled liaison with other agencies as head of e 6 projectile target and source group critchfield calculated critical masses and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using 20 mm cannon and 3 inch guns while full scale thin man tubes took months to produce these were readily and easily obtained it was not possible to conduct tests with plutonium as it was not yet available indeed actual physical characteristics of metal were little more than educated guesses at this time hirschfelder headed e 8 interior ballistics group his group performed mathematical calculations but he also had to identify a suitable powder igniter and primer his group conducted full scale tests with their selections fixing physical size of bomb proved important when it came to selecting a suitable aircraft to carry it e 8 group estimated muzzle velocity of gun at around close to maximum achievable in 1944 and calculated that pressure in barrel would be up to although weapon s designers thought that simply bringing a critical mass together would be sufficient serber suggested that design should also include an initiator a polonium 210 beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140 day half life which allowed it to be stockpiled and it could be obtained from naturally occurring ores from port hope ontario oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in x 10 graphite reactor at oak ridge tennessee or when they became available reactors at hanford site specifications thin man design was an early nuclear weapon design proposed before plutonium had been successfully bred in a nuclear reactor from irradiation of uranium 238 it was assumed that plutonium like uranium 235 could be assembled into a critical mass by a gun type method which simply involved shooting one sub critical piece into another to avoid pre detonation or fizzle plutonium bullet would need to be accelerated to a speed of at least or else fission reaction would begin before assembly was complete blowing device apart prematurely thin man was long with wide tail and nose assemblies and a midsection length was necessary for plutonium bullet to pick up adequate speed before reaching target weight was around for final weapon model there were no aircraft in allied inventory that could carry a thin man without being modified however american boeing b 29 superfortress could be modified to carry it by removing part of bulkhead under main wing spar and some oxygen tanks located between its two bomb bays design issues aerodynamics great length of thin man bomb led to aerodynamic instabilities models of bomb were dropped from a grumman tbf avenger at us navy test range at dahlgren virginia starting in august 1943 bombs would spin sideways after being dropped and broke up when they hit ground twenty four drops were carried out in march 1944 before tests were discontinued so that improvements could be made to thin man bombs failed to release immediately frustrating calibration tests in what turned out to be last test flight of series on 16 march a thin man was prematurely released while b 29 was still en route to test range and fell onto bomb bay doors severely damaging test aircraft modified glider tow hook mechanisms used to suspend bomb in bomb bay had caused all four malfunctions due to great weight of bombs they were replaced with british type g single point attachments and type f releases as used on lancaster to carry tallboy bomb predetonation feasibility of a plutonium bomb had been questioned in 1942 james conant heard on 14 november from wallace akers director of british tube alloys project that james chadwick had concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities conant consulted ernest lawrence and arthur compton who acknowledged that their scientists at berkeley and chicago respectively knew about problem but could offer no ready solution conant informed director of manhattan project brigadier general leslie r groves jr who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of lawrence compton oppenheimer and mcmillan to examine issue committee concluded that any problems could be overcome by requiring higher purity in april 1944 experiments by emilio g segre and his p 5 group at los alamos on newly reactor produced plutonium from oak ridge and hanford site showed that it contained impurities in form of isotope plutonium 240 this has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium 239 cyclotron produced material on which original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium 240 its inclusion in reactor bred plutonium appeared unavoidable this meant that spontaneous fission rate of reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during initial formation of a critical mass distance required to accelerate plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion a far more difficult engineering task impracticability of a gun type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in los alamos on july 17 1944 all gun type work in manhattan project was directed at little boy enriched uranium gun design and almost all of research at los alamos laboratory was re oriented around problems of implosion for fat man bomb notes references category code names category world war ii aerial bombs of united
