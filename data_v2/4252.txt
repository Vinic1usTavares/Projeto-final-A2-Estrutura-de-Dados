canis minor is a small constellation in northern celestial hemisphere in second century it was included as an asterism or pattern of two stars in ptolemy s 48 constellations and it is counted among 88 modern constellations its name is latin for lesser dog in contrast to canis major greater dog both figures are commonly represented as following constellation of orion hunter canis minor contains only two stars brighter than fourth magnitude procyon alpha canis minoris with a magnitude of 0 34 and gomeisa beta canis minoris with a magnitude of 2 9 constellation s dimmer stars were noted by johann bayer who named eight stars including alpha and beta and john flamsteed who numbered fourteen procyon is seventh brightest star in night sky as well as one of closest a yellow white main sequence star

associated with classical greek tradition canis minor originates from ancient mesopotamia procyon and gomeisa were called mash tab ba or twins in three stars each tablets dating to around 1100 bc in later mul apin this name was also applied to pairs of and orionis and zeta and xi orionis meaning of mash tab ba evolved as well becoming twin deities and who are on opposite side of sky from true shepherd of heaven in babylonian mythology canis minor was also given name dar lugal its position defined as star which stands behind it orion in mul apin constellation represents a rooster this name may have also referred to constellation lepus dar lugal was also denoted dar musen and dar lugal musen in babylonia canis minor was then called in akkadian astronomy canis minor was one of original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his second century almagest in which it was defined as a specific pattern asterism of stars ptolemy identified only two stars and hence no depiction was possible ancient greeks called constellation procyon coming before dog transliterated into latin as or variations thereof by cicero and others roman writers also appended descriptors parvus minor or small or lesser for its faintness septentrionalis northerly for its position in relation to canis major primus rising first or sinister rising to left to its name canis in greek mythology canis minor was sometimes connected with teumessian fox a beast turned into stone with its hunter laelaps by zeus who placed them in heaven as canis major laelaps and canis minor teumessian fox apollodorus

chart from urania s mirror alternative names have been proposed johann bayer in early 17th century termed constellation fovea pit and morus tree seventeenth century german poet and author philippus caesius linked it to dog of tobias from apocrypha richard a proctor gave constellation name felis cat in 1870 contrasting with canis major which he had abbreviated to canis dog explaining that he sought to shorten constellation names to make them more manageable on celestial charts occasionally canis minor is confused with canis major and given name canis orionis orion s dog in non western

not border canis major monoceros is in between two covering 183 square degrees canis minor ranks seventy first of 88 constellations in size it appears prominently in southern sky during northern hemisphere s winter constellation boundaries as set by eugene delporte in 1930 are defined by a polygon of 14 sides in equatorial coordinate system right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while declination coordinates are between and most visible in evening sky from january to march canis minor is most prominent at 10 pm during mid february it is then seen earlier in evening until july when it is only visible after sunset before setting itself and rising in morning sky before dawn constellation s three letter abbreviation as adopted by international astronomical union in 1922 is cmi features stars thumb right 300px constellation canis minor as it can be seen by naked eye canis minor contains only two stars brighter than fourth magnitude at magnitude 0 34 procyon or alpha canis minoris is seventh brightest star in night sky as well as one of closest its name means before dog or preceding dog in greek as it rises an hour before dog star sirius of canis major it is a binary star system consisting of a yellow white main sequence star of spectral type f5 iv v named procyon a and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type da named procyon b procyon b which orbits more massive star every 41 years is of magnitude 10 7 procyon a is 1 4 times sun s mass while its smaller companion is 0 6 times as massive as sun system is from earth shortest distance to a northern hemisphere star of first magnitude gomeisa or beta canis minoris with a magnitude of 2 89 is second brightest star in canis minor lying from solar system it is a blue white main sequence star of spectral class b8 ve although fainter to earth observers it is much brighter than procyon and is 250 times as luminous and three times as massive as sun although its variations are slight gomeisa is classified as a shell star gamma cassiopeiae variable with a maximum magnitude of 2 84 and a minimum magnitude of 2 92 it is surrounded by a disk of gas which it heats and causes to emit radiation johann bayer used greek letters alpha to eta to label most prominent eight stars in constellation designating two stars as delta named delta1 and delta2 john flamsteed numbered fourteen stars discerning a third star he named delta3 his star 12 canis minoris was not found subsequently in bayer s 1603 work uranometria procyon is located on dog s belly and gomeisa on its neck gamma epsilon and eta canis minoris lie nearby marking dog s neck crown and chest respectively although it has an apparent magnitude of 4 34 gamma canis minoris is an orange k type giant of spectral class

system lying 222 7 light years away with an apparent magnitude of 4 39 hd 66141 is 6 8 billion years old and has evolved into an orange giant of spectral type k2iii with a diameter around 22 times that of sun and weighing 1 1 solar masses it is 174 times as luminous as sun with an absolute magnitude of 0 15 hd 66141 was mistakenly named 13 puppis as its celestial coordinates were recorded incorrectly when catalogued and hence mistakenly thought to be in constellation of puppis bode gave it name lambda canis minoris which is now obsolete orange giant is orbited by a planet hd which was detected in 2012 by measuring star s radial velocity planet has a mass around 6 times that of jupiter and a period of 480 days a red giant of spectral type m4iii bc canis minoris lies around distant from solar system it is a semiregular variable star that varies between a maximum magnitude of 6 14 and minimum magnitude of 6 42 periods of 27 7 143 3 and 208 3 days have been recorded in its pulsations az ad and bi canis minoris are delta scuti variables short period six hours at most pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study az is of spectral type and ranges between magnitudes 6 44 and 6 51 over a period of 2 3 hours ad has a spectral type of and has a maximum magnitude of 9 21 and minimum of 9 51 with a period of approximately 2 95 hours bi is

m7e is brightest ranging from magnitude 6 6 to 13 2 over a period of 332 94 days v canis minoris ranges from magnitude 7 4 to 15 1 over a period of 366 1 days similar in magnitude is r canis minoris which has a maximum of 7 3 but a significantly brighter minimum of 11 6 an s type star it has a period of 337 8 days yz canis minoris is a red dwarf of spectral type m4 5v and magnitude 11 2 roughly three times size of jupiter and from earth it is a flare star emitting unpredictable outbursts of energy for mere minutes which might be much more powerful analogues of solar flares luyten s star gj 273 is a red dwarf star of spectral type m3 5v and close neighbour of solar system its visual magnitude of 9 9 renders it too faint to be seen with naked eye even though it is only away fainter still is pss 544 7 an eighteenth magnitude red dwarf around 20 percent mass of sun located from earth first noticed in 1991 it is thought to be a cannonball star shot out of a star cluster and now moving rapidly through space directly away from galactic disc wz type dwarf nova dy canis minoris also known as 6 flared up to magnitude 11 4 over january and february 2008 before dropping eight magnitudes to around 19 5 over approximately 80 days it is a remote binary star system where a white dwarf and low mass star orbit each other close enough for former star to draw material off latter and form an accretion disc this material builds up until it erupts dramatically deep sky objects thumb nebula abell 24 milky way passes through much of canis minor yet it has few deep sky objects william herschel recorded four objects in his 1786 work catalogue of nebulae and clusters of stars including two he mistakenly believed were star clusters ngc 2459 is a group of five thirteenth and fourteenth magnitude stars that appear to lie close together in sky but are not related a similar situation has occurred with ngc also in canis minor this is a collection of fifteen unrelated stars of ninth magnitude and fainter herschel also observed three faint galaxies two of which are interacting with each other ngc is a lenticular galaxy of thirteenth magnitude estimated at 205 million light years 63 million parsecs distance with a diameter of 80 thousand light years 25 thousand parsecs named as a single object by herschel ngc is actually a pair of near adjacent galaxies that appear to be interacting with each other only of fourteenth and fifteenth magnitudes respectively elliptical and spiral galaxy are thought to be approximately 245 million light years distant and each measure 55 000 light years in diameter meteor showers 11 canis minorids also called beta canis minorids are a meteor shower that arise near fifth magnitude star 11 canis minoris and were discovered in 1964 by keith hindley who investigated their trajectory and proposed a common origin with comet d 1917 f1 mellish however this conclusion has been refuted subsequently as number of orbits analysed was low and their trajectories too disparate to confirm a link they last from 4 to 15 december peaking over 10 and 11 december references sources external links deep photographic guide to constellations canis
