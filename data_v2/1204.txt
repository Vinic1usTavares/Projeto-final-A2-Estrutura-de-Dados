trails at time in 1805 detroit created rights of way for principal streets of city grand river avenue included this street plan was devised by augustus woodward and others following a devastating fire

inland journeys in detroit at first grand river road was a deep rutted ditch bordered road road branched into two at rouge now redford southern branch roughly followed modern route of grand river avenue and northern route ran by way of pontiac along woodward avenue and modern m 21 to north of lansing area from bancroft several trails branched off including northern branch of grand river road and saginaw trail two branches merged back together near dewitt and continued west toward ionia and on to grand rapids and newton now grand haven early travelers plied road in wagons pulled by oxen or horses and drivers charged between four and seven cents a mile equivalent to mi in horses were exchanged every with speed averaging around with few obstacles congress further aided road in 1835 with an appropriation of 25 000 equivalent to in for a road on of right of way these improvements included removing brush and debris and construction of bridges across rouge shiawassee red cedar and grand rivers grand river road was a major route for settlers headed inland to grand rapids in 1836 as shortest route for travelers coming from detroit an economic panic in 1837 drove settlers from new york to michigan these were travelers who followed grand river road new settlements were created along route every or so that distance being a good day s travel by horse approximately 120 wagons left detroit each day between august and november 1843 after statehood in 1837 michigan assumed costs for construction work to grand river trail at that time about had been surveyed from detroit westward new state lacked money to continue improvements to road and michigan petitioned congress for better part of next decade for money to complete work when state capital was moved to lansing in 1847 an improved road was needed to capital city first segments of roadway were privatized starting in 1844 in 1850 michigan state legislature established lansing and howell plank road company which set about converting various indian trails into lansing howell plank road a task company completed by 1853 at howell road connected with detroit howell plank road establishing first improved connection direct

lansing for cesar chavez mexican american civil rights activist group lansing for cesar e chavez was raising funds to rename section between oakland and pine streets in old town previously a section of grand avenue was renamed for chavez in 1994 but voters overturned decision renaming proposal was even mentioned as a way to a maze of different branches of grand river avenue running through old town currently east grand river avenue and north grand river avenue bridge between sections of grand river avenue in addition to grand avenue which runs along grand river near downtown while lansing s latino community supported proposal business community opposed it one shop owner said she would have 10 000 in costs associated with a name change adding i think there s many beautiful ways to honor such an incredible man changing five blocks of a street doesn t seem to do justice another business owner cited work old town commercial association has done to market area using grand river avenue name marketing that would be useless after a name change compromise solution reached in august 2010 was to rename lot 56 where old town holds festivals to cesar chavez plaza street signs would be installed marking parts of grand river avenue as cesar e chavez avenue but only in a memorial capacity street would still be officially named grand river avenue memorial highway designations thumb
