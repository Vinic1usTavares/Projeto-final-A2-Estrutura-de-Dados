chaco culture national historical park is a united states national historical park in american southwest hosting a concentration of pueblos park is located in northwestern new mexico between albuquerque and farmington in a remote canyon cut by chaco wash containing most sweeping collection of ancient ruins north of mexico park preserves one of most important pre columbian cultural and historical areas in united states between ad 900 and 1150 chaco canyon was a major center of culture for ancestral puebloans chacoans quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances assembling fifteen major complexes that remained largest buildings ever built in north america until 19th century evidence of archaeoastronomy at chaco has been proposed with sun dagger petroglyph at fajada butte a popular example many chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture solar and lunar cycles requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction climate change is thought to have led to emigration of chacoans and eventual abandonment of canyon beginning with a fifty year drought commencing in 1130 comprising a unesco world heritage site located in arid and sparsely populated four corners region chacoan cultural sites are fragile concerns of erosion caused by tourists have led to closure of fajada butte to public sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by hopi and pueblo people who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from chaco and their spiritual relationship to land though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs tribal representatives work closely with national park service to share their knowledge and respect heritage of chacoan culture park is

vast colorado plateau surrounded by chuska mountains to west san juan mountains to north and san pedro mountains to east ancient chacoans drew upon dense forests of oak pinon ponderosa pine and juniper to obtain timber and other resources canyon itself located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields ridges and mountains is aligned along a roughly northwest to southeast axis and is rimmed by flat massifs known as mesas large gaps between southwestern cliff faces side canyons known as rincons were critical in funneling rain bearing storms into canyon and boosting local precipitation levels principal chacoan complexes such as pueblo bonito nuevo alto and kin kletso have elevations of alluvial canyon floor slopes downward to northwest at a gentle grade of per mile per kilometer it is bisected by chaco wash an arroyo that rarely bears water canyon s main aquifers were too deep to be of use to ancient chacoans only several smaller and shallower sources supported

basin average of rainfall annually park averages chaco canyon lies on leeward side of extensive mountain ranges to south and west resulting in a rainshadow effect that fosters prevailing lack of moisture in region region sees four distinct seasons rainfall is most likely between july and september while may and june are driest months orographic precipitation which results from moisture wrung out of storm systems ascending mountain ranges around chaco canyon is responsible for most of summer and winter precipitation and rainfall increases with higher elevation occasional aberrant northward excursions of intertropical convergence zone may boost precipitation in some years chaco endures remarkable climatic extremes temperatures range between and may swing in a single day region averages fewer than free days per year and local climate swings wildly from years of plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought heavy influence of el nino southern oscillation contributes to canyon s fickle climate flora and fauna chacoan flora typifies that of north american high deserts sagebrush and several species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of pinon and juniper latter primarily on mesa tops canyon is far drier than other parts of new mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations and it lacks temperate coniferous forests plentiful to east prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times when overpopulation expanding cultivation overhunting habitat destruction and drought may have led chacoans to strip canyon of wild plants and game it has been suggested that even during wet periods canyon was able to sustain only 2 000 people among chacoan mammals are plentiful coyote canis latrans mule deer elk and pronghorn also live within canyon though they are rarely encountered by visitors important smaller carnivores include bobcats badgers foxes and two species of skunk park hosts abundant populations of rodents including several prairie dog towns small colonies of bats are present during summer local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present these include roadrunners large hawks such as cooper s hawks and american kestrels owls vultures and ravens though they are less abundant in canyon than in wetter mountain ranges to east sizeable populations of smaller birds including warblers sparrows and house finches are also common three species of hummingbirds are present one is tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird which compete intensely with more mild tempered black chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water western prairie rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in backcountry though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant history archaic early basketmakers first people in san juan basin were hunter gatherers archaic early basketmaker people these small bands descended from nomadic clovis big game hunters who arrived in southwest around 10 000 bc more than 70 campsites from this period carbon dated to period 7000 1500 bc and mostly consisting of stone chips and other were found in atlatl cave and elsewhere within chaco canyon with at least one of sites located on canyon floor near an exposed arroyo archaic early basketmaker people were nomadic or semi nomadic hunter gatherers who over time began making baskets to store gathered plants by end of period some people cultivated food excavation of their campsites and rock shelters has revealed that they made tools gathered wild plants and killed and processed game slab lined

their presence in chaco canyon by ad 490 their descendants of late basketmaker ii era farmed lands around village and other pit house settlements at chaco a small population of basketmakers remained in chaco canyon area broad arc of their cultural elaboration culminated around 800 during pueblo i era when they were building crescent shaped stone complexes each comprising four to five residential suites abutting subterranean kivas large enclosed areas reserved for rites such structures characterize early pueblo people by 850 ancient pueblo population anasazi from a ute term adopted by navajo

pueblo bonito determined that members of an elite matriline were interred here for approximately 330 years between 800 and 1130 suggesting continuity with matrilineal succession practices of many pueblo nations today cohesive chacoan system began unravelling around 1140 perhaps triggered by an extreme fifty year drought that began in 1130 chronic climatic instability including a series of severe droughts again struck region between 1250 and 1450 poor water management led to arroyo cutting deforestation was extensive and economically devastating timber for construction had to be hauled instead from outlying mountain ranges such as chuska mountains which are more than to west outlying communities began to depopulate and by end of century buildings in central canyon had been neatly sealed and abandoned some scholars suggest that violence and warfare perhaps involving cannibalism impelled evacuations hints of such include dismembered bodies dating from chacoan times found at two sites within central canyon yet chacoan complexes showed little evidence of being defended or defensively sited high on cliff faces or atop mesas only several minor sites at chaco have evidence of large scale burning that would suggest enemy raids archaeological and cultural evidence leads scientists to believe people from this region migrated south east and west into valleys and drainages of

trip through chaco canyon was an 1823 expedition led by new mexican governor jose antonio when area was under mexican rule he noted several large ruins in canyon american trader josiah gregg wrote about ruins of chaco canyon referring in 1832 to pueblo bonito as built of fine grit sandstone in 1849 a u s army detachment passed through and surveyed ruins following united states acquisition of southwest with its victory in mexican war in 1848 canyon was so remote however that it was scarcely visited over next 50 years after brief reconnaissance work by smithsonian scholars in 1870s formal archaeological work began in 1896 when a party from american museum of natural history based in new york city hyde exploring expedition began excavating pueblo bonito spending five summers in region they sent over 60 000 artifacts back to new york and operated a series of trading posts in area in 1901 richard wetherill who had worked for hyde expedition claimed a homestead of that included pueblo bonito pueblo del arroyo and chetro ketl while investigating wetherill s land claim federal land agent samuel j holsinger detailed physical setting of canyon and sites noted prehistoric road segments and stairways above chetro ketl and documented prehistoric dams and irrigation systems his report went unpublished and unheeded it urged creation of a national park to safeguard chacoan sites next year edgar lee hewett president of new mexico normal university later renamed new mexico highlands university mapped many chacoan sites hewett and others helped enact federal antiquities act of 1906 first u s law to protect relics it was in effect a direct consequence of wetherill s controversial activities at chaco act also authorized president to establish national monuments on march 11 1907 theodore roosevelt proclaimed chaco canyon national monument wetherill relinquished his land claims thumb left a ceramic bowl excavated from pueblo alto dating from ad 1030 to 1200 in 1920 national geographic society began an archaeological examination of chaco canyon and appointed neil judd then 32 to head project after a reconnaissance trip that year judd proposed to excavate pueblo bonito largest ruin at chaco beginning in 1921 judd spent seven field seasons at chaco living and working conditions were spartan at best in his memoirs judd noted dryly that chaco canyon has its limitations as a summer resort by 1925 judd s excavators had removed 100 000 short tons of overburden using a team of 35 or more indians ten white men and eight or nine horses judd s team found only 69 hearths in ruin a puzzling discovery as winters are cold at chaco judd sent a e douglass more than 90 specimens for tree ring dating then in its infancy at that time douglass had only a floating chronology it was not until 1929 that a judd led team found missing link most of beams used at chaco were cut between 1033 and 1092 height of construction there in 1949 university of new mexico deeded over adjoining lands to form an expanded chaco canyon national monument in return university maintained scientific research rights to area by 1959 national park service had constructed a park visitor center staff housing and campgrounds as a historic property of national park service national monument was listed on national register of historic places on october 15 1966 in 1971 researchers robert lister and james judge established chaco center a division for cultural research that functioned as a joint project between university of new mexico and national park service a number of multi disciplinary research projects archaeological surveys and limited excavations began during this time chaco center extensively surveyed chacoan roads well constructed and strongly reinforced thoroughfares radiating from central canyon richness of cultural remains at park sites led to expansion of small national monument into chaco culture national historical park on december 19 1980 when an additional were added to protected area in 1987 park was designated a world heritage site by unesco to safeguard chacoan sites on adjacent bureau of land management and navajo nation lands park

collection museum an information desk a theater a book store and a gift shop prior to 1980s archeological excavations within current park boundaries were intensive compound walls were dismantled or demolished and thousands of artifacts were extracted starting in 1981 a new approach informed by traditional hopi and pueblo beliefs stopped such intrusions remote sensing anthropological study of indian oral traditions and dendrochronology which left chacoan relics undisturbed were pursued in this vein chaco american indian consultation committee was established in 1991 to give navajo hopi pueblo and other indian representatives a voice in park oversight current park policy mandates partial restoration of excavated sites or re burying excavated sites with sand is one such means other measures attempt to safeguard area s ancient ambiance and mystique such as chaco night sky program which seeks to eliminate effect of light pollution on park s acclaimed night skies under program some 14 000 visitors make use of chaco observatory inaugurated in 1998 park telescopes and astronomy related programs park was named a gold tier dark sky park by international dark sky association in 2013 chacoan relics outside current park s boundaries have been threatened by development an example was proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in san juan basin for surface coal mining beginning in 1983 as ample coal deposits abut park this strip mining threatened web of ancient chacoan roads year long chaco roads project thus documented roads which were later protected from mining sites

between ad 1020 and 1050 during a wider building boom throughout canyon its location made community visible to most of inhabitants of san juan basin indeed it was only north of tsin kletzin on opposite side of canyon community was center of a bead and turquoise processing industry that influenced development of all villages in canyon chert tool production was common research at site conducted by archaeologist tom suggests only a handful of families perhaps as few as five to twenty lived in complex this may imply that pueblo alto served a primarily non residential role another

constructions lasted decades and even centuries as architectural forms evolved and centuries passed houses kept several core traits most apparent is their sheer bulk complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each and some enclosed up to 700 rooms individual rooms were substantial in size with higher ceilings than anasazi works of preceding periods they were well planned vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage rather than in increments houses generally faced south and plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed off rooms or high walls houses often stood four or five stories tall with single story rooms facing plaza room blocks were terraced to allow tallest sections to compose pueblo s rear edifice rooms were often organized into suites with front rooms larger than rear interior and storage rooms or areas ceremonial structures known as kivas were built in proportion to number of rooms in a pueblo one small kiva was built for roughly every 29 rooms nine complexes each hosted an oversized great kiva each up to in diameter t shaped doorways and stone lintels marked all chacoan kivas though simple and compound walls were often used great houses were primarily constructed of core and veneer walls two parallel load bearing walls comprising dressed flat sandstone blocks bound in clay mortar were erected gaps between walls were packed with rubble forming wall s core walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces which were pressed into a layer of binding mud these surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns chacoan structures altogether required wood of 200 000 coniferous trees mostly hauled on foot from mountain ranges up to away uses thumb left around 200 000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from ruins at chaco canyon these turquoise and red beads were found at pueblo alto chaco technology at nps meticulously designed buildings composing larger chacoan complexes did not emerge until around ad 1030 chacoans melded pre planned architectural designs astronomical alignments geometry landscaping and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture researchers have concluded that complex may have had a relatively small residential population with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies smaller sites apparently more residential in character are scattered near great houses in and around chaco canyon itself runs along one of lunar alignment lines suggesting location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance if nothing else this allowed alignment with several other key structures in canyon turquoise was very important to people of chaco around 200 000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from ruins at

boom throughout 10th century chacoan building techniques spread from canyon to neighboring regions by ad 1115 at least 70 outlying pueblos of chacoan provenance had been built within composing san juan basin experts speculate function of these compounds some large enough to be considered great houses in their own right some suggest they may have been more than agricultural communities perhaps functioning as trading posts or ceremonial sites thirty such outliers spread across are connected to central canyon and to one another by an enigmatic web of six chacoan road systems extending up to in generally straight routes they appear to have been extensively surveyed and engineered their depressed and scraped caliche beds reach wide earthen berms or rocks at times composing low walls delimit their edges when necessary roads deploy steep stone stairways and rock ramps to surmount cliffs and other obstacles though their purpose may never be certain archaeologist harold gladwin noted that nearby navajo believe that anasazi built roads to transport timber archaeologist neil judd offered a similar hypothesis archaeoastronomy sun dagger thumb this 11th century pictograph at chaco
