most illustrious order of saint patrick is a dormant british order of chivalry associated with ireland order was created in 1783 by george iii at request of then lord lieutenant of ireland 3rd earl temple created 1st marquess of buckingham in 1784 regular creation of knights of saint patrick lasted until 1922 when most of ireland gained independence as irish free state a dominion within what was then known as british commonwealth of nations while order technically still exists no knight of st patrick has been created since 1936 and last surviving knight prince henry duke of gloucester died in 1974 queen however remains sovereign of order and one officer ulster king of arms now combined with norroy king of arms also survives st patrick is patron of order its motto is quis latin for who will separate us an allusion to vulgate translation of romans 8 35 who shall separate us from love of christ according to galloway pp 171 2 motto was borrowed from order of friendly brothers of st patrick but was also appropriate politically in expressing a desire for unity most british orders of chivalry cover entire kingdom but three most exalted ones each pertain to one constituent country only order of st patrick which pertains to ireland is most junior of these three in precedence and age its equivalent in england most noble order of garter is oldest order of chivalry in united kingdom dating to middle fourteenth century scottish equivalent is most ancient and most noble order of thistle dating in its modern form to 1687 history thumb 200px badge of order of st patrick left thumb installation dinner for founding of order took place on 17 march 1783 in great hall of dublin castle early history order was founded in 1783 a year after grant of substantial autonomy to ireland as a means of rewarding or obtaining political support in irish parliament order of bath founded in 1725 was instituted for similar reasons statutes of order restricted membership to men who were both knights and gentlemen latter being defined as having three generations of noblesse i e ancestors bearing coats of arms on both their father s and mother s side 1783 statutes article iii quoted in nicolas p 9 1905 statutes quoted in galloway remove these restrictions on membership in practice however only irish peers and british princes were ever appointed to order cross of st patrick a red saltire on a white background was chosen as one of symbols of order a flag of this design was later incorporated into union flag its association with st patrick or with ireland prior to foundation of order is unclear however one of first knights was 2nd duke of leinster whose arms carry same cross see image duke of leinster coa png thumb 250px irish crown jewels order of st patrick earned international coverage when in 1907 its insignia known generally as irish crown jewels were stolen from bedford tower in dublin castle shortly before a visit by order s sovereign king edward vii their whereabouts remain a mystery post 1922 last non royal member appointed to order was 3rd duke of abercorn in 1922 who served as first governor of northern ireland when irish free state left united kingdom in december of that same year irish executive council under w t cosgrave chose to make no further appointments to order british government continued to entertain hopes for order s revival as a pan irish institution therefore while there was no legal or constitutional bar to british government continuing to make appointments from among british subjects resident in northern ireland it chose not to do so since then only three people have been appointed to order all members of british royal family then prince of wales future king edward viii and later duke of windsor was appointed in to galloway p155 neither cosgrave or his government registered any protest possibly because they had no objection and his younger brothers prince henry duke of gloucester in 1934 and prince albert duke of york later king george vi in 1936 it is likely that these appointments were considered possible because irish free state continued to recognise british monarch as its official head of state in 1937 however irish free state adopted a new constitution rendering crown s position in irish affairs ambiguous ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when eire as irish free state had been renamed in december 1937 formally declared itself a republic and left british commonwealth officially leaving in april 1949 basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made 1st duke of gloucester at his death in 1974 was last surviving member of order last living non royal member of order 9th earl of shaftesbury died in 1961 order has however never formally been abolished possible revival thumb right collar of order of st patrick prime minister winston churchill suggested reviving order in 1943 to recognise services of general hon sir harold alexander in tunisia but opinion of other ministers and civil servants was that it would upset diplomatic balance between london and dublin galloway 6 taoiseach sean lemass considered reviving order during 1960s but did not take a decision constitution of ireland provides titles of nobility shall not be conferred by state article 40 2 1deg and no title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with prior approval of government article 40 2 2deg legal experts are divided on whether this clause prohibits awarding of membership of order of st patrick to irish citizens but some suggest that phrase titles of nobility implies hereditary peerages and other noble titles not lifetime honours such as knighthoods in recent decades however this prohibition has almost never been enforced irish citizens who are today offered british honours rarely apply for permission prior to accepting in practice it has come to be understood that irish citizens who receive such awards including for example former attorney general peter sutherland rocker political activist bob geldof and late talk show host sir terry wogan do so on a purely honorary basis they cannot use honorific sir or dame unless they subsequently adopt british or commonwealth nationality which wogan did composition members thumb right 2nd earl of dudley lord lieutenant of ireland 1902 1905 wearing irish crown jewels as ex officio grand master of order of st patrick british monarch is sovereign of order of st patrick lord lieutenant of ireland monarch s representative in ireland served as grand master 1783 statutes article ii quoted in nicolas p 9 office of lord lieutenant was abolished in 1922 last lord lieutenant and grand master was 1st viscount fitzalan of derwent galloway p 103 initially statutes of order did not provide that grand master be admitted to order as a matter of right before this only some lords lieutenant were in fact appointed to order this seems to have been exception rather than rule in 1839 queen victoria altered this and though not a member during his grand mastership he was permitted to retain insignia after his term of office order originally consisted of fifteen knights in addition to sovereign preamble to 1783 statutes quoted in nicolas p 9 according to galloway p 17 it was intended that there be 16 knights in addition to sovereign but george iii decided to take one of 16 stalls which had been allotted in chapel for himself in 1821 however george iv appointed six additional knights nicolas p 37 he did not issue a royal warrant authorising change until 1830 william iv formally changed statutes in 1833 increasing limit to twenty two knights galloway p 269 original statutes based heavily on those of order of garter prescribed that any vacancy should be filled by sovereign upon nomination of members each knight was to propose nine candidates of whom three had to have rank of earl or higher three rank of baron or higher and three rank of knight or higher and a vote taken in practice this system was never used grand master would nominate a peer sovereign would usually assent and a chapter meeting held at which knights elected new member galloway p26 order of st patrick differed from its english and scottish counterparts orders of garter and thistle in only ever appointing peers and princes women were never admitted to order of st patrick they were not eligible to become members of other two orders until 1987 only woman to be part of order was queen victoria in her capacity as sovereign of order although it was associated with established church of ireland

knight of order of saint patrick office of prelate was held by lord archbishop of armagh most senior clergyman in church of ireland prelate was not mentioned in original statutes but created by a

without a ceremonial home until 1881 when arrangements were made to display banners helms and hatchment plates equivalent of stall plates in absence of stalls in great hall officially called st patrick s hall in dublin castle galloway p 70 on establishment of irish free state banners of living knights were removed when hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with banners of members of order in 1922 existing banners were repaired or new ones made it is these banners which can be seen today galloway p 202 hall which was renamed st patrick s hall from its association with order also served as chancery of order installation ceremonies and later investitures were held here often on st patrick s day until they were discontinued a banquet for knights was often held in hall on occasion of an installation st patrick s hall now serves as location for inauguration of president of ireland if an incumbent irish president dies in office such as erskine hamilton childers in 1974 he lies in state in hall unlike many of other british orders stall plates or hatchment plates do not form a continuous record of knights of order there are only 34 stall plates for 80 or so knights appointed before 1871 although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940 and 40 hatchments plates for 60 knights appointed subsequently in case of stall plates this was perhaps due to their size cm in galloway pp 201 209 precedence and privileges thumb right a panel recording some members of order of st patrick in st patrick s cathedral dublin since members of order
