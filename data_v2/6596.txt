repaying him for his sacrifice and charity cast edwin august as marx a gentleman thief unknown as william weldon lon chaney as a pawnbroker it is possible that mary charleston was a part of cast due to edwin august having been noted as working with her in powers productions production according to an interview with dorothy donnell edwin august wrote blood red tape of charity with an intent on showing evils of organized charity he also directed production within months of completing this production august would leave universal donnell stated that august was tired of earning money for other people when he would make more under his own brand film s cast and credits were unbilled and very few details emerged but two scholars have claimed that it featured lon chaney jon mirsalis states that chaney has an unbilled part as a pawnbroker michael blake notes that chaney had a role in film but also states that film had only one reel and lists production code as blake s claim that it was a single reel is subject of dispute because release was originally as a two reel production in publications and many advertisements release thumb contemporary newspaper advertising a double feature with blood red tape of charity two reel film was released on september 26 1913 by universal film manufacturing company under powers label on august 15 1913 prior to film s release daily capital journal of salem oregon contained a brief section on edwin august which lists blood red tape of charity as one of his latest successes this occurred more than a month prior to film s release and is not known to have appeared in any other source or any known pre release viewing event after film was released nationwide advertisements for its viewing appeared in newspapers including in el paso texas chicago illinois indiana iowa ohio nebraska kansas and pennsylvania reception jon c mirsalis s website cites a review in moving picture world which states there is considerable strength in offering but it has some bad faults one of these is melodramatic and insincere acting photography is good and in spite of numerous absurdities picture has strong moments descriptive ads for film were often informative an ad by crystal theater indicates that august wrote and acted in film but also did not shy away from film s depiction of charity organizations and instead promoted film s defining message as charity organizations pay dearly for incompetency another advertisement cites new york world review detailing propaganda film s intent to gain public attention to incite a regeneration of charitable organizations an advertisement in el paso herald by alamo theater described film as a beautiful story of love devotion and charity it is a strong moral lesson and should appeal to charity workers in this country advertisement also said film would make viewers more charitable and good but that film s critique on charity workers in particular would be far from appealing or well received film provoked a response by charity organization societies because of its melodramatic and exaggerated depiction of family s suffering due to regulation delays in its response to letters about film charity organization bulletin wished for a scenario to be written and produced to give a true picture of work done by organized charity in book charity organization movement in united states a study in american philanthropy volume 19 film is said to be to an attack on organized charity by a distortion of facts these characterizations were accurate as august s intention to instruct and entertain audiences of evils of organized charity makes blood red tape of charity a propaganda film by definition another response by p l whitney extension secretary of united charities stopped short of calling film outright dangerous but noted its intent and poetic justice that surrounds two secretaries one of whom results in marx postponing his retirement and later takes their jewelry to provide for family whitney advised editor and readers to keep watch for film and use media to highlight its faults and exaggerations patricia erens used film still of pawnbroker claimed by mirsalis to be lon chaney as an example of common depictions of jews in her book jew in american cinema film is now considered lost it is unknown when film was lost but if it was in universal s vaults it would have been
