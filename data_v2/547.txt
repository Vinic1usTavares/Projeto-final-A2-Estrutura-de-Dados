1905 international tourist trophy was an automobile motor race held on 14 september 1905 on closed public roads along highroads course on isle of man it was organised by automobile club of great britain and ireland and was first time that what became known as rac tourist trophy was awarded race lasted over six hours and was won by john napier driving an arrol johnston percy northey finished second in a rolls royce while vinot deguingand driver norman littlejohn was third prior to tourist trophy isle of man had hosted english trials for gordon bennett cup as english government had banned motor racing on its roads automobile club wanted to run an event to help develop fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted to use same route as had been used for trials in order to make event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering though there were complaints that rules were too restrictive and detracted from spectacle there were 58 entrants but only 42 of these started race less than half of cars completed full and there were more retirements due to mechanical failures and crashes than a lack of fuel top three were separated by just over five minutes while final finisher took almost three hours longer than napier event was held again in 1906 though overall distance covered was shortened to around background thumb right highlands course used for race at start of twentieth century motor racing was banned on english roads and although automobile club of great britain and ireland later renamed royal automobile club had lobbied british government to remove speed limits and allow provision for motor racing in england motor car act 1903 only raised speed limit to and did not repeal ban on racing british cars and drivers had nonetheless been successful during 1902 gordon bennett cup and as such automobile club wanted to host 1903 gordon bennett cup in britain after their failure to persuade government to allow racing in england 1903 race had been held in ireland under provision of light locomotives ireland act but this had been a one off and automobile club did not manage to get law extended for further races vaukins 2014 pp 8 17 as such when automobile club wanted to hold trials for 1904 gordon bennett cup to establish three vehicles to represent england at race in germany they approached manx legislature tynwald in early 1904 and proposed to hold trials on island highway light locomotives bill was rushed through tynwald in march 1904 but only allowed racing for three days during that year specifically for gordon bennett trials to take place following year after further lobbying from automobile club bill was renewed as highways motor car bill without a fixed term bill gave provision for six days of racing to take place three for gordon bennett trials in spring and three for tourist trophy in autumn vaukins 2014 p 27 course course used for race was same as had been used for 1904 and 1905 gordon bennett trials a course featuring over 420 corners which followed much of modern day snaefell mountain course known as highroads course or highlands lap began at in douglas and proceeded down a5 road towards castletown then back up a3 to where it then headed towards along a10 but turned onto a13 towards ramsey from ramsey course followed a18 commonly known as mountain road back to douglas elevation of isle of man was challenging for cars course rose from being barely above sea level at douglas to at many parts of course were nothing more than rough tracks in order to minimise disruption to public two footbridges were built over roads of course one at and other at ramsey cars thumb right chassis of a speedwell car being weighed prior to race cars were subject to a number of criteria chassis had to weigh between they were required to have a wheelbase of at least and to carry a load of including driver an optional passenger and ballast additionally car had to be able to carry four people including driver and model of car had to be available for sale for at least a month after race initially it was decided that each car was only allowed to use of fuel per of race but due to conditions this was altered to one imperial gallon per most of cars opted to use continental tyres just and used palmer whites and swifts used dunlop while wolseley and darracq vehicles used michelin rules were introduced in an attempt to make cars more representative of touring cars that members of public could drive in many ways they were successful charles rolls 20 horsepower rolls royce was one of more powerful of cars to enter tourist trophy but in contrast during 1905 gordon bennett cup he drove a wolseley which generated 112 horsepower however a number of manufacturers were put off from entering contest due to upper weight limit imposed it was opined in graphic that this excluded kind of cars that were really wanted as they suggested that chassis of an ordinary four cylinder touring car such as is sold to public weighed although it had been originally suggested that number of foreign entries should be limited with no more than two foreign cars for every five british entries no such restrictions were but it was decided to give special prizes for cars entirely british built while majority of cars were british there were also entries from france including a vinot deguingand and a peugeot and united states including a pair of white steam cars and a cadillac practice of 58 original entrants to event ten pulled out before entry list was published generally because they either could not reduce weight of their car sufficiently to be within limits or they could not achieve required fuel efficiency first of cars to arrive on isle of man was 16 horsepower minerva entered by charles rolls but driven by e h arnott which arrived more than two weeks before race during weeks before race cars were tested around island s roads during which arnott managed fastest circuit of course there were also a number of accidents during practices ernest de wilton crashed his swift into a stone wall near castletown causing significant damage to car although it was repaired in time there was a miscommunication between de wilton and race organisers and de wilton did not present car for inspection in time to be entered into race another of competitors a mccormack in a gladiator hit some cows after coming off road and caused such damage to car s brakes that it could not be repaired in time for race on sunday prior to race local residents were upset that forty of cars were driving course and meetings were held where they expressed their indignation that it was a desecration of sanctity of sabbath three days prior to race organisers began weighing cars and filling them with specified amount of fuel mors car which was to have been driven by dorothy levitt never arrived on island and so levitt was unable to take part in race race report thumb right a maudslay car driven by w h cox at 1905 isle of man tourist trophy due to limited fuel allowance cars were towed to start line by horses first car a rolls royce being driven by charles rolls started at 9am and following 41 cars were released at one minute intervals due to fuel saving nature of event most of drivers began race by letting their car coast down initial slope under its own momentum before engaging gear early on first lap of race rolls heard a crunching noise from his gear box and car stopped he claimed that upon investigation he discovered that small nuts and screws had been dropped into gearbox which had smashed a gear rolls claimed that this was a common trick abroad but voiced surprise at it happening in an english race there was further speculation of foul play when it was discovered that arnott s minerva had been tampered with two spark plugs had been smashed and an air valve bent causing his engine to overheat before race rolls and arnott had been two of favourites and automobile magazine said that this unfortunate incident has greatly detracted from success of race early in race john downie crashed into a pub in but car did not sustain extensive damage and he was able to continue race at keppel gate on mountain road frederick bennett who had been unable to take part in practice sessions and therefore did not know course very well approached a corner with too much speed in his cadillac and crashed ripping off two of wheels bennett managed to stay in vehicle and avoided serious injury another driver to go off track was j hadley in his wolseley who also carried too much speed into a corner leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field thornycroft driven by tom thornycroft had been following closely behind and two cars collided during incident damaging one of thornycroft s rear wheels napier in his arrol johnston made quickest circuit of first lap in one hour 32 minutes and 36 seconds during second lap a number of drivers were forced to retire with broken wheels both darracq drivers a rawlinson and algernon lee guinness suffered from issue rawlinson broke his in ramsey while lee guinness hit a well at a j dew also broke a wheel but continued race in w h warren s car both being entered by j w h dew a fourth driver in one of white steam cars succumbed to same problem while a j hancock crashed his vauxhall into a tree also breaking a wheel napier was once again quickest driver around circuit followed by percy northey in a rolls royce and norman littlejohn in vinot deguingand after his earlier crash downie retired on third lap with a broken wheel while thornycroft who had also had first lap trouble was forced to stop with a broken rear axle over final two laps a number of cars ran out of fuel and of 42 starters only 18 completed race first car to finish was rolls royce of percy northey he had started twenty minutes ahead of napier s arrol johnston so napier had to finish within twenty minutes of northey in order to win he did so passing finish line eighteen minutes later having run fastest lap of race at end to win by just over two minutes napier s time was 6 hours 9 minutes 14 6 seconds followed by northey in 6 11 23 and norman littlejohn in a french vinot deguingand in 6 14 32 4 three drivers had been consistently quickest throughout race and were separated by just over five minutes next quickest driver was e j c roberts in second of arrol but he was over 25 minutes behind his victorious team mate ancillary incidents around an hour after start of race three children were struck by car driven by one of race officials on a side road from quarter bridge road near finish line none sustained serious injuries two of them had cuts dressed while third rushed back to watching racing kelly 1996 p 62 another more serious accident occurred on snaefell mountain railway which had been transporting people up mountain to watch racing a tramcar that had been descending railway had broken down and a second car had stopped close behind it a third tram on rounding bend above them was unable to stop in time and collided into rearmost car which was then propelled into car in front of it minor injuries were sustained by some of passengers though none were serious kelly 1996 p 63 post race and legacy opinion as to success of race was divided in press automobile magazine declared that it must be said that it was a success while yorkshire post went even further claiming that end of monster racing car is in sight they suggested that racing cars were only useful to help develop technology for ordinary cars and that cars used in gordon bennett races and similar were no longer relevant along with withdrawal of france and britain from gordon bennett races and amount of support for tourist trophy they commended automobile club for recognising changed conditions of affairs in contrast filson young of manchester guardian was strong in his criticism of event he opined that it had been a disappointment though it had never many possibilities as a spectacle due to fact that cars only passed each point four times during day though he conceded that concept of race had been admirable he felt that cost of fuel was negligible in running of a motor car and that other factors such as general reliability over a thousand or more miles were more important tourist trophy was held on isle of man again in each of subsequent three years race remained four laps but was run over a shorter course of around charles rolls won 1906 event while napier finished over an hour behind in his arrol johnston after further races on isle of man in 1914 and 1922 event moved to dundonald in northern ireland tourist trophy moniker became more closely associated with isle of man tt motorcycle races which began in 1907 and have continued to run on isle of man ever since classification thumb right w h astell s orleans car being pulled out of garage by a horse final standings rank
