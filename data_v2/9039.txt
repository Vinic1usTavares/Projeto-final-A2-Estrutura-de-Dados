reporter as production development in september 2011 indian media reported that mahesh bhatt and bhushan kumar were keen to remake 1990 musical blockbuster aashiqui kumar approached bhatt for a possible sequel although it was shagufta rafique s melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that film had potential as a sequel and decided to proceed with project given aashiqui s status in hindi cinematic history as one of finest indian musicals of all time many expressed concerns towards decision to remake film dubious that producers could come up with a soundtrack on par with quality

thumb 250px left aditya roy kapur and shraddha kapoor from left film s producers launched a nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for film initially refusing to employ established actors however actors who came to audition were not promising enough for roles and idea was scrapped mahesh bhatt said it was a disastrous talent hunt we discovered that people lacked courage to audition those who are amateurs went for audition and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection when suri saw some pictures of aditya roy kapur and met him he found kapur perfect for role and cast him to play male lead in june 2012 shraddha kapoor was signed to play female lead bhatt said yes shraddha kapoor is playing lead with two boys aditya roy kapur and shaad randhawa we found her to be very talented all three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles when asked about replacing new actors with known ones suri said people said i couldn t make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in but i was pretty sure i wanted aditya and shraddha to play my protagonists my writer shagufta rafique and i saw them as protagonists see aditya and shraddha
