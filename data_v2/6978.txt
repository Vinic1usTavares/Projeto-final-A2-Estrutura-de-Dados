stone age in territory of today s poland is divided into paleolithic mesolithic and neolithic eras paleolithic extended from about 500 000 bce to 8000 bce paleolithic is subdivided into periods lower paleolithic 500 000 to 350 000 bce middle paleolithic 350 000 to 40 000 bce upper paleolithic 40 000 to 10 000 bce and final paleolithic 10 000 to 8000 bce mesolithic lasted from 8000 to 5500 bce and neolithic from 5500 to 2300 bce neolithic is subdivided into neolithic proper 5500 to 2900 bce and copper age 2900 to 2300 bce stone age era lasted 800 000 years and involved three different human species homo erectus homo neanderthalensis and homo sapiens stone age cultures ranged from early human groups with primitive tools to advanced agricultural societies which used sophisticated stone tools built fortified settlements and developed copper metallurgy as elsewhere in eastern and central europe stone age human cultures went through stages known as paleolithic mesolithic and neolithic each bringing new refinements of stone tool making techniques paleolithic period human activities earliest sites are about 500 000 years old were intermittent because of recurring periods of glaciation with recession of last glaciation a general climate warming and resulting increase in ecologic environment diversity was characteristic of mesolithic from 9000 8000 bce neolithic brought first settled agricultural communities their founders migrated from danube river area from 5500 bce later native post mesolithic populations also adopted and further developed agricultural way of life

assimilation of plant and animal material found in nature that is gathering and hunting because of warmer temperatures complex forest ecosystems and wetlands developed and this natural diversity necessitated new hunting and fishing strategies as new populations entered poland from west hunters and fishermen working individually or in small groups had to pursue single large and small animals using traps javelins bows and arrows boats and fishing equipment and utilizing dogs women engaged in gathering of such products as roots herbs nuts bird eggs mollusks fruit or honey which possibly was even more important than hunting mesolithic human settlements became quite numerous and by end of this period economy of harvesting nature became very highly developed tools and devices were made of materials such as stone flint strip mines have been found at northern edge of swietokrzyskie mountains bone wood horn or plant material for rope and baskets and included such fine utensils as fishing hooks and sewing needles animal figurines were made of amber at least during later mesolithic dead were placed in graves and outfitted with familiar objects of their surroundings one such well

burning activity brought about significant ecological and environmental changes in lesser poland silesia and kujawy further out were pastures entire area utilized by a single settlement having a radius of about 5 km cattle sheep and goats were even more numerous in northern flatlands where land was less fertile danubian people communities kept in touch and exchanged goods over large areas all way to their regions of origin beyond carpathian mountains after 5000 bce new waves of immigrants arrived from south again which accelerated process of differentiation of agrarian society into several distinct cultures during first half of 5th millennium bc and afterwards in oder river basin mostly there was culture named after punctured variety of linear band pottery stroked pottery culture while in vistula river basin lengyel and polgar cultures appeared two regions developed in some separation but within them different cultural traditions of younger danubian circle often overlapped houses were now of an elongated trapezoidal shape up to 40 meters long grouped in larger complexes often protected by beam and earth walls moats and other fortifications as such defensive measures apparently became necessary against people from still mesolithic native population or other danubian settlements these defensive structures built from mid 5th millennium bce on were complicated and consumed significant time and resources their design followed that of similar construction that was taking place in danube river areas starting in early part of this millennium large cemeteries and graves supplied with fancier objects such as jewelry including first so called princely graves princesses had imported copper necklaces earrings and diadems in addition to locally made decorations testify to emergence of a relatively more affluent society cattle raising and trading large varieties resulted from cross breeding with aurochs and land tillage provided basic sustenance salt was obtained and traded and became a much sought after commodity at first probably to help preserve stored food salt springs around wieliczka were utilized already by lengyel culture people who left ceramic vessels

trade with danubian people u zrodel polski p 40 and 44 ryszard grygiel native mesolithic populations were slow in gradually assimilating agricultural way of life beginning with just use of ceramics it took a thousand years into neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry which became especially important to them and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree when they eventually developed interest in more fertile areas utilized by late danubian cultures they became threat that compelled danubian farmers to fortify their settlements native post mesolithic groups expanded beyond traditional danubian areas of agricultural development moving also into ecologically less favorable environments which included utilization of sandy soils u zrodel polski p 40 41 ryszard grygiel first truly native neolithic culture was funnelbeaker culture named after shape of their typical clay vessels it developed starting around 4400 bce and lasted some two thousand years like other post mesolithic cultures funnelbeaker culture was megalithic they built tombs of large stones some of them huge for example trapezoidal structures up to 150 meters long and resembling pyramids few survived until now because of demand for stone as building material but a well preserved one from first half of 4th millennium bc was found in near wloclawek from this place and period came skull

to about 2400 bce in parallel with funnelbeaker culture and is named after bulging shape of its representative pottery they specialized in breeding domestic animals and lived in a semi settled state
