most important foreign trips was an official visit to france in may 1903 as guest of president emile loubet following a visit to pope leo xiii in rome this trip helped create atmosphere for anglo french entente cordiale an agreement delineating british and french colonies in north africa and ruling out any future war between two countries entente was negotiated in 1904 between french foreign minister theophile delcasse and british foreign secretary lord lansdowne it marked end of centuries of anglo french rivalry and britain s splendid isolation from continental affairs and attempted to

gladstone whom his mother detested magnus p 212 but statesman s son home secretary herbert gladstone angered king by planning to permit roman catholic priests in vestments to carry host through streets of london and by appointing two ladies lady frances balfour and mrs h j tennant to serve on a royal commission on reforming divorce law edward thought divorce could not be discussed with delicacy or even decency before ladies edward s biographer philip magnus suggests that gladstone may have become a whipping boy for king s general irritation with liberal government gladstone was sacked in reshuffle following year and king agreed with some reluctance to appoint him governor general of south africa magnus p 541 edward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform need for which had become apparent with failings of second boer war lee vol ii pp 91 93 ridley p 389 he supported redesign of army command creation of territorial force and decision to provide an expeditionary force supporting france in event of war with germany middlemas pp 130 134 reform of royal navy was also suggested partly due to ever increasing naval estimates and because of emergence of imperial german navy as a new strategic threat ultimately a dispute arose between admiral lord charles beresford who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment and first sea lord admiral sir john fisher who favoured efficiency savings scrapping obsolete vessels and a strategic realignment of royal navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by new dreadnoughts see principally for a much shorter summary of fisher s reforms see king lent support to fisher in part because he disliked beresford and eventually beresford was dismissed beresford continued his campaign outside of navy and fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909 although bulk of his policies were retained middlemas pp 134 139 king was intimately involved in appointment of fisher s successor as fisher beresford feud had split service and only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was sir arthur wilson who had retired in 1907 lambert pp 200 201 wilson was reluctant to return to active duty but edward persuaded him to do so and wilson became first sea lord on 25 january 1910 edward was rarely interested in politics although his views on some issues were notably liberal for time during his reign he said use of word nigger was disgraceful despite it then being in common parlance in 1904 during an anglo german summit in kiel between wilhelm ii and edward wilhelm with russo japanese war in mind started to go on about yellow peril which he called greatest peril menacing christendom and european civilisation if russians went on giving ground yellow race would in twenty years time be in moscow and posen wilhelm went on to attack his british guests for supporting japan against russia suggesting that british were committing race treason in response edward stated that he could not see it japanese were an intelligent brave and chivalrous nation quite as civilised as europeans from whom they only differed by pigmentation of their skin although edward lived a life of luxury often far removed from that of majority of his subjects his personal charm with all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime constitutional crisis thumb left upright bust by francis derwent wood thumb upright left profile of edward vii on a halfpenny 1902 in last year of his life edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when conservative majority in house of lords refused to pass people s budget proposed by liberal government of prime

lloyd george at limehouse heffer pp 276 277 ridley p 437 cabinet minister winston churchill publicly demanded a general election for which asquith apologised to king s adviser lord knollys and rebuked churchill at a cabinet meeting edward was so dispirited at tone of class warfare although asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over first home rule bill in 1886 that he introduced his son to secretary of state for war richard haldane as last king of england heffer pp 282 283 after king s horse minoru won derby on 26 july 1909 he returned to racetrack following day and laughed when a man shouted now king you ve won derby go back home and dissolve this bloody parliament magnus p 526 in vain king urged conservative leaders arthur balfour and lord lansdowne to pass budget which lord esher had advised him was not unusual as queen victoria had helped to broker agreements between two houses over irish disestablishment in 1869 and third reform act in 1884 magnus p 534 ridley pp 440 441 on asquith s advice however he did not offer them an election at which to judge from recent by elections they were likely to gain seats as a reward for doing so heffer pp 281 282 finance bill passed commons on 5 november 1909 but was rejected by lords on 30 november they instead passed a resolution of lord lansdowne s stating that they were entitled to oppose bill as it lacked an electoral mandate king was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of budget had become public p 536 and had forbidden knollys who was an active liberal peer from voting for budget although knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see budget pass heffer pp 283 284 in december 1909 a proposal to create peers to give liberals a majority in lords or give prime minister right to do so was considered outrageous by knollys who thought king should abdicate rather than agree to it ridley p 443 january 1910 election was dominated by talk of removing lords veto during election campaign lloyd george talked of guarantees and asquith of safeguards that would be necessary before forming another liberal government but king informed asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election hattersley p 168 balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a conservative government but advised king not to promise to create peers until he had seen terms of any proposed constitutional change heffer pp 286 288 during campaign leading conservative walter long had asked knollys for permission to state that king did not favour irish home rule but knollys refused on grounds that it was not appropriate for monarch s views to be known in public magnus p 547 election resulted in a hung parliament with liberal government dependent on support of third largest party irish nationalists king suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote which would also redress large conservative majority in lords but lord crewe liberal leader in lords advised that this would reduce lords independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked pressure to remove lords veto now came from irish nationalist mps who wanted to remove lords ability to block introduction of home rule they threatened to vote against budget unless they had their way an attempt by lloyd george to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as cabinet felt this would recast budget too much asquith now revealed that there were no guarantees for creation of peers cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to balfour to try to form a conservative government heffer pp 290 293 king s speech from throne on 21 february made reference to introducing measures restricting lords power of veto to one of delay but asquith inserted a phrase in opinion of my advisers so king could be seen to be distancing himself from planned legislation heffer p 291 commons passed resolutions on 14 april that would form basis for 1911 parliament act to remove power of lords to veto money bills to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay and to reduce term of parliament from seven years to five king would have preferred four but in that debate asquith hinted to ensure support of nationalist mps that he would ask king to break deadlock in that parliament i e contrary to edward s earlier stipulation that there be a second election budget was passed by both commons and lords in april heffer p 293 by april palace was having secret talks with balfour and randall davidson archbishop of canterbury who both advised that liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand creation of peers king thought whole proposal simply disgusting and that government was in hands of redmond co lord crewe announced publicly that government s wish to create peers should be treated as formal ministerial advice which by convention monarch must obey although lord esher argued that monarch was entitled in extremis to dismiss government rather than take their advice heffer pp 294 296 esher s view has been

prince of wales on 26 july 1958 ago as king edward vii proved a greater success than anyone had expected ridley pp 349 473 476 but he was already past average life expectancy and had little time left to fulfil role in his short reign he ensured that his second son and heir george v was better prepared to take throne contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son bentley cranch p 155 and on edward s death george wrote in his diary that he had lost his best friend and best of fathers i never had a cross word with him in my life i am heart

well as his relationships with his extended family fed paranoia of german emperor who blamed edward for war ridley p 474 publication of official biography of edward was delayed until 1927 by its author sidney lee who feared german propagandists would select material to portray edward as an anti german warmonger ridley p 487 lee was also hampered by extensive destruction of edward s personal papers edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death ridley pp 482 483 subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to lee ridley pp 494 495 historian r c k ensor writing in 1936 praised king s political personality he had in many respects great natural ability he knew how to be both dignified and charming he had an excellent memory and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional he had a store of varied though knowledge gathered at first hand through talking to all sorts of eminent men his tastes were not particularly elevated but they were thoroughly english and he showed much though not unfailing comprehension for common instincts of people over whom he reigned this was not less remarkable because though a good linguist in french and german he never learned to speak english without a german accent ensor p 343 ensor rejects widespread notion that king exerted important influence on british foreign policy believing he gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts ensor thought surviving documents showed how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were how little he read and of what naive indiscretions he was capable ensor pp 567 569 edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self indulgent pleasure but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact as his grandson edward viii wrote his lighter side obscured fact that he had both insight and influence duke of windsor p 69 he had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty wrote j b priestley priestley p 25 lord esher wrote that edward vii was kind and debonair
