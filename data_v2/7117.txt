heffernan v city of paterson 578 u s 2016 was a united states supreme court case in 2016 concerning first amendment rights of public employees by a 6 2 margin court held that a public employee s constitutional rights might be violated when an employer believing that employee was engaging in what would be protected speech disciplines them because of that belief even if employee did not exercise such a constitutional right case was brought after jeffrey heffernan a detective with paterson new jersey police force went to a distribution center and picked up a lawn sign for candidate challenging city s incumbent mayor in 2005 election heffernan s mother had wanted a sign so he was getting one for her while heffernan did not support challenger after other officers saw him with sign they told senior officers including police chief who strongly supported mayor for his apparent public support of other candidate they demoted heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer heffernan brought suit alleging that his demotion violated his first amendment rights case took a decade to reach supreme court for most of that time it was in federal district court where it was heard by three different judges a jury verdict in heffernan s favor was set aside a later summary judgment in city s favor was overturned on appeal before being granted again in third trial hereafter distinguished as heffernan iii writing for a majority of supreme court justice stephen breyer stated that department s belief was all that mattered since court s precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline for engaging in partisan political activity as long as that activity is not disruptive to agency s operations even if heffernan was not engaging in protected speech he wrote discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights justice clarence thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by justice samuel alito in which he agreed that heffernan had been harmed but his constitutional rights had not been violated legal background first amendment guarantees rights of freedom of speech and peaceable assembly among others while not explicitly mentioned supreme court has held that right to assembly includes freedom of association particularly political association these protections not only prohibit government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights but also from taking actions which would violate them while bill of rights which includes first amendment applied originally only to federal government ratification of fourteenth amendment allowed for application of bill of rights to states under incorporation doctrine in order to better protect these rights in reconstruction era congress passed second enforcement act of 1871 at request of president ulysses s grant to better counter white supremacist organizations such as ku klux klan that were intimidating and suppressing voting by black citizens act provided a remedy for those citizens who were deprived of their constitutional rights under color of any statute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory or district of columbia and is currently codified at 42 u s c ss 1983 42 u s c ss 1983 with its decision in monroe v pape 1961 court expanded reach of section 1983 such that it is now used as a method of checking abuse by state officials who infringe upon constitutionally protected rights first amendment protects public employees from retaliation by their employer when speaking on matters of public concern in pickering v board of education 1968 court first articulated right of public employees to be protected from dismissal for exercising their right to free speech there supreme court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue pickering v board of education eight years later this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in elrod v burns but court has recognized that government as employer has wider constitutional latitude in its decisions than government as sovereign in order to adequately delineate limits of government as employer s discretion court developed a framework in connick v myers 1983 known as connick test it consists of two elements first is threshold a plaintiff must pass to state a claim plaintiff must show that they were speaking on a matter of public concern second falls to employer they must show that harm to workplace efficiency outweighs harm caused by infringing upon right to free speech in waters v churchill 1994 court was faced with two differing accounts of speech at issue question presented to court was whether connick test ought be applied to what employer thought was said or what was actually said case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker there was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said justice sandra day o connor joined by a plurality of justices opined that connick test must be applied to speech employer thought occurred and on which it acted rather than that which finder of fact determines did occur prior history original dispute thumb downtown paterson alt a cityscape of medium height high rises and some older buildings amid trees seen from above through some leaves and branches in 2005 jeffrey heffernan was a detective with paterson new jersey police his supervisor and chief of police were both appointed by city s incumbent mayor jose torres who was being challenged by city councilman lawrence spagnola in that year s election heffernan was friendly with spagnola a former police chief and informally supported his campaign he could not vote in election as he did not live in city hereafter distinguished as heffernan ii at request of his sick mother who did live in city heffernan while off duty picked up a spagnola lawn sign for her after her previous sign was stolen other officers saw him at distribution location holding a sign and talking to spagnola campaign staff they soon notified superiors and next day officials demoted heffernan from detective to patrol officer for his perceived overt involvement with spagnola campaign district court heffernan sued city mayor and his superior officers under 42 u s c in federal district court for new jersey claiming that his rights of freedom of speech as well as freedom of association had been violated heffernan contended that while he had not actually engaged in any protected speech department acted on belief that he had and department should not have demoted him on basis of that erroneous belief in 2009 a jury found for heffernan and awarded him damages from police officials and city despite verdict heffernan sought a retrial because judge peter g sheridan had not allowed him to pursue freedom of speech claim defense did so as well because judge sheridan had allowed freedom of association claim while considering these motions judge sheridan became aware of a conflict of interest through a former law firm and set aside verdict setting a new date for trial before judge dennis m cavanaugh heffernan ii at 568 citing earlier 2012 decision judge cavanaugh granted summary judgment to defendants on freedom of speech claim based on their earlier motions holding that heffernan had not engaged in protected speech so his rights could not have been violated in 2012 third circuit court of appeals reversed judge cavanaugh s ruling and remanded case to him with instructions that he was to allow heffernan to present his freedom of association claim and consider facts from jury trial when reconsidering summary judgment motions judge kevin mcnulty heard case on remand after considering parties motions for summary judgment again he ruled in city s favor in 2014 heffernan he ruled had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct judge mcnulty also ruled that heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected per ambrose v robinson township a previous case on that issue in third circuit or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech heffernan ii 570 76 judge mcnulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association he decided that dye v office of racing commission a case in which sixth circuit had held that first amendment reached perceived political association was not a precedent he could rely on since dye itself explicitly rejected ambrose and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent heffernan ii 579 581 court of appeals on appeal to third circuit a three judge panel of judge robert cowen judge morton ira greenberg and judge thomas i vanaskie unanimously held for city in a decision issued in 2015 judge vanaskie writing for court reiterated judge mcnulty s finding that heffernan s actions in picking up sign for his mother did not constitute protected speech or association he distinguished case at hand from sixth circuit s ruling in dye by noting that in that case employers had inferred employees intent from their non participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken as had occurred in heffernan s case judge vanaskie instead found guidance from supreme court s 1994 holding in waters v churchill in which it had upheld an illinois public hospital s dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague despite an ongoing factual dispute about substance of those comments court found that hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what nurse had said before firing her in that case court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not rise to level of a constitutional violation supreme court following third circuit s decision heffernan petitioned supreme court for certiorari requesting they hear case after court considered both heffernan s petition and city s reply it granted petition on first day of 2015 term both parties consented to filing of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in outcome of case national association of government employees becket fund for religious liberty and thomas jefferson center for protection of free expression filed amicus briefs in support of heffernan while new jersey state league of municipalities and national conference of state legislatures filed briefs in support of city of paterson amicus curiae briefs in support of petitioners amicus briefs in support of respondents united states government also filed an amicus brief in support of heffernan as well as a motion to appear at oral argument which court granted meaning solicitor general s office would be appearing at oral arguments held on january 19 2016 oral arguments mark frost arguing for petitioner jeffrey heffernan was immediately met with questions from justices anthony kennedy asked for clarification on particular right to be protected and antonin scalia samuel alito and chief justice john roberts all questioned him about whether his rights could be infringed if he was not actually engaged in any speech justice scalia who died before decision was announced argued that there was no constitutional right not to be fired for wrong reason oral arguments frost responded that motives of government rather than actions of individual were important in this case assistant to solicitor general ginger anders arguing on behalf of united states as amicus curiae in favor of heffernan continued this argument stating that there is a first amendment right not to have adverse action taken against him by his employer for unconstitutional purpose of suppressing disfavored political beliefs arguing for respondents thomas goldstein distinguished between political neutrality and political apathy he argued that first amendment protects political neutrality conscious choice to not take a position but does not protect political apathy when a person simply does not care and makes no particular choice to be neutral as heffernan claimed that he had no affiliation with spagnola respondents argued that heffernan s actions constitute unprotected apathy rather than a conscious choice of neutrality transcript of oral argument at 31 heffernan v city of paterson 578 us 2016 justice elena kagan questioned goldstein as to purpose of first amendment saying idea has to do with why government acted to which he responded it s called an individual right not a government wrong frost took a rebuttal to respond to goldstein s distinction between political neutrality and apathy arguing that there is little distinction as government is acting for impermissible reasons in both cases opinion of court thumb upright right justice stephen breyer delivered opinion of court in a 6 2 decision authored by justice stephen breyer court reversed ruling of lower court and ruled that employer s motive is material to first amendment challenges citing waters v churchill justice breyer wrote w e conclude that as in waters government s reason for demoting heffernan is what counts here when an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent employee from engaging in political activity that first amendment protects employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action under first amendment even if as here employer makes a factual mistake about employee s behavior court remanded case to third circuit and made clear in its opinion that while it is impermissible to retaliate based upon perceived protected speech lower courts should take into consideration whether heffernan was disciplined for violating any different and neutral policies majority provided three main arguments in support of its reasoning that their interpretation is more in line with text of first amendment that it better served first amendment s purpose of limiting political patronage and that such an interpretation will not significantly burden employers justice breyer argued that unlike fourteenth amendment which focuses on rights of people first amendment focuses on actions of government when it says congress shall make no law freedom of speech citing u s const amend i internal quotations omitted as text of amendment focuses on government s abilities to make laws it is government s actions and motives not actual actions of citizens which are proscribed by amendment while policy at issue was not a law of congress actions were still that of a government official that infringed upon rights guaranteed by first amendment court supported this interpretation by recognizing that first amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity constitutional harm at issue in ordinary free speech case consists in large part of discouraging employees both employee discharged or demoted and his or her colleagues from engaging in protected activities citing v finkel court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful and similarly extended that logic to this case potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech still exists regardless of factual basis of employer s reasoning citing because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal both should be considered in violation of first amendment respondents argued that finding employers liable for factual mistakes would place substantial costs upon employers court rejected this argument saying that an employee would still need to prove employer acted out of an improper motive referring to heffernan s case and those like it court said that employee will if anything find it more difficult to prove that motive for employee will have to point to more than his own conduct to show an employer s intent dissent thumb right upright alt a portrait of justice clarence thomas justice thomas authored dissent justice clarence thomas authored dissent in which justice samuel alito joined justice thomas argued that previous ruling should have been upheld because federal law does not provide a cause of action to plaintiffs whose constitutional rights have not been violated dissent focused on text of statute heffernan was suing under 42 u s c ss 1983 statute provides a cause of action only for those whose rights have actually been violated by government because heffernan maintained that he had not been exercising his first amendment rights dissent argued that those rights could not have been violated and that a section 1983 claim requires that employee engage in protected activity and that employer retaliate against that activity dissent argued that for a section 1983 claim to be valid harm alone is not enough it has to be right kind of harm thomas provided an example of a law allowing police to pull over any driver without cause this would obviously violate fourth amendment rights of anyone stopped but people stuck in traffic who were injured by collateral damage of unconstitutional actions would not be able to sue because none of their rights was violated similarly it is not enough for heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well for dissent even if dismissal was for wrong reason and harm was suffered dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised further supporting their argument dissent cited monterey v del monte dunes at monterey ltd to argue that a section 1983 claim falls under tort law in order to draw a distinction between how attempts are handled under tort and criminal law under criminal law a factually impossible attempt to commit a crime such as trying to steal from an empty pocket or defraud someone with no money can still be tried as an attempt no such doctrine exists in tort law because heffernan was not engaged in protected activity police department could only have attempted to deprive him of his right so his suit must fail because there are no attempted torts citing commentary day after oral arguments writer gilad edelman criticized court s assumption that heffernan never exercised his first amendment rights saying supreme court may miss an opportunity to make sure that cases like his really are rare edelman interpreted heffernan s actions as being well within existing first amendment precedent though heffernan was not necessarily supporting candidate he was talking and associating with people connected to candidate actions already protected under existing precedent edelman suggested that regardless of whether or not heffernan intended to be identified as supporting campaign he was still punished by city for associating soon after ruling was announced decision was largely praised jonathan stahl a writer at constitution daily said that t he potential impact of this case on our understanding of first amendment is notable similarly economist called it good law and a significant development for expanding existing jurisprudence to perceived speech not just actual speech aftermath subsequent to supreme court s ruling city of paterson approved a 1 6 million settlement payout to heffernan final payment of settlement was due on
