during afternoon rush hour of june 22 2009 a subway train on train collision occurred between two southbound red line washington metro trains in northeast washington d c united states a moving train collided with a train stopped ahead of it train operator along with eight passengers were killed and 80 people were injured making it deadliest crash in history of washington metro national transportation safety board ntsb investigation found that after a june 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became site of june 22 collision track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead because entire train was within faulty circuit it became invisible to automatic train control atc system train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at operator of striking train applied emergency brake after stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent collision which occurred at approximately collision thumb aerial view of emergency responders at crash thumb ntsb and recovery team working in night following collision at approximately 4 57 pm edt 20 57 utc on monday june 22 2009 washington metro train 112 bound from glenmont to shady grove left takoma station minutes later at 5 02 pm train 112 rear ended train 214 which was stopped between takoma and fort totten stations while waiting for another train to leave fort totten station nine people were killed including operator in lead car of moving train mcmillan 42 of springfield virginia at least 80 people were injured death toll makes crash deadliest in metro history ntsb found that train 214 had come to a stop entirely within faulty circuit b2 304 making it effectively invisible to automatic train control atc system other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum to make it to next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from atc system train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit b2 304 and was therefore invisible train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by atc to proceed on track investigation found that emergency brakes had been applied by operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert collision which occurred with a speed of about a series of almost collisions in 2005 in similar circumstances in tunnel between foggy bottom and rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified faulty circuit after installation however by 2009 metro engineers were unaware of this incident or tests developed to detect failure condition rolling stock involved thumb left car 5066 following collision being investigated by ntsb this car was retired by wmata and was used as a source of spare parts along with 5067 until all 5000 series were pulled from service in late 2018 train 112 moving train was made up of cars 1079 1078 1071 1070 1130 and 1131 all from 1000 series train 214 stationary train was made up of cars 3036 3037 3256 5067 and 5066 from breda 3000 series and caf 5000 series cars are equipped with on board systems called automatic train operation and automatic train control which allow autonomous operation with little human intervention after collision wmata announced a policy of no longer placing 1000 series at end of train consists to prevent a telescoping in a collision as they were weakest cars structurally all 1000 series cars were then put in middle of trainsets and served for another 8 years until their retirement in june 2017 cars 5066 and 5067 were never repaired and were used as a source for spare parts until all 5000 series railcars were retired in 2018 1078 was also retired following collision response at 5 20 pm rescuers first entered car 1079 lead car of train 112 this car had telescoped over rear car of stationary train trapping many passengers who required rescue by emergency workers using ladders for access survivors described crash as like hit ting a concrete wall with air clouded by smoke and debris and panic among passengers when car doors did not immediately open metro crash like we hit a concrete wall passenger says cnn june 23 2009 retrieved june 23 2009 dennis oglesby and martin griffith two united states army soldiers who were in lead train and were uninjured in collision helped passengers evacuate from their train most of whom appeared to have minor injuries oglesby and griffith then noticed that six to eight people from other train had been ejected by force of collision and were more seriously injured one person from overtaking train had been thrown onto roof of stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound soldiers gave first aid to more seriously injured victims until help arrived and informed responding emergency personnel that rails were still powered and needed to be shut down cox matthew soldiers jumped into action after d c crash military times august 23 2009 thumb evening rush hour commuters waiting to board shuttle buses at rhode island avenue brentwood station on evening of collision immediately following collision firefighters and paramedics from district of columbia fire and emergency medical services were dispatched to takoma metro station and arrived at location of collision soon after d c fire chief dennis rubin stated that initial 9 1 1 emergency calls made incident seem small but after firefighters arrived on scene they dispatched mass casualty incident teams within two hours more than 200 firefighters were on scene in response to three alarm incident d c fire chief firefighters expected a small incident washington post june 23 2009 rescuers worked through night of june 22 using cranes and heavy rescue equipment to free trapped passengers and search for bodies fire chief dennis rubin initially confirmed four fatalities including train operator and 74 injuries 14 of which were considered moderate and 6 critical 4 dead after metro trains collide in washington d c fox news june 22 2009 five of dead were discovered in wreckage and removed from site of collision on morning of june 23 as cranes dismantling wrecked trains revealed bodies nine fatalities were eventually confirmed major general ret david f wherley jr of district of columbia air national guard known for deploying fighter jets to defend washington d c during september 11 attacks was killed in collision along with his wife ann other passengers killed in crash were king veronica dubose cameron williams dennis hawkins mary doolittle and ana fernandez according to daniel a former george w bush administration homeland security official now with homeland security policy institute at george washington university overall emergency response was calm and ordered indicating that u s emergency response during extraordinary incidents has significantly improved since september 11 attacks service disruption thumb delays continued on red line day after collision earlier situation referred to on passenger information display system sign thumb clean up recovery of wrecked cars following collision red line service was suspended between fort totten and silver spring until saturday june 27 immediately following incident red line services were suspended between fort totten and takoma stations and new hampshire avenue was closed service between silver spring and rhode island ave brentwood stations was suspended pending completion of initial investigation and clearing of debris this section was expected to remain shut down at least through june 23 washington mayor adrian fenty said that transportation all along east coast will be significantly impacted as amtrak and marc trains run on tracks adjacent to crash site bus services were deployed to route metrorail passengers around closed track but area commuting was severely affected federal government urged its employees in capital area to on june 23 if possible after crash feds urge telework washington post june 23 2009 morning commute will be tough for many washington post june 23 2009 red line was projected to be very crowded after resumption of service and washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata advised people to take alternate bus routes replacement bus shuttle between affected stations was expected to be subjected to long delays services were restored in both directions on saturday june 27 but with a reduced maximum speed of 35 mph on entire red line and slower speeds in area of collision aftermath initial inquiry thumb a typical 1000 series trainset similar to moving train in accident arriving at fort totten shortly after incident wmata general manager john catoe stated that cause was not known but that system is safe d c metro trains collide killing four wall street journal june 22 2009 national transportation safety board ntsb began an investigation wmata and ntsb investigators considered several possible causes which might include operator error brake failure fault in computerized signal and operation system or a combination of three during rush hour operation train movement is typically controlled by a centralized computer system and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply brakes to prevent a collision these systems had failed at least once in past and ntsb subsequently identified incompatible specifications from maximum deceleration capability of trains to deceleration rates used in wayside system design train has a manual emergency brake which can be applied by driver in event of an imminent collision if driver can see and identify hazard with sufficient time to stop officials indicated that manual brake was indeed engaged it is possible that brake system failed to perform as designed or that operator applied brake too late layton lindsey experts suspect failure of signal system operator error washington post june 23 2009 retrieved june 23 2009 lead car of moving train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance in a press conference evening of june 22 catoe stated that last car on stopped train was a caf 5000 series car car 5066 which entered service in 2001 and that lead car on moving train was a rohr industries 1000 series car wmata later confirmed that all of cars on moving train were 1000 series thumb a typical 5000 series car similar to stopped train in accident at branch avenue yard 1000 series entered service in 1976 when metro system opened and were refurbished and had their motors converted from dc to ac propulsion by breda in mid 1990s in 2006 ntsb cited 1000 series cars as vulnerable to catastrophic telescoping damage and complete loss of occupant survival space in a longitudinal end structure collision it recommended refurbishment of entire series after a 2004 collision at woodley park station in which a 1000 series rohr car telescoped into another train in this case ntsb s hersman confirmed that first car of striking train overrode rear car of struck train and much of survivable space on that first car of striking train was compromised ntsb called for accelerated retirement of 1000 series cars or urged that they be retrofitted with crashworthiness collision protection that is comparable to 6000 series car railcars additionally 1000 series cars lack data recorders that could be used in determining cause of a crash during press conference catoe stated that he had no basis to suspend use of 1000 series cars at this time mike old questions about crashworthiness of metro cars washington city paper june 22 2009 retrieved june 22 2009 however wmata later announced a decision to no longer use 1000 series cars as lead or trailing units of any trains on june 24 wmata issued a press release stating that agency is not likely to know cause for several weeks or months as investigation unfolds twenty four hours after incident ntsb confirmed that evidence indicated that emergency brake had been engaged by operator additionally striking train was in automatic mode and so on board software should have stopped train thumb inbound approach to collision site on june 25 ntsb tests of long track circuit below stopped train showed that it did not work correctly failing to detect presence of a test train that investigators had placed on it hersman said these circuits are vital it s a signal system it s providing information authorization and speed commands to following train but stopped short of blaming them in this case wmata had replaced all 20 000 track circuit relays system wide in 1999 after a component designed to last 70 years began failing after only 25 years in service but agency claims that none of newer relays had failed prior to this event wmata ordered inspection of all track circuits on its of track after ntsb test on july 23 ntsb announced that track circuit at accident site had been malfunctioning since 2007 18 months prior to collision and wmata has since found six other circuits within system that have been behaving unusually wmata disabled each circuit that could not be immediately fixed and created an online circuit tracking system similar to its elevator outage tracker ntsb report ntsb report on accident was released on july 27 2010 and blamed a faulty track circuit part of automatic train control system for causing crash wmata made a press release detailing changes on july 26 in anticipation of release of report memorials thumb left 150px a plaque that commemorates victims of collision at fort totten station a plaque is located inside of fort totten s mezzanine that commemorates victims of crash on june 22 2015 sixth anniversary of accident legacy memorial park in honor of victims was opened ground was broken exactly one year previously by mayor vincent c gray park features a memorial wall and nine inscribed sculptures one in honor of each person killed in crash sculptures were created by sculptor barbara liotta and memorial was designed by firm of hunt design is titled a sacred grove representatives of victims families and city government officials attended dedication but metro officials did not park is located at entrance to blair memorial gardens which is close to site of collision same week as memorial dedication national transportation safety board held hearings related to another fatal incident in metro system one which happened earlier in 2015 juxtaposition of two events was noted by some commentators on third anniversary of crash a plaque on charles bridge was unveiled bridge crosses rail tracks at site of accident and a makeshift memorial had been maintained there by victims families ntsb chairwoman deborah hersman attended unveiling along with mayor gray another memorial plaque was also installed by metro officials at fort totten station it was subject to complaints from relatives of dead who claimed that it was insensitive see also incidents on washington metro november 29 2009
