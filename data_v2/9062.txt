thumb upright 1 2 bessell s evidence against thorpe reported in daily mirror during pre trial committal proceedings november 1978 thorpe affair of 1970s was a british political and sex scandal that ended career of jeremy thorpe leader of liberal party and member of parliament mp for north devon scandal arose from allegations by norman josiffe otherwise known as norman scott that he and thorpe had a homosexual relationship in early 1960s and that thorpe had begun a badly planned conspiracy to murder josiffe who was threatening to expose their affair thorpe while admitting that two had been friends denied any such relationship with help of political colleagues and a compliant press he was able to ensure that rumours of misconduct went unreported for more than a decade scott s allegations were a persistent threat however and by mid 1970s he was regarded as a danger both to thorpe and to liberal party which was then enjoying a resurgence of popularity and was close to a place in government attempts to buy or frighten scott into silence were unsuccessful and problem deepened until fallout following shooting of his dog during a possible murder attempt by a hired gunman in october 1975 brought matter into open after further newspaper revelations thorpe was forced to resign liberal leadership in may 1976 and subsequent police investigations led to his being charged with three others with conspiracy to murder scott before case came to trial thorpe lost his parliamentary seat at 1979 general election at trial in may 1979 prosecution s case depended heavily on evidence of scott of thorpe s former parliamentary colleague peter bessell and of hired gunman andrew newton none of these witnesses impressed court bessell s credibility was undermined by revelations of his financial arrangements with sunday telegraph in his summing up judge was scathing about prosecution s evidence and all four defendants were acquitted nevertheless thorpe s public reputation was damaged irreparably by case he had chosen not to testify at trial which left several matters unexplained amid public disquiet thorpe s retirement into private life was followed by onset of parkinson s disease in mid 1980s and he made few public statements afterwards he eventually achieved a reconciliation with north devon liberal democrat constituency party of which he was honorary president from 1988 until his death in 2014 allegations of suppression of evidence by police before trial were under investigation from 2015 reaching a culmination in june 2018 when police said that there was no new evidence and case would remain closed background homosexuality and english law before passage of sexual offences act 1967 which decriminalised most homosexual acts in england and wales but did not apply to scotland or northern ireland all sexual activity between men was illegal throughout united kingdom and carried heavy criminal penalties antony grey a secretary of homosexual law reform

junior foreign office minister in harold macmillan s government was found guilty of indecent behaviour with a coldstream guardsman in november 1958 he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary seat at harrow east he was ostracised by conservative party and by most of his former friends and never again held a position in public life parris pp 136 40 thus anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end chester et al pp 31 33 thorpe thumb barnstaple main town in thorpe s north devon

his main energies to making a personal impact rather than to his studies freeman and penrose pp 13 19 rejecting his conservative background he joined small centrist liberal party which by late 1940s was a declining force in british politics but still offered a national platform and a challenge to an ambitious young politician chester et al pp 14 15 he became secretary and eventually president of oxford liberal club and met many of party s leading figures in hilary term january march of 1950 51 thorpe served as president of oxford union in 1952 while studying at inner temple prior to his call

government chester et al p 29 writer and former mp matthew parris described thorpe as one of more dashing among new mps elected in 1959 parris p 208 thorpe s chief political interest lay in field of human rights and his speeches criticising apartheid in south africa attracted attention of south african bureau of state security boss who took note of this rising star in liberal party thorpe was

some pony feed and was put on probation with encouragement of his probation officer he took lessons at westerham riding school at oxted in surrey and eventually found work at a stable in altrincham in cheshire after moving there he chose to cut all links with his family and began to call himself lianche josiffe lianche being a stylised version of lynch he also hinted at an aristocratic background and of family tragedies that had left him orphaned and alone chester et al pp 36 37 in 1959 josiffe moved to kingham stables in chipping norton oxfordshire where he learned dressage while working as a groom stables were owned by norman vater self made son of a coalminer who like josiffe had inflated his name and was known as brecht van de vater in course of his rise vater had made numerous friends in higher social circles among them thorpe initially josiffe was settled and happy at stables but his relationship with vater deteriorated in face of latter s assertive and demanding manner and he was unable to form good relationships with his fellow workers freeman and penrose pp 39 40 he began to evidence kind of behaviour which a journalist would later summarise as his extraordinary talent for wheedling his way into people s sympathy before turning their lives to misery with his hysterical temper tantrums bessell peter bessell eight years older than thorpe had a successful business career before entering liberal politics in 1950s he came to party leadership s attention in 1955 when as liberal candidate in torquay by election he substantially increased his party s vote in first of a series of impressive liberal results during 1955 59 parliament cook and ramsden pp 153 54 he was subsequently selected as candidate for more winnable constituency of bodmin and became both an admirer and personal friend of thorpe who in turn was impressed by bessell s apparent business acumen freeman and penrose p 90 at bodmin in 1959 general election bessell reduced conservative majority and he followed this in october 1964 election with victory by over 3 000 votes with prestige of letters mp after his name bessell set out in pursuit of serious money making while staying close to thorpe whom he considered likely next leader of liberal party freeman and penrose pp 93 94 bessell noted that thorpe for all his gregariousness and warmth appeared to have no female friends and lacked any interest in girls former liberal mp frank owen confided to bessell his suspicions that thorpe was homosexual other west country liberals had formed same opinion freeman and penrose pp 91 92 aware that exposure as a gay man would end thorpe s career bessell became his self appointed protector even to extent he later said of falsely claiming to be bisexual as a means of acquiring his friend s confidence freeman and penrose pp 94 96 origins thorpe scott friendship in late 1960 or early 1961 thorpe visited vater at kingham stables and briefly met josiffe he was sufficiently taken with young man to suggest that should josiffe ever need help he should call on him at house of commons soon after this josiffe left stables after a serious disagreement with vater he then suffered a mental breakdown and for much of 1961 was under psychiatric care on 8 november 1961 a week after discharging himself from ashurst clinic in oxford josiffe went to house of commons to see thorpe he was penniless homeless and worse had left vater s employment without national insurance card which at that time was essential for obtaining regular work and access to social and unemployment benefits thorpe promised he would help freeman and penrose pp 40 43 according to josiffe s account a homosexual liaison with thorpe began that same evening at his mother s ursula thorpe nee norton griffiths 1903 1992 home in oxted and continued for several years chester et al p pp 209 10 thorpe while acknowledging that a friendship developed denied any sexual dimension in relationship parris p 223 he organised accommodation for josiffe in london and a longer term stay with a family in barnstaple within north devon constituency he paid for advertisements in country life magazine in an effort to find work with horses for his friend chester et al p 41 freeman and penrose pp 48 53 arranged various temporary jobs and promised to help josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in france on basis of josiffe s claim that his father had died in an air crash thorpe s solicitors investigated whether any money was due but found that albert josiffe was alive and well in orpington parris pp 208 and 212 when early in 1962 police questioned josiffe about alleged theft of a suede jacket thorpe persuaded investigating officer that josiffe was recovering from mental illness and was under his care no further action was taken freeman and penrose pp 50 51 in april 1962 josiffe obtained a replacement national insurance card which he later said was retained by thorpe who had assumed role of his employer this was denied by thorpe and missing card remained an ongoing source of grievance for josiffe chester et al p 44 he began to feel marginalised by thorpe and in december 1962 in a fit of depression confided to a friend his intention to shoot mp and commit suicide friend alerted police to whom josiffe gave a detailed statement of his sexual relations with thorpe and produced letters to support his story none of this evidence impressed police sufficiently for them to take action although a report on matter was added to thorpe s mi5 file freeman and penrose pp 58 60 in 1963 a relatively calm period in josiffe s life as a riding instructor in northern ireland ended after he was seriously hurt in an accident at dublin horse show freeman and penrose pp 65 and 74 he moved back to england and eventually found a job at a riding school in wolverhampton where he stayed for several months before his erratic behaviour proved too much and he was asked to leave chester p 49 after a period of aimlessness in london josiffe saw an advertisement for a groom s post in in switzerland thorpe used his influence to secure him job josiffe left for switzerland in december 1964 but returned to england almost immediately with complaints that conditions were impossible in his hurry to depart he left his suitcase behind which contained letters and other documents that he believed supported his claims to a sexual relationship with thorpe freeman and penrose pp 76 78 threats and counter measures thorpe proved to be a lively and witty performer in cut and thrust of parliamentary debates and his presence in house of commons was soon noticed in july 1962 in wake of some disastrous conservative by election performances macmillan sacked seven cabinet ministers in what was known as night of long knives thorpe s comment greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his friends for his life was widely regarded in press as most apt verdict on prime minister freeman and penrose pp 33 34 thorpe raised his political profile with effective attacks on government bureaucracy and in october 1964 general election was returned in north devon with an increased majority chester et al p 48 a year later he secured office of liberal party treasurer a significant step towards his ambition to become next party leader freeman and penrose p 109 by early 1965 josiffe was in dublin where he worked at various horse related jobs while continuing to badger thorpe by letter about his missing luggage and continuing national insurance card issue freeman and penrose pp 79 80 however thorpe rejected any responsibility for these matters chester et al pp 50 52 in mid march 1965 josiffe wrote a long letter to thorpe s mother which began for last five years as you probably know jeremy and i have had a homosexual relationship letter blamed thorpe for awakening this vice that lies latent in every man and accused him of callousness and disloyalty parris p 213 ursula thorpe gave letter to her son who drafted a quasi legal statement rejecting damaging and groundless accusations and accusing josiffe of attempting to blackmail him document was never sent instead thorpe turned to bessell for advice freeman and penrose pp 84 86 bessell anxious to be of service to his party s highest profile figure flew to dublin in april 1965 he found that josiffe was being advised by a sympathetic jesuit priest father sweetman freeman and penrose pp 97 99 who believed that at least some of josiffe s allegations might be true otherwise he asked bessell why had he flown all way from london to deal with them chester et al p 63 bessell warned josiffe of consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover missing luggage and insurance card he also hinted at possibility of an equestrian job in america bessell s intervention appeared to contain problem particularly as josiffe s suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards although letters implicating thorpe had been removed chester et al pp 68 69 for most of following two years josiffe remained largely quiescent in ireland attempting to establish himself in various careers part of this time was spent in a monastery it was during this period that he formally adopted name of scott freeman and penrose pp 126 27 in april 1967 scott wrote to bessell from ireland asking for help in obtaining a passport in his changed name so that he could begin a new life in america a second less positive letter dated july indicated that scott had returned to england and was once again in difficulties with medical bills and other debts his lack of an insurance card prevented him from claiming benefits chester pp 82 84 by this time thorpe had succeeded jo grimond as leader of liberal party chester et al pp 74 78 to resolve scott s immediate problems and to prevent a resumption of his tirades against new party leader bessell began paying him a retainer of between ps5 and ps10 a week ostensibly in lieu of lost national insurance benefits freeman and penrose pp 128 30 bessell also arranged scott s new passport but by this time scott had abandoned his american plans and wished to establish a career as a model he asked bessell for ps200 to set him up bessell refused but in may 1968 gave him ps75 on understanding there would be no further demands for a year freeman and penrose pp 139 40 developments incitement thorpe s leadership of liberals was not initially an unqualified success his local campaigning skills did not readily transfer to set speeches on national or international issues and some sections of party became restless chester et al p 80 his engagement to caroline allpass announced in april 1968 reassured those in party who had reservations about his private life others were shocked by thorpe s emphasis on political motivation for marriage worth five points in polls he opined to mike steele party s press officer freeman and penrose pp 133 35 for much of 1968 thorpe was untroubled by scott who had acquired new friends and according to bessell had burned his thorpe letters freeman and penrose pp 140 42 his reappearance in november 1968 again penniless and without prospect of work was particularly unwelcome to thorpe as he fought to establish his leadership credentials bessell provided immediate relief by resuming weekly cash retainer but this was a short term respite early in december 1968 bessell was summoned to thorpe s office in house of commons according to bessell thorpe said of scott we ve got to get rid of him and later it is no worse than shooting a sick dog parris p 215 bessell said later that he was unsure whether thorpe was serious but decided to play along by discussing various ways of getting rid of scott s body thorpe supposedly thought that disposal down one of cornwall s many disused tin mines offered best option and also suggested his friend david holmes as an appropriate assassin holmes one of four assistant treasurers of liberal party appointed by thorpe in 1965 had been best man at thorpe s wedding and was completely loyal to him freeman and penrose pp 143 46 bessell further maintained that in january 1969 thorpe called him to a meeting together with holmes and that again thorpe put forward suggestions for eliminating scott these were dismissed as impractical or ridiculous by bessell and holmes who nevertheless agreed to give matter further consideration they hoped said bessell that if they stalled thorpe would see absurdity of his murder scheme and abandon it holmes who largely confirmed bessell s account of meeting later justified this decision on grounds that if we had simply said no he might have gone elsewhere and that might have led to an even greater disaster according to bessell and holmes discussions of plan ended in may 1969 after surprising news of scott s wedding that month party enquiry by early 1971 thorpe s political career had stalled he had led party to a disastrous performance in general election of june 1970 in an unexpected victory for conservatives under edward heath liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats and thorpe s majority in north devon fell to below 400 chester et al pp 110 12 bessell with mounting business worries did not stand for re election in bodmin thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left party on verge of bankruptcy but matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife caroline was killed in a road accident 11 days after election thorpe was devastated he continued as leader but for next year performed little beyond routine party duties thumb village of tal y bont north wales where scott lived in 1971 meanwhile bessell s efforts ensured that for time being scott threat was kept at bay missing insurance card meant that scott s wife who was pregnant could not claim maternity benefits scott threatened to talk to newspapers but matter was resolved by issue of an emergency card after bessell s intervention at department of health and social security chester pp 96 98 in 1970 scott s marriage collapsed he blamed thorpe and again threatened exposure freeman and penrose pp 160 61 bessell successfully prevented thorpe s name being mentioned in court during divorce proceedings and arranged that thorpe would anonymously pay legal costs chester et al pp 120 and penrose pp 161 64 early in 1971 scott moved to a cottage in village of talybont in north wales where he befriended a widow gwen parry jones he sufficiently persuaded her of his mistreatment at hands of thorpe that she contacted liberal mp for adjoining constituency of montgomeryshire emlyn hooson on right wing of party and a friend of neither thorpe nor bessell hooson suggested a meeting at house of commons freeman and penrose pp 166 70 on 26 and 27 may 1971 scott told his story to hooson and david steel liberals chief whip neither was fully convinced but felt matter warranted further investigation against thorpe s wishes a confidential party enquiry was arranged for 9 june to be chaired by lord byers leader of liberals in house of lords at enquiry byers took a tough line against scott failing to offer him a chair and treating him scott said like a boy at school up before headmaster freeman and penrose pp 170 75 byers s unsympathetic manner quickly unsettled scott who changed details of his story several times and frequently broke down in tears byers suggested that scott was a common blackmailer who needed psychiatric help declaring that byers was a pontificating old sod scott fled room enquiry then questioned police officers about letters which scott had shown to police in 1962 but were told that these were inconclusive chester et al pp 137 38 thorpe persuaded home secretary reginald and metropolitan police commissioner john waldron to inform byers that there was no police interest in thorpe s activities and no evidence of wrongdoing on his part freeman and penrose pp 176 77 as a result enquiry dismissed scott s allegations further threats angry at his treatment by byers inquiry scott sought other means of pursuing his vendetta against thorpe in june 1971 he met gordon winter a south african journalist who was also an agent for south african intelligence agency boss scott provided details of his supposed seduction by thorpe a story which winter assured his boss masters would destroy thorpe and liberal party he found that no newspaper would print story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence freeman and penrose pp 178 82 in march 1972 scott s friend gwen parry jones died scott used inquest to denounce thorpe for ruining his life and driving parry jones to her death none of these accusations was published chester et al pp 154 and 158 depressed scott retreated into a state of torpor assisted by tranquilisers and for a while presented no threat to thorpe chester et al p 160 in 1972 and 1973 thorpe s political fortunes and those of liberals revived thorpe s personal standing was enhanced when on 14 march 1973 he married marion countess of harewood whose former husband was a first cousin to queen after a series of by election victories and local government gains an electoral breakthrough for party looked plausible when heath called a general election in february 1974 in that election with more than six million votes 19 3 of those cast liberals achieved by far their best election result since second world war freeman and penrose p 195 but under first past post voting system this large vote translated into only 14 seats however as neither major party won an overall majority these seats gave thorpe whose personal majority in north devon increased to 11 072 significant leverage he was briefly in coalition discussions with heath who was prepared to give cabinet posts to thorpe and other senior liberals thorpe later denied that there was any serious prospect of agreement trewin ed p 93 and in march 1974 harold wilson formed a minority labour government in second 1974 general election in october wilson achieved a narrow majority liberals lost ground with 5 3 million votes and 13 mps after parry jones s death scott lived quietly for a while in west country freeman and penrose pp 183 and 200 in january 1974 he met tim keigwin thorpe s conservative opponent in north devon and gave his version of his relationship with thorpe keigwin was advised by conservative leadership that material should not be used chester et al pp 186 87 scott also confided in his doctor ronald gleadle who was treating him for depression he had shown gleadle his dossier of documents doctor without scott s knowledge or consent sold papers to holmes who had assumed role of thorpe s protector after bessell settled permanently in california in january 1974 holmes paid ps2 500 for documents which were promptly burned in home of thorpe s solicitor freeman and penrose pp 200 01 a further cache of papers was discovered in november 1974 by builders renovating a london office formerly used by bessell they found a briefcase containing letters and photographs that apparently compromised thorpe among them scott s 1965 letter to ursula thorpe undecided what to do with their find they took it to sunday mirror newspaper sidney jacobson paper s deputy chairman decided not to publish material and passed briefcase and its content to thorpe parris p 216 copies of documents were however kept in newspaper s files freeman and penrose p 211 alleged conspiracy in their analysis of case journalists simon freeman and barry penrose state that thorpe probably formed outline of a plan to silence scott early in 1974 after latter s re emergence became a matter of increasing concern freeman and penrose pp 206 08 holmes later said that thorpe was insistent that scott be killed jeremy felt he would never be safe with that man around freeman and penrose p 208 quoted from holmes s article in news of world 31 may 1981 uncertain how to proceed late in 1974 holmes approached a business acquaintance a carpet salesman named john le mesurier not to be confused with actor of that name le mesurier introduced holmes to george deakin a fruit machine salesman who he thought would have contacts with people who might be prepared to deal with scott holmes and le mesurier concocted a story involving a blackmailer who needed to be frightened off deakin agreed to help chester et al pp 217 20 in february 1975 deakin met andrew newton an airline pilot who said he was willing to deal with scott for an appropriate fee between ps5 000 and ps10 000 was suggested parris p 217 deakin put newton in touch with holmes newton always said that he had been hired to kill not frighten citing size of fee that he was offered too much he said simply to scare someone freeman and penrose pp 214 16 while these arrangements proceeded thorpe wrote to sir jack hayward bahamas based millionaire businessman who had given generously to liberal party in past in wake of liberals february 1974 election successes thorpe asked for ps50 000 to replenish party s funds he further requested that ps10 000 of this sum be paid not into party s regular accounts but to nadir dinshaw an acquaintance of thorpe s who was resident in channel islands thorpe explained that this subterfuge was necessary to deal with a special category of unspecific election expenses hayward trusted thorpe and sent ps10 000 to dinshaw who instructed by thorpe passed money to holmes after october 1974 election thorpe again requested funds from hayward and again asked that ps10 000 be sent via dinshaw route hayward obliged though this time with more reluctance and after some delay no accounting of this ps20 000 was ever provided holmes le mesurier and deakin all said that it was used to finance a conspiracy to frighten although they disagreed as to how much was spent thorpe later changed story he had given hayward about special categories of election expenses and said he had deposited sum with accountants as an iron reserve against any shortage of funds at any subsequent election he denied that he had authorised any payment to newton or to anyone else connected with case parris pp 228 29 shooting thumb moorland road above porlock hill close to scene of shooting newton met holmes early in october 1975 when former claimed he was given a down payment on a fee of ps10 000 holmes later denied any such transaction admitting only an agreement that newton would carry out a frightening operation on 12 october newton calling himself peter keene drove to barnstaple in a yellow mazda car where he approached scott claiming to have been hired to protect scott from a supposed canadian hit man chester et al p 215 this seemed plausible to scott who had been beaten up a few weeks earlier chester et al p 210 and he agreed to meet keene at a later date he was sufficiently cautious to ask a friend to make a note of stranger s car registration number preston p 198 on 24 october newton now driving a ford saloon met scott by arrangement in combe martin just north of barnstaple newton explained that he had to drive to porlock about 25 miles away and suggested that scott accompany him he and scott could talk on journey scott had with him his recently acquired pet dog a great dane called rinka this disconcerted newton who was afraid of dogs but scott insisted that rinka go with them at porlock newton left scott and rinka at a hotel while he supposedly dealt with his business he picked them up shortly after 8 pm and they began drive back to combe martin freeman and penrose pp 216 17 on a deserted stretch of road newton began to drive erratically feigning tiredness and accepted scott s suggestion that he take over driving they stopped scott got out followed by rinka and ran round to driver s side where he found newton gun in hand newton shot dog in head and saying it s your turn now pointed gun at scott pistol failed to fire several times eventually newton jumped into car and drove away leaving scott and dead or dying dog by roadside chester et al pp 226 pp 202 04 after scott had been picked up in a distressed state by a passing car police were notified and began enquiries newton was quickly identified through mazda s registration number and arrested his story was that scott was blackmailing him and that shooting had been intended to frighten him preston pp 207 08 he made no mention of any deal with holmes perhaps calculating that by keeping silent he would maximise his chances of payment from that quarter freeman and penrose pp 222 23 revelations on 12 december 1975 private eye included another short teasing piece by auberon waugh which ended my only hope is that sorrow over his friend s dog will not cause mr thorpe s premature retirement from public life waugh pp 22 23 quoting from private eye 12 december 1975 by this time most newspapers knew of stories surrounding thorpe and scott but were wary of libel according to parris by keeping silent they were serving notice on thorpe that they knew a bigger story must break and could wait for it in january 1976 scott appeared before magistrates on a minor social security fraud charge and stated that he was being hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with thorpe this claim made in court and therefore protected from libel laws was widely reported freeman and penrose pp 229 30 daily mail had meanwhile discovered bessell s whereabouts in california and on 3 february 1976 carried a long interview with former mp bessell s claim that he had been blackmailed by scott provided thorpe with temporary cover freeman and penrose p 233 on 6 march newspapers reported holmes s purchase of scott s dossier from gleadle and a few days later david steel discovered from dinshaw a personal friend that ps20 000 intended for party had been diverted to holmes and was unaccounted for steel told thorpe that he should resign but he refused parris pp 218 and penrose pp 235 36 in an attempt to reassure his wavering parliamentary colleagues on 14 march thorpe made arrangements with sunday times newspaper to publish a detailed rebuttal of scott s charges under heading lies of norman scott chester et al p 259 newton s trial took place at exeter crown court from 16 to 19 march 1976 where scott repeated his allegations against thorpe despite efforts of prosecution s lawyers to steer him away newton was found guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and sentenced to two years imprisonment but he did not incriminate thorpe chester et al pp 261 64 thorpe s difficulties increased when bessell fearing for his own position and perhaps scenting possibility of making money changed his stance and confessed in daily mail on 6 may that he had lied to protect his former friend a further concern for thorpe was danger that newspapers would publish letters he had sent to scott early in their friendship in an effort to forestall this thorpe arranged for publication of two of letters in sunday times a paper generally sympathetic towards him in one of these letters thorpe referred to scott by pet name bunnies tone of this letter convinced readers and commentators that thorpe had not been frank about nature of relationship on 10 may 1976 he resigned as liberal leader amid rising criticism again categorically denying scott s allegations but acknowledging damage that they were inflicting on party freeman and penrose pp 238 41 after thorpe s resignation relative lack of press attention to story for 18 months disguised extent to which investigative reporting continued barry penrose and roger courtiour collectively known as pencourt had originally been hired by wilson after his retirement to investigate former prime minister s theory that thorpe was a target of south african intelligence agencies chester et al pp 272 77 pencourt s investigations led them to bessell who gave them his account of a conspiracy to murder scott and thorpe s role in it freeman and penrose pp 262 66 before they could publish they were scooped newton released from prison in october 1977 sold his story to london evening news he said that he had been paid ps5 000 to kill scott and provided photographs of him receiving payment from le mesurier freeman and penrose pp 286 p 220 a lengthy police inquiry followed at end of which thorpe holmes le mesurier and deakin were charged with conspiracy to murder thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder on basis of his 1969 meetings with bessell and holmes after being released on bail thorpe declared i am totally innocent of this charge and will vigorously challenge it freeman and penrose p 324 on 2 august 1978 thorpe participated in a house of commons debate about future of rhodesia but thereafter played no further active part in parliament although he remained north devon s member at liberals 1978 annual assembly in southport he embarrassed leadership by making a theatrical entrance and taking his place on platform freeman and penrose pp 333 34 committal and trial prosecution set out its case at pre trial committal hearing which began in minehead on 20 november 1978 at request of deakin s counsel reporting restrictions were lifted which meant that newspapers were free to print anything said in court without fear of libel laws chippindale and leigh pp 13 17 this move infuriated thorpe who had hoped for an in camera hearing which would avoid unfortunate newspaper headlines and perhaps lead to dismissal of case whatever outcome thorpe knew that adverse publicity would destroy his career and that scott would thus have his revenge freeman and penrose p 340 as hearings began bessell described 1969 meetings where he alleged that thorpe had suggested that holmes should kill scott including comment about shooting of a sick dog chippindale and leigh pp 30 33 court learned that bessell had a contract with sunday telegraph which was paying him ps50 000 for his story chippindale and leigh p 58 dinshaw gave evidence of ps20 000 he had received from hayward and passed to holmes and of subsequent attempts by thorpe to obscure details of these transactions chippindale and leigh pp 80 83 newton testified that holmes had wanted scott killed he would prefer it if scott vanished from face of earth and was never seen again it was left to me how to do it chippindale and leigh p 86 scott gave clinical details of his alleged seduction by thorpe at thorpe s mother s house in november 1961 and on other occasions and also recounted his ordeal on moors above porlock hill chippindale and leigh pp 104 06 and 112 15 scott contended that homosexuality was an incurable disease with which thorpe had infected him and that thorpe therefore should be held responsible for scott s lifelong care at end of hearing presiding magistrate committed four defendants for trial at central criminal court commonly known as old bailey chippindale and leigh p 189 in march 1979 labour government fell on a vote of no confidence and a general election was called for 3 may this led to a brief delay in start of trial as thorpe who still had a following among north devon liberals was adopted as their candidate in election largely isolated from his party s national campaign he lost seat to conservative antony speller by over 8 000 votes freeman and penrose pp 345 46 trial began on 8 may under sir joseph cantley a relatively obscure high court judge with limited experience of high profile cases freeman and penrose pp 350 51 to conduct his defence thorpe engaged george carman who had established a criminal law practice on northern circuit in manchester this was his first high profile national case parris p 230 carman undermined bessell s credibility by revealing his financial interest in thorpe s conviction his newspaper contract provided that in event of acquittal only half ps50 000 would be paid waugh pp 85 86 judge left no doubt as to his own low opinion of bessell s character waugh pp 65 66 auberon waugh who was writing a book on trial thought that cantley s general attitude to other prosecution witnesses became increasingly one sided waugh p 142 on 7 june deakin testified that although he had put newton in touch with holmes he had thought that this was to help someone to deal with a blackmailer he knew nothing of a conspiracy to kill waugh pp 179 81 deakin was only defendant to testify others all chose to remain silent and call no witnesses believing that based on testimonies of bessell scott and newton prosecution had failed to make its case freeman and penrose p 357 during his closing speech on behalf of thorpe carman raised possibility that holmes and others might have organised a conspiracy without thorpe s knowledge waugh p 210 on 18 june judge began his summing up he drew jury s attention to previous good character of defendants whom he characterised as men of hitherto unblemished reputation waugh p 217 cantley described thorpe as a national figure with a very distinguished public record judge was scathing about principal witnesses bessell was a humbug whose contract with sunday telegraph was deplorable waugh pp 220 21 scott was a fraud a sponger a whiner a parasite but of course he could still be telling truth it is a question of belief waugh pp 223 25 newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump determined to milk case as hard as he can waugh pp 225 27 mystery surrounding ps20 000 that thorpe had obtained from hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not prove that man was a member of a conspiracy waugh p 233 waugh felt that judge s lack of even handedness could well provoke a counteraction against accused from jury summing up became subject of a scathing parody by satirist peter cook cook ed pp 268 and 275 76 acquittal and aftermath jury retired during morning of 20 june they returned just over two days later and acquitted all four defendants on all charges judge awarded costs to deakin but not to holmes or le mesurier who he thought had been insufficiently co operative in enquiry thorpe made no application for costs waugh pp 236 37 in a brief public statement he said that he considered verdict as totally fair just and a complete vindication waugh p 238 david steel on behalf of liberal party welcomed verdict as a great relief and hoped that thorpe would after a suitable period of rest and recuperation find many avenues where his great talents may be used in north devon thorpe s acquittal was celebrated with a thanksgiving service at which presiding vicar rev john hornby gave thanks to god for ministry of his servant jeremy darkness is now past and true light shines this is day lord hath made now is day of our salvation preston pp 310 11 despite acquittal broader public perception was strong that thorpe had not behaved well nor had he adequately explained himself parris p et al p 369 ronald archdeacon of barnstaple who was critical of hornby s melodramatic thanksgiving service wrote there is a great deal of unhappiness about result at old bailey as far as most people are concerned trial ended with a big question mark over case freeman and penrose p 367 prevented by his party from a return to active politics freeman and penrose p 369 in 1982 thorpe was appointed by amnesty international as director of its british section but after protests from organisation s staff he withdrew not long afterwards thorpe first showed signs of parkinson s disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in mid 1980s there was a political reconciliation when in 1988 following merger of liberals and social democratic party newly formed north devon liberal democrat association made him their honorary president when he attended liberal democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation in 1999 thorpe published his political memoir in my own time in which he justified his silence at trial and stated that he had never doubted outcome thorpe pp 202 03 nine years later in january 2008 thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years to guardian referring to affair he said if it happened now i think public would be kinder back then they were very troubled by it it offended their set of values thorpe died on 4 december 2014 bloch p 555 after trial le mesurier kept a low profile after unsuccessful attempts to sell real story to national newspapers freeman and penrose pp 385 86 in june 1981 in a series of articles printed in news of world holmes reasserted his allegation that thorpe had asked him to kill scott incitement charge which jeremy faced was true and if i had gone into witness box i d have had to tell truth freeman and penrose pp 379 80 holmes who died in 1990 had previously admitted his participation in a conspiracy to frighten scott though not to kill him waugh p 200 bessell s account of affair was published in america in 1980 he died in 1985 his final years were devoted to a campaign to stop erosion of san diego beaches in california newton like le mesurier attempted to cash in on case but failed to find a newspaper willing to print his story freeman and penrose pp 383 84 scott s comments on affair immediately after trial verdict were that he was unsurprised by outcome but was upset by aspersions on his character made by judge from safety of bench in december 2014 scott then aged 74 was reported to have recently relocated from devon to ireland although john preston in his 2016 account places him in a village on dartmoor with seventy hens three horses a cat a parrot a canary and five dogs preston p 320 in a bbc investigative documentary broadcast in december 2014 an antique firearms collector named dennis meighan claimed that he had been hired by an unidentified senior liberal to kill scott for a fee of ps13 500 having initially agreed meighan says he changed his mind but provided newton with gun used in shooting after confessing to police he was asked to sign a prepared statement which according to him left everything out that was incriminating but at same time everything i said about liberal party jeremy thorpe et cetera was left out as well bbc s tom mangold said that meighan s account if true indicated existence of a conspiracy at very highest level in 2016 avon and somerset police passed their files to gwent police for an independent review of original investigation after police came to conclusion that andrew newton had died crown prosecution service closed case in 2018 gwent police reported that they had now revisited these enquiries and have identified information which indicates that newton may still be alive therefore re opening lines of inquiry on 4 june 2018 force announced that they had interviewed newton who had been living under a new name hann in dorking surrey but that he had given no new useful information and so case would remain closed in popular media at 1979 secret policeman s ball in aid of amnesty international biased summing up speech by mr justice
