incorporated character comedy rather than topical humor on show to emphasize things that are more about humorous situations and about characters and their flaws he designed patrick and spongebob as such because they re whipping themselves up into situations that s always where humor comes from rule is follow innocence and avoid topical humor in spite of being depicted as having a good temperament or state of mind patrick has been shown in some episodes to have a tantrum patrick s emotional outbreak was originally written only for first season episode valentine s day where spongebob and sandy try to give patrick a valentine s day gift and was supposed to be a one time thing however according to episode writer jay lender when that show came back it felt so right that his dark side started popping up everywhere you can plan ahead all you want but characters eventually tell you who they are every main character in show has its own unique footstep sound sound of patrick s

whatsoever he described his experience in audition saying i was just going in for another audition and i had no idea what was in store there in terms of remarkable visual wit and really kind of endearing child like humanity in show i couldn t pick that up from audition material at all i was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give guy what he wanted fagerbakke referred to patrick as a reference to his role as michael dauber on 1990s sitcom coach in first few years of working on show patrick is enormously entertaining to portray because according to fagerbakke when i m performing patrick there are many secrets that i could never divulge fagerbakke s approach in voicing patrick is much same way i would do to any kind of character i m always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children to be able to plug in to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas i have so much fun with that i love kids i raised two girls and i love being a parent he said cast members record as a whole cast fagerbakke says that situation improves his performance as a voice actor because there is something remarkable that happens
