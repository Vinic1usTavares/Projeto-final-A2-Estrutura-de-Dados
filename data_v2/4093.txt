story season one is seen through eyes of akane tsunemori a rookie inspector within unit one of ministry of welfare public safety bureau s criminal investigation department shinya kogami is an enforcer under her watch during her first mission when tsunemori judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal s life she uses her dominator to prevent him from decomposing criminal ashamed of her action kogami thanks her for intervening in what could be perceived as murder an opinion which influences tsunemori to stay on force she is accompanied by veteran inspector nobuchika ginoza a strict man who looks down on enforcers tomomi masaoka a middle aged enforcer who used to be a detective shusei kagari a carefree young man who was marked as a latent criminal in childhood and yayoi kunizuka a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a relationship with a terrorist over course of tsunemori s early investigations group uncovers crimes of shogo makishima a prolific criminal mastermind makishima is a person persistently assessed by sibyl system as having a low crime coefficient despite all actions and attitudes thus protecting him from dominator harm enforcers and inspectors start hunting makishima but it is kogami who is most invested having lost a friend at hands of villain makishima is an intelligent and creative individual yet one who aims to destroy society created by sibyl system by causing societal disruption and performing acts of a criminal nature in one instance he initiates riots to draw police away from health and welfare ministry s nona tower facility where sibyl is located tsunemori and kogami stop makishima s forces while kagari follows one of makishima s allies to tower where bureau chief kasei kills makishima s ally and kagari to keep true form of sibyl a secret kasei tells makishima that sibyl is a hive mind of similarly asymptomatic individuals and invites him to join but makishima chooses to flee realizing this kogami leaves group to find and to kill him tsunemori is contacted by sibyl system which orders her to capture makishima alive she agrees to do so on condition that they withdraw execution order for kogami learning that makishima plans to commit bioterrorism to weaken japan s economy and bring system down criminal investigation division searches for both makishima and kogami upon finding him makishima tries killing ginoza but masaoka sacrifices his life to save him and despite tsunemori s efforts kogami kills makishima then escapes from psb confinement with whereabouts unknown in season two

new threat in form of kirito kamui another criminal mastermind who like makishima intends to bring down sibyl system but unlike makishima wants to do so by exploiting its flaws instead of wreaking havoc skilled in avoiding all forms of detection and capable of helping his supporters keep their crime coefficients low few believe that he actually exists including tsunemori season three occurs after events of psycho pass movie wherein tsunemori and her team help people of float uncover government corruption with unlikely assistance of kogami whom tsunemori locates while he is a member of a guerilla group he believes is working to bring freedom to people of that country mission results in disbandment of unit one aka division one and kogami s disappearance yet again plot of season three arises from an unrevealed situation that leads to tsunemori s arrest for putting public in danger unfolding story and truth tsunemori seeks involves two new investigators shindo and kei mikhail ignatov their first case with public safety bureau involves investigating crash landing of a passenger drone airplane that results in death of a passenger and discovery of a large group of immigrants during investigation and those that follow shindo and ignatov uncover evidence of a conspiracy headed by a shadowy organization called bifrost that uses mechanism of a tournament game called roundrobin in order to manipulate societal events as evidence and knowledge about bifrost increases focus of story narrows until shindo and ignatov find themselves at odds with one another instead of trusting one another this leads to a dangerous choice by ignatov one to be further explored in 2020 sequel film production left thumb director naoyoshi shiotani series was directed by naoyoshi shiotani written by gen urobuchi and features character designs by reborn manga artist akira amano it stars tomokazu seki as shinya kogami kana hanazawa as akane tsunemori and takahiro sakurai as shogo makishima psycho pass originated from production i g s interest in making a successor to mamoru oshii s ghost in shell and patlabor company hired katsuyuki became series chief veteran i g animator naoyoshi shiotani to supervise direction motohiro wanted to return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer motohiro and his staff were surprised with gen urobuchi s contribution to highly acclaimed anime series magi madoka magica motohiro was fascinated by madoka magica he read other works from urobuchi which persuaded him to talk to urobuchi in early 2011 motohiro proposed to urobuchi that pair should work together early in making of series motohiro told naoyoshi shiotani not to make anything that could not be adapted into a live action film before work on psycho pass started shiotani was busy working on film blood c last dark as soon as his work with film ended shiotani focused on series quality after episode 16 which proved to be most challenging and popular of series team found themselves out of stamina next two episodes were made by an outside team which is reflected in several problems with animation in response to this producer of episode said that while he expected problems he worked to make it best he could shiotani also apologized for episode s quality original team continued working from episode 19 on until finale they decided to remake episodes 17 and 18 for their retail release thumb ubukata was main writer in both second and third series of psycho pass anime series was first announced in late march 2012 by fuji tv at its noitamina press conference in march 2013 shiotani stated there could be a second season if show received enough support once development of second season started shiotani said new episodes are more difficult to make than those in first season he said it s more about show s inflexibility because staff have to maintain consistency for second season tow ubukata replaced urobuchi as main writer ubukata mentions he was given idea of expanding setting in form of a sequel as a result of being given scenario of tv series and film ubukata had to write characters personalities although time of production was short he had time to discuss with first series staff shiotani aided team for final episode which ubukata was satisfied with much attention was given in bigger central tsunemori was given as former lead character from first series kogami was not present additionally new character who works as an inspector mika shimotsuki was given traits to act as a newcomer similar to tsunemori but different in a way shiotani could not explain during development as a result of series still premiering during final episodes of first series shiotani conceived idea of a psycho pass film urobuchi and motohiro said film would have to contain a scenario independent of japan s sibyl system society shiotani wanted to create film in collaboration with staff who had worked on season one of series and with character designer naoyuki onda and art director shuichi who also worked on series urobuchi believed ideal sequel would be a film rather than a television series but wanted to stay true to roots of original series film s setting was intended to show how a future dystopia would occur outside japan without sibyl system to make story more realistic shiotani decided to have foreigners speak english in contrast with other films in which they instead speak japanese both lead actors tomokazu seki kogami and kana hanazawa akane were surprised at this proposal because they had multiple english lines shiotani wished to explore what happens when a confined society expands into other countries bringing chaos rather than peace which would make audience further question this ideal shiotani chose southeast asia thinking a country working hard to further its development would be fitting for story films sinners of system were first announced in japan by fuji tv in march 2018 shiotani returned as films director novelist ryo yoshigami wrote first film s script while second one was written by makoto fukami in regards to first film shiotani picked nobuchika ginoza and mika shimotsuki as main characters due to their similarities to protagonists from first television series shinya kogami and akane tsunemori respectively nevertheless he noted these duo employed a different dynamic from kogami and akane while noting how ginoza has undergone a notable character arc across previous projects related to psycho pass mainly due to his relationship with masaoka and kogami voice actress ayane sakura believed shimotsuki was now more fitting for role of a heroine thanks to her experience in second television series where she was youngest main character once first movie premiered shiotani commented trilogy would broaden your perspective audience s they re those kinds of movies for 2019 anime series shiotani entrusted writer ubukata fukami and yoshigami with handling a new cast fukami and wrote script while ubukata was in charge of composition fukami was surprised with ongoing dynamic between shiotani and ubukata as despite new story share mostly a new cast series still felt like psycho pass he clarified every episode of new series handled a different theme based on ubukata s writing there were a few characters not included in original series composition that were added later on writers had to alter event in second half of series which they found challenging in making of new leads arata shindo and kei mikhail ignatov two were handled as two good buddies while making notable differences between each other ubukata then conceived idea of psychology vs combat making shindo a mentalist while ignatov would a stand out as a former military soldier special attention was given to shindo s characterization as he depending on how he was written he could come across as an unlikable character based on how he leads conversations while also noting he was still caring ubukata wanted two main characters to be written solely by fukami design when hearing comments from atsuko ishizuka director of pet girl of about way characters were designed first shiotani realized it was opposite for his team who had to create setting first and then characters because they are almost being played by world as a result characters were designed by manga artist akira amano to balance them with dark atmosphere by having them palatable and very relate able staff avoided using bright colors that would stand out akane tsunemori was created as most relatable character who would question setting from audience s point of view and as heroine who would come between main character shinya kogami and his main rival and enemy shogo makishima akane s progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of staff s main objectives motohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements even though they could reduce female viewership he acknowledges that series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality he added that team did not want to make a violent series but an artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it about amount of violence shiotani told urobuchi just let us deal with it some of these violent scenes occur off camera but whenever a protagonist was involved moment was developed to be memorable team twice had to remake scenes because television station complained that they went overboard motohiro wanted series to counter concurrent anime trends use of moe slang was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like mobile suit gundam and patlabor that focus on conflicts between male characters as series was anti moe team decided to avoid having female lead character akane remove her clothes and instead had kogami do it nevertheless show attracted a female viewership because conflict between male characters appeared to attract shonen ai genre fans although shiotani also wanted series to avoid romance between male characters he believed fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships influences series was inspired by several western films most notably l a confidential director naoyoshi shiotani cited several other influences including minority report gattaca brazil and blade runner latter of which he compared very closely to psycho pass before making of series urobuchi insisted on using a philip k dick inspired dystopian narrative psychological themes were based on time shiotani watched lupin iii during his childhood because he thought about adding today s youth trauma to series rivalry between main characters was based on several dramas staff liked other voice actors have been credited in making of series because of ways they added traits to characters since third series was handled by new writers fukami and yoshigami new members used ideas from their superiors when writing script such as ubukata s novels scramble and spiegel music staff had problems composing an opening theme for series until someone provided some music by ling tosite sigure who was engaged to compose opening theme egoist who composed ending theme had debuted on noitamina with guilty crown shiotani said they asked egoist to record three versions of ending theme so they could alternate them to match episode s ending across series time limits resulted in ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from episode when there were concerns from producers of songs tomohiro and shiotani discussed this with them following first series yugo kanno made remixes of original background themes as staff found them enjoyable and might come across as appealing in process two psycho pass cds were included in second and fifth japanese home media release of series psycho pass original soundtrack was released by sony music entertainment on may 29 2013 it features fifty five tracks composed by kanno second original soundtrack was released on march 18 2015 a two volume drama cd called based on prequel novel was released between september 25 and november 27 2013 themes as some critics have noted psycho pass explores societal and psychological themes such as price of living without stress and without fear of crime indeed sibyl system targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others but this raises question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed for example in first episode a woman is kidnapped and resultant trauma causes her psycho pass to become clouded according to sibyl s instructions police are therefore prepared to kill her but akane steps in refusing to accept sibyl s verdict and manages to bring woman s psycho pass level back to acceptable range by speaking gently to her consequently this challenges notion that potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing crime according to anime news network we are all capable of doing bad things at we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it or because we were victims it really all comes back to that first episode and akane s reaction to victim who presented as a violent criminal psycho pass further suggests that price of living without stress includes overriding individual s needs in favor of general social value it is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes so long as we accept that harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged in other words sibyl system operates on principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk but relying on sibyl system paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole but individuals who personally fear consequences of sibyl system s verdicts as such urobuchi himself has said that one of series central thematic ideas is fear as seen through shogo makishima s feeling of being out of place because sibyl system cannot recognize him for what he actually is he feels displaced and deviant within structure of society itself emotional repression is also explored in psycho pass identification of latent criminals is partially based around avoidance of emotions that society judges to be negative such as sadness or anger to avoid being identified as a latent criminal one must not feel these emotions heavily outside where their psycho pass can be scanned kotaku states because of these scans psycho pass shows an interesting future where mental beauty is as sought after as physical beauty it is also a future where police s job is little more than to watch latent criminals they control because if they did any real detective work they might start to think like criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves many of main characters feel nostalgia throughout series many references to older literature philosophy music and theatre create a nostalgic world building for a time before psycho passes media anime anime series produced by production i g
