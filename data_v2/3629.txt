eustathios argyros died ca 910 was a byzantine aristocrat and one of most prominent generals under emperor leo vi wise r 886 912 first member of argyros family to rise to high posts he fought with distinction against arabs in east before being disgraced ca 907 possibly in connection with flight of andronikos doukas to arabs rehabilitated soon after he was appointed as strategos of charsianon from which post he oversaw settlement of armenian lords as march wardens along empire s eastern frontier promoted to commander of imperial bodyguard in late 908 he again fell into disgrace shortly after and died of poison apparently a suicide on his way to his estates life eustathios argyros was son of tourmarches leo argyros founder of noble argyros family nothing is known of his life or prior to turn of 10th century although he may have been in imperial service as early as 866 when a man of same name is recorded as protostrator of caesar bardas in connection with latter s murder on 21 april byzantine historians praise eustathios argyros as an intelligent valiant prudent and just man and account him along with andronikos doukas as best of leo vi s generals historians jean claude cheynet and jean francois vannier experts on byzantine prosopography consider him true founder of family s glory thumb 250px map of arab byzantine frontier zone although he is sometimes identified with an admiral active in ca 902 904 see below his life is only securely attested after 904 at this time evidently after a succession of unknown military commands eustathios had reached according to theophanes continuatus rank of patrikios and hypostrategos of anatolic theme significance of term hypostrategos has been debated normally it would designate second in command to strategos or military governor of a theme but vannier suggested that on account of his high title of patrikios argyros was actually strategos theophanes continuatus further extols argyros and mentions that he scored several successes against arabs in east most likely a reference to great byzantine victory over arabs of tarsus and mopsuestia at germanikeia in december 904 under overall command of andronikos doukas he then fell into disgrace and was exiled although no details or reasons are offered for his exile this has been interpreted by modern scholars as being connected to failed rebellion and flight of andronikos doukas to arabs in 906 907 eustathios was rehabilitated soon after if indeed his disgrace was related to flight of andronikos doukas this happened likely in 907 8 when andronikos doukas son constantine escaped from his arab exile and returned to constantinople where he was pardoned by emperor leo eustathios was then appointed as strategos of border theme of charsianon a position notably inferior in rank to that of anatolics that he had held previously argyros family however had strong connections with charsianon from which it hailed there he received return to imperial service of a number of armenian lords melias three brothers and and ismael who were established as march wardens along empire s eastern border of them melias in particular would go on to become founder of theme of and one of main byzantine leaders in wars against arabs over next 30 years in late 908 eustathios argyros was promoted to rank of magistros highest court dignity open to someone not a member of imperial family and post of drungary of watch i e commander of imperial bodyguard and replaced as strategos of charsianon by constantine doukas about a year later he fell again under leo s suspicion and was ordered to return to his family s estates at charsianon again reason is unknown perhaps according to cheynet and vannier it was a result of unreliability of armenian lords he had welcomed into empire who frequently went over to arabs on way he died after taking poison by one of his servants and was buried on summit of mount aran while historian romilly james heald jenkins has suggested that argyros poisoning was done through an agent of powerful and scheming court eunuch samonas it more likely was suicide his two sons pothos and leo who served in palace as manglabites personal bodyguards of emperor arranged to have their father s body transferred for burial to monastery of saint elizabeth in charsianon district founded by eustathios father family eustathios sons pothos and leo would go on to hold senior military commands including post of domestic of schools commander in chief another son romanos is known only from his participation in battle of achelous in 917 leo argyros married a daughter of emperor romanos i lekapenos r 920 944 and was probably grandfather or great grandfather of emperor romanos iii argyros r 1028 1034 identity some modern scholars like r j h jenkins flight of samonas r h dolley lord high admiral eustathios argyros and betrayal of taormina to african arabs in 902 and ekkehard und zwischen islam und consider eustathios argyros to have been identical with contemporary admiral eustathios active in years before 904 mainly due to reference by 11th century historian john skylitzes that argyros pursued a career in army as well as in fleet this identification is rejected by other scholars like j f vannier familles byzantines les siecles and r guilland recherches sur les institutions byzantines furthermore admiral is given surname argyros in some modern works that distinguish him from general while others reject surname entirely according to der zeit a definitive decision can no longer be made and main argument for two being different persons is incompatibility of their careers admiral eustathios likewise experienced a tumultuous career with accusations of treason rehabilitation and renewed disgrace and it is unlikely that such a man would again be entrusted with senior posts references sources category 9th century births category 910 deaths category 10th century byzantine people category byzantine generals
