blockade danish navy had imposed during second schleswig war and french navy had put into place during franco prussian conflict stosch s fleet plan finalized in 1873 called for a total of eight ocean going ironclads and six smaller armored corvettes ocean going component had been completed with and of six corvettes five had been built and four s last corvette was originally intended to be a fifth sachsen type vessel but dissatisfaction with design led many senior officers to push for a revised version new design was prepared between 1879 and 1881 but budgetary constraints imposed in aftermath of accidental sinking of ironclad limited ability of design staff to produce an effective improvement on sachsens on available budget new ship s displacement would have to be reduced by some compared to sachsens limited displacement forced a reversion to casemate ship arrangement as well as a reduction in caliber of guns from to to somewhat offset reduction in offensive power these guns were of a new longer 30 caliber type that had a higher muzzle velocity than shorter 22 caliber guns carried by sachsen class assessment of design is mixed ship was an anachronism being last casemate ship to be laid down by any navy though ottoman ironclad was completed later naval historian erich groner states that oldenburg was an experimental design of no real value in combat conway s all world s fighting ships concurs stating that oldenburg was considered to be of little fighting value by time she was completed historian aidan dodson criticized ship as being a poor investment that failed to make her designed speed by and had a form that lead to a rapid drop off of speed in head seas 1889 edition of brassey s naval annual reported a contradictory opinion however stating that majority of german
