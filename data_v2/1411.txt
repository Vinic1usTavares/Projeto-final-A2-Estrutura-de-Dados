training immediately after graduation he graduated 18th out of 456 in class of 1926 and received an award for having highest standing in engineering and aeronautics he was commissioned as an ensign on

1940 and commander on 15 august 1942 there he conducted research into design of propellers and drive shafts he examined a problem with skegs on keels of and south dakota class battleships with harmonic vibrations which was resolved with re designed propellers similar problems with singing propellers affected s in january 1943 he took over propeller desk at bureau of ships with rank of captain from 1 august 1943 propeller design was a critical part of all ships and special propellers were designed and tested for pt boats and submarines in early 1944 he visited britain to look at

of four naval officers assigned to alsos mission others being jacob pieter den hartog wendell roop and henry a naval section of alsos would investigate german naval technologies but main objective of alsos mission was to learn all it could about german nuclear energy project all members of mission had ultra secret security clearances but none had been involved with development of atomic bomb naval section of alsos flew into paris soon after it had been liberated in august 1944 they went down to bordeaux to inspect captured german destroyer z39 after alsos mission became convinced that germans had not developed an atomic bomb naval section became naval technical mission europe they were particularly interested in work of dr hellmuth walter in development of submarines and rockets most of targets that they were interested in lay in british sector so they worked closely with their english allies in last days of war naval technical mission was part of a 75 man task force most of whom were from 30 assault unit that made a dash for kiel entering city far in advance of allied advance whole garrison of city some 150 000 men surrendered to task force they drove to admiral karl donitz s

so men like walter could freely discuss their work with allies from april to december 1945 mumma also served as assistant naval attache post war mumma arrived back in united states in december 1945

groves and brigadier general kenneth nichols commander of manhattan district who were willing to help but would not offer any fissionable material navy decided to proceed with design of a nuclear powered ship they visited oak ridge and attended lectures of nuclear physics from george gamow and lawrence r mumma selected four outstanding young officers and a physicist everett blizzard to go to oak ridge and learn about reactor design mills decided that a senior officer should be sent as well and added hyman rickover to group something that mumma warned mills that he would regret in 1949
