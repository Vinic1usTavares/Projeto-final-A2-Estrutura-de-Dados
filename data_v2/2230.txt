american game magazine nintendo power did however find it innovative for instance they cited automatic battle option cleveland disliked monster conversation system which he found irritating he said that players never know what answer they should give a monster and that questions monsters ask feel monotone due to how often they are repeated writers for japanese game magazine famitsu thought monster fusion system was fun in their review of last bible iii they commented on how different game is from megami tensei series and instead compared it to final fantasy kurt kalata and christopher j snelgrove wrote for hardcore gaming 101 that while demon slayer was not by any means an outstanding game it was one of few competent role playing games on game boy they found last bible iii to be best game in series cleveland liked graphics in game boy color version of demon slayer and said that it reminded him of 8 bit wonders of years ago nintendo power said that graphics in game boy color version looked good but that they lack richness of most new games on system they disliked backgrounds which they called very bland famitsu thought graphics in last bible iii were good but that graphics in another bible looked cheap kalata and snelgrove called color palette in game boy color versions of first two games awful but said that sega game gear version of first game looked much better and that it was very nice for a handheld game they specifically pointed out its cinematic sequences which they called impressive they thought character designs in another bible were overly adorable and said that there are graphical issues in game when players move they appreciated backgrounds in last bible special and commented that some monster designs in last bible iii were strange nintendo power called music in demon slayer surprisingly good cleveland also liked it and said that it always fits in with all situations it is played in kalata and snelgrove called it catchy don at square enix music online said that demon slayer has a solid soundtrack for a game boy role playing game and specifically highlighted opening as a well composed piece with its exotic and mysterious atmosphere patrick gann at rpgfan said that demon slayer has fantastic and under appreciated music but that soundtrack is short don found soundtrack of last bible ii to be better than first game s and said that several pieces including temple field boss battle and dungeon were better than their counterparts in first game he said that gaia piece that is played during final boss battle probably was best of all pieces in first two games gann did also find last bible iis music to be better than first game s he liked that soundtrack was longer than first game s and how he could not find any melodies that had been borrowed from demon slayers soundtrack gann found last bible iiis sound font to be weak but liked several of compositions both don and gann thought that another bibles music was worse than music in previous games in series don did however appreciate several pieces including beginning moment which he thought was catchy and had a fantastic melody and hiding all feeling inside which he found to be most successful piece in game s soundtrack notes references category 1992 video games category atlus games category game boy games category game boy color games category mobile
