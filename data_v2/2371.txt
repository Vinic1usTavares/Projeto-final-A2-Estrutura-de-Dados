a high level of exercise and stimulation they are relatively free from any serious health complaints originating from dogs bred and used by reverend john russell in early 19th century from whom breed takes its name jack russell has similar origins to modern fox terrier it has gone through several changes over years corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs recognition by kennel clubs for jack russell breed has been opposed by breed s parent societies which resulted in breeding and recognition of parson russell terrier jack russells have appeared many times in film

term used for any terrier which was used to bolt foxes out of their burrows her colouring was described as white with just a patch of dark tan over each eye and ear whilst a similar dot not larger than a penny piece marks root of tail coile 2000 p 3 davies a friend of russell s wrote trump was such an animal as russell had only seen in his dreams she was basis for a breeding program to develop a terrier with high stamina for hunt as well as courage and formation to chase out foxes that had gone to ground by 1850s these dogs were recognised as a distinct breed an important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide necessary drive to pursue and bolt fox without resulting in physical harm to quarry and effectively ending chase which was considered unsporting burns 2006 p 12 russell was said to have prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood this line of terriers developed by john russell was well respected for those qualities and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts it is unlikely however that any dogs alive today can be proved to be descendants from trump as russell was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty and had only four aged and non breeding terriers left when he died in 1883 burns 2006 p 237 fox terrier and jack russell terrier type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period although documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found although several records remain of documented breeding by john russell between 1860s and 1880s fox terrier club was formed in 1875 with russell as one of founder members its breed standard was aspiration and not a description of how breed appeared then by start of 20th century fox terrier had altered more towards modern breed but in some parts of country old style of john russell s terriers remained and it is from those dogs that modern jack russell type has descended many breeds can claim heritage to

usually less than arthur blake heinemann created first breed standard and in 1894 he founded devon and somerset badger club aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting and breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose terriers were acquired from nicholas snow of oare and they were likely descended from russell s original dogs as russell would probably have hunted at some point with snow s hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original terriers by turn of 20th century russell s name had become associated with this breed of dog club was later renamed parson jack russell terrier club badger digging required a different type of dog than fox hunting and it is likely that bull terrier stock was introduced to strengthen breed which may have caused creation of a shorter legged variety of jack russell terrier that started to appear around this period at same time that a split was appearing between show and working fox terriers a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier both carrying jack russell s name heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs these classes were continued for several years by various judges but charles cruft dropped attempt as classes were never heavily competed following heinemann s death in 1930 kennel and leadership of club passed to annie harris but club itself folded shortly before world war ii post world war ii thumb
