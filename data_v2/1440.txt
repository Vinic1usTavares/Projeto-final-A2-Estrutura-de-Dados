alsace class was a group of two fast battleships planned by french navy in late 1930s in response to german plans to build two h class battleships after second london naval treaty collapsed alsace design was based on variants of and three proposals were submitted by design staff proposed armament included nine or twelve guns or nine guns but no choice was definitively made before program ended in mid 1940 according to one pair of historians logistical considerations including size of 12 gun variant and introduction of a new shell caliber for 406 mm version led naval command to settle on nine 380 mm design but another pair of authors disagree believing that difficulty of designing and manufacturing a three gun turret would have caused prohibitive delays during wartime making third largest variant most likely to have been built ships would have forced french government to make significant improvements to its harbor and shipyard facilities as smaller richelieus already stretched limitations of existing shipyards with construction of first member of class scheduled for 1941 plan was terminated by german victory in battle of france in may june 1940 background and development thumb left previous french battleship design france united kingdom and united states signed second london naval treaty in 1936 though japan and italy both refused to do so which effectively ended international naval arms control regime begun with washington naval treaty of 1922 treaty was to have reduced caliber of new battleships main batteries from to while retaining original displacement limit of but us navy insisted on an escalator clause that allowed a reversion to 406 mm guns if any signatory to original naval treaties refused to sign second london agreement after japan withdrew from conference on 15 january 1937 and refused to return united states invoked clause on 31 march a year later french american and british naval commands exchanged notes that resulted in a joint agreement on 30 june 1938 permitting construction of battleships with a displacement of up to french naval command initially intended to remain within original displacement limits since existing naval infrastructure prohibited vessels larger than and even for those 35 000 ton ships inventive measures had to be taken to build first two vessels work to improve french shipyards and harbor facilities would have significantly increased cost of building battleships up to treaty maximum command assumed that only japan and united state would be interested in building 45 000 ton ships and so announced that it would respect 35 000 ton limit so long as other european navies did same french plans were disrupted in mid 1939 when french military intelligence became aware that german kriegsmarine war navy had begun construction of two h class battleships in accordance with plan z these were ships though french intelligence initially believed them to be only vessels this development led vice amiral vice admiral francois darlan chief of staff of french navy to order design studies for new battleships that exceeded 35 000 ton limit darlan specified that armament was to be 406 mm or infrastructure concerns in late 1930s there were only three existing slipways capable of building large ships no 4 dock at brest and forme and no 1 docks in saint nazaire no 4 dock was only too short to build any vessel larger than richelieus which themselves had to be built without their bow or stern and completed after launching and no 1 dock in saint nazaire was already occupied with building aircraft carrier and was slated to begin construction of her sister after latter s projected launch in 1941 to build battleships to compete with german h class vessels french navy would need to embark on a major program to improve its infrastructure docks at arsenal de brest were to be significantly expanded a new longer dock that would be designated dock no 10 that was long and wide was to be excavated which would have been large enough to construct alsace class a new long graving dock was to be built and existing dock no 9 was to be lengthened from 250 m to dock no 10 was slated to be completed by 1942 at which point work on graving dock would begin as budgetary limitations and a shortage of skilled workers prevented both facilities from being built at same time at a later date dock no 10 was to be lengthened to 360 m as well in addition to shipbuilding facilities new battleships would necessitate improved repair and harbor facilities at various major naval bases port facilities had already been built or were in process of construction at cherbourg toulon casablanca bizerta and dakar though dry docks in those ports were not sufficient to handle even a richelieu in a damaged condition where flooding would increase draft of more than it was estimated that these docks would need to be dredged to at least to accommodate alsace design navy had to acquire other equipment including tugboats necessary to maneuver ships in port and floating cranes needed to fit out vessels but shortages in machinery slowed construction and owing to outbreak of world war ii in september 1939 france was unable to order vessels from neutral countries design proposals design work began in late 1939 three versions were prepared all of which were developments of project c type that was created during design process for clemenceau and gascogne variants of richelieu class unlike standard richelieu type that mounted all eight of their main battery guns in a pair of four gun turrets forward project c design adopted an arrangement with two three gun turrets forward and one triple turret aft design staff considered three standard displacements and first was same figure proposed for british s and that incorrectly assumed for german h class ships third was maximum under agreement reached with britain and united states and third was a compromise displacement figured to be minimum that could accommodate mandated top speed of at least along with a battery of 406 mm guns first proposal for alsace no 1 was essentially a slightly enlarged version of project c ship had a longer hull which required a increase in horsepower while incurring a loss of one knot in top speed no 2 was a scaled up version of no 1 with 380 mm guns replaced with 406 mm guns even larger hull necessitated a further increase in horsepower by to maintain same speed no 3 type was enlarged further to accommodate three quadruple 380 mm turrets though it managed to increase speed by a knot all of designs would have carried a light anti aircraft battery of and guns but numbers and arrangements of those guns had not been finalized before program came to an end 1 9 x 9 x 16 x no 29 x no 312 x 380 x 100 mm darlan and rest of naval command evaluated design proposals but choice was obvious from start according to historians john jordan and robert dumas no 2 armed with 406 mm guns would have introduced a fourth caliber to french battle line after 380 mm guns of richelieus guns of s and guns of older s additionally 406 mm gun had not yet been produced so necessary design work might have delayed completion of new ships no 3 type was simply too large for existing naval bases to easily accommodate this left no 1 as only realistic option for next battleship program historians william garzke and robert dulin disagree however pointing out that french navy had never built a three gun turret before building ships under wartime constraints and with need to produce ship as quickly as possible repeating four gun turrets of richelieus made most sense and they argue that no 3 design was most likely version to be built garzke and dulin project that a finalized no 3 design would have had a full load displacement of which would have included lengthening hull to with same beam of 35 5 m at these dimensions draft would have been and with ship could have been propelled at a speed of at least 30 knots they estimate that projected battery of twenty four 100 mm guns would have been cut in half in line with other variants and eighteen 37 mm guns would have been carried they expect belt would have been increased to a maximum of with an incline of 15 5 degrees from vertical to improve its resistance to long range fire according to their design study main deck would have been reduced slightly to 170 mm over magazines and over propulsion machinery spaces two of new ships were authorized on 1 april 1940 first vessel was slated to be laid down at no 1 slipway at saint nazaire after joffre was to be launched in 1941 displacing painleve which was not reallocated to another builder before program ended second member of class was to be laid down in 1942 in new no 10 dock in brest which was to have been completed by that time on 15 may 1940 navy proposed four names for first two ships for darlan to select these were alsace normandie flandre and bourgogne according to garzke and dulin government considered authorizing two more vessels though no contracts were placed initial orders for building material were scheduled for mid 1940 but following german victory in battle of france by june all french naval construction programs came to an end citations references category battleship classes category battleships of french navy category proposed ships category abandoned
