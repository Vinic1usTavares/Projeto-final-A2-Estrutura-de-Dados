tony much of inspiration for episode came from news reports of bears roaming streets in southern california around time when episode was in production cohen said that when a bear swims in somebody s pool or goes in somebody s garbage can it becomes a popular news item in california show runner of simpsons at time bill oakley commented that news reports often create an anti bear hysteria and that is one of inspirations for episode another inspiration for episode came from california s proposition 187 which proposed rescinding of employment rights and benefits from illegal immigrants cohen decided to name referendum proposition 24 because 24 was number he had on his little league baseball uniform cohen commented that main theme of episode is illegal immigration and anti immigration sentiment which is a big issue here in california so both intro with bear and main theme are yanked from california headlines apu studying computer science is based on cohen s own academic background where he met and became friends with indian people in department similarly scene where apu does an in depth explanation of what caused american civil war only for test taker to respond with just say slavery is something that actually happened to a friend of cohen when she got her citizenship test taken final script of episode was very close to cohen s first draft i was looking at old drafts and this episode probably changed as little as any script i ve written from original inception to final aired version cohen said oakley commented that some writer s scripts get rewritten many times but cohen s usually do not get rewritten that much because they are so good oakley added that cohen has a very distinctive comedy style so there are certain jokes in episode that just really sound like cohen something oakley and his partner josh weinstein wanted to do while they were show runners of simpsons was to explore side characters such as apu a little deeper apu s origin is revealed in this episode and oakley is proud of being one who suggested that another character that was explored deeper in their period as show runners was ned flanders in episode hurricane neddy cultural references episode s title is based on william shakespeare s play much ado about nothing original title for episode was going to be anti immigrant song in reference to led zeppelin s song immigrant song a sign

received mostly positive reviews from television critics dvd movie guide s colin jacobson commented positively on episode and said that if any show s taken a more unusual path to a story about xenophobia i ve not seen it he praised bear scenes which he thought was episode s most amusing part review continued parts with immigrants are also good especially since they make their point deftly add to that hilarious sound of american apu and this is a strong program jennifer malkowski of dvd verdict considered best part of episode to be when homer tries to teach apu american history noting homer s relevant and complex diagram of a stovepipe hat malkowski concluded her review by giving episode a grade of b authors of book i can t believe it s a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood wrote one of most outspoken and certainly angriest of episodes succeeds as a savage satire on scapegoating of immigrants homer has never been so frighteningly dumb although he does come through with a rousing liberal speech episode is simpsons creator matt groening s third favorite episode of show episode received a negative review from dave foster of dvd times he considered much apu about nothing to be one of season s most tiring episodes mostly because apu is not a strong enough character to focus an episode on no matter how much writer david cohen develops him foster commented that episode deals with a political issue which is difficult to broach in twenty minutes and is therefore reached and sewn up in a rather haphazard manner episode has become study material for sociology courses at university of california berkeley where it is used to examine issues of production and reception of cultural objects in this case a satirical cartoon show and to figure out what it is trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of american society and to a lesser extent about other societies some questions asked in courses include what aspects of american society are being addressed in episode what aspects of them are used to make points how is satire conveyed through language drawing music is behavior of each character consistent with his her character as developed over years can we identify elements of historical political context that writers are satirizing what is difference between satire and parody in episode after creation of bear patrol bear sightings decrease to zero so homer concludes that bear patrol must be working lisa attempts to demonstrate homer s logical fallacy by example of a tiger repellent rock but it goes over his head scott anthony of harvard business review describes this scene as a classic example of informal fallacy of assuming that correlation implies causation mike moffatt also called
