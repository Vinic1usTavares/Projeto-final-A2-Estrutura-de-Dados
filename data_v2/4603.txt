from rhodes he reached adalia now known as antalya but contracted malaria whilst he was recuperating he died from a second attack of disease combined with as a wealthy amateur artist daniell exhibited his paintings but was not forced to earn his living from them usually selecting a limited palette he had a distinctive style that was influenced by crome turner and john sell cotman his etchings demonstrate his great skill in use of drypoint his surviving sketches may have been preparatory work for future works they were printed by daniell s friend and neighbour henry ninham whose technique he influenced background thumb john crome whose pupils included edward daniell leading spirits and finest artists of norwich school of painters were crome and john sell cotman edward thomas daniell was associated with norwich school of painters a group of artists connected both by geographical location and their depictions of norfolk landscapes as well as by personal and professional relationships school s most important artists were john crome joseph stannard george vincent robert ladbrooke james stark john thirtle and john sell cotman along with cotman s sons miles edmund and john joseph cotman school was a unique phenomenon in history of 19th century british art norwich was first english city outside london where a school of artists arose and which had right conditions to create a provincial art movement it had more local born artists than any subsequently formed schools elsewhere city s theatrical artistic philosophical and musical cultures were cross fertilised in a way that was unique outside london daniell was according author geoffrey searle associated more with wider circle of norwich based artists and more weakly linked with his contemporary artists because of his social class artistic connections in london and travels abroad norwich society of artists which was founded in 1803 arose from need for a group of norwich artists to teach each other and their pupils not all of members of norwich school were members of norwich society which held regular exhibitions and had an organised structure showing works annually until 1825 and again from 1828 until it was dissolved in 1833 at end of seventeenth century other schools of painting had begun to form that associated with artists such as francis towne at exeter and john at oxford and other centres of population outside london were creating art societies whose artists and drawing masters influenced their pupils unlike artists of norwich school many other provincial artists did not benefit from wealthy merchants and landed gentry demonstrating their patriotism at a time of international unrest by acquiring picturesque paintings of english countryside norwich society of artists 1803 1833 first group of its kind to be created since formation of royal academy in 1768 was remarkable in acting in its artists interests for thirty years longer than for any other similar group life family thumb daniell s mother anne edward thomas daniell was born on 6 june 1804 at charlotte street fitzroy square london son of sir thomas daniell retired attorney general of dominica and his second wife anne drosier daughter of john drosier of rudham grange norfolk his first wife by whom he had a son and a daughter had died in london in 1792 a man of considerable wealth sir thomas daniell was able to purchase land and slaves in leeward islands which then formed part of british empire his estates which included at dickenson bay on island of antigua had been bought from family of his first wife in 1779 he retired and moved to west of norfolk but his health deteriorated and he died of cancer in 1806 leaving a young widow and an infant son in his will he left his dominican lands to his wife anne and his estate on antigua to his adult son earle subject to him providing a guaranteed annual income of ps300 to family in norfolk sir thomas slaves were also included as part of bequest to anne and her son anne daniell subsequently moved with her son to 68 st giles street norwich when she died there in 1836 at age of 64 she was buried in nave of st mary coslany norwich early life and education little has been recorded of daniell s early life and no anecdotes of his childhood days have survived he grew up in norwich and was educated at norwich grammar school where his drawing master was john crome he was taught etching by joseph stannard and during vacations practised at stannard s studio in st giles terrace which was round corner from his own house their influence is apparent in daniell s early etchings but he later became more influenced by work of j m w turner whom he greatly admired he became involved in art world at a young age brothers thomas and chambers hall wrote to artist john linnell in 1822 about our young friend mr daniells sic who accompanied us to your house last week and who wishes to possess a drawing by on 9 december 1823 nineteen year old daniell went up to balliol college oxford to read classics he graduated from oxford in november 1828 despite having neglected his studies in favour of art in a letter by daniell to his friend linnell dated month before his graduation he wrote i find that examinations for which i am preparing next month require a closer application to my literary studies than i had imagined that i must not attempt to serve two masters he began a master of arts degree six months later on 25 may 1831 travels around europe scotland and ireland daniell had financial means to travel abroad to seek subjects to paint and of norwich school painters only john sell cotman travelled further he spent intervening months between his classics studies and his master s degree on a grand tour through france italy and switzerland producing paintings of local scenery these watercolours were described by art historian william dickes as well centred painted with fluidity and revealing a delicate appreciation of tone thumb left bridge at toledo undated norfolk museums collections route taken during his eighteen months on continent is revealed by order of his drawings in touring europe he was acting in a similar way to other wealthy young englishmen of his day his travels through switzerland are reminiscent of those of artist captain james pattison cockburn whose works included his swiss scenery published in 1820 when daniell visited rome and naples in 1830 he met artist thomas uwins who wrote what a shoal of amateur artists we have got here there is a daniel sic too come to judgement a second daniel verily i have got more substantial criticism from this young man than from any one since havell was my messmate daniell may also have visited spain as his drawings of country were copied by ninham but there is no direct evidence that he went there himself it is possible that he returned to norwich from europe in time to attend joseph stannard s funeral after his former teacher died from tuberculosis in december 1830 aged 33 in summer of 1832 daniell went with friends from his days at oxford on a walking trip of scotland travelling with edmund walker head and g a denison as well as to ireland obtaining valuable subject material as a result his scottish tour influenced his use of drypoint etching as he was able to study work of important etchers such as andrew geddes according to author jane thistlethwaite daniell s drawings and etchings of scottish scenes testify in their subjects to his enthusiasm for beauties of scotland and in their technique to his almost certain acquaintance with scottish etchers career in church thumb st mark s north audley street london 1831 on 7 october 1832 daniell was ordained as a deacon at norwich cathedral by elderly bishop of norwich henry bathurst and three days later he was licensed by bishop as curate of banham a post he held for eighteen months from letters to john linnell it is evident that he was rather short of money and this might account for why he decided to enter church little is known of his career as a norfolk curate but parish registers for banham all of which have been preserved show that he led an active life within parish according to jane thistlethwaite some of his loveliest and most sophisticated plates were produced whilst he was living at banham on 2 june 1833 he was ordained to priesthood at norwich cathedral but he continued as curate at banham until in 1834 he was appointed to curacy of st mark s north audley street in london at this time he also worked at st george s hospital but there are no surviving records of his work there or as a curate at st mark s a letter written in 1835 from daniell to his old oxford tutor reverend joseph blanco white gives an indication of friendship he still felt towards his old coadjutor letter referred to his norfolk and london parishioners in a jocular way as when he wrote you probably thought i was haranguing plough boys in norfolk and you find me among dons of grosvenor square and having to preach as i must next wednesday at st george s hanover square i wish you would come and give me some assistance in about 1836 he moved to rooms at 13 green street near grosvenor square and close to st mark s where he stayed until he left england in 1840 outer shell of norwich castle s keep was refaced in bath stone from 1834 9 faithfully replicating original blank arcading daniell was one of foremost opponents of proposed refacing in one of many letters he wrote about subject one appeared in norwich mercury in august 1830 referring to scandalous re facing of ancient keep tour of holy land thumb lycia from travels in lycia milyas and cibyratis in company with late rev e t daniell 1842 see external links for a high quality version of this map at a date some time after june 1840 and perhaps inspired by example of scottish painter david roberts who had made a long trip to egypt and holy land to gather subject material daniell left england to tour near east arriving in corfu in september 1840 roberts drawings of middle east are thought to have compelled him to tour abroad but he had also heard of recent discoveries in lycia from his friend british explorer charles fellows daniell s depictions of landscapes of middle east have provided important documentary evidence of region during this period he was in athens by end of year and had crossed to alexandria early in 1841 travelling up nile to nubia and then from egypt to palestine after travelling on to syria he reached beirut in october 1841 at turkish city of smyrna he met fellows and joined his expedition boarding hms beacon sent by british government to lycia to convey home antiquities recently discovered at xanthos during expedition eighteen ancient cities were located daniell spent winter at xanthos and when fellows left he remained to make a more thorough survey of country in company with thomas abel spratt a lieutenant in navy and naturalist professor edward forbes daniell recorded their journey by producing a series of sixty four drawings now preserved in british museum laurence binyon said of them what strikes one most at first is astonishing air of space and magnitude conveyed fluid wash of sunlight in these towering gorges and open valleys daniell travelled to selge sketching and exploring ruins he copied inscriptions from monuments in lycia cibyratis pisidia and pamphylia and also collected coins he alone visited selge marmara perga and lyrbe 200 inscriptions were copied by expedition in main by daniell his original inscriptions he produced are now lost but they were published in travels in lycia milyas and cibyratis in company with late e t daniell and were transcribed inaccurately by samuel birch for a book now in british museum book contains a single page of daniell s original manuscript in april 1842 spratt forbes and daniell arrived overland at antalya spratt and forbes left city on before daniell who left overland after his meeting with pasha daniell visited cyprus that year and painted his only extant watercolour of island an untitled work now held in british museum and described as cyprus from sea he may have produced work aboard his ship while anchored off shore dr rita severis had compared work with watercolour paintings of turner a painter he was known to admire according to dr severis interplay of blue of sea with sand colour of land latter colour being repeated in a most successful way in foreground of picture accentuates distance on one hand but simultaneously enhances desire for a closer and more attentive look at subject death from malaria thumb left daniell s etching published in travels in lycia milyas and 1847 in june daniell left rhodes to return to lycia and rejoin forbes and spratt his intention was to sail to athens aboard then lying off coast at mouth of xanthos with hms medea as both ships had by that time been commissioned to replace hms beacon he missed his ship and was forced to amend his plans he travelled to adalia now known as antalya in company of newly appointed consul for city john purdie but during journey he contracted malaria it is likely he became infected as he travelled past marshy lowlands of aksu cayi and cayi circumventing a great marsh as he travelled inland at adalia purdie helped him to convalesce during this time daniell wrote letters to his friends in which he described his discoveries of sites such as those at olbia appolonia and lyrbe he chose to leave adalia before he had fully recovered and undertook a solitary expedition to pamphylia and pisidia during hottest part of year he was forced back after suffering a second attack of disease at consul s house in adalia he dictated what was to be his last letter in which he expressed his intentions to continue his work thumb daniell s plaque inside st mary coslany norwich he lost consciousness after sleeping on front terrace of purdie s residence and he died a week later from combined effects of malaria and heat stroke he was buried in city beecheno recalled that he was buried beneath an ancient granite column in court of a greek church in centre of town of adalia forbes paid tribute to his friend saying that his illness destroyed a traveller whose talents scholarship and research would have made lycia a bright spot on map of asia minor and whose manliness of character and kindness of heart endeared him to all who had happiness of knowing him roberts wrote poor daniell like wilkie went to syria after me but neither returned had daniell returned to england i have reason to know from turner s own mouth he would have been entrusted with his law affairs a memorial to daniell can be seen in church of st mary coslany norwich his will is preserved in national archives at kew friends and associates many of daniell s etchings were printed by his norwich friend henry ninham whose home and printing workshop was a short distance from daniell s house on st giles street according to dickes daniell was fond of ninham and corresponded with him regularly his friendships with ninham and joseph stannard may have first begun when they were at school daniell was one of best known patrons of arts of his time and held regular dinner parties and other gatherings at his london home his rooms at 77 park lane in mayfair became a resort of painters that included john linnell david roberts william mulready william dyce thomas creswick edwin landseer william collins abraham cooper john horsley charles lock eastlake j m w turner and william clarkson stanfield according to linnell s biographer alfred story daniell s home was a treasure house of art and comprised works by some of best painters of day one of edward daniell s friends was writer elizabeth rigby who was also one of his pupils a private letter from elizabeth to frederick beecheno written in 1891 explained how her friend taught her etching and showed her drawings to him and in it is revealed warmth of friendship she and her future husband charles lock eastlake felt for him before their marriage recalling him in letter many years later she wrote of daniell that his face was that of one of that could be seen a superb forehead and splendid teeth which showed themselves with every smile and no one smiled and laughed more in a letter written by daniell to elizabeth rigby he referred to himself as a house and tree painter john linnell daniell was an influential friend of artist john linnell whom he first met at oxford daniell acted as his patron as when in 1825 he promoted for him sale of illustrations of book of job by english artist and poet william blake he commissioned him to produce painting now known as view of lymington isle of wight beyond for price of 30 guineas at a later date he exchanged it for boy minding sheep paying difference of 20 guineas in 1828 linnell made a miniature of daniell and taught him how to paint in oils two friends corresponded to each other regularly and linnell was a frequent guest at daniell s rooms in london he encouraged linnell to complete his st john baptist preaching in wilderness 1828 33 offering to buy it himself if it did not sell when painting was exhibited in 1839 at british institution it helped to enhance linnell s reputation as an artist linnell first met j m w turner at daniell s house in 1838 and used opportunity to study him prior to painting his portrait from memory as turner had previously refused to sit for artist and it was notoriously difficult to get his agreement to be portrayed due to daniell s premature death painting was never delivered when linnell s painting noon was rejected by royal academy in 1840 daniell came to his friend s assistance linnell agreed that picture be hung in daniell s house above fireplace when his friends who included turner and eastlake admired picture daniell criticised them and forced them to justify their action and was quoted to say you are a pretty set of men to pretend to stand up for high art and to proclaim academy fosterer of artistic talent and yet allow such a picture to be rejected j m w turner edward daniell s friendship with turner whom he met when he moved from norwich was short but intense of all group of artists that daniell was surrounded by during his years in london turner was considered by them ablest he was a regular guest at daniell s gatherings and dinner parties and they quickly became close friends beecheno in his e t daniell a memoir recalled that on one occasion turner was asked his opinion of daniell s work very clever sir very clever was great master s dictum delivered in his usual blunt way elizabeth rigby wrote of turner and artist william boxall his admiration for turner inspired turner with genuine affection for him boxall has told me that at an r a dinner he and turner sitting with one between them turner leant back and touched boxall to attract silently his attention and then pointing to a glass of wine in his other hand whispered solemnly edward daniell painter david roberts wrote of daniell he adored turner when i and others doubted and taught me to see to distinguish his beauties over that of others old man really had a fond personal regard for this young clergyman which i doubt he ever evinced for other daniell s watercolours of landscapes seen during his tour of switzerland and during his travels in middle east approach turner s romantic works in their style coincidentally turner toured switzerland in 1829 visiting some of sites that daniell had previously depicted daniell may have helped to turn turner towards religion as he approached old age according to author james hamilton he would have been able to supply spiritual comfort that turner required to help him fill holes left by deaths of his father and friends and to ease fears of a naturally reflective man approaching old age old artist is known to have mourned his friend s early death deeply saying repeatedly to david roberts that he would never form such a friendship again artistic career thumb 300px sketch for a picture of mountains of savoy from geneva norfolk museums collections daniell exhibited work at royal academy in 1839 throughout his life daniell remained an amateur artist as befit his social class his private income and career as a parish priest freed him from having to earn a living from his etchings and paintings according to art historian derek clifford daniell s free bold and distinctive artistic style was rooted methods of john sell cotman an artist he deeply admired historian josephine walpole who believes daniell s talent has yet to be properly recognised noted his ability to create a sense of space a feeling of heat or cold of poverty or plenty with apparent of effort she has written admiring his rare talent and highly individual approach for her his drawings are appealing for their delicacy of outline and his watercolours best of which were produced on his last tour are impressive in their simplicity having a powerful feeling for landscape involved and having washes that are muted but distinctive in 1832 he exhibited a number of his own pictures of scenes in italy switzerland and france with norwich society of artists which were favourably commented upon by norwich mercury during sole instance of an exhibition of daniell s works with society which was disbanded following year he showed sketch from nature lake of geneva from lausanne painted on spot ruins of a claudian aqueduct in campagna di roma and ruined tombs on via nomentana rome painted on spot daniell s oil paintings which generally depicted subjects encountered on his continental travels were shown in annual exhibitions during time he lived in london he was an honorary exhibitor with royal academy showing four works there sion in valais 1837 view of st malo 1838 sketch from a picture of mountains of savoy from geneva 1839 and kenilworth 1840 as well as four works at british institute for his watercolour paintings he deliberately selected a limited palette for instance when he made painted freely on buff paper during his tours of middle east 120 sketches at norwich castle and 64 works in possession of british museum may have been preparatory work for etchings and paintings that were never made daniell served on bodies involved with arts he was elected as a fellow of geological society of london in 1835 and was elected as a committee member of society for encouragement of british art in may 1837 etchings thumb view of 1827 british museum his view of whitlingham full of light and air proves him to be in direct line of masters salaman studio 1914 daniell s etchings though small in number are basis for his reputation as an artist author geoffrey searle asserts that only a lack of plates has prevented him from being one of great etchers of world in 1899 laurence binyon considered daniell s etchings to be from a historical point of view most remarkable of his works anticipating with their freedom of line etching revival personified later in century by seymour haden and whistler malcolm salaman writing in 1910s observed no etcher of this early english period evinced a truer and more subtle understanding and handling of medium than crome s pupil rev e t daniell a very interesting artist of norwich school whose plates etched in eighteen twenties are remarkable for genuine etcher s vision expressive charm and delicacy of craft his view of whitlingham full of light and air proves him to be in direct line of masters dr miklos formerly keeper of art at norwich castle museum compared daniell s skill as an etcher with john crome and john sell cotman british art historian arthur hind has said that his etchings anticipated far more than nearly anything of crome or cotman modern revival of etching according to author james hamilton his etchings become supremely independent and for his time unique after 1831 daniell s first etchings were made with joseph stannard in 1824 and he became skilled in this particular method of printmaking because of his norwich connections three distinct groups of etchings can be identified those produced in norfolk including flordon bridge his masterpiece from his early years which according to searle has an assured and individuality a more grandiose group of etchings made during daniell s tours of scotland and continent and those etchings made in norfolk during his curacy at banham which includes his most assured work of this period whitlingham lane near trowse although his norfolk prints were nearly all of landscapes they were not intended to be topographically accurate and any figures that were often pairs of companions were used simply to indicate scale of landscape they were set in whilst still at university daniell learnt much from his fellow norwich artist joseph stannard but later employed a looser style moving away from example of his friend and teacher towards that of andrew geddes and other scottish etchers whose work he had probably seen while in scotland in summer of 1831 his later works excel in use of drypoint according to geoffrey searle he is thought to have introduced drypoint etching to his norwich peers both thomas and henry ninham etched in this way after 1831 producing works of a quality that approached daniell s own etchings legacy most of daniell s works are held at either british museum or as part of norfolk museums collections british museum obtained some of his etchings before 1852 and had purchased his prints as early as 1856 an article by poet and art scholar lawrence binyon on daniell appeared in 1889 daniell stopped etching when he moved to london none of his etchings were exhibited or published during his lifetime but were sometimes given to friends original impressions are generally held in public collections and so it is unusual for any to appear for sale in 1882 inglis palgrave wrote twelve etchings of rev e t daniell and twenty four copies of book were made but it was never published his etchings were first shown in public in 1891 in a norwich arts circle exhibition in 1921 author martin hardie delivered a lecture to print collectors club in which he discussed etchings of e t daniell he later noted that daniell s prints are full of interest and technical value and at same time curiously modern in their spirit adding that he reaches a very high level of refined thought and execution in his borough bridge daniell s works were exhibited at aldeburgh in 1968 and at an exhibition from norfolk to nubia
