scutellinia scutellata commonly known as eyelash cup molly eye winker scarlet elf cap eyelash fungus or eyelash pixie cup is a small saprophytic fungus of genus scutellinia it is type species of scutellinia as well as being most common and widespread fruiting bodies are small red cups with distinct long dark hairs or eyelashes these eyelashes are most distinctive feature and are easily visible with a magnifying glass species is common in north america and europe and has been recorded on every continent s scutellata is found on rotting wood and in other damp habitats typically growing in small groups sometimes forming clusters it is sometimes described as inedible but its small size means it is not suitable for culinary use despite this it is popular among mushroom hunters due to its unusual eyelash hairs making it memorable and easy to identify taxonomy s scutellata was first described in 1753 by carl linnaeus in his book species plantarum as peziza scutellata and it was given its current name by jean baptiste emil lambotte in memoires societe royale des sciences de liege in 1887 it was also named patella scutellata in 1902 specific name scutellata is from latin for like a small shield common names include eyelash fungus eyelash cup scarlet elf cap molly eye winker and eyelash pixie cup genus scutellinia is currently placed in family pyronemataceae however genera of pyronemataceae lack unifying macroscopic or microscopic characteristics this lack of uniting characters has led various authors to propose a variety of classification schemes a 1996 study of british specimens of scutellinia revealed that species s crinita originally described as peziza crinita in 1789 by french botanist jean baptiste francois pierre bulliard was synonymous with s scutellata description fruiting body of s scutellata is a shallow disc shape typically between in diameter youngest specimens are almost entirely spherical cups open up and expand to a disc during maturity inner surface of cup fertile spore bearing surface known as hymenium is bright orange red while outer surface sterile surface is pale brown flesh is red and thin outer surface is covered in dark coloured stiff hairs measuring up to in length at base these hairs are up to thick and they taper towards pointed apices hairs form distinctive eyelashes on margin of cup that are visible to naked eye or easily visible through a magnifying glass s scutellata is sessile it does not have a stalk microscopic features thumb left alt ten numbered black and white sketches of various structures including cup shaped objects some with hairs some with open tops and some closed lines resembling thin filaments asci and ascospores of s scutellata drawn by johann hedwig in 1788 s scutellata has asci of approximately 300 um by 25 um in size and releases elliptical spores measuring 18 to 19 um by 10 to 12 um translucent hyaline ascospores have a rough exterior with very small warts and contain small droplets of oil they are white when present in large numbers like a spore print paraphyses are cylindrical in shape and feature septa partitioning hypha into distinct cells electron microscopy of top of ascus has revealed a roughly delimited operculum a flap like covering of ascus and a pore in apex of ascus and a subapical ring edibility while some list s scutellata as inedible others list it as having an unknown edibility david arora considers it too small to be of any culinary interest and it lacks a distinctive smell or taste distribution and habitat thumb right alt three larger red cup shaped structures with darker colored eyelashes on outer rim also present are several dozen smaller structures roughly resembling red colored ball on sticks supporting all of these structures is a moist piece of wood with some moss on it scutellinia scutellata typically grows in groups on rotten wood s scutellata is common in both europe where it can be found from late spring to late autumn and north america where it fruits in winter and spring it has also been collected in cameroon colombia east asia india iceland israel new guinea and solomon islands russia and turkey a saprobic species it grows generally in subalpine regions fruiting on rotten wood and damp soil and can also sometimes be found on ashes wet leaves or bracket fungi in alaska it has been found growing on humus in tundra a six year study of succession of fungal flora appearing on freshly cut stumps of poplar trees populus canadensis showed that s scutellata appeared roughly in middle of fungal succession about 2 4 years after tree had been cut along with species ascocoryne sarcoides scutellinia and when growing on wood it is often obscured by surrounding moss though sometimes found alone they typically fruit in groups sometimes forming dense clusters on rotting wood or other plant detritus due to its small size it is often overlooked but mycologist vera evenson has observed that discovery of eyelash cup is always a great pleasure due to beauty of eyelashes vera mcknight describes it as a most attractive little fungus and claims it is easy to notice due to its bright colouration carotenoids carotenoids are pigmented molecules found naturally in plants and some types of fungi including s scutellata a 1965 study reported carotenoid composition of this fungus found to contain a high proportion of carotenes carotenes with only one ring such as beta carotene also present were minor amounts of xanthophyll a molecule structurally related to carotenes similar species of more than a dozen species of scutellinia s scutellata is most common and widespread though a microscope is required to differentiate between some of them it is also type species of genus it is differentiated from most other scutellinia by its larger size and its distinctive eyelashes although david arora describes s scutellata as easily recognizable it can be mistaken for s which has a larger fruiting body and larger spores as well as having shorter less obvious hairs s which is slightly smaller and orange to yellow in colour with smooth spores cheilymenia which is much smaller with short pale hairs and spores lacking oil droplets and which is bright orange with small brown hairs pennsylvania eyelash cup s pennsylvanica is a smaller north american version that has smaller hairs and spores that are more coarsely warted than s scutellata s is very similar as well and can only be reliably distinguished by its roughly spherical ascospores that are typically 17 23 um in diameter species from genus are smaller and hairless similar fungi that favour dung over rotting wood include cheilymenia c and granulata while species such as anthracobia anthracobia omphalodes pulvinula carbonaria and pulvinula
