jacket s field long barrow is an long barrow located near to village of boughton aluph in south eastern english county of kent it was probably constructed in fourth millennium bce during britain s early neolithic period built out of earth long barrow consists of an sub trapezoidal tumulus flanked by side ditches archaeologists have established that monument was built by a pastoralist community shortly after introduction of agriculture to britain from continental europe although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across neolithic europe jacket s field long barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in vicinity of river stour of these it lies on western side of river while julliberrie s grave and shrub s wood long barrow are found on eastern side site was discovered in 1970 at which point it was concealed in dense woodland although has yet to undergo thorough archaeological investigation location jacket s field long barrow is found within woodland in jacket s field southeast of village of boughton aluph it is located within soakham downs on a subsoil of clay with flints north downs trackway is located around to south west of barrow it can be inspected from an adjacent public path context thumb right construction of long barrows and related funerary monuments took place in various parts of europe during early neolithic distribution pictured early neolithic was a revolutionary period of british prehistory between 4500 and 3800 bce there was a widespread change in lifestyle as communities living on british isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence abandoning hunter gatherer lifestyle that had characterised preceding mesolithic period this came about through contact with continental societies although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous mesolithic britons adopting agricultural technologies from continent region of modern kent would have been a key area for arrival of continental european settlers and visitors because of its position on estuary of river thames and its proximity to continent britain was largely forested in this period widespread forest clearance did not occur in area around modern kent until late bronze age c 1000 to 700 bce throughout most of britain there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period leading archaeologists to believe that early neolithic economy on island was largely pastoral relying on herding cattle with people living a nomadic or semi nomadic life it is apparent that although a common material culture was shared throughout most of british isles in this period there was great regional variation regarding nature and distribution of settlement architectural styles and use of natural resources stour long barrows across western europe early neolithic marked first period in which humans built monumental structures in landscape these were tombs that held physical remains of dead and though sometimes constructed out of timber many were built using large stones now known as megaliths individuals were rarely buried alone in early neolithic instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community construction of these collective burial monumental tombs both wooden and megalithic began in continental europe before being adopted in britain in first half of fourth millennium bce many archaeologists have suggested that this is evidence for an early neolithic ancestor cult revolving around veneration of spirits of dead given that other rites may have taken place around these long barrows historian ronald hutton termed them tomb shrines to reflect their dual purpose in britain these long barrows were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking surrounding landscape perhaps at junction between different territories archaeologist caroline malone noted that tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in landscape that conveyed information on territory political allegiance ownership and ancestors many archaeologists have subscribed to idea that these tomb shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society instead it has been suggested that they were markers along herding pathways many archaeologists have suggested that construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over land thus representing a change in mindset brought about by others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by mesolithic hunter gatherers thumb left s grave one of other two known stour long barrows archaeologists are aware of around twelve neolithic long barrows located in kent best known are medway megaliths found in vicinity of river medway each of which contains a stone burial chamber stones addington long barrow chestnuts long barrow kit s coty house little kit s coty house destroyed smythe s megalith and two other possible examples coffin stone and white horse stone about east of medway megaliths are stour long barrows this distinct regional grouping consists of three known mounds jacket s field long barrow julliberrie s grave and shrub s wood long barrow these are located within of each other high up on north downs between canterbury and ashford jacket s field is on western side of river stour and other two on eastern side unlike medway megaliths stour long barrows do not appear to have used stone as a building material their builders decision not to do so was likely deliberate for sarsens are naturally present in local area and could have been obtained had they wanted them presence of long barrows suggests some sort of settlement nearby in early neolithic period and two polished flint axes from period have been found at soakham farm not far from jacket s field long barrow north downs trackway may have been in use at time and would have provided routes for local people to travel west elsewhere in southern britain long barrows were often erected close to causewayed enclosures although none of latter have yet been discovered near to stour long barrows elsewhere in southeast there are other long barrows of period over away from stour long barrows are another regional cluster in sussex while a solitary long barrow is known at badshot farm in farnham surrey description jacket s field long barrow is slightly trapezoidal in shape it aligns on an east southeast to west southwest axis it measures approximately in length with a width of at its eastern end and at west at its western end it reaches in height and at eastern end almost there is evidence of side ditches that once flanked mound discovery thumb right jacket s field barrow while julliberrie s grave had been known to antiquarians since at least 16th century jacket s field long barrow as well as shrub s wood long barrow was only discovered by later archaeological investigation archaeologist ronald jessup who excavated julliberrie s grave in 1930s suggested likelihood that other long barrows would also be found in area in 1970 j bradshaw reported in archaeologia cantiana journal of kent archaeological society that jacket s field long barrow had been discovered within dense woodland and reported to ordnance survey archaeological team who investigated and confirmed its existence it was subsequently made a scheduled ancient monument as of 2007
