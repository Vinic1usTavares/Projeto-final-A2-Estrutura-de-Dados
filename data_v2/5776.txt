battle of balikpapan was concluding stage of operation oboe campaign to liberate japanese held british and dutch borneo landings took place on 1 july 1945 australian 7th division composed of 18th 21st and 25th infantry brigades with a small number of netherlands east indies knil troops made an amphibious landing codenamed operation oboe two a few miles north of balikpapan allied invasion fleet consisted of around 100 ships landing had been preceded by heavy bombing and shelling by australian and us air and naval forces allied force totalled 33 000 personnel and was commanded by major general edward milford while japanese force commanded by rear admiral michiaki kamada numbered between 8 400 and 10 000 of which between 3 100 and 3 900 were combatants after initial landing allies secured town and its port and then advanced along coast and into hinterland capturing two japanese airfields major combat operations concluded around 21 july but were followed by mopping up operations which lasted until end of war in mid august australian troops remained in area until early 1946 background geography situated northwest of darwin on east coast of borneo balikpapan s importance lay in its oil production facilities and port facilities prior to war area produced 1 8 million tons of oil products a year town s port sitting inside balikpapan bay consisted of seven piers and a large number of warehouses port area was serviced by well developed roads at its mouth bay was wide and was suitable for medium sized ships to south of port an oil refinery with 40 storage tanks and a cracking plant lay along a steep ridge separating port from european suburb of klandasan which looked out on open sea from cape that sat at eastern part of bay two roads fanned out from balikpapan town one running north east to samarinda dubbed milford highway by australians while other vasey highway stretched south along coast towards sambodja oil refinery in balikpapan was supplied with oil from fields around sambodja and sangasanga to north east thumb 300px japanese forces in borneo to east of cape narrow coastal strip was serviced by road that extended east from klandasan to stalkoedo sepinggang batakan besar manggar and sambodja crossing many rivers and streams this road sat on a thick sandy strip of ground just inland from beach ground around coast was largely flat although there were some low hills which rose steeply further inland up to heights of while area around town and coast was largely open interior was heavily covered with thick rainforest dense vegetation limited cross country movement although rivers and streams were partially navigable two airfields had been established to east of balikpapan around sepinggang and manggar manggar was larger of two consisting of two runways that had been graded out of coral at time of allied landings airfield had been badly damaged by aerial bombardment while second smaller airfield at sepinggang had also been rendered unserviceable balikpapan is located one degree south of equator and has a tropical rainforest climate maximum temperature for most days in south east borneo in 1945 was about and relative humidity was consistently high ranging from 74 to 93 percent monthly rainfall was fairly constant averaging in july allied intelligence estimates assessed that july to september period represented that best period for military operations in terms of cloud cover july was generally clear and visibility was assessed as generally good wind speeds averaged with south south westerly winds being most prevalent during may to november period strategic situation prior to world war ii balikpapan was under dutch control and formed part of netherlands east indies japanese occupied british borneo and netherlands east indies in late 1941 and early 1942 balikpapan itself was seized on 25 january 1942 british and dutch forces attempted to resist but were quickly overwhelmed but not before destroying or damaging oil facilities and other important infrastructure destruction of these facilities led to harsh reprisals against civilians particularly at balikpapan which was occupied in late january 1942 after which entire european population around 80 to 100 people was executed facilities were subsequently repaired and by 1943 1944 borneo had become one of japan s main sources of fuel crude and heavy oil in 1943 balikpapan provided of fuel oil to japanese war effort throughout 1943 and 1944 allies attempted to reduce japanese oil production at balikpapan with air power first strategic bombing raids began in october 1943 undertaken by us liberator bombers flying 17 hours from bases around darwin further raids took place in december 1943 and january 1944 in early months of 1944 royal australian air force catalina flying boats carried out a series of highly successful mining operations which reduced output of balikpapan s facilities by an estimated 40 percent in late september and early october 1944 us thirteenth and fifth air forces began long range bombing raids from noemfoor first two raids suffered heavy losses due to lack of escort fighters and inflicted minimal damage however after a brief pause and a change of tactics by us airmen final three raids resulted in heavy damage to refineries and destruction of most of japanese aircraft defending balikpapan this coupled with allied operations along japanese sea lanes of communication effectively cut off japan from balikpapan s oil supply line japanese decided not to repair damaged facilities and those that remained were used for local supply only indeed after october 1944 no more japanese oil tankers were sent to balikpapan nevertheless this simply diverted japanese efforts to oil fields in sumatra instead japanese advance in pacific was halted in early 1943 by australian troops in new guinea and us troops in guadalcanal after which allies went on offensive advancing through new guinea and solomon islands towards philippines throughout 1944 allies began planning to retake borneo general headquarters of general douglas macarthur s south west pacific area was responsible for planning operation but due to commitment of us forces to recapture of philippines task of recapturing borneo was allocated primarily to australian ground forces allied operations in borneo consisted of landings at tarakan labuan and balikpapan originally macarthur had intended to use borneo as a stepping stone to re taking java but this operation was later cancelled and responsibility for netherlands east indies transferred to british led south east asia command in planning phase commander of australian military forces general thomas blamey recommended against landing at balikpapan believing that it would serve no strategic purpose after much consideration australian government agreed to provide forces for this operation us joint chiefs of staff also had concerns about strategic necessity of operation but according to historian garth pratten macarthur manipulated both australian government and joint chiefs into approving capture of balikpapan stated purpose of operation was according to historian chris coulthard clark secure port and oilfields in area and to establish a base from which to launch future operations additionally netherlands east indies governmental control would be re established opposing forces japanese preparations to defend against allied landings in borneo commenced in 1944 with garrison forces being reorganised and an operational command being set up under thirty seventh army in early 1945 thirty seventh army began its troops towards borneo s west coast number of japanese defending area around balikpapan in 1945 was around 8 400 10 000 of these between 3 100 and 3 900 were combatants about 1 500 infantry and field artillery soldiers were in balikpapan manggar area along with 1 500 anti aircraft gunners base troops made up rest of number along with between 1 100 and 4 500 armed japanese formosan and indonesian civilian labourers another 1 500 troops were away at samarinda main japanese units were rear admiral michiaki kamada s 22nd naval base force and elements of 71st independent mixed brigade 22nd naval base force s i battalion was located around klandasan and river while ii battalion was positioned around batuchampar two other companies were around imperial japanese army s 454th battalion had also been deployed to manggar area having been transferred from tarakan in march 1945 japanese holding town consisted of 2nd garrison force armed labourers base troops artillerymen along with a small number of marines and elements of 454th independent infantry battalion these troops possessed varying levels of training and their morale had been effected by weeks of preliminary bombardment they were well equipped with heavy calibre weapons but lacked lighter weapons as a result they were largely static in posture thumb 300px left a map of battle due to allied interdiction of sea lanes of communication throughout pacific japanese troops on borneo had found themselves increasingly isolated and by end of 1944 supply shipments essentially ended food and supplies dwindled and units were forced to commence subsistence operations as majority of troops began to suffer from malnutrition sanitation was also poor and due to limited medical supplies many japanese troops became non battle casualties nevertheless area was well supported with artillery consisting of 18 japanese coastal guns concentrated around ridges overlooking balikpapan along with 26 heavy guns and 78 medium and light anti aircraft guns these were orientated to defend airfield port and balikpapan town itself defences in area included a wide anti tank ditch along coast between stalkoedo and sepinggang augmented by another around klandasan beaches were dotted with dutch built concrete pillboxes while japanese had dug complex trench system on ridges overlooking town seaward approach to klandasan was defended by an underwater obstacle consisting of poles and barbed wire which ran between klandasan and manggar this was augmented by a large number of naval mines around coast operation was designated operation oboe two by allies who assigned 33 000 personnel main ground forces amounting to 21 000 personnel were drawn from major general edward milford s 7th division a veteran second australian imperial force formation consisting of three infantry brigades 18th 21st and 25th along with supporting artillery armour engineer and logistics support units 7th division had seen action earlier in war in middle east and in new guinea but had been resting on atherton tablelands in queensland when they were assigned to operation division s formation and unit level command teams were all very experienced but due to high turn over of personnel that had occurred in australian army in 1943 1944 many of its more junior personnel had not been in action before tank support was provided by 1st armoured regiment equipped with matilda tanks naval support was drawn from us 7th fleet under admiral thomas kinkaid while air support came from australian first tactical air force and us thirteenth air force three us navy escort carriers were also assigned to provide fighter support as airstrip at tarakan had not been made operational in time and weather conditions hampered provision of fighter support from philippines a small number of dutch knil troops were also assigned to operation amounting to a company from 1st nei battalion prelude thumb raaf liberator bombers over balikpapan june 1945 oil facilities they have bombed are burning beneath them planning teams from all branches of australian and us armed services gathered at morotai island to begin planning operation around 26 april 1945 a shortage of shipping hampered preliminary movement of troops and a lack of co ordination and scheduling meant that tactical level planning and battle preparation was carried out in a hasty fashion first combat troops began embarking from townsville in early may however planners from combat formations assigned to operation did not arrive on morotai on 13 june in determining location of landing naval planners advocated for a landing around manggar as water was deeper in this area however beach was deemed unsuitable and a landing at manggar would require ground troops to advance through difficult terrain to reach their objective around balikpapan further west around stalkoedo and klandasan beach was more suitable to a large scale landing operation but this area was where majority of japanese defences were located additionally water in this area was not as deep and as a result supporting cruisers would have to stand further out to sea which would reduce accuracy of their guns when firing on shore targets approach was also covered by minefields and other obstacles ultimately australian commander milford chose to land at three beaches across a front in area occupied by main japanese forces reasoning that shorter approach march outweighed risks which would be reduced by a comprehensive pre landing aerial and naval bombardment air support was provided by australian and us aircraft based out of southern philippines due to of airfield on tarakan aerial operations began 20 days before landing while minesweepers began clearing safe lanes and anchorages 15 days out these operations were undertaken inside range of japanese coastal guns to protect minesweepers naval gunfire and aerial bombardment was used to suppress and neutralise japanese guns japanese torpedo boats attacked minesweepers on 24 june albeit without success three minesweepers were lost during clearance operations while assigned troops were moving from queensland to mounting base at morotai allies began enacting a deception plan to draw japanese attention away from intended landing area this included spreading disinformation amongst local population as well as undertaking preparatory operations in locations away from intended area advance force operations included small parties of special forces landing to carry out reconnaissance operations while minesweeping and obstacle clearance operations began 16 days before assault pre invasion bombardment expended over of bombs 7 361 rockets 38 052 shells and 114 000 small arms rounds most of japanese field guns were destroyed and shore defences severely depleted focus of allied air campaign from late may was japanese airfields throughout netherlands east indies as well as anti aircraft facilities attacks were also made on oil facilities around samarinda by raaf aircraft in contravention of an initial order not to target these facilities battle thumb left australian troops landing at balikpapan on 1 july 1945 allied fleet consisting of over 100 mainly us and australian ships began forming around morotai island on 17 june after landing rehearsals were conducted fleet departed area in afternoon of 26 june traversing strait of macassar on 29 june faster naval ships that were to carry out pre landing bombardment detached themselves from convoy meanwhile us underwater demolition teams worked create gaps in off shore obstacles this work was carried out under heavy fire several of supporting allied vessels were damaged and operations were concluded without completely clearing obstacles from central landing beach which was designated yellow beach in total about of landing beach was cleared while of neighbouring beaches were also cleared as part of deception operations early on 1 july convoy reached assembly area about south east of klandasan after which a heavy naval and aerial bombardment concentrated on beaches around klandasan a total of 63 liberator bombers as well as five cruisers and 14 destroyers were committed to this action a total of 17 250 shells were expended by naval bombardment group in this effort meanwhile assault troops aboard nine tank landing ships lsts made for transport area where they were transferred to smaller landing craft including alligator tracked landing vehicles lvts dukws and lcvps these craft were crewed by us personnel mainly from 672nd and 727th amphibian tractor battalions and 593rd engineer boat and shore regiment under cover of bombardment they began their run to shore in several waves when they were from shore naval bombardment ceased ramps came down on landing craft as they hit beaches just before 9 00 am landing was carried out on a two brigade front 18th brigade s 2 10th and 2 12th battalions landed on left at red and yellow beaches while 21st brigade s 2 27th battalion landed on right at green beach division s third brigade remained embarked initially to act as a floating reserve assaulting troops were landed at wrong place due to obscuration of key features ashore as a result of pre landing bombardment and a failure to clear all of beach obstacles as a result two of three assault battalions landed too far left and troops from each battalion became mixed up with others causing some confusion despite this landing was unopposed apart of a small volume of fire and within 15 to 20 minutes assault troops had established a beachhead landing force suffered no casualties during this first part of operation thumb members of australian 2 12th infantry battalion advancing past oil fires at balikpapan after beach maintenance area was secured 18th brigade was tasked with capturing high features north of klandasan which blocked advance towards balikpapan town while 21st brigade was tasked with advancing along coast road to capture airfields at sepinggang and manggar during fighting around klandasan 2 10th battalion attacked a feature dubbed parramatta ridge which was strongly fortified with pillboxes tunnels land mines and booby traps due to a last minute diversion and communications issues battalion s fire support was unavailable and tanks that had been assigned to support them broke down nevertheless battalion s commanding officer lieutenant colonel tom daly pressed home attack despite likely heavy casualties initial infantry assault on hill 87 was launched throughout morning and stalled as japanese resistance grew australians became pinned below summit and just before noon two supporting tanks from 1st armoured regiment came forward suppressing japanese fire and assisting infantry to capture position by 12 40 pm after this indirect fire support except for divisional machine guns was restored japanese fire from neighbouring positions was suppressed enabling a company assault on final objective by 2 00 pm australians had captured parramatta meanwhile 21st brigade came up against heavy resistance after initially advancing against only desultory artillery and mortar fire australian ground troops were lavishly provided with direct and indirect fire support potentially more so than in any other australian campaign during war and with help of tanks flame throwers mortars and other fire support by end of first day australians had extended their beachhead work of marking out beaches and organising troops as they arrived on beach as well as controlling unloading of stores was undertaken by a specially trained unit 2nd beach group which landed in second wave shortly after landing it was found that lsts could not land their stores over beaches as a result dukws were used instead to offload stores and land them fighting for high ground around klandasan continued throughout 2 july where japanese largely from 2nd garrison force and elements of 454th independent infantry battalion resisted strongly during which australian engineers worked to destroy large numbers of japanese tunnels as well as neutralising thousands of land mines and booby traps 25th brigade landed at this time while 21st brigade pushed further eastwards with engineers supporting multiple river crossings 2 14th battalion captured sepinggang airfield using indirect fire support as much as possible to minimise their own casualties while 2 27th battalion secured area around stalkoedo and 2 16th battalion also took several features next day 25th brigade relieved 18th while 18th secured balikpapan town and its harbour 25th brigade advanced inland along milford highway by end of day australian beachhead had been extended out to and 21st brigade had reached manggar airfield elements of japanese 454th independent infantry battalion occupied strong positions in high ground overlooking field and were able to call down heavy concentrations of mortar and artillery fire australians captured airfield on 4 july but were held up for several days after coming up against japanese artillery and mortar fire tanks were landed around manggar besar river but two were knocked out by japanese fire naval and air support was called in and over course of several days gun positions were captured thumb 300px left movement of australian infantry battalions 1 5 july 1945 after landing 25th brigade assumed a holding role in centre of allied beachhead until 3 july when it took over from 18th brigade who went into reserve but remained around balikpapan town to continue mopping up operations there 25th brigade then began pushing inland from urban area towards batuchampar from initial landing beaches on 5 july 2 9th battalion and 2 1st pioneer battalion supported by elements of 2 7th cavalry commando regiment as well as artillery and tanks were landed at panadjam by lvts and lcms to clear western shore of japanese artillery prior to allies opening port 2 9th sent patrols to and river before continuing down riko river and landing another patrol that exploited inland towards river meanwhile 2 1st pioneers landed at several spots including and before advancing overland to japanese opposition was limited and area around panadjam was cleared within two days however heavy fighting took place along milford highway on 5 6 july as part of a japanese battalion attempted to block australian advance on batuchampar japanese employed a variety of delaying tactics to slow australians using thick jungle to their advantage australians brought up tanks equipped with flamethrowers and called in a heavy artillery barrage to clear firmly entrenched defenders over 8 000 rounds were expended in this effort by 9 july two forward japanese battalions had largely been destroyed and remnants were withdrawing from east coast 21st brigade continued their advance towards sambodja patrols also ranged towards milford highway to established contact with 25th brigade japanese commander kamada had established his headquarters around batuchampar by this time and japanese rearguard began withdrawing back to main defensive position inland at batuchampar where kamada s third battalion was digging in meanwhile landing beaches were improved with construction of a several docks by us 11th naval construction battalion to enable two lsts to be unloaded at a time on 10 july allies opened another beach designated brown beach around southern part of bay protected waters there greatly increased amount of supplies that could be brought in allowing eight lsts to dock at same time thumb advance by a matilda frog flame thrower tank of australian 4th armoured brigade in support of soldiers of australian 2 10th infantry battalion over course of a fortnight allied artillery and aircraft worked to reduce japanese position along milford highway while 25th brigade felt for japanese flanks attempting to encircle them meanwhile patrols from 2 7th cavalry commando regiment and knil company were sent along flanks and to remote areas to gather intelligence by 21 july encirclement of japanese defensive position was almost complete and surviving japanese began to withdraw this withdrawal was conducted in good order and australians noted skill and determination with which japanese sited and held their defensive positions during this time australians assessed that japanese would seek to establish a new defensive position around samarinda but australian commander milford determined that strategic situation did not require attacking this position following this australians began deep patrolling operations 2 27th battalion advanced along vasey highway ranging as far as sambodja aftermath major operations had ceased by 21 july when japanese abandoned batuchampar and manggar although small scale clashes continued until end of war majority of japanese withdrew north east before eventually turning west and marching across island to kuching or to bandjermasin however troops from 22nd special base force attempted to break into port facilities around balikpapan in august from western side of bay and several minor actions were fought during this time 7th division s casualties were significantly lighter than they had suffered in previous campaigns a total of 229 australians were killed and 634 wounded while at least 2 032 japanese were killed and another 63 captured operation to secure balikpapan was australia s largest and last amphibious operation of war battle was one of last to occur in world war ii beginning a few weeks before bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and soviet invasion of manchuria effectively ended war japan surrendered while australians were combing jungle for stragglers in this regard and in light of strategic situation which had effectively negated many of allies stated reasons for operation historians such as rhys crawley and david horner have assessed that operation did not affect course of war and was strategically dubious pratten argues that cancellation of allied operations to secure java negated need for operation and concludes that decision to continue with operation was potentially influenced by perceived importance of balikpapan s oil facilities thumb left burning oil refineries at balikpapan despite early capture of airfields at sepinggang and manggar it was not until 15 july that first raaf spitfire fighters began operating and ultimately airfields could not be used for bombing operations additionally much of port area and oil producing facilities were heavily damaged by pre invasion bombardment and by japanese sabotage efforts rendering them useless to allies in short term politically damage inflicted on infrastructure strained relationship between australians and returning netherlands east indies government additionally oilfields that supplied damaged refineries those around sambodja and sangasanga remained in japanese hands until end of war thereby negating what little benefit allies gained in securing refineries due to limited strategic reasons for operation horner argues that operation was undertaken largely for political reasons as macarthur wished to show dutch government that he had attempted to recover part of its territory but ultimately it did not effect outcome of war nevertheless historian peter dennis concludes that operation was of doubtful value strategically but that tactically it was skilfully conducted a key element of success of operation from australian perspective was logistic support provided by us particularly in relation to shipping that was required to transport vast amounts of troops stores and equipment for operation in comparison with concurrent operations australian first army were fighting in new guinea at same time particularly around aitape wewak i australian corps operations in borneo received considerably more resources in terms of air and naval support and transportation following japanese surrender three australian brigades were committed to occupation duties until around february 1946 21st brigade was detached to makassar in celebes islands to accept surrender of japanese forces release prisoners of war and maintain civil order 25th brigade detached elements to occupy samarinda bandjermasin and pontianak references bibliography further reading external links british pathe
