his strong form by posting fastest lap of 2 minutes and 12 894 seconds tsukakoshi ended session second fastest and was 0 038 seconds slower than asmer jarvis ran consistently near top of time sheets for majority of practice and finished in third mortara oshima grosjean buemi streit jelley and van dam occupied positions four to ten although no red flags were necessitated during session several

itself qualifying race to set grid order for main race started on 17 november at 13 20 macau standard time utc 08 00 weather conditions at start of qualifying race were dry and sunny with an air temperature of and a track temperature at kobayashi failed to take start because he stalled in his grid slot on grid pole position starter jarvis made a brisk getaway but asmer despite initial fears he would lose grip of his clutch accelerated quicker off line and progressed to lead heading towards mandarin bend further back separate crashes involving multiple cars prompted deployment of safety car mortara had a slow getaway and then made contact with buemi at lisboa corner and tsukakoshi was caught up in melee tsukakoshi survived impact and rejoined race but grosjean picked up a puncture this caused senna to swerve in avoidance grosjean drove slowly to pit lane for a replacement wheel but consequently lost a lap to asmer incident enabled to bird to gain ten positions to run in fifth and oshima was now sixth but guerrieri s race ended early when he crashed as well cheong and lei went into pit lane for debris removal and a replacement front wing respectively safety car was withdrawn after three laps and racing resumed with asmer leading field back up to speed jarvis remained close by as he hoped to overtake on following lap at lisboa corner as van der zande crossed start finish line to continue racing he attempted to pass kennard van der zande could not get past and drifted into wall at lisboa turn while kennard resumed without trouble ho then made a pit stop and retired soon after on fifth lap jarvis slipstreamed onto back of asmer heading down main straight and passed him for lead around outside at lisboa corner two laps later senna found his way past hulkenberg and started to close gap to hulkenberg then tried to line up a pass on senna to reclaim position but lost control of his car and glanced a barrier lining track at mandarin bend corner both he and senna were forced into retirement localised yellow flags were waved which neutralised racing in that section of circuit because debris was scattered across tarmac surface none of these issues bothered jarvis who at this point established a small but healthy advantage over asmer who in turn maintained a comfortable margin over oshima jakes and buurman followed in next two places as field began penultimate lap mustonen pushed hard but this meant he clouted an outside tyre barrier at fisherman s bend removing both his rear wheels his car was stranded in centre of track result of mustonen s accident ended qualifying race prematurely and race result was counted back two laps this gave jarvis victory and pole position for grand prix itself he was joined on front row by asmer oshima completed podium in third position ahead of british duo of jakes and bird buurman jelley streit tsukakoshi and breen completed in next five places outside top ten kennard hartley mailleux mustonen van dam grubmuller avila izawa merszei senna hulkenberg and grosjean rounded out top twenty two classified finishers warm up a twenty minute warm up session was held on morning of main race

his qualification race crash previous day and was forced to withdraw from remainder of race meeting after he was transported to hospital for precautionary checks which revealed his injury main race race began on 18 november at 15 35 local time conditions on grid at start of race were dry and cloudy with an air temperature of and an track temperature at when grand prix started from its standing start jarvis ran with little wing angle to give him an advantage in highland part of circuit this enabled him to make a fast getaway and maintain his pole position advantage heading into first corner asmer briefly drew alongside jarvis off line but fell to fourth behind oshima and bird soon after oshima attempted to overtake jarvis but latter fended him off and oshima was forced to ease off accelerator pedal first retirement of race came on first lap when buurman tried to gain ground but could not get any further than san francisco bend with three wheels attached to his vehicle on lap two breen became second driver to withdraw from grand prix as he was hit from behind by another driver this put him into tyre wall lining circuit upfront jarvis steadily opened up an advantage over oshima asmer ran in slipstream of bird s car heading down main straight and he retook third position from him in braking zone for lisboa corner at start on lap oshima s advantage over asmer had been reduced before oshima responded by increasing his pace to draw slightly closer to jarvis on next lap further down field jelley lost a place to tsukakoshi and streit overtook jakes as latter was pushing hard in early laps of grand prix streit then gained another place with an pass on jelley while jakes lost one further position when mailleux overtook him grosjean also progressed through field and was at this point in 14th place passing grubmuller without heavy resistance streit overtook bird on lap three while grosjean gained further ground with an overtake on mustonen soon after mustonen clouted a barrier at solitude corner and was forced into pit lane for repairs before retiring buemi and kobayashi recovered from starting at rear of grid with buemi in 14th with successive overtakes on grubmuller and mustonen meanwhile hartley moved into top ten by with a pass on kennard grosjean s faster top speed enabled him to pass van dam for 12th asmer set a new official lap record of guia

was stranded in a dangerous position safety car remained on track for three laps until it was withdrawn at start of lap eleven jarvis maintained lead at restart oshima tried to pass jarvis but became aware his tyres were too cold tsukakoshi overtook asmer for final podium position heading towards mandarin bend and immediately set about on capitalising on oshima s error grosjean made best restart in field and moved to eighth place kennard became race s final retirement when he went into a barrier at lisboa corner possibly caused by him being caught off guard by his cold tyres tsukakoshi got a run on oshima heading towards lisboa corner and executed a successful lunge on outside line to claim second from his fellow countryman tsukakoshi then set himself after jarvis while mortara overtook hartley to move into top ten however jarvis maintained first position for rest of event to win grand prix and led all of laps contested in main race tsukakoshi finished 1 7 seconds adrift in second while fellow japanese driver oshima took third off podium asmer could not catch oshima and settled for fourth streit and bird were close behind each other in fifth and sixth with jakes seventh top ten
