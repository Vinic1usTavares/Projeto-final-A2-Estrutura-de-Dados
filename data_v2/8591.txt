intelligence that could either be used to maintain peace between u s and japan or get information out of japan in case of war this plan became known as m plan named after mashbir zacharias p 53 his undisclosed activities working for naval attache did not sit well with his superiors however in order to establish a network of foreign businessmen in japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war it was suggested by his commander colonel burnett that mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in tokyo himself in order to put m plan in effect consequently

prejudicial report based upon erroneous assumptions was delivered on 24 june 1937 colonel mashbir was advised on 25 february 1939 that he was from military intelligence division g2 reserves for

of work on which he was actually engaged mashbir s dismissal and failure to implement an intelligence network such as that suggested in mashbir s m plan has been described as a key factor in united states failure to have more information on japan before attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 thumb 1937 japan group photo with prince tokugawa and colonel sidney mashbir and others after
