after stone they are best friends and their friendship symbolically intended to reflect parker and stone s friendship is a common topic throughout series eric cartman usually nicknamed by his surname only is loud obnoxious and amoral often portrayed as an antagonist his anti semitic attitude has resulted in a progressive rivalry with kyle although deeper reason is strong clash between kyle s strong morality and cartman s complete lack of such kenny who comes from a poor family wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most of his face and muffles his speech during show s first five seasons kenny would die in nearly every episode before returning in next with little to no definitive explanation given he was written out of show s sixth season in 2002 re appearing in season finale since then kenny s death has been seldom used by show s creators during show s first 58 episodes boys were in third grade in season four episode 4th grade 2000 they entered fourth grade and have remained there ever since plots are often set in motion by events ranging from fairly typical to supernatural and extraordinary which frequently happen in town boys often act as voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among adult populace who are customarily depicted as irrational gullible and prone to boys are also frequently confused by contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society themes and style each episode opens with a tongue in cheek all persons fictitious disclaimer all characters and events in this show even those based on real people are entirely fictional all celebrity voices are impersonated poorly following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone south park was first weekly program to be rated tv ma and is generally intended for adult audiences boys and most other child

south park commonly makes use of carnivalesque and absurdist techniques numerous running gags violence sexual content offhand pop cultural references and satirical portrayal of celebrities early episodes tended to be shock value oriented and featured more slapstick style humor while social satire had been used on show occasionally earlier on it became more prevalent as series progressed with show retaining some of its focus on boys fondness of scatological humor in an attempt to remind adult viewers what it was like to be eight years old parker and stone also began further developing other characters by giving them larger roles in certain storylines and began writing plots as parables based on religion politics and numerous other topics this provided opportunity for show to spoof both extreme sides of contentious issues while lampooning both liberal and conservative points of view parker and stone describe themselves as equal opportunity offenders whose main purpose is to be funny and make people laugh while stating that no particular topic or group of people be exempt from mockery and satire parker and stone insist that show is still more about kids being kids and what it s like to be in elementary school in america stating that introduction of a more satirical element to series was result of two adding more of a moral center to show so that it would rely less on simply being crude and shocking in an attempt to maintain an audience while profane parker notes that there is still an underlying sweetness aspect to child characters and time described boys as sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence usually boys or other characters ponder over what has transpired during an episode and convey important lesson taken from it with a short monologue during earlier seasons this speech would commonly begin with a variation of phrase you know i ve learned something today arp and jacoby p 58 development thumb alt two adult males sitting in chairs with their

referred to as jesus vs frosty and second short as jesus vs santa graden sent copies of video to several of his friends and from there it was copied and distributed including on internet where it became one of first viral videos as jesus vs santa became more popular parker and stone began talks of developing short into a television series that centered around four children residing in fictional colorado town of south park fox eagerly agreed to meet with duo about show s premise having pride itself with edgier products such as cops simpsons and x files however during meeting at fox office in century city disagreements between two creators and network began to arise mainly over latter s refusal to air a show that included a supporting talking stool character named mr hankey some executives at 20th century fox television which was to produce series agreed with its sister network s stance on mr hankey and repeatedly requested parker and stone to remove character in order for show to proceed refusing to their demands duo cut ties with fox and its sister companies all together and began shipping series somewhere else two then entered negotiations with both mtv and comedy

debuted with cartman gets an anal probe on august 13 1997 production except for pilot episode which was produced using cutout animation all episodes of south park are created with use of software

themselves in creative process which they feel results in a funnier show schedule also allows south park to both stay more topical and respond more quickly to specific current events than other
