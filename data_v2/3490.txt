thumb ice auger showing an ice core pushed up into core remover barrel 1954 pp 4 6 ice drilling allows scientists studying glaciers and ice sheets to gain access to what is beneath ice to take measurements along interior of ice and to retrieve samples instruments can be placed in drilled holes to record temperature pressure speed direction of movement and for other scientific research such as neutrino detection many different methods have been used since 1840 when first scientific ice drilling expedition attempted to drill through unteraargletscher in alps two early methods were percussion in which ice is fractured and pulverized and rotary drilling a method often used in mineral exploration for rock drilling in 1940s thermal drills began to be used these drills melt ice by heating drill drills that use jets of hot water or steam to bore through ice soon followed a growing interest in ice cores used for research led to ice coring drills being developed in 1950s and 1960s and there are now many different coring drills in use for obtaining ice cores from deep holes most investigators use cable suspended electromechanical drills which use an armoured cable to carry electrical power to a mechanical drill at bottom of borehole in 1966 a us team successfully drilled through greenland ice sheet at camp century at a depth of since then many other groups have succeeded in reaching bedrock through two largest ice sheets in greenland and antarctica recent projects have focused on finding drilling locations that will give scientists access to very old undisturbed ice at bottom of borehole since an undisturbed stratigraphic sequence is required to accurately date information obtained from ice goals of ice drilling first scientific ice drilling expeditions led by louis agassiz from 1840 to 1842 had three goals to prove that glaciers flowed clarke 1987 pp 4 5 to measure internal temperature of a glacier at different depths clarke 1987 pp 11 12 and to measure thickness of a glacier 1844 pp 292 293 proof of glacier motion was achieved by placing stakes in holes drilled in a glacier and tracking their motion from surrounding mountain drilling through glaciers to determine their thickness and to test theories of glacier motion and structure continued to be of interest for some time blumcke hess 1910 pp 66 70 but glacier thickness has been measured by seismographic techniques since 1920s 1951 p 313 barry gan 2011 pp 85 86 although it is no longer necessary to drill through a glacier to determine its thickness scientists still drill shot holes in ice for these seismic studies bentley et al 2009 p 222 temperature measurements continue to this day modelling behaviour of glaciers requires an understanding of their internal temperature and in ice sheets borehole temperature at different depths can provide information about past climates alley 2000 pp 65 67 other instruments may be lowered into borehole such as to measure pressure within ice iken et al 1976 p 143 or cameras to allow a visual review of stratigraphy hubbard glasser 2005 p 126 icecube a large astrophysical project required numerous optical sensors to be placed in holes 2 5 km deep drilled at south pole benson et al 2014 p 105 borehole inclination and change in inclination over time can be measured in a cased hole a hole in which a hollow pipe has been placed as a liner to keep hole open this allows three dimensional position of borehole to be mapped periodically revealing movement of glacier not only at surface but throughout its thickness sharp 1953 p 182 to understand whether a glacier is shrinking or growing its mass balance must be measured this is net effect of gains from fresh snow minus losses from melting and sublimation a straightforward way to determine these effects across surface of a glacier is to plant stakes known as ablation stakes in holes drilled in glacier s surface and monitor them over time to see if more snow is accumulating burying stake or if more and more of stake is visible as snow around it disappears knight 1999 pp 34 35 discovery of layers of aqueous water and of several hundred mapped subglacial lakes beneath antarctic ice sheet led to speculation about existence of unique microbial environments that had been isolated from rest of biosphere potentially for millions of years these environments can be investigated by drilling national research council of national academies 2007 p 1 talalay 2016 p 2 thumb center upright 3 part of gisp2 ice core from 1837 1838 meters deep in which annual layers are visible core was drilled in early 1990s and this picture covers some 38 years of accumulated ice which dates from about 16 250 years ago ice cores are one of most important motivations for drilling in ice since ice cores retain environmental information about time ice in them fell as snow they are useful in reconstructing past climates and ice core analysis includes studies of isotopic composition mechanical properties dissolved impurities and dust trapped atmospheric samples and trace radionuclides data from ice cores can be used to determine past variations in solar activity bradley 2015 p 138 and is important in construction of marine isotope stages one of key palaeoclimatic dating tools hay 2015 p 676 ice cores can also provide information about glacier flow and accumulation rates knight 1999 pp 206 208 international partnership in ice core sciences maintains a list of key goals for ice core research currently these are to obtain a 1 5 million year old core obtain a complete record of last interglacial period use ice cores to assist with understanding of climate change over long time scales obtain a detailed spatial array of ice core climate data for last 2 000 years and continue development of advanced ice core drilling technology drilling design considerations constraints on ice drill designs can be divided into following broad categories ice removal method and project logistics ice must be cut through broken up or melted tools can be directly pushed into snow and firn snow that is compressed but not yet turned to ice which typically happens at a depth of to alley 2000 pp 48 50 this method is not effective in ice but it is perfectly adequate for obtaining samples from uppermost layers for ice two options are percussion drilling and rotary drilling percussion drilling uses a sharp tool such as a chisel which strikes ice to fracture and fragment it talalay 2016 pp 53 56 more common are rotary cutting tools which have a rotating blade or set of blades at bottom of borehole to cut away ice for small tools rotation can be provided by hand using a t handle or a carpenter s brace some tools can also be set up to make use of ordinary household power drills or they may include a motor to drive rotation if torque is supplied from surface then entire drill string must be rigid so that it can be rotated but it is also possible to place a motor just above bottom of drill string and have it supply power directly to drill bit talalay 2016 pp 6 7 if ice is to be melted instead of cut then heat must be generated an electrical heater built into drill string can heat ice directly or it can heat material it is embedded in which in turn heats ice heat can also be sent down drill string hot water or steam pumped down from surface can be used to heat a metal drillhead or water or steam can be allowed to emerge from drillhead and melt ice directly in at least one case a drilling project experimented with heating drillhead on surface and then lowering it into hole many ice drilling locations are very difficult to access and drills must be designed so that they can be transported to drill site talalay 2016 p 97 equipment should be as light and portable as possible it is helpful if equipment can be broken down so that individual components can be carried separately thus reducing burden for hand carrying if required talalay 2016 pp 169 170 fuel for steam or hot water drills or for a generator to provide power must also be transported and this weight has to be taken into account as well cuttings and meltwater thumb mechanical ice auger showing cutting teeth helical flights used to transport ice cuttings up away from cutting region and a central void for core itself mechanical drilling produces pieces of ice either as cuttings or as granular fragments which must be removed from bottom of hole to prevent them from interfering with cutting or action of drill an auger used as cutting tool will naturally move ice cuttings up its helical flights if drill s action leaves ice chips on top of drill they can be removed by simply raising drill to surface periodically if not they can be brought to surface by lowering a tool to scoop them up or hole can be kept full of water in which case cuttings will naturally float to top of hole if chips are not removed they must be compacted into walls of borehole and into core if a core is being retrieved mellor sellmann 1976 pp 81 82 cuttings can also be moved to surface by circulating compressed air through hole either by pumping air through drillpipe and out at drillhead forcing chips up in space between drill string and borehole wall or by reverse air circulation in which air flows up through drill string compressed air will be heated by compression and it must be cooled before being pumped downhole or it will cause melting of borehole walls and core talalay 2016 p 72 if air is circulated by creating a vacuum rather than pumping air in ambient air carries cuttings so no cooling is needed talalay 2016 p 107 a fluid can be used to circulate cuttings away from bit or fluid may be able to dissolve cuttings rotary mineral drilling through rock typically circulates fluid through entire hole and separates solids from fluid at surface before pumping fluid back down in deep ice drilling it is usual to circulate fluid only at bottom of hole collecting cuttings in a chamber that is part of downhole assembly for a coring drill cuttings chamber can be emptied each time drill is brought to surface to retrieve a core thermal drills will produce water so there are no cuttings to dispose of but drill must be capable of working while submerged in water or else drill must have a method of removing and storing meltwater while drilling zagorodnov thompson 2014 pp 322 325 drill string logistics drilling mechanism must be connected to surface and there must be a method of raising and lowering drill mellor sellmann 1976 pp 90 92 if drill string consists of pipes or rods that have to be screwed together or otherwise assembled as hole gets deeper and drill string lengthens then there must be a way to hold drill string in place as each length of rod or pipe is added or removed if hole is only a few metres deep no mechanical assistance may be necessary but drill strings can get very heavy for deep holes and a winch or other hoisting system must be in place that is capable of lifting and lowering it a trip in drilling refers to task of pulling a drill string completely out of hole tripping out and then reinserting it back into hole tripping in tripping time is time taken to trip in and out of hole it is important for a drill design to minimize tripping time particularly for coring drills since they must complete a trip for each core sheldon et al 2014 pp 260 261 borehole stability and permeability overburden pressure in a deep hole from weight of ice above will cause a borehole to slowly close up unless something is done to counteract it so deep holes are filled with a drilling fluid that is about same density as surrounding ice such as jet fuel or kerosene fluid must have low viscosity to reduce tripping time since retrieval of each segment of core requires a trip a slower speed of travel through drilling fluid could add significant time to a project a year or more for a deep hole fluid must contaminate ice as little as possible it must have low toxicity for safety and to minimize effect on environment it must be available at a reasonable cost and it must be relatively easy to transport depth at which borehole closure prevents dry drilling is strongly dependent on temperature of ice in a temperate glacier maximum depth might be but in a very cold environment such as parts of east antarctica dry drilling to might be possible bentley et al 2009 p 223 snow and firn are permeable to air water and drilling fluids so any drilling method that requires liquid or compressed air in hole needs to prevent them from escaping into surface layers of snow and firn if fluid is only used in lower part of hole permeability is not an issue alternatively hole can be cased down past point where firn turns to ice if water is used as a drilling fluid in cold enough temperatures it will turn to ice in surrounding snow and firn and seal hole talalay 2014 pp 341 342 power torque antitorque and heat tools can be designed to be rotated by hand via a brace or t handle or a hand crank gearing blumcke hess 1899 pp 33 34 or attached to a hand drill talalay 2016 p 30 drills with powered rotation require an electrical motor at rig site which generally must have fuel though in at least one case a drilling project was set up near enough to a permanent research station to run a cable to research building for power rotation can be applied at surface by a rotary table using a kelly or by a motor in drillhead for cable suspended drills in latter case cable must carry power to drillhead as well as support its weight for rotary drills gearing is required to reduce engine s rotation to a suitable speed for drilling talalay 2016 pp 109 110 if torque is supplied at bottom of hole motor supplying it to drillbit beneath it will have a tendency to rotate around its own axis rather than imparting rotation to drillbit this is because drillbit will have a strong resistance to rotation since it is cutting ice to prevent this an anti torque mechanism of some kind must be provided typically by giving motor some grip against walls of borehole a thermal drill that uses electricity to heat drill head so that it melts ice must bring power down hole just as with rotary drills bird 1976 p 2 if drillhead is heated by pumping water or steam down to bottom of hole then no downhole power is needed but a pump at surface is required for hot water water or steam can be heated at surface by a fuel powered boiler solar power can also be used blake et al 1998 p 175 directional control some drills which are designed to rest on their tip as they drill will lean to one side in borehole and hole they drill will gradually drift towards horizontal unless some method of counteracting this tendency is provided philberth 1972 p 7 for other drills directional control can be useful in starting additional holes at depth for example to retrieve additional ice cores zagorodnov et al 1992 p 1 temperature many glaciers are temperate meaning that they contain warm ice ice that is at melting temperature 0 degc throughout knight 1999 p 2 meltwater in boreholes in warm ice will not refreeze but for colder ice meltwater is likely to cause a problem and may freeze drill in place so thermal drills that operate submerged in meltwater they produce and any drilling method that results in water in borehole are difficult to use in such conditions paterson 1981 p 80 drilling fluids or antifreeze additives to meltwater must be chosen to keep fluid liquid at temperatures found in borehole in warm ice ice tends to form on cutters and drillhead and to pack into spaces at bottom of hole slowing down drilling talalay 2016 pp 266 269 core retrieval to retrieve a core an annulus of ice must be removed from around cylindrical core hubbard glasser 2005 pp 44 46 core should be unbroken which means that vibrations and mechanical shocks must be kept to a minimum and changes in temperature which could cause thermal shock to core must also be avoided talalay 2014 p 345 core must be kept from melting caused by heat generated either mechanically from drilling process cao et al 2015 pp 78 85 from heat of compressed air if air is used as drilling fluid or from a thermal drill and must not be contaminated by drilling fluid when core is about to be retrieved it is still connected to ice beneath it so some method of breaking it at lower end must be provided and of gripping it so it does not fall from core barrel as it is brought to surface which must be done as quickly and safely as possible most coring drills are designed to retrieve cores that are no longer than so drilling must stop each time hole depth is extended by that amount so that core can be retrieved a drill string that must be assembled and disassembled in segments such as pipe sections that must be screwed together takes a long time to trip in and out a cable which can be continuously winched up or a drill string that is flexible enough to be coiled significantly reduces tripping time wireline drills have a mechanism that allows core barrel to be detached from drill head and winched directly to surface without having to trip out drill string once core is removed core barrel is lowered to bottom of hole and reattached to drill brittle ice over a depth range known as brittle ice zone bubbles of air are trapped in ice under great pressure when a core is brought to surface bubbles can exert a stress that exceeds tensile strength of ice resulting in cracks and spall et al 2014 pp 20 21 at greater depths ice crystal structure changes from hexagonal to cubic and air molecules move inside crystals in a structure called a clathrate bubbles disappear and ice becomes stable again uchida et al 1994 p 302 alley 2000 p 50 brittle ice zone typically returns poorer quality samples than for rest of core some steps can be taken to alleviate problem liners can be placed inside drill barrel to enclose core before it is brought to surface but this makes it difficult to clean off drilling fluid in mineral drilling special machinery can bring core samples to surface at bottom hole pressure but this is too expensive for inaccessible locations of most drilling sites keeping processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks cores are most brittle at surface so another approach is to break them into 1 m lengths in hole extruding core from drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at drill site for some time up to a full year between drilling seasons to let ice gradually relax talalay 2016 pp 265 266 core quality in brittle ice zone is much improved when a drilling fluid is used as opposed to dry hole drilling zagorodnov et al 1998 p 190 percussion drills a percussion drill penetrates ice by repeatedly striking it to fracture and fragment it cutting tool is mounted at bottom of drill string typically connected metal rods and some means of giving it kinetic energy must be provided a tripod erected over hole allows a pulley to be set up and a cable can then be used to repeatedly raise and drop tool this method is known as cable tool drilling a weight repeatedly dropped on to a rigid drill string can also be used to provide necessary impetus pulverized ice collects at bottom of borehole and must be removed it can be collected with a tool capable of scooping it from bottom of hole or hole can be kept full of water so that ice floats to top of hole though this retards momentum of drill striking ice reducing its effectiveness 1898 pp 190 193 a percussion drilling tool that is not mechanically driven requires some method of raising drill so it can be released to fall on ice to do this efficiently with manual labour it is usual to set up a tripod or other supporting scaffold and a pulley to allow drill string to be raised by a rope this arrangement known as a cable tool rig can also be used for mechanical drilling with a motor raising drill string and allowing it to fall an alternative approach is to leave drill string at bottom of borehole and to raise and let fall a hammer weight onto drill string earliest scientific ice drilling expedition used percussion drilling louis agassiz used iron rods to drill holes in unteraargletscher in alps in summer of 1840 cable tool rigs have been used for ice drilling in more recent times soviet expeditions in 1960s drilled with cable tool rigs in caucasus and tien shan range and us projects have drilled on blue glacier in washington between 1969 and 1976 and on black rapids glacier in alaska in 2002 two other percussion methods have been tried pneumatic drills have been used to drill shallow holes in ice in order to set blast charges and rotary percussion drills a type of drilling tool once in common use in mining industry have also been used for drilling blasting holes but neither approach has been used for scientific investigations of ice percussion drilling is now rarely used for scientific ice drilling having been overtaken by more effective techniques for both ice and mineral drilling hand operated mechanical drills spoon borers a soil sampling auger contains a pair of blades at bottom of an enclosed cylinder it can be driven and rotated by hand to pick up soft soil a similar design called a spoon borer has been used for ice drilling though it is not effective in hard ice von drygalski 1904 pp 283 284 a version used by erich von drygalski in 1902 had two half moon cutting blades set into base of cylinder in such a way as to allow ice cuttings to accumulate in cylinder above blades talalay 2016 p 9 noncoring augers thumb 260x260px ice auger with offset brace handle augers have long been used for drilling through ice for ice fishing augers can be rotated by hand using a mechanism such as a t handle or a brace bit or by attaching them to powered hand drills talalay 2016 pp 31 33 scientific uses for non coring augers include sensor installation and determining ice thickness augers have a helical screw blade around main drilling axis this blade called flighting carries ice cuttings up from bottom of hole talalay 2016 p 27 28 for drilling deeper holes extensions can be added to auger but as auger gets longer it becomes more difficult to rotate with a platform such as a stepladder a longer auger can be rotated from higher off ground commercially available ice augers for winter fishing powered by petrol propane or battery power are available for hole diameters from 4 5 in to 10 in for holes deeper than 2 m a tripod can be used to winch auger from hole a folding brace handle with an offset design is common this allows both hands to contribute to torque coring augers left thumb 239x239px coring ice auger with no barrel designs like this proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid augers that are capable of retrieving ice cores are similar to noncoring augers except that flights are set around a hollow core barrel augers have been devised that consist of helical cutting blades and a space for a core without central supporting cylinder but they are difficult to make sufficiently rigid coring augers typically produce cores with diameters in range 75 100 mm and with lengths up to 1 m coring augers were originally designed to be manually rotated but over time they have been adapted for use with handheld drills or small engines as with noncoring augers extensions can be added to drill deeper drilling deeper than 6 m requires more than one person because of weight of drill string a clamp placed at surface is useful for supporting string and a tripod and block and tackle can also be used for support and to increase weight of string that can be handled as drill string gets longer it takes more time to complete a trip to extract a core since each extension rod must be separated from drill string when tripping out and re attached when tripping in drilling with a tripod or other method of handling a long drill string considerably extends depth limit for use of a coring auger deepest hole drilled by hand with an auger was 55 m in ward hunt ice shelf on ellesmere island in 1960 usually a hole deeper than 30 m will be drilled with other methods because of weight of drill string and long trip time required modern coring augers have changed little in decades an ice coring auger patented in us in 1932 closely resembles coring augers in use eighty years later us military s frost effects laboratory fel developed an ice mechanics testing kit that included a coring auger in late 1940s snow ice and permafrost research establishment sipre a successor organization refined design in early 1950s and resulting auger known as sipre auger is still in wide use it was modified slightly by cold regions research and engineering laboratory crrel another successor organization in 1960s and is sometimes known as crrel auger for that reason talalay 2016 pp 37 39 an auger developed in 1970s by polar ice core office pico then based in lincoln nebraska is also still widely used talalay 2016 pp 40 41 a coring auger designed at university of copenhagen in 1980s was used for first time at camp century and since then has been frequently used in greenland talalay 2016 pp 42 43 in 2009 us ice drilling design and operations group iddo began work on an improved hand auger design and a version was successfully tested in field during 2012 2013 field season at wais divide goetz 2013 p 66 talalay 2016 pp 45 46 as of 2017 iddo maintains both 3 inch and 4 inch diameter versions of new auger for use of us ice drilling research programs and these are now most requested hand augers provided by iddo anonymous 2017 p 8 prairie dog auger designed in 2007 adds an outer barrel to basic coring auger design cuttings are captured between auger flights and outer barrel which has an anti torque section to prevent it from rotating in hole talalay 2016 pp 43 44 goal of outer barrel is to increase efficiency of chip collection since it is common to see chips from a hand auger run fall back into hole from auger flights which means next run has to through these cuttings mcconnell 2007 p 99 outer barrel also makes auger effective in warm ice which could easily cause an auger with no outer barrel to jam outside barrel of prairie dog is same as diameter of pico auger and since prairie dog s anti torque blades do not perform well in soft snow and firn it is common to start a hole with pico auger and then continue it with prairie dog once dense firn is reached bentley et al 2009 pp 258 259 prairie dog is relatively heavy and can require two drillers to handle it as it is being removed from hole iddo maintains a prairie dog drill for use of us ice drilling research programs anonymous 30 june 2017 ice drilling design and operations long range technology plan p 10 iddo also provides a lifting system for use with hand augers known as sidewinder it is driven by an electric hand drill which can be powered by a generator or by solar cells bentley et al 2009 p 259 sidewinder winds a rope around hand auger as it is lowered into hole and assists in raising auger back out of hole this extends maximum practical depth for hand to about 40 m sidewinders have proved popular with researchers anonymous 30 june 2017 ice drilling design and operations long range technology plan p 9 talalay 2016 p 44 piston drills a piston drill consists of a flat disc at bottom of a long rod with three or four radial slots in disc each of which has a cutting edge rod is rotated by hand using a brace handle ice comes through slots and piles up on top of disc pulling drill out of borehole brings cuttings up on disc in 1940s some patents for piston drill designs were filed in sweden and u s but these drills are now rarely used they are less efficient than auger drills since drill must be periodically removed from hole to get rid of cuttings talalay 2016 p 34 35 talalay 2016 p 50 hand core drills and mini drills some hand drills have been designed to retrieve cores without using auger flights to transport cuttings up hole these drills typically have a core barrel with teeth at lower end and are rotated by a brace or t handle or by a small engine barrel itself can be omitted so that drill consists only of a ring with a cutting slot to cut annulus around core and a vertical rod to attach ring to surface a couple of small hand held drills or mini drills have been designed to quickly collect core samples up to 50 cm long a difficulty with all these designs is that as soon as cuttings are generated if they are not removed they will interfere with cutting action of drill making these tools slow and inefficient in use talalay 2016 pp 45 51 a very small drill known as chipmunk drill was designed by iddo for use by a project in west greenland in 2003 and 2004 and was subsequently used at south pole in 2013 anonymous 30 june 2017 ice drilling design and operations long range technology plan p 7 rotary rigs using drillpipe rotary rigs used in mineral drilling use a string of drillpipe connected to a drillbit at bottom of hole and to a rotary mechanism at top of hole such as a top drive or rotary table and kelly as borehole deepens drilling is paused periodically to add a new length of drill pipe at top of drill string these projects have usually been undertaken with commercially available rotary rigs originally designed for mineral drilling with adaptations to suit special needs of ice drilling talalay 2016 pp 59 99 dry drilling when drilling in ice hole may be drilled dry with no mechanism to dispose of cuttings in snow and firn this means that cuttings simply compact into walls of borehole and in coring drills they also compact into core in ice cuttings accumulate in space between drillpipe and borehole wall and eventually start to clog drill bit usually after no more than 1 m of progress this increases torque needed to drill slows down progress and can cause loss of drill dry core drilling generally produces a poor quality core that is broken into pieces talalay 2016 p 59 in 1950 french expedition francaises drilled two dry holes in greenland using a rotary rig at camp vi on west coast and station centrale inland reaching 126 m and 151 m talalay 2016 pp 61 62 some shallow holes were also drilled that summer on baffin island using a coring drill talalay 2016 pp 62 63 and in antarctic norwegian british swedish antarctic expedition drilled several holes between april 1950 and following year eventually reaching 100 m in one hole talalay 2016 p 63 last expedition to try dry drilling in ice was 2nd soviet antarctic expedition sae which drilled three holes between july 1957 and january 1958 talalay 2016 p 64 since that time dry drilling has been abandoned as other drilling methods have proved to be more effective air circulation several holes have been drilled in ice using direct air circulation in which compressed air is pumped down drillpipe to escape through holes in drillbit and return up annular space between drillbit and borehole carrying cuttings with it technique was first tried by 1st soviet antarctic expedition in october 1956 there were problems with poor cuttings removal and ice forming in borehole but drill succeeded in reaching a depth of 86 5 m talalay 2016 p 71 further attempts were made to use air circulation with rotary rigs by us soviet and belgian expeditions with a maximum hole depth of 411 m reached by a us team at site 2 in greenland in 1957 last time a project used a conventional rotary rig with air circulation was 1961 talalay 2016 pp 60 61 fluid circulation in mineral exploration most common drilling method is a rotary rig with fluid circulated down drillpipe and back up between drillpipe and borehole wall fluid carries cuttings to surface where cuttings are removed and recycled fluid known as mud is returned to hole first ice drilling project to try this approach was an american geographical society expedition to taku glacier in 1950 fresh water drawn from glacier was used as drilling fluid and three holes were drilled to a maximum depth of 89 m cores were retrieved but in poor condition talalay 2016 p 77 seawater has also been tried as a drilling fluid talalay 2016 p 79 first time a fluid other than water was used with a conventional rotary rig was in late 1958 at little america v where diesel fuel was used for last few metres of a 254 m hole talalay 2016 p 75 wireline a wireline drill uses air or fluid circulation but also has a tool that can be lowered into drillpipe to retrieve a core without removing drill string tool called an overshot latches onto core barrel and pulls it up to surface when core is removed core barrel is lowered back into borehole and reattached to drill a wireline core drilling project was planned in 1970s for international antarctic glaciological project but was never completed and first wireline ice drilling project took place in 1976 as part of ross ice shelf project risp a hole was started in november of that year with a wireline drill probably using air circulation but problems with overshot forced project to switch to thermal drilling when hole was 103 m deep talalay 2016 pp 80 81 risp project reached over 170 m with another wireline drill following season and several 1980s soviet expedition also used wireline drills after starting holes with an auger drill and casing holes talalay 2016 pp 82 83 agile sub ice geological drill designed by iddo to collect sub glacial cores is a recent wireline system it was first used in field in 2016 2017 season in west antarctica anonymous 30 june 2017 ice drilling design and operations long range technology plan p 19 assessment there are many disadvantages to using conventional rotary rigs for ice drilling when a conventional rotary rig is used for coring entire drill string must be hoisted out of borehole each time core is retrieved each length of pipe in turn must be unscrewed and racked as hole gets deeper this becomes very time consuming conventional rigs are very heavy and since many ice drilling sites are not easily accessible these rigs place a large logistical burden on an ice drilling project for deep holes a drilling fluid is required to maintain pressure in borehole and prevent hole from closing up because of pressure ice is under a drilling fluid requires additional heavy equipment to circulate and store fluid and to separate circulated material any circulation system also requires upper part of hole through snow and firn to be cased since circulated air or fluid would escape through anything more permeable than ice commercial rotary rigs are not designed for extremely cold temperatures and in addition to problems with components such as hydraulics and fluid management systems they are designed to operate outdoors which is impractical in extreme environments such as antarctic drilling talalay 2016 p 97 commercial rotary rigs can be effective for large diameter holes and can also be used for subglacial drilling into rock they have also been used with some success for rock glaciers which are challenging to drill because they contain a heterogeneous mixture of ice and rock talalay 2016 p 88 flexible drillstem rigs flexible drillstem rigs use a drill string that is continuous so that it does not have to be assembled or disassembled rod by rod or pipe by pipe when tripping in or out drill string is also flexible so that when out of borehole it can be stored on a reel drill string may be a reinforced hose or it may be steel or composite pipe in which case it is known as a coiled tubing drill rigs designed along these lines began to appear in 1960s and 1970s in mineral drilling and became commercially viable in 1990s only one such rig rapid air movement ram system developed at university of wisconsin madison by ice coring and drilling services has been used for ice drilling talalay 2016 pp 101 103 ram drill was developed in early 2000s and was originally designed for drilling shot holes for seismic exploration anonymous 30 june 2017 ice drilling design and operations long range technology plan p 18 drill stem is a hose through which air is pumped air drives a turbine that powers a downhole rotary drill bit ice cuttings are removed by exhaust air and fountain out of hole compressor increases temperature of air by about 50deg and it is cooled again before being pumped downhole with a final temperature about 10deg warmer than ambient air this means it cannot be used in ambient temperatures warmer than 10 degc to avoid ice forming in hose ethanol is added to compressed air system which includes a winch to hold 100 m of hose as well as two air compressors is mounted on a sled bentley et al 2009 p 285 it has successfully drilling hundreds of holes in west antarctica and was easily able to drill to 90 m in only 25 minutes making it fastest ice drill it was also used by radio array project in 2010 2011 at south pole but was unable to drill below 63 m there because of variations in local characteristics of ice and firn talalay 2016 p 107 it cannot be used in a fluid filled hole which limits maximum hole depth for this design main problem with ram drill is a loss of air circulation in firn and snow which might be addressed by using reverse air circulation via a vacuum pump drawing air up through hose as of 2017 iddo is planning a revised design for ram drill to reduce weight of drill which is currently 10 3 tonnes other flexible drill stem designs have been considered and in some cases tested but as of 2016 none had been successfully used in field one design suggested using hot water to drill via a hose and replacing drillhead with a mechanical drill for coring once depth of interest is reached using hot water both to hydraulically power down hole motor and to melt resulting ice cuttings talalay 2016 p 103 another design radix drill produces a very narrow hole 20 mm and is intended for rapid drilling access holes it uses a small hydraulic motor on a narrow hose it was tested in 2015 but found to have difficulty with cuttings transport probably because of very narrow space available between hose and borehole wall talalay 2016 pp 104 105 coiled tubing designs have never been successfully used for ice drilling coring operations would be particularly difficult since a coring drill must trip out and in for each core which would lead to fatigue tubing is typically rated for a lifetime of only 100 to 200 trips cable suspended electromechanical drills thumb schematic of cable suspended ice core drilling 2016 p 110 left upright 1 5 a cable suspended drill has a downhole system known as a sonde to drill hole bentley et al 2009 pp 226 227 sonde is connected to surface by an armoured cable which provides power and enables drill to be winched in and out of hole electromechanical em cable suspended drills have a cutting head with blades that shave ice as they rotate like a carpenter s plane depth of penetration of cut is adjusted by a device called a shoe which is part of cutting head ice cuttings are stored in a chamber in sonde either in core barrel above core or in a separate chamber further up drill cuttings can be transported by auger flights or by fluid circulation drills that rely on auger flights and which are not designed to work in a fluid filled hole are limited to depths at which borehole closure is not a problem so these are known as shallow drills deeper holes have to be drilled with drilling fluid but whereas circulation in a rotary drill takes fluid all way down and then up borehole cable suspended drills only need to circulate fluid from drill head up to cuttings chamber this is known as bottom hole circulation upper part of sonde has an antitorque system which most commonly consists of three or four leaf springs that press out against borehole walls sharp edges on leaf springs catch in walls and provide necessary resistance to prevent this part of drill from rotating at point where cable connects to sonde most drills include a slip ring to allow drill to rotate independently of cable this is to prevent torque damage to cable if anti torque system fails coring drills may also have a weight that can be used as a hammer to assist in breaking core and a chamber for any instrumentation or sensors needed at bottom of sonde is cutting head and above this is core barrel with auger flights around it on shallow drills and typically an outer barrel around that usually with internal vertical ribs or some other way of providing additional impetus to upward bound cuttings on flights if there is a separate chip chamber it will be above core barrel motor with suitable gearing is also above core barrel shallow drills can retrieve cores up to 300 350 m deep but core quality is much improved if drilling fluid is present so some shallow drills have been designed to work in wet holes tests reported in 2014 showed that wet drilling with top of drilling fluid no deeper than 250 m would maintain good core quality drilling fluids are necessary for drilling deep holes so cable suspended drills that are used for these projects use a pump to provide fluid circulation in order to remove cuttings from bit a few drills designed for use with drilling fluid also have auger flights on inner barrel as with shallow drills cuttings are stored in a chamber above core circulation can be in either direction down inside of drill string and up between core barrel and borehole wall or in reverse direction which has become favoured approach in drill design as it gives better cuttings removal for a lower flow rate talalay 2016 pp 252 253 drills capable of reaching depths over 1500 m are known as deep drilling systems they have generally similar designs to intermediate systems that can drill from 400 m to 1500 m but must have heavier and more robust systems such as winches and have longer drills and larger drilling shelters core diameters for these drills have varied from 50 mm to 132 mm and core length from as short as 0 35 m up to 6 m a common design feature of these deep drills is that they can be tipped to horizontal to make it easier to remove core and cuttings this reduces required height of mast but requires a deep slot to be cut into ice to make room for sonde to swing up bentley et al 2009 pp 227 228 first cable suspended electromechanical drill was invented by arutunoff for use in mineral drilling it was tested in 1947 in oklahoma but did not perform well talalay 2016 p 179 shoemaker 2002 p 24 crrel acquired a reconditioned arutunoff drill in 1963 hansen 1994 p 7 modified it for drilling in ice and in 1966 used it to extend a hole at camp century in greenland to base of ice cap at 1387 m and 4 m further into bedrock many other drills have since been based on this basic design a recent variation on basic em drill design is rapid access isotope drill designed by british antarctic survey to drill dry holes to 600 m talalay 2014 p 340 this drill does not collect a complete ice core instead it will collect ice cuttings using a cutting head similar to a resulting access hole will be used for temperature profiling and along with isotope results which will indicate age of ice data will be used for modeling ice profile down to bedrock in order to determine best place to drill to obtain oldest possible undisturbed basal ice drill is expected to reach 600 m in 7 days of drilling rather than 2 months which would be needed to drill a core speed is because cutters can be more aggressive as core quality is not an issue and because borehole is narrow which reduces power requirements for winch thermal drills thermal drills work by applying heat to ice at bottom of borehole to melt it thermal drills in general are able to drill successfully in temperate ice where an electromechanical drill is at risk of jamming because of ice forming in borehole when used in colder ice some form of antifreeze is likely to be introduced into borehole to prevent meltwater from freezing in drill hot water and steam drills thumb schematic of a hot water et al 2009 p 263 upright 4 center hot water can be used to drill in ice by pumping it down a hose with a nozzle at end jet of hot water will quickly produce a hole letting hose dangle freely will produce a straight hole as hole gets deeper weight of hose makes this hard to manage manually and at a depth of about 100 m it becomes necessary to run hose over a pulley and enlist some method to help lower and raise hose usually consisting of a hose reel capstan or some type of hose assist iken et al 1976 p 145 since pressure in hose is proportional to square of flow hose diameter is one of limiting factors for a hot water drill to increase flow rate beyond a certain point hose diameter must be increased but this will require significant capacity increases elsewhere in drill design bentley et al 2009 pp 264 265 hoses that are wrapped around a drum before being pressurized will exert constricting force on drum so drums must be of robust design bentley et al 2009 p 272 hoses must wrap neatly when spooling up to avoid damage this can be done manually for smaller systems but for very large drills a level wind system has to be implemented bentley et al 2009 p 273 hose ideally should have tensile strength to support its weight when spooling into hole but for very deep holes a supporting cable may need to be used to support hose bentley et al 2009 p 274 steam can also be used in place of hot water and does not need to be pumped a handheld steam drill is able to rapidly drill short holes for example for ablation stakes and both steam and drills can be made light enough to be hand carried a guide tube can be used to help keep borehole straight in cold ice a borehole drilled with hot water will close up as water freezes to avoid this drill can be run back down hole warming water and hence surrounding ice this is a form of reaming repeated will raise temperature of surrounding ice to point where borehole will stay open for longer periods bentley et al 2009 p 265 however if goal is to measure temperature in borehole then it is better to apply as little additional heat as possible to surrounding ice which means that a higher energy drill with a high water flow rate is desirable since this will be more efficient if there is a risk of drill freezing in a back drill can be included in design this is a mechanism which redirects hot water jet upwards if drill meets with resistance on tripping out bentley et al 2009 p 275 a separate hot water reamer can also be used jetting hot water sideways onto borehole walls as it passes boreholes drilled with hot water are rather irregular which makes them unsuitable for certain kinds of investigations such as speed of borehole closure or measurements warm water from nozzle will continue to melt borehole walls as it rises and this will tend to make hole cone shaped if hole is being drilled at a location with no surface snow or firn such as an ablation zone in a glacier then this effect will persist to top of borehole water supply for a hot water drill can come from water at surface if available or melted snow meltwater in borehole can be reused but this can only be done once hole penetrates below firn to impermeable ice layer because above this level meltwater escapes pump to bring meltwater back to surface must be placed below this level and in addition if there is a chance that borehole will penetrate to base of ice drilling project must plan for likelihood that this will change water level in hole and ensure that pump is below lowest likely level bentley et al 2009 pp 266 267 heating systems are usually adapted from heaters used in pressure washer industry bentley et al 2009 p 271 thumb schematic of a steam drill upright 2 any thermal drilling method is used in dirty ice debris will accumulate at bottom of borehole and start to impede drill enough debris in form of sand pebbles or a large rock could completely stop progress bentley et al 2009 p 267 one way to avoid this is to have a nozzle angled at 45deg using this nozzle will create a side channel into which obstructions will go vertical drilling can then start again bypassing debris another approach is to water at bottom of hole with an electrical heater embedded in drill head and filters in circulation this can remove most of small debris that impedes drillhead rado et al 1987 pp 236 238 a different problem with impure ice comes from contaminants brought in by project such as clothing and wood fibres dust and grit using snow from around campsite to supply drill with water is often necessary at start of drilling as hole will not yet have reached impermeable ice so water cannot be pumped back up from bottom of hole shoveling this snow into drill s water supply will pass these contaminants through drill mechanism and can damage pumps and valves a fine filter is required to avoid these problems bentley et al 2009 p 276 an early expedition using hot water drills was in 1955 to mer de glace electricite de france used hot water to reach base of glacier and also used equipment that sprayed multiple jets simultaneously to create a tunnel under ice reynaud 1962 p 813 more development work was done in 1970s gillet 1975 pp 171 174 hot water drills are now capable of drilling very deep holes and capable of clean access for sub glacial lakes for example between 2012 2019 on wissard salsa project wissard drill a mid sized hot water drill drilled clean access up to 1 km at lake mercer in antarctica and between 2004 and 2011 a large hot water drill at south pole was used to drill 86 holes to a depth of 2 5 km to set strings of sensors in boreholes for icecube project benson et al 2014 p 113 hot water coring drills have also been developed but are susceptible to debris stopping forward motion in dirty ice bentley et al 2009 p 264 an early steam drill was developed by f howorka in early 1960s for work in alps howorka 1965 pp 749 750 steam drills are not used for holes deeper than 30 m as they are quite et al 2009 pp 283 284 due to thermal losses along hose and pressure losses with increasing depth under water rado et al 1987 p 236 they are primarily used for quickly drilling shallow holes hotpoints instead of using a jet of hot water or steam thermal drills can also be constructed to provide heat to a durable drillhead for example by pumping hot water down and back up again inside drill string and use that to melt ice modern thermal drills use electrical power to heat drillhead instead it is possible to drill with a hotpoint that consists of an electrical heating element directly exposed to ice this means that element must be able to work underwater reynaud 1951 p 303 some drills instead embed heating element in a material such as silver or copper that will conduct heat quickly to hotpoint surface shreve 1962 pp 151 152 these can be constructed so that electrical connections are not exposed to water ward 1961 p 537 electrothermal drills require a cable to bring power down hole circuit can be completed via drillpipe if one is present sharp 1951 pp 479 480 a transformer is needed in drill assembly since cable must carry high voltage to avoid power dissipation hansen 1994 pp 5 6 it is more difficult to arrange electrical power at a remote location than to generate heat via a gas boiler so hotpoint drills are only used for boreholes up to a few hundred metres deep bentley et al 2009 p 284 earliest attempt to use heat to drill in ice was in 1904 when c bernard drilling at tete rousse glacier tried using heated iron bars to drill with ends of bars were heated until incandescent and lowered into borehole mercanton 1905 pp 461 462 first true hotpoint was used by mario calciati in 1942 on glacier calciati pumped hot water from surface down drillstem and back up after it had passed through drillhead 1960 p 99 renaud mercanton 1950 pp 67 68 other hotpoint designs have used electrical heating to heat drillhead this was done in 1948 by a british expedition to jungfraujoch gerrard et al 1952 pp 548 551 and by many other drill designs since then hotpoints do not produce cores so they are used primarily for creating access holes electrothermal coring drills thumb three thermal drill designs development in 1960s of thermal coring drills for intermediate depth holes was prompted by problems associated with rotary coring drills which were too costly to use for polar ice cores because of logistical problems caused by their weight bird 1976 p 1 1967 pp 102 104 components of a thermal drill are generally same as for a cable suspended em drill both have a mast and winch and an armoured cable to provide power downhole to a sonde which includes a core barrel no antitorque system is needed for a thermal drill and instead of a motor that provides torque power is used to generate heat in cutting head which is ring shaped to melt an annulus of ice around core some drills may also have a to keep sonde in middle of borehole sonde of an electrothermal drill designed to run submerged in meltwater may consist almost entirely of core barrel plus heated cutting head diagram a in figure to right alternative designs for use in colder ice see diagram b at right may have a compartment above core barrel and tubes that run down to just above cutting head a vacuum pump sucks up meltwater in these drills meltwater must be emptied at surface at end of each coring run another approach see c at right is to use a drilling fluid that is a mixture of ethanol and water with exact proportions determined by ice temperature in these drills there is a piston above core barrel and at start of a run piston is at bottom of sonde and space above is filled with drilling fluid as drills cuts downwards core pushes piston up pumping fluid down and out around cutting head where it mixes with meltwater and prevents it from freezing piston is only moving part which simplifies design and core barrel can take up much of length of sonde whereas drills which suck out meltwater in order to drill in a dry hole have to sacrifice a large section of sonde for meltwater storage zagorodnov thompson 2014 pp 324 325 thermal drills designed for temperate ice are light and straightforward to operate which makes them suitable for use on high altitude glaciers though this also requires that drill can be disassembled into components for human powered transport to most inaccessible locations since helicopters may not be able to reach highest glaciers zagorodnov thompson 2014 p 323 2002 pp 1 2 electrothermal drill designs date back to 1940s an electrothermal drill was patented in switzerland in may 1946 by rene koechlin and was used in switzerland 1951 pp 66 72 koechlin 1946 pp 1 5 terrier 1951 p 255 and in 1948 a british expedition to jungfraujoch drilled to bed of glacier using an electrothermal design twenty electrothermal coring drills were designed between 1964 and 2005 though many designs were abandoned because of higher performance of em coring drills autonomous probes left thumb cryobot design for nasa martian ice cap probe partly built in 2001 if goal is to obtain instrument readings from within ice and there is no need to retrieve either ice or drill system then a probe containing a long spool of cable and a hotpoint can be used hotpoint allows probe to melt its way through ice cable behind it meltwater will refreeze so probe cannot be recovered but it can continue to penetrate ice until it reaches limit of cable it carries and send instrument readings back up through cable to surface known as philberth probes aamot p 321 these devices were designed by karl and bernhard philberth in 1960s as a way to store nuclear waste in antarctic but were never used for that purpose instead they were adapted to use for glaciological research reaching a depth of 1005 metres and sending temperature information back to surface when tested in 1968 as part of expedition internationale au bentley et al 2009 pp 286 287 philberth 1976 p 117 because thermal probes support their weight on ice at bottom of borehole they lean slightly out of vertical and this means they have a natural tendency to stray away from a vertical borehole towards horizontal various methods have been proposed to address this a cone shaped tip with a layer of mercury above tip will cause additional heat transfer to lower side of a slanting borehole increasing speed of melting on that side and returning borehole to vertical philberth 1972 p 10 alternatively probe can be constructed to be supported by ice above its centre of gravity by providing two heating rings one of which is towards top of probe and has a greater diameter than rest of probe giving this upper ring a slightly lower heating power will cause probe to have more bearing pressure on upper ring which will give it a natural tendency to swing back to vertical if borehole starts to deviate effect is called pendulum steering by analogy with tendency of a pendulum always to swing back towards a vertical position aamot 1967 p 1 in 1990s nasa combined philberth probe design with ideas drawn from hot water drills to design a cryobot probe that had hot water jets in addition to a hotpoint nose once probe was submerged in a thin layer of meltwater water was drawn in and reheated emerging at nose as a jet this design was intended to help move particulate matter away from nose as a hot water drill tends to a version with no analytical tools on board was built and field tested in svalbard norway in 2001 it penetrated to 23 m successfully passing through layers of particulates bentley et al 2009 288 289 remain in good thermal contact with surrounding ice throughout their descent and in very cold ice this can drain a substantial fraction of their power budget which is finite since they must carry their power source with them this makes them unsuitable for investigating martian polar ice cap instead nasa added a pump to cryobot design to raise meltwater to surface so that probe known as for subsurface ice probe descends in a dry hole lower gravity on mars means that overburden pressure on ice cap is much less and an open borehole is expected to be stable to a depth of 3 km expected depth of ice cap meltwater can then be analyzed at surface pumping through a vertical tube will cause mixing so to ensure discrete samples for analysis at surface a large bore and a small bore tube are used small bore tube is used for sampling and then its contents are allowed to return to probe and are pumped back up large bore tube for use in experiments that do not depend on stratigraphy such as searches for living organisms leaving analytical instruments on surface reduces necessary size of probe which helps make this design more efficient cardell et al 2004 pp 1 2 along with water transport tubes a heated wire ensures that water stays liquid all way to surface and power and telemetry is also carried from surface to keep hole vertical probe can sense when it is deviating and jets of hot water are adjusted to compensate drill is expected to make use of solar power in operation meaning it must be able to function on less than 100 w when in sunlight a fully built version of probe was successfully tested in greenland in 2006 drilling to a depth of 50 m bentley et al 2009 p 291 nasa has proposed a similar design for drilling in ice on europa a moon of jupiter any such probe would have to survive temperatures of 500 degc while being sterilized to avoid biological contamination of target environment other drill types snow samplers snow samples are taken to measure depth and density of snow pack in a given area measurements of depth and density can be converted into a snow water equivalent swe number which is depth of water that would result from converting snow into water snow samplers are typically hollow cylinders with toothed ends to help them penetrate snow pack they are used by pushing them into snow and then pulling them out along with snow in cylinder talalay 2016 pp 15 16 weighing cylinder full of snow and subtracting weight of empty cylinder gives snow weight samplers usually have lengthwise slots to allow depth of snow to be recorded as well though a sampler made of transparent material makes this unnecessary sampler must grip snow well enough to keep snow inside cylinder as it is removed from snow which is easier to accomplish with a smaller diameter cylinder however larger diameters give more accurate readings samples must avoid compacting snow so they have smooth inner surfaces usually of anodized aluminium alloy and sometimes waxed in addition to prevent snow from gripping sides of cylinder as it is pushed in a sampler may penetrate light snow under its own weight denser snow pack firn or ice may require user to rotate sampler gently so that cutting teeth are engaged pushing too hard without successfully cutting a dense layer may cause sample to push layer down this situation can be identified because snow level inside sampler will be lower than surrounding snow multiple readings are usually taken at each location of interest and results are averaged snow samplers are usually accurate to within about 5 10 first snow sampler was developed by j e church in winter of 1908 1909 and most common modern snow sampler known as federal snow sampler is based on church s design with some modifications by george d clyde and u s soil conservation service in 1930s it can be used for sampling snow up to 9 m in depth talalay 2016 pp 16 18 penetration testers penetration testing involves inserting a probe into snow to determine snow s mechanical properties experienced snow surveyors can use an ordinary ski pole to test snow hardness by pushing it into snow results are recorded based on change in resistance felt as pole is inserted a more scientific tool invented in 1930s but still in widespread use is a ram penetrometer this takes form of a rod with a cone at lower end upper end of rod passes through a weight that is used as a hammer weight is lifted and released and hits an anvil a ledge around rod which it cannot pass which drives rod into snow to take a measurement rod is placed on snow and hammer is dropped one or more times resulting depth of penetration is recorded in soft snow a lighter hammer can be used to obtain more precise results hammer weights range from 2 kg down to 0 1 kg talalay 2016 pp 20 21 even with lighter hammers ram penetrometers have difficulty distinguishing thin layers of snow which limits their usefulness with regard to avalanche studies since thin and soft layers are often involved in avalanche formation talalay 2016 p 24 two lightweight tools are in wide use that are more sensitive than ram penetrometers a snow micro penetrometer uses a motor to drive a rod into snow measuring force required it is sensitive to 0 01 0 05 newtons depending on snow strength a sabre probe consists of a rod that is inserted manually into snow accelerometer readings are then used to determine penetrative force needed at each depth and stored electronically for testing dense polar snow a cone penetrometer test cpt is use based on equivalent devices used for soil testing cpt measurements can be used in hard snow and firn to depths of 5 10 m talalay 2016 pp 22 23 rotary auger rigs thumb 24 inch auger used by us navy in testing polar construction equipment in 1967 commercially available rotary rigs have been used with large augers to drill in ice generally for construction or for holes to gain access below ice although they are unable to produce cores they have been intermittently used by us and soviet scientific expeditions in antarctic talalay 2016 pp 64 71 in 2012 a british antarctic survey expedition to drill down to lake ellsworth two miles below surface of antarctic ice used an australian earth auger driven by a truck mounted top drive to help drill two 300 m holes as part of project though in event project was delayed talalay 2016 p 68 et al 2014 p 63 powered augers designed to drill large holes through ice for winter fishing may be mounted on a snow vehicle or a tractor or sled hole diameters can be as high as 350 mm these rigs have been produced commercially in both us and ussr but are no longer in common use flame jet drills a flame jet drill more usually used to drill through crystalline rocks was used to drill through ice on ross ice shelf in 1970s drill burns fuel oil and can be run under water as long as enough compressed air is available it drills rapidly but produces an irregular hole contaminated by soot and fuel oil bentley et al 2009 p 283 vibratory drills a soviet designed drill used a motor to provide vertical vibration to barrel of drill at 50 hz drill had an outer diameter of 0 4 m and in tests at vostok station in antarctic drilled a 6 5 m hole with a 1 2 m drilling run taking between 1 and 5 minutes to complete drill s steel edges compacted snow into core which helped it stick to inside of barrel when drill was winched out of hole talalay 2016 pp 19 20 zagorodnov 1992 pp 1 2 drilling system components cutters thumb geometric parameters for cutters upright 2 mechanical drills typically have three cutters spaced evenly around drill head two cutters leads to vibration and poorer ice core quality and tests of with four cutters have produced unsatisfactory performance geometric design varies but relief angle a varies from 5 15deg with 8 10deg most common range in cold ice and cutting angle varies from 45deg most common in cold ice up to 90deg safety angle between underside of cutting blade and ice can be as low as 0 8deg in successful drill designs talalay 2012 pp 18 19 different shapes for end of blade have been tried flat most common design pointed rounded and scoop shaped talalay 2012 pp 12 13 cutters have to be made of extremely strong materials and usually have to be sharpened after every 10 20 m of drilling tool steels containing carbon are not ideal because carbon makes steel brittle in temperatures below 20 degc sintered tungsten carbide has been suggested for use in cutters since it is extremely hard but best tool steels are more cost effective carbide cutters are fixed to body of cutting tool by cold pressing or brass soldering and cannot easily be unmounted and sharpened in field talalay 2012 pp 20 21 cutting depth is controlled by mounting shoes on bottom of drill head these ride on ice surface and so limit how deep cutter can penetrate in each revolution of drill they are most commonly mounted just behind cutters but this position can lead to ice accumulating in gap between cutter and shoe so far it has not proved possible to correct this by modifying shoe design talalay 2012 pp 23 26 drilling fluids drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from bit fluids used include water ethanol water and water ethylene glycol mixtures petroleum fuels non aromatic hydrocarbons and n butyl acetate water is cheapest and cleanest option it may be present on glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling in cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary or heat must be reapplied by reaming hole periodically bentley et al 2009 p 293 ethanol and water ethanol acts as an anti freeze in water at sufficient concentrations it can reduce freezing temperature of mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling concentration must be chosen to prevent liquid freezing and also to maintain borehole against ice overburden pressure because density of mixture decreases with lower temperatures vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth as lighter mixture rises this causes slush to form in borehole though successful drilling is still possible ueda 2002 pp 133 135 zagorodnov et al 1998 pp 193 194 ethanol is one of cheapest options for a drilling fluid and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water a soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of 53 degc after 11 months borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems a problem with this option is that mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks ethylene glycol and water was used at camp century in 1966 in lower part of hole to dissolve cuttings bentley et al 2009 p 230 petroleum fuels this includes diesel jet fuel and kerosene they are inexpensive and easily available and were once in common use disadvantages include flammability and aromatics they contain which are a health hazard non aromatic hydrocarbons as of 2009 these had become most commonly used drilling fluids eliminating aromatics resolved health issues with these fluids they are significantly more expensive than untreated petroleum fuels n butyl acetate a widely used fuel in 1990s because it is a close match for density of ice this is now unpopular because it dissolves many materials which prevents their use in drilling equipment it comes in contact with it is also flammable and corrosive and protective clothing and in some cases masks may be necessary for people exposed to it bentley et al 2009 p 294 estisol based fluids estisol is an ester like n butyl acetate but it has no health concerns talalay 2014 p 342 are used in drilling fluids to adjust density of fluid to match surrounding ice and were often used in early drilling programs in combination with petroleum fuels these have been phased out for health reasons freon was a temporary replacement but has been banned by montreal protocol as has a used once freon was abandoned bentley et al 2009 pp 294 295 future options for drilling fluids include low molecular weight esters such as ethyl butyrate n propyl propionate n butyl butyrate n butyrate and acetate mixtures of various kinds of estisol and dimethyl oils anti torque thumb 263x263px leaf springs and hinged friction blades on crrel drill used to drill at byrd station in antarctica from 1966 to 1968 two main requirements of an anti torque system are that it should prevent rotation of sonde and it should allow easy movement of drill up and down borehole talalay et al 2014 p 211 attempts have been made to design drills with counter rotating components so that overall torque is minimized but these have had limited success wehrle 1985 pp 196 198 five kinds of anti torque systems have been devised for use with cable suspended em drills though not all are in current use and some drills have used a combination of more than one design first drill to require an anti torque system was used at camp century by crrel in 1966 drill incorporated a set of hinged friction blades that swung out from sonde when drill motor was started these were found to have very weak friction against borehole wall and were ineffective drill had to be controlled carefully to prevent twisting cable no other drills have attempted to use this approach talalay et al 2014 p 207 for next deployment of drill leaf springs were installed and this has proved to be a more durable design these are mounted vertically with a curve outwards so that they are easily compressed by borehole wall and can slide up and down with movement of drill they pass easily through any areas of irregularity in borehole but edges of springs cut into borehole wall and prevent rotation leaf springs are very simple mechanically with additional benefit of being easy to adjust by changing spacing between end points they can be placed anywhere on drill that does not rotate so they do not add length to sonde talalay et al 2014 pp 208 209 shape is usually a fourth order parabola since this has been determined to provide most even loading against borehole wall 1984 pp 69 72 leaf springs have been found to be so effective that they can prevent rotation even in heavy drills running at full power skate antitorque systems have blades attached to vertical bars which are pushed against borehole wall blades dig into wall and provide anti torque skates can be built with springs which allow them to keep blades pressed against wall in an irregular borehole and to prevent problems in narrower parts of borehole although skates are a popular design for anti torque and have been used with success they have difficulty preventing rotation in firn and at boundaries between layers of different densities and can cause problems when drilling with high torque when they fail they act as removing chips from wall which can fall to drillbit and interfere with drilling talalay et al 2014 pp 209 210 thumb five different anti torque et al 2014 p 208 left upright 3 in 1970s japanese antarctic research expedition group designed several drills using side mill cutters these are toothed gears that are driven from rotation of main drill motor via 45deg spiral gears their axis of rotation is horizontal and they are placed so that teeth cut four vertical slots in borehole wall guide fins higher on sonde travel in these slots and provide antitorque design was effective at preventing rotation of sonde but it proved to be almost impossible to realign guide fins with existing slots when tripping in misalignment increased chance of drill getting stuck in borehole and there was also a risk of ice cuttings from mill cutters jamming in between drill and borehole wall causing drill to get stuck system was used again in a drill developed in china in 1980s and 1990s but problems inherent in design are now considered insuperable and it is no longer in use talalay et al 2014 p 210 talalay 2016 p 146 most recent anti torque system design is use of u shaped blades made of steel and fixed vertically to sides of sonde initial implementations ran into problems with thin blades bending too easily and thick blades providing too much resistance to vertical movement of sonde but final design can generate strong resistance to torque in both firn and ice talalay et al 2014 pp 210 211 drills may be designed with more than one anti torque system in order to take advantage of different performance of different designs in different kinds of snow and ice for example a drill may have skates to be used in hard firn or ice but also have a leaf spring system which will be more effective in soft firn breaking and retaining cores thumb core dog in unengaged and engaged position upright 1 5 in ice core drilling when an annulus has been drilled around core to be retrieved core is still attached to ice sheet at its lower end and this connection has to be broken before core can be retrieved one option is to use a collet which is a tapered ring inside cutting head when drill is pulled up collet compresses core and holds it with loose ice chips wedged in it increasing compression this breaks core and holds it in barrel once it has broken are effective in firn but less so in ice so core dogs also known as core catchers are often used for ice cores a typical ice drill core dog has a dog leg shape and will be built into drill head with ability to rotate and with a spring supplying some pressure against core when drill is lifted sharp point of core dog engages and rotates around causing core to break some core dogs have a shoulder to stop them from over rotating talalay 2012 pp 28 29 most drill heads have three core dogs though having only two core dogs is possible asymmetric shearing force helps break core angle between core dog point and core has been subject of some investigation a study in 1984 concluded that optimum angle was 55deg and a later study concluded that angle should be closer to 80deg talalay 2012 pp 29 30 core catchers are made from hardened steel and need to be as sharp as possible force required to break core varies with temperature and depth and in warm ice core dogs may gouge grooves up core before they catch and it breaks talalay 2012 pp 31 32 some drills may also include a weight that can be used as a hammer to provide an impact to help in breaking core for snow and firn where core material may be at risk of falling out of bottom of core barrel a basket catcher is a better choice these catchers consist of spring wires or thin pieces of sheet metal placed radially around bottom of core barrel and pressed against side of barrel by core as drill descends around it when drill is lifted ends of catcher engage with core and break it from base and act as a basket to hold it in place while it is brought to surface talalay 2012 p 35 casing casing or lining a hole with a tube is necessary whenever drilling operations require that borehole be isolated from surrounding permeable snow and firn holes can be drilled with fluid by using a hose lowered into hole but this is likely to lead to increased drilling fluid consumption and environmental contamination from leaks steel casing was used in 1970s but rust from casing caused damage to drills and casing was not sealed leading to fluid leaks there were also problems with casing tubes not being centered which caused damage to drill bit as it was lowered through casing fibreglass and hdpe casing has become more common with junctions sealed with ptfe tape but leaks are frequent heat fusion welding for hdpe casing is a possible solution to seal bottom of casing water can be pumped to bottom of hole once casing is set or a thermal head can be used to melt ice around casing shoe creating a seal when water freezes again another approach is to use a hotpoint drill saturating snow and firn with melted water which will then freeze and seal borehole talalay 2014 p 341 low temperature pvc tubing is not suitable for permanent casing since it cannot be sealed at bottom but it can be used to pass drilling fluid through permeable zone its advantage is that it requires no connections since it can be coiled on a reel for deployment see also
