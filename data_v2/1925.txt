lauded game s vast open world and enjoyable activities critics also pointed out its lack of direction and overall scope with critique also being directed at its always online concept matthew kato of game informer awarded game a positive review while he was initially wondering if a game solely centered on extreme sports and a vast open world would capture players he found steep to be very captivating through its open world gameplay and atmosphere he called volume of challenges admirable as is scale of its open world but was especially pleased with how well world was tailored to cater to each discipline thus interacting with world was a breathtaking and demanding process he noted that trick system was aimed at accessibility and thus did not provide a feeling akin to tony hawk s series of video games tj hafer of ign also rated game positively for similar reasons describing steep s world as one of most diverse and visually interesting open worlds in video games he called physics of game satisfying and noted that they managed to find a balance between realistic and arcade approaches unlike other critics he found open concept of game to be working out well he lauded game for its well executed controls which he described as intense engaging and at times frantic also he praised game s open world which he described as gorgeous and also just awe gargantuan with its grandiose attractive environments ray castillo of egm gave game an average rating and was more critical he too lauded ubisoft annecy for game s graphics and world design stating that game looks gorgeous and each mountainside has character to it furthermore he noted customization options for different characters as very rich however he was critical of game s map and objective structure stating that map opens up too early and is convoluted while presentation of objectives is confusing and they do not seem to be designed to lead player to an end goal through constant progress this led him to conclude that game lacked direction he called fact that game has to have an internet connection to be played unforgivable he concluded that while game had a lot of good ideas at its core it was more frustrating than fun similarly hafer noted that paragliding path was least entertaining of four initial play styles but if a player wanted to complete game he was forced to do these events furthermore he missed option of increasing a character s stats as is was handled in most classic extreme sport titles additional expansions additional expansions were similarly received as main game road to olympics dlc was criticized by kato of for providing little substance while he enjoyed japanese mountain ranges he was very critical of game s new story mode and korean mountain he noted that mode half heartedly attempts staging of its own olympic drama without conveying an olympic experience decision to only include freestyle disciplines in story while completely omitting skiing events such as super g or giant slalom added to that sentiment he questioned decision to include korean mountain ranges where olympics took place but not making them accessible in mode all in all he noted that expansion restrict what is best about steep with little to show for it in return chris shive of hardcore gamer was less critical of expansion calling new story mode a goal focused narrative that so many gamers have been conditioned to crave while noting game s stunning visuals especially in japanese mountains x games pass was described by michele sollazzo of eurogamer as a completion of game s development bringing it to its final form also he noted that expansion provided a good contrast to previous road to olympics expansion as it focused more on extreme sports while he noted x games expansion itself as short he found competitions to be rather challenging stefan of xgn also noted difficulty of x games events and felt new challenges added depth to game however he criticized ubisoft for not including a new area and relative small amount of content in new dlc package notes references external links category 2016 video games category cancelled nintendo switch games category extreme
