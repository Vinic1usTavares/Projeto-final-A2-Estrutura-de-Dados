tremella mesenterica common names include yellow brain golden jelly fungus yellow trembler and witches spelled witch s or witches is a common jelly fungus in family of it is most frequently found on dead but attached and on recently fallen branches especially of angiosperms as a parasite of wood decay fungi in genus peniophora gelatinous orange yellow fruit body of fungus which can grow up to diameter has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or slimy when damp it grows in crevices in bark appearing during rainy weather within a few days after rain it dries into a thin film or shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain this fungus occurs widely in deciduous and mixed forests and is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions that include africa asia australia europe north and south america although considered bland and flavorless fungus is edible tremella mesenterica produces carbohydrates that are attracting research interest because of their various biological activities taxonomy and phylogeny species was originally described from sweden as helvella mesenterica by naturalist anders jahan retzius in 1769 it was later 1822 sanctioned by elias magnus fries in second volume of his systema mycologicum it is type species of genus tremella its distinctive appearance has led species to accumulate a variety of common names including yellow trembler yellow brain golden jelly fungus and witches butter although this latter name is also applied to exidia glandulosa specific epithet is a latin adjective formed from ancient greek word mesenterion mesenterion middle intestine from meso meso middle center and enteron enteron intestine referring to its shape species formerly recognized as tremella lutescens is now seen as a form of t mesenterica with washed out colors and considered a synonym based on molecular analysis of sequences of d1 d2 regions of large subunit ribosomal rna gene and internal transcribed spacer regions of rrna t mesenterica is most closely related to t t and t brasiliensis this analysis included 20 of estimated 120 tremella species description fruit body has an irregular shape and usually breaks through bark of dead branches it is up to broad and high rounded to variously lobed or brain like in appearance fruit body is gelatin like but tough when wet and hard when dry surface is usually smooth lobes translucent deep yellow or bright yellow orange fading to pale yellow rarely and white or colorless fruit bodies dry to a dark reddish or orange spores viewed in mass are whitish or pale yellow microscopic characteristics basidia spore bearing cells are ellipsoid to roughly spherical in shape not or rarely stalked and typically 15 21 um wide they contain two to four septa that divide it into compartments septa are most frequently diagonal or vertical asexual reproduction in t mesenterica is carried out through formation of spores called conidia which arise from conidiophores specialized hyphal cells that are morphologically distinct from somatic hyphae conidiophores are densely branched and normally abundant in hymenium young specimens may be entirely conidial conidia are roughly spherical ovoid or ellipsoid and about 2 0 3 0 by 2 0 2 5 um they may be so numerous that young fruit bodies may be covered in a bright yellow conidial slime spores are broadly ellipsoid to oblong on average 10 0 16 0 by 6 0 9 5 um they germinate by germ tube or by yeast like conidia of identical form to conidia produced on conidiophores edibility although some have claimed fungus to be inedible or merely non poisonous most other sources agree that it is edible but flavorless gelatinous to rubbery consistency lends texture to soups in china fungus is used by vegetarians to prepare an cooling soup with lotus seed lily bulbs jujube etc similar species tremella mesenterica is frequently confused with tremella aurantia a widespread species parasitic on plant pathogenic fungus stereum hirsutum tremella aurantia can often be recognized by presence of its host which typically grows on logs stumps and trunks though two species are similarly colored surface of t aurantia is usually matte not greasy or shiny and its lobes or folds are thicker than those of t mesenterica fruit bodies of t aurantia contain unclamped thick walled host hyphae and consequently retain their shape when dried rather than or collapsing to a film as in t mesenterica microscopically t aurantia has smaller basidia and smaller differently shaped spores measuring 8 5 10 by 7 8 5 um t brasiliensis known from neotropical areas and japan and north american species t are also similar tremella mesenterica may also be confused with members of dacrymycetaceae family like chrysospermus formerly d due to their superficial resemblance microscopic examination shows that dacrymycetaceae have y shaped basidia with two spores unlike longitudinally split basidia characteristic of tremella additionally d chrysospermus is smaller has a whitish attachment point to its substrate and grows on conifer wood life cycle tremella mesenterica has a phase in its life cycle that arises as a result of budding of basidiospores alternation between asexual and sexual propagation is achieved by mating of yeast form haploid cells of two compatible mating types each mating type secretes a mating pheromone that elicits sexual differentiation of target cell having opposite mating type to pheromone producing cell sexual differentiation is characterized by arrest of growth in g1 phase of cell division cycle and subsequent formation of an elongated mating tube formation of mating tube initiated by pheromones a 10 and a 13 is similar to process of bud emergence during bipolar budding in yeasts a 10 has been purified and its chemical structure found to be s polyisoprenyl peptide fruit bodies arise from a located beneath wood bark and sometimes more than one fruit body can originate separately from same primordia habitat and distribution thumb right typical habit tremella mesenterica has a cosmopolitan distribution having been recorded from europe north central and south america africa asia and australia fruit bodies are formed during wet periods throughout year in british columbia canada it is sometimes found on maple poplar or pine but is most abundant on red alder it prefers to grow in habitats ranging from mesic to wet fungus grows parasitically on mycelium of wood rotting fungi in genus peniophora occasionally t mesenterica and its host fungus can be found fruiting together bioactive compounds some tremella species produce polysaccharides that are of interest to medical field because of their biological activity several patents have been filed in china pertaining to use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement in 1966 reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of t mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by species cryptococcus laurentii structural similarity of polysaccharides from two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them subsequently researchers chemically synthesized polysaccharide and determined chemical identities of component sugar units polysaccharide known as glucuronoxylomannan produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is with chains in a regular repeating structure laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with t mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan including anti
