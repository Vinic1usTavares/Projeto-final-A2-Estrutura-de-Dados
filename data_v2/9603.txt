little sammy sneeze was a comic strip by american cartoonist winsor mccay in each episode titular sammy sneezed himself into an awkward or disastrous predicament strip ran from july 24 1904 until december 9 1906 in new york herald where mccay was on staff it was mccay s first successful comic strip he followed it with dream of rarebit fiend later in 1904 and his best known strip little nemo in slumberland in 1905 in contrast to imaginative layouts of little nemo sammy sneeze was confined to a rigid grid and followed a strict formula sammy s sneeze would build frame by frame contorting protagonist s face until it erupted in second to last panel in closing panel he suffered consequences often a kick in rear mccay s artwork was finely detailed and highly accurate in its persistent repetition he delved into modernist experimentation shattering fourth walls and even strip s panel borders panel by panel buildup displayed mccay s concern with depicting motion a concern that was to culminate in his pioneering animated films of 1910s such as gertie dinosaur 1914 premise strip follows a simple concept in each weekly instalment sammy sneezes with such power that it wreaked havoc with his surroundings his sneeze builds until its release with onomatopoeia chow in second to last panel in last panel he suffers consequences being driven away by one of his victims or often receiving a kick in rear background winsor mccay worked in dime museums in cincinnati from 1891 where he drew posters and advertisements his ability to draw quickly with great accuracy drew crowds when he painted advertisements in public he began working as a newspaper cartoonist full time in 1898 and also freelanced for humor magazines mccay moved to new york city in 1903 to work for new york herald leaving behind his first comic strip a tale of jungle imps by felix fiddle from january 1904 he created a number of other short lived strips before finding popular success with sammy sneeze that july in addition to his editorial cartooning in 1905 he was producing five regular comic strips little sammy sneeze dream of rarebit fiend little nemo in slumberland hungry henrietta and a pilgrim s progress little sammy sneeze was one of three strips with little nemo and hungry henrietta that starred a child protagonist this may have been under influence of richard f outcault s popular yellow kid and buster brown strips style and analysis strip was almost always laid out in a rigid grid sammy s sneeze builds in first four panels to a release in fifth and consequences for sammy in sixth this is in contrast to great variety of panel sizes and layouts displayed in mccay s earlier strip jungle imps and later much more prominently in little nemo sammy was inarticulate making little more than mouth noises adults around him conversed but in a monotonous manner that did not invite careful reading neither did he learn from his foibles nor grow as a character sammy and mccay s other child protagonists differ from those of outcault and other popular cartoonists such as rudolph dirks and his rambunctious pranking katzenjammer kids sammy takes no pleasure in trouble he causes rather as strip s header declares he just simply couldn t stop it on occasion his sneezes have positive consequences as when he frightens a stubborn mule to move out of way of an oncoming train or foils a group of kidnappers though not to degree applied to little nemo mccay s backgrounds were heavily detailed and he drew monotonous repetitive images with great accuracy mccay later applied these skills to his animation work backgrounds remain same from panel to panel while passersby unwittingly pass sammy during his buildup during buildup mccay presents people going about their lives to comics historian thierry smolderen reading of these pages is most enjoyable not in repetitive buildup of sneeze itself but in beautifully varied and fleshed out description of human activities that are so violently interrupted by explosion mccay took visual ideas he experimented with in little sammy sneeze and dream of rarebit fiend also 1904 and more fully explored them when he began little nemo following year while technical dexterity little nemo draws greatest share of attention among mccay s works katherine roeder finds formally lower key sammy sneeze tested limits of visual representation and demonstrated comic strip s potential as a vehicle for modernist experimentation mccay was fond of breaking fourth wall a well known example of which is september 24 1905 episode gag unfolds according to formula culminating in destruction of very panel borders of comic strip itself strip may pay homage to fred ott s sneeze a filmstrip of progression of a man sneezing photographs appeared in harper s magazine in 1884 and were well known as in film and unusual for sammy sneeze strip september 24 episode has a closeup of sneezer against a blank background and sammy s gestures echo those of ott mccay was concerned with depicting seldom perceived minutiae of movement though his was not scientific curiosity found in chronophotography of eadweard muybridge etienne jules and georges mccay emphasizes lack of order and irrational unpredictability of human body mccay s concern was to culminate in his pioneering animated films such as gertie dinosaur 1914 comic strips as early as a b frost s incorporated repetition of backgrounds inspired by chronophotography and by time of sammy sneeze had become a standard comic strip trope one comics historian thierry smolderen suggests mccay may have deliberately parodied left thumb alt a series of photographs showing progress of a man sneezing mccay had likely seen fred ott s sneeze 1894 though story of mischievous children and trouble they caused was typical of comic strips of day in contrast to such other popular strips as katzenjammer kids and buster brown havoc sammy wreaked was unintentional to roeder humor at expense of both adults and child likely appealed to a broad range of readers and may have broadened appeal of comic strips to conservative middle class audiences these audiences may have seen inevitable consequences for sammy as a restoration of a natural social order one that was left rent asunder in other comic strips sammy is given an unappealing character design and personality with dull features and expression that do not invite reader s sympathy his character is never developed similar to buster brown sammy dresses in a dress shirt lace collar and cravat this style associated with middle class aspirations and popularized toward end of 19th century in wake of success of little lord fauntleroy by time sammy sneeze had begun style was a subject of ridicule in an age where respectable society went to lengths to avoid drawing attention to bodily functions it emphasized humorous contortions of sammy s face as he built up toward his sneeze his sneeze could also tear down other symbols of middle class such as an expansive department store display of goods at christmas strip s header declared to each side of title he just simply couldn t stop and he never knew when it was coming and never strayed from basic formula of build up release and consequence mccay was to make use of such framing devices throughout his career as in little nemo where reader could rely on protagonist awakening in closing panel each week scott bukatman and thierry smolderen saw monotony of sammy sneeze as an attempt by mccay at parody one that in smolderen s words chuckles at absurdity of doing same thing ad nauseam noah berlatsky objected to idea calling strip excessive and infantile linked not to a sense of irony but a sense of wonder which he compared to eternal appetite of infancy that g k chesterton in
