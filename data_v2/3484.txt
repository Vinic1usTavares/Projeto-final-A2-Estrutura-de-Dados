after he asked susan sackett star trek creator gene roddenberry s assistant to type up some writing he was working on after reading it through she thought it was good and passed it to roddenberry who agreed and asked koenig if he was interested in writing for animated show he accepted offer and started working on a plot involving cloning which was inspired by newspaper articles about subject becoming first actor from star trek to write for franchise he found writing process for infinite vulcan unbearable this was due to interference from roddenberry resulting in koenig producing ten drafts of screenplay and because of koenig s frustration in not otherwise being involved in series he could not understand why so many redrafts were required a view shared by story editor associate producer d c fontana roddenberry was keen in particular to make use of benefits of an animated medium by including things which could not have been shown on a live action series these included talking vegetables as characters which koenig said were not his idea but were so silly as to not be worthy of a fight david alexander in his book star trek creator authorised biography of gene roddenberry suggested that koenig was hired to write infinite vulcan because roddenberry felt bad about koenig s exclusion from series koenig asked to play part of dr keniclius roddenberry and fontana approved and show s producers allowed him to audition but he said later that he suspected it was a very token gesture and they were not seriously considering him he included a reference to himself in episode as walking plant is called a retlaw walter spelled backwards this was a reference to aliens in 1940s comic book planet comics who spoke backwards he later used a similar idea in stranger a land of lost episode he wrote in which koenig introduced character this character was originally called backwards for gene as a reference to gene roddenberry koenig felt that infinite vulcan turned out ok and had heard a number of opinions on it ranging from it being best episode of animated series to it being very worst he felt overall that it was an interesting take and certainly a little different fellow cast member george takei felt episode showed that koenig was enterprising producers liked episode so much that they wanted koenig to write another but he turned them down koenig later explained that he was still upset at time over not appearing as chekov in series keniclius later appeared in kevin lauderdale s story rules of war which takes place during eugenics wars in anthology strange new
