batavia present day jakarta in dutch east indies violence in city lasted from 9 october 1740 until 22 october with minor skirmishes outside walls continuing late into november that year historians have estimated that at least 10 000 ethnic chinese were massacred just 600 to 3 000 are believed to have survived in september 1740 as unrest rose among chinese population spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices governor general adriaan valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force on 7 october hundreds of ethnic chinese many of them sugar mill workers killed 50 dutch soldiers leading dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from chinese populace and to place chinese under a curfew two days later rumours of chinese atrocities led other batavian ethnic groups to burn chinese houses along besar river and dutch soldiers to fire cannon at chinese homes violence soon spread throughout batavia killing more chinese although valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 october gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill chinese until 22 october when governor general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities outside city walls clashes continued between dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers after several weeks of minor skirmishes dutch led troops assaulted chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout area following

sugar mill workers and shopkeepers economic boom precipitated by trade between east indies and china via port of batavia increased chinese immigration to java number of ethnic chinese in batavia grew rapidly reaching a total of 10 000 by 1740 thousands more lived outside city walls dutch colonials required them to carry registration papers and deported those who did not comply to china deportation policy was tightened during 1730s after an outbreak of malaria killed thousands including governor general of dutch east indies dirck van according to indonesian historian benny g setiono outbreak was followed by increased suspicion and resentment in native indonesians and dutch toward ethnic chinese who were growing in number and whose wealth was increasingly visible as a result commissioner of native affairs roy ferdinand under orders of governor general adriaan valckenier decreed on 25 july 1740 that chinese considered suspicious would be deported to ceylon modern day sri lanka and forced to harvest cinnamon wealthy chinese were extorted by corrupt dutch officials who threatened them with deportation stamford raffles a british explorer and historian of java noted in 1830 that in some javanese accounts dutch were told by dutch appointed chinese headman of batavia nie hoe kong kapitein der chinezen to deport all chinese wearing black or blue because these were thought to be poor there were also rumours that deportees were not taken to their destinations but were thrown overboard once out of sight of java and in some accounts they died when rioting on ships deportation of ethnic chinese caused unrest among remaining chinese leading many chinese workers to desert their jobs at same time native occupants of batavia including ethnic betawi servants became increasingly distrustful of chinese economic factors played a role most natives were poor and perceived chinese as occupying some of most prosperous neighbourhoods in city although dutch historian a n notes that at time chinese were jews of asia actual situation was more complicated many poor chinese living in area around batavia were sugar mill workers who felt exploited by dutch and chinese elites equally rich chinese owned mills and were involved in revenue farming and shipping they drew income from milling and distillation of arak a molasses and rice based alcoholic beverage however dutch overlords set price for sugar which itself caused unrest because of decline of worldwide sugar prices that began in 1720s caused by an increase in exports to europe and competition from west indies sugar industry in east indies had suffered considerably by 1740 worldwide sugar prices had dropped to half price in 1720 as sugar was a major export this caused considerable financial difficulties for colony initially some members of council of indies believed that chinese would never attack batavia and stronger measures to control chinese were blocked by a faction led by valckenier s political opponent former governor of gustaaf willem van imhoff who returned to batavia in 1738 large numbers of chinese arrived outside batavia from nearby settlements however and on 26 september valckenier called an emergency meeting of council during which he gave orders to respond to any ethnic chinese uprisings with deadly force this policy continued to be opposed by van imhoff s faction vermeulen 1938 suggested that tension between two colonial factions played a role in ensuing massacre on evening of 1 october valckenier received reports that a crowd of a thousand chinese had gathered outside gate angered by his statements at emergency meeting five days earlier this report was received incredulously by valckenier and council however after murder of a balinese sergeant by chinese outside walls council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce guard two groups of 50 europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on south and east sides of city and a plan of attack was formulated incident massacre alt bird s eye view of part of city of batavia where there is fighting while houses stand in flames in foreground at time of massacre of chinese in 1740 thumb 300px

forbidden to light candles and were forced to surrender everything down to smallest kitchen knife following day dutch repelled an attack by up to 10 000 ethnic chinese led by groups from nearby tangerang and at city s outer walls raffles wrote that 1 789 chinese died in this attack in response valckenier called another meeting of council on 9 october meanwhile rumours spread among other ethnic groups in batavia including slaves from bali and sulawesi bugis and balinese troops that chinese were plotting to kill rape or enslave them these groups pre emptively burned houses belonging to ethnic chinese along besar river dutch followed this with an assault on chinese settlements elsewhere in batavia in which they burned houses and killed people dutch politician and critic of

violence on 11 october valckenier unsuccessfully requested that officers control their troops and stop looting two days later council established a reward of two ducats for every chinese head surrendered to soldiers as an incentive for other ethnic groups to assist in purge as a result ethnic chinese who had survived initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars who killed those chinese they found for reward dutch worked with natives in different parts of batavia ethnic bugis and balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce dutch on 14 october on 22 october valckenier called for all killings to cease in a lengthy letter in which he blamed unrest entirely on chinese rebels valckenier offered an amnesty to all chinese except for leaders of unrest on whose heads he placed a

indonesian historian benny g setiono notes that 500 prisoners and hospital patients were killed and a total of 3 431 people survived massacre was followed by an open season against ethnic chinese throughout java causing another massacre in 1741 in semarang and others later in surabaya and gresik as part of conditions for cessation of violence all of batavia s ethnic chinese were moved to a pecinan or chinatown outside of city walls now known as this allowed dutch to monitor chinese more easily to leave pecinan ethnic chinese required special passes by 1743 however ethnic chinese had already returned to inner batavia several hundred merchants operated there other ethnic chinese led by khe pandjang fled to central java where they attacked dutch trading posts and were later joined by troops under command of javanese sultan of mataram though this further uprising was quashed in 1743 conflicts in java continued almost without interruption for next 17 years on 6 december 1740 van imhoff and two fellow councillors were arrested on orders of valckenier for insubordination and on 13 january 1741 they were sent to netherlands on separate ships they arrived on 19 september 1741 in netherlands van imhoff convinced council that valckenier was to blame for massacre and delivered an extensive speech entitled over den tegenwoordigen staat van de ned o i comp considerations on current condition of dutch east indies company on 24 november as a result of speech charges against him and other councillors were dismissed on 27 october 1742 van imhoff was sent back to batavia on as new governor general of east indies with high expectations from lords xvii leadership of dutch east india company he arrived in indies on 26 may 1743 thumb alt a portrait of governor general van imhoff in a large white wig and black over plate armour he is carrying a cane in his left hand and has a sword sheathed on his right side van imhoff was sent to netherlands but later assigned as new governor general of dutch east indies valckenier had asked to be replaced late in 1740 and in february 1741 had received a reply instructing him to appoint van imhoff as his successor an alternative account indicates that lords xvii informed him that he was to be replaced by van imhoff as punishment for exporting too much sugar and too little coffee in 1739 and thus causing large financial losses by time valckenier received reply van imhoff was already on his way back to netherlands valckenier left indies on 6 november 1741 after appointing a temporary successor johannes taking command of a fleet valckenier headed for netherlands on 25 january 1742 he arrived in cape town but was detained and investigated by governor hendrik by order of lords xvii in august 1742 valckenier was sent back to batavia where he was imprisoned in fort batavia and three months later tried on several charges including his involvement in massacre in march 1744 he was convicted and condemned to death and all his belongings were confiscated in december 1744 trial was reopened when valckenier gave a lengthy statement to defend himself valckenier asked for more evidence from netherlands but died in his prison cell on 20 june 1751 before investigation was completed death penalty was rescinded posthumously in 1755 vermeulen characterises investigation as unfair and fuelled by popular outrage in netherlands and arguably this was officially recognised because in 1760 valckenier s son adriaan isaak valckenier received reparations totalling 725 000 gulden sugar production in area suffered greatly after massacre as many of chinese who had run industry had been killed or were missing it began to recover after new governor general van imhoff colonised tangerang he initially intended for men to come from netherlands and work land he considered those already settled in indies to be lazy however he was unable to attract new settlers because of high taxes and thus sold land to those already in batavia as he had expected new land owners were unwilling to soil their hands and quickly rented out land to ethnic chinese production rose steadily after this but took until 1760s to reach pre 1740 levels after which it again diminished number of mills also declined in 1710 there had been 131 but by 1750 number had fallen to 66 after 1740 massacre it became apparent over ensuing decades through a series of considerations that batavia needed chinese people for a long list of trades considerable chinese economic expansion occurred in late eighteenth century and by 1814 there were 11 854 chinese people within total of 47 217 inhabitants legacy vermeulen described massacre as one of most striking events in 18th century dutch colonialism in his doctoral dissertation w w notes that attack has figured heavily in dutch literature early examples of which include a poem by willem van haren that condemned massacre dating from 1742 and an anonymous poem from same period critical of chinese raffles wrote in 1830 that dutch historical records are far from complete or satisfactory dutch historian leonard writes that massacre indirectly led to rapid expansion of batavia and institutionalised a modus vivendi that led to a dichotomy between ethnic chinese and other groups which could still be felt in late 20th century massacre may also have been a factor in naming of numerous areas in jakarta one possible etymology for name of tanah abang district meaning red earth is that it was named for chinese blood spilled there van hoevell suggests that naming was a compromise to make chinese survivors accept amnesty more quickly name rawa for a subdistrict of east jakarta may be derived from colloquial indonesian word for corpse due to great number of ethnic chinese killed there a similar etymology has been suggested for angke in tambora see also discrimination against chinese indonesians may 1998 riots of indonesia riots in which many ethnic chinese were
