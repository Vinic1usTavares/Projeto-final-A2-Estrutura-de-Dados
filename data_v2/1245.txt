isaac i komnenos or comnenus ho komnenos 1060 was byzantine emperor from 1057 to 1059 first reigning member of komnenian dynasty son of general manuel erotikos komnenos he was orphaned at an early age and was raised under care of emperor basil ii he made his name as a successful military commander serving as commander in chief of eastern armies between and 1054 in 1057 he became head of a conspiracy of dissatisfied eastern generals against newly crowned michael vi bringas proclaimed emperor by his followers on 8 june 1057 he rallied sufficient military forces to defeat loyalist army at battle of hades while isaac was willing to accept a compromise solution by being appointed michael s heir a powerful faction in constantinople led by ambitious patriarch of constantinople michael keroularios pressured michael to abdicate after michael abdicated on 30 august 1057 isaac was crowned emperor in hagia sophia on 1 september as emperor he rewarded his supporters but also embarked on a series of fiscal measures designed to shore up revenue and eliminate excesses allowed to flourish under his predecessors his aim was to fill treasury and restore byzantine army s effectiveness to preserve empire reduction of salaries harsh tax measures and confiscation of church properties aroused much opposition particularly from keroularios who had come to think of himself as a king maker in november 1058 keroularios was arrested and exiled and died before a synod to depose him could be convened eastern frontier held firm during his reign hungarian raids were resolved by a treaty in 1059 while restive pechenegs were subdued by isaac in person in summer 1059 shortly after isaac fell ill and on advice and pressure of michael psellos he abdicated his throne in favour of constantine x doukas retiring to stoudion monastery where he died later in 1060 biography origin and early career thumb upright 1 2 byzantine empire in first half of 11th century isaac was son of manuel erotikos komnenos who reportedly served as strategos autokrator of east under emperor basil ii and defended nicaea against rebel bardas skleros in 978 his mother s name was maria about whom nothing else is known manuel s native language was greek and modern scholarship considers family to have been of greek origin it is said that family name was derived from city of near philippopolis in thrace isaac was born as maria had died early on his deathbed in 1020 isaac s father commended his two surviving sons isaac and john to care of emperor basil ii according to nikephoros bryennios younger two children were raised with solicitude they were raised at stoudion monastery with best tutors while care was taken to teach them how to hunt and military exercises as soon as they came of age isaac and his brother joined imperial bodyguard hetaireia at a young age perhaps as early as 1025 isaac married catherine of bulgaria born a daughter of ivan vladislav last tsar of first bulgarian empire from he held post of stratopedarches of east likely denoting that he was domestikos ton scholon commander in chief of eastern field army but this title is not explicitly attested and ranks of magistros and he was dismissed by empress theodora in 1054 and replaced by her eunuch confidant proedros theodore revolt of eastern generals michael vi and military leadership when michael vi bringas came to throne in 1056 isaac was chosen to lead a deputation of eastern generals to new emperor michael vi engaged in mass promotions of individuals in eyes of contemporary courtier michael psellos to an excessive degree and military sought to partake in emperor s bounty this was not a trivial matter debasement of byzantine currency under constantine ix monomachos had affected military pay not coincidentally presided over by none other than michael bringas who was then military logothete and while civil officials were compensated by being raised to higher dignities which commanded higher salaries rogai army was not this exacerbated already simmering dislike of military aristocracy for regime of eunuchs and civilian politicians that had dominated empire during last decades of macedonian dynasty thumb upright 1 2 right gold of michael vi at easter 1057 traditional time when emperor paid title holders their stipends delegation presented itself before emperor along with isaac delegation included magistros katakalon kekaumenos who had just been dismissed as doux of antioch michael bourtzes whose namesake grandfather had captured antioch for byzantium a century earlier constantine doukas married to a niece of patriarch of constantinople michael keroularios his brother john doukas a friend of psellos and others not explicitly named as historian anthony kaldellis comments this was a formidable assemblage as families represented in it all of them descended from military men promoted by warrior emperor basil ii would define future of empire for next thirty years indeed for next century and more psellos himself was an eyewitness at reception of generals delegation and claims that emperor began abusing them at once he then made isaac as leader of deputation and his second kekaumenos stand forth and proceeded to denounce him claiming that he was responsible for all but losing antioch and corrupting his army being a coward and incompetent and of having misappropriated army funds for his own use john skylitzes who wrote later in century reports that emperor treated generals courteously but agrees that he refused outright to consider honours they claimed for themselves notably promotion of isaac and kekaumenos to rank of proedros effect of emperor s attitude on army leadership was profound and turned them against michael a second delegation to chief minister leo paraspondylos was received in similar manner and according to psellos isaac could barely restrain his colleagues from attacking emperor then and there in his own throne room at length a plot was formed against emperor and despite isaac s own reluctance according to psellos he was nominated as its leader conspirators contacted veteran general nikephoros bryennios who had unsuccessfully tried to usurp throne from theodora but had recently been recalled by michael vi as commander of macedonian army and he apparently agreed to support them soon after however bryennios left with his troops for asia minor to campaign against turks once in anatolic theme he quarreled with army treasurer threw him in prison and appropriated funds to pay his soldiers as he saw fit this was seen by another local commander as a sign of rebellion bryennios was arrested and blinded proclamation of isaac as emperor and battle of hades fearing that their plot was about to be discovered eastern generals hastened to act conspirators resident in anatolic theme romanos skleros michael bourtzes nikephoros botaneiates and sons of basil argyros hastened to find isaac komnenos at his estates near in paphlagonia and on 8 june 1057 at a place called proclaimed him emperor it is unclear whether any of rebels held command of troops rather according to kaldellis they had to canvass for support among officers and soldiers and forge orders of imperial appointment for themselves thus skylitzes reports that kekaumenos had to forge imperial letters to mobilize regiments of armeniac theme with this force he went to join komnenos leaving his family for safety with his brother at fortress of on banks of halys river komnenos advanced west towards constantinople at same time western regiments and some of eastern ones too remained loyal to michael vi emperor placed them under command of theodora s eunuch favourite proedros theodore and aaron isaac s brother in law unlike previously he now showered his commanders with honours to secure their allegiance loyalist army assembled at nicomedia controlling direct route to capital therefore komnenos turned south and seized nicaea as his base of operations two armies met at battle of hades near nicaea in a hard fought battle with many casualties loyalist left defeated right wing of rebel army on other flank kekaumenos broke through loyalists to capture their camp and decide battle while isaac held centre negotiations and downfall of michael vi michael vi then attempted to negotiate with rebels sending psellos leo and former mesazon of constantine ix constantine leichoudes to isaac s camp michael offered to adopt isaac as his son and to grant him title of caesar making him effectively his successor but this was rejected in a public audience psellos claims that isaac was inclined to accept pressure of assembled troops who vocally refused it forced him to agree with his supporters at a private meeting afterwards isaac insisted that he had accepted title of emperor only under pressure of his followers and secretly accepted offer provided that michael would also share some at any rate of his imperial power so that he could make appointments and reward his followers especially in military envoys returned to constantinople and rapidly secured michael s consent to proposal emperor explicitly agreed to pardon isaac s followers and to accord isaac additional honours above those of caesar setting him up almost as a co emperor as a sign of good faith furthermore paraspondylos was dismissed from office when envoys returned to isaac with these news he publicly accepted proposal and prepared to enter capital back in constantinople however a crowd of officials assembled in hagia sophia and began protesting that by making a deal emperor was forcing them to renounce their oaths to oppose rebels going a step further they began themselves acclaiming isaac as emperor after a short while on 30 august michael keroularios and clergy joined their cause raising suspicions that this spontaneous assembly had been planned by ambitious and wily patriarch all along pressured by keroularios and wanting to avoid bloodshed in city michael agreed to abdicate he was quickly tonsured and retired to a monastery on next day 31 august isaac and his entourage crossed bosporus into constantinople and entered palace on 1 september he was crowned emperor by patriarch in hagia sophia reign first act of new emperor was to reward his partisans his fellow conspirators were named to high offices his own brother john was named domestikos ton scholon of west and received high title of kouropalates which was also awarded to kekaumenos and bryennios troops that had followed him received a donative and were quickly sent back east to avoid any trouble with populace of constantinople patriarch michael keroularios was also rewarded for his support by receiving sole authority for all personnel and financial matters of church which were previously under purview of emperor while patriarch s nephews received high court titles fiscal reforms right thumb upright 1 2 gold histamenon struck by isaac his martial posture bearing a naked sword is unique among byzantine coinage isaac s rise to power was a turning point in byzantine history marking definitive end of long lived macedonian dynasty although powerful generals had previously suborned power they had ruled alongside macedonian emperors isaac was first military strongman to usurp power outright since 9th century this was reflected in coinage struck in his name which uniquely showed him holding a drawn sword while it may have simply indicated his intention to restore capable military rule kaldellis it came to be understood as a claim to rule by right of conquest and even as expressing an impious belief that his accomplishments came not from god but from his own prowess certainly it highlighted isaac s determination to make reforms and restore effectiveness of army task he faced was truly herculean as politically weak emperors of previous thirty years had fostered corruption and inefficiency handing out titles and their attendant state salaries rogai in exchange for support devaluation of coinage under constantine ix had been a first reaction to brewing crisis but isaac was first emperor who certainly faced a budget deficit to fund his cherished army isaac was therefore obliged to begin strict economies he reduced or abolished rogai of those who had been awarded titles enforced a stricter and more efficient collection of taxes reclaimed misappropriated imperial estates and cancelled grants of such lands and tax exemptions made under constantine ix and michael vi particularly those that had been granted to monasteries and churches using a law of nikephoros ii phokas even though salaries of officials especially members of senate were cut isaac s efforts were enthusiastically received even among some senior members of civil bureaucracy judging by comments of psellos and michael attaleiates downfall of keroularios right thumb upright 1 2 patriarch michael keroularios on his throne from madrid skylitzes only point of criticism raised by psellos is his haste and severity judging that by a more gradual and judicious step by step approach he would have reaped greater success with far less opposition thus his appropriation of church lands provoked reaction of michael keroularios with whom isaac s relations had been steadily deteriorating patriarch s role in isaac s accession and his extensive new powers over church quickly went to his head he is said to have admonished and berated emperor and even going as far as threatening to destroy him like an oven he had made he is also alleged to have worn imperial purple boots a privilege restricted to emperor and which may indicate according to kaldellis that keroularios was influenced by papal theories and conceived of secular and clerical powers as co equal a traditional byzantine approach known as a symphonia finally on 8 november 1058 while keroularios was visiting a church outside city walls and hence was away from his supporters in urban mob isaac sent varangian guard to arrest him and take him to where he was placed under house arrest isaac applied considerable pressure on keroularios to resign but latter steadfastly refused in end emperor decided to convene a synod against patriarch this too was to take place away from capital somewhere in thrace with psellos who had himself been earlier persecuted by keroularios as chief accuser in event keroularios died on 21 january 1059 before synod could take place isaac appointed bureaucrat constantine leichoudes as new patriarch military situation rebellion and civil war that brought isaac to throne had concentrated byzantium s military might away from its borders contemporary armenian historian aristakes lastivertsi reports that georgian lord ivane took advantage of this opportunity to capture two byzantine frontier forts as well as an imperial tax collector and lay siege to theodosiopolis byzantine doux at ani drove him off but ivane then called upon some turks for assistance about a month after isaac s coronation these raiders reached melitene whose inhabitants were allowed to depart before city was plundered by turks local byzantine troops managed to blockade mountain passes forcing raiders to winter in region of in spring 1058 turks were ambushed and defeated while they attacked fort of leaving most of their captives behind at about same time or shortly after another turkish raid into taron was heavily defeated by byzantine defenders melitene was repaired and refortified and made seat of a doux constantine ix had famously abolished military obligations of armenian thematic troops in exchange for cash payments a step widely regarded both by contemporaries and modern historians as having catastrophic consequences for byzantium s eastern defences especially against mounting turkish threat while isaac does not appear to have acted to restore thematic armies according to kaldellis reaction of local forces to these events does not appear to indicate a degradation of byzantium s defensive abilities in east but rather continued and successful application of old established counter raiding principles as codified in nikephoros phokas de velitatione a century earlier isaac led only one military expedition in late summer of 1059 into balkan provinces that had been suffering raids by hungarians and pechenegs details of campaign are obscure but two had possibly entered into an alliance at serdica emperor made a treaty with hungarians who appear to have kept fortress town of sirmium before moving against pechenegs in area of moesia most of pechenegs submitted again to imperial authority only major combat was against fortified stronghold of a certain a recalcitrant pecheneg leader on its return march army was caught in a sudden storm on 24 september many men and supplies were lost while isaac barely escaped death when a tree struck by lightning fell next to him this was followed by false rumour that a tax assessor in eastern provinces was plotting rebellion and isaac hastened back to capital despite these events psellos claims that at this point isaac s character changed markedly and that he became more haughty to such an extent that he held everyone else in contempt including his own brother illness abdication and death isaac was a passionate hunter with both horse and falcon spending much time at a hunting lodge outside constantinople on a hunt he fell ill as fever lasted for several days isaac fearing he would die soon named constantine doukas as his successor on 22 november 1059 and agreed to resign and retire to a monastery psellos claims that he was main author of this nomination even against initial opposition of empress catherine according to psellos isaac began to recover soon after doukas nomination and started reconsidering his decision psellos again took decisive step of having doukas publicly acclaimed as emperor on 23 december with psellos putting purple sandals on his feet isaac then resigned to his fate and was tonsured as a monk retiring to stoudion monastery psellos prominent role in these events may simply be exaggeration and self promotion especially as he was writing this part of his history during reign of constantine doukas and his son michael vii doukas no contemporary or later source not even during komnenian dynasty 1081 1180 described or implied a coup by doukas and his supporters and legality of transition was never questioned empress catherine remained at palace and was even allowed to be mentioned first in imperial acclamations with doukas coming second this joint reign lasted for a brief while before she too retired to myrelaion monastery under monastic name of isaac lived remainder of his life as a simple monk in stoudion readily performing menial tasks until he died in late 1060 family isaac was married to catherine of bulgaria a daughter of ivan vladislav last ruler of first bulgarian empire isaac raised her to position of augusta couple had at least two children manuel komnenos probably son of komnenos recorded as having been engaged to daughter of protospatharios helios he died sometime between 1042 and 1057 maria komnene born her beauty is remarked upon by psellos but she remained unmarried and retired with her mother to myrelaion notes references sources further reading category 1007 births
