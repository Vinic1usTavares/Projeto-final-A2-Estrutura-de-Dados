as walter white 150px thumb right conception writing and filming vince gilligan writer of drive was inspired to pen episode based on an earlier idea he had about a man holding an individual hostage on a tilt a whirl gilligan had pitched this idea at several previous story meetings and it soon became a recurring joke among show s writers many of whom felt that premise lacked an x files like mystery gilligan soon revised his story so that after ride was shut off man s head would explode this led to gilligan researching various government experiments and soon he learned about two real life military experiments project haarp and project elf meisler p 27 former is an ionospheric research program jointly funded by u s air force u s navy university of alaska fairbanks and defense advanced research projects agency darpa whereas latter is a u s navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths gilligan thus wrote a script that featured an individual who due to a secret experiment involving soundwaves could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head meisler p 28 gilligan admitted that episode was partially an homage to action film speed 1994 and contains a reference to film when crump and mulder discover that speeding west is key to success mulder mentions that he thinks he saw this movie opening teaser footage is done in style of a news report a stylistic direction that ign suggested was intended to echo o j simpson s ford bronco chase from 1994 casting gilligan wanted bryan cranston to be episode s antagonist because series needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome but at same time had a deep resounding humanity in an interview with new york times gilligan stated we had this villain and we needed audience to feel bad for him when he died bryan alone was only actor who could do that who could pull off that trick and it is a trick i have no idea how he does it rick millikan casting director for x files very nearly did not cast cranston in fact a different actor had already been cast when cranston arrived to try out for part despite part having already been cast millikan allowed cranston to audition and was very pleased with his performance eventually choosing him for part cranston s work on this episode would later have a major impact on his career as it led to gilligan casting him in amc series breaking bad initially amc executives were unsure of this decision as they were familiar only with cranston s work on sitcom malcolm in middle however they were convinced after viewing his performance in drive gilligan a fan of country musician junior brown cast brown as virgil farmer who mulder and scully investigate at beginning of episode brown was flown in at request and personal expense of gilligan meisler p 29 reception
