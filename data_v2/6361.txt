battle of suoi chau pha 6 august 1967 was fought during vietnam war between australian troops and viet cong battle took place during operation ballarat an australian search and destroy operation in eastern hat dich area north west of nui dat in phuoc tuy province following a covert insertion day before which had caught a number of viet cong sentries by surprise a company 7th battalion royal australian regiment 7 rar had patrolled forward unaware of presence of a large viet cong main force unit nearby clashing with a reinforced company from viet cong 3rd battalion 274th regiment a classic encounter battle ensued between two forces of roughly equal size fought at close quarters in dense jungle amid a heavy monsoon rain both sides suffered heavy casualties as neither was able to gain an advantage finally after a battle lasting several hours australian artillery proved decisive and viet cong were forced to withdraw dragging many of their dead from battlefield after having suffered crippling losses background military situation thumb 220px left viet cong soldiers believed to be from d445 battalion by second half of 1967 viet cong seemed to have melted away in phuoc tuy province abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding main roads and towns battle of long tan and operation bribie had weakened communist forces in province while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics this prompted commander of 1st australian task force 1 atf brigadier stuart graham to speculate that viet cong may have fled to border perhaps leaving province altogether graham reasoned that a succession of operations in south east of province and completion of barrier minefield at dat do meant that no single sizable threat remained to populated areas of phuoc tuy thumb 220px australian m2a2 howitzer during operation paddington australians had continued to operate independently within phuoc tuy province and while war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for americans they had pursued their own counter insurgency campaign regardless differences of opinion between australian and american methods had produced friction and increasingly impatient with australian approach in early 1967 commander us macv general william westmoreland had complained to commander australian forces vietnam major general tim vincent demanding a more aggressive approach however australians were convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from population in villages while working towards slowly extending government control and such urgings went largely unheeded highway to xuyen moc in east had been reopened by australians in march and april and with viet cong 275th regiment believed to have been severely weakened following long tan a series of operations aimed at destroying viet cong 274th regiment were subsequently launched by 1 atf australian assessments of viet cong 275th regiment were seemingly reinforced by its unsuccessful attempt to ambush a convoy from us 11th armoured cavalry regiment 11 acr on 2 december 1966 meanwhile after westmoreland had again pressed vincent on what he saw as limited results achieved by australian tactics a large joint us australian operation was mounted against may tao mountains in phuoc tuy moving against communist bases in area largest search and destroy operation mounted by australians to that point operation paddington 9 15 july was carried out in co operation with american and south vietnamese units based in bien hoa province and targeted viet cong 5th division mounted on a large scale under american command and involving nearly 15 000 troops paddington failed to result in significant contact in spite of employment of well co ordinated search techniques and blocking forces a large number of viet cong camps bunkers and storage areas were however uncovered and destroyed resulting in significant disruption to communist logistic system under overall command of major general george g o connor commander us 9th infantry division allied forces for operation paddington included us 1st brigade 9th infantry division 2nd battalion us 47th infantry regiment mechanised us 11th armoured cavalry regiment task force b marine corps rvn and 1st australian task force as well as various supporting arms including two artillery batteries and more than a thousand armoured vehicles and helicopters viet cong casualties included 92 killed including 31 by 1 atf for loss of one australian killed and another wounded nonetheless results were disappointing for australians and viet cong continued to elude them prelude opposing forces based at nui dat in iii corps tactical zone as part of us ii field force vietnam 1 atf now included two infantry battalions plus armour aviation engineers and artillery support with total australian troop strength in vietnam reaching 6 300 men logistic arrangements were provided by 1st australian logistic support group based at port of vung tau 5th and 6th battalions royal australian regiment 6 rar subsequently returned to australia in may and june 1967 and were replaced by 2nd and 7th battalions royal australian regiment 7 rar meanwhile viet cong units operating in province in early 1967 included main forces from viet cong 5th division which consisted of 274th regiment and 275th regiment each of three infantry battalions under command of senior colonel nguyen supporting this force were a number of artillery engineer medical and logistic units group 89 artillery was equipped with recoilless rifles medium mortars and heavy machine guns local forces included d445 provincial mobile battalion a provincial unit normally operating in south of province and in long khanh while guerrilla forces included two companies in chau duc district one in long dat and a platoon in xuyen moc in total around 4 500 men despite optimistic australian assessments of viet cong capability rather than having left phuoc tuy communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations avoiding battle with australians in order to preserve their strength regardless d445 battalion had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat while headquarters of viet cong 5th division was located near northern border west of may tao mountains with its fighting formations widely dispersed viet cong 275th regiment was reported to have moved north to war zone d for retraining and refitting and viet cong 274th regiment had moved from its scattered locations in north west hat dich to replace it in north east of province and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain meanwhile casualties illness and poor local recruitment meant they were now largely reliant on reinforcements from north vietnam unsure of next move viet cong 5th division adopted a cautious posture with only 1st battalion 275th regiment remaining in may tao mountains while 274th regiment dispersed east of route 2 for remainder of month planning and preliminary operations province now seemed secure and graham saw opportunity to continue pacification on a more methodical basis in phuoc tuy planning to attack remaining viet cong where they were most vulnerable australians returned to interdicting communist supply lines and bases with 2 rar conducting two search and destroy operations to east of dat do operation cairns in late july followed by operation atherton in mid august both of which resulted in only minor contact meanwhile hat dich area had been quiet since us forces had swept of area as part of operation akron 9 29 june and australian intelligence assessed that it was free of viet cong main force combat units by late july communist rear services units and other supporting units were believed to have begun moving back into area in an attempt to rehabilitate their base areas that had been destroyed in earlier fighting yet in reality location of communist forces was largely unknown to australians in mid july viet cong 274th regiment now believed to be commanded by ut had been forced to move from hat dich towards its north eastern base areas due to operation paddington and australian signals intelligence had been able to effectively track regiment s movement due to location of its transmitter however 1 atf intelligence officers had then lost track of unit thumb 220px left 7 rar battalion headquarters during operation ballarat operation ballarat was subsequently planned to assess extent of viet cong s efforts to re establish their supply lines and to repair bunkers and camps in eastern hat dich that had been destroyed by previous operations concept of operations envisioned 7 rar under command of lieutenant colonel eric smith creating a series of company patrol bases from which platoon fighting patrols would gather intelligence on viet cong activities an ambush plan would then be developed twelve day battalion search and destroy operation subsequently commenced on 4 august 1967 within ao lion north west of nui dat in an attempt to achieve surprise rifle companies moved into their respective areas of operation by foot rather than by helicopter carrying five days rations and supplies to reduce need for resupply and likelihood of detection by viet cong with stealth considered key to operation it was intended that any bunkers and camps located during patrol phase of operation would not be destroyed until after ambush phase regardless australians expected only to encounter rear guard elements fire support base giraffe was subsequently established with new m2a2 howitzers of 106th field battery and mortars from mortar platoon 7 rar providing indirect fire support while elements of australian reinforcement holding unit provided protection further support was provide by m109 self propelled medium guns from us 2 35th artillery regiment while american and heavy artillery were also available if required meanwhile elements of 1st field squadron royal australian engineers had been tasked with clearing route 2 of vegetation and rubber north of nui dat and d company 2 rar was attached for operation providing security for engineers and additional protection to fire support base in conjunction with a troop of m113 armoured personnel carriers from a squadron 3rd cavalry regiment which would support infantry during day battle insertion and patrolling 5 6 august a company 7 rar had already been patrolling in hat dich since 3 august when orders for operation were issued utilising an insertion technique perfected by special air service regiment they were subsequently re supplied early on evening of 5 august with supplies successfully unloaded and helicopters departing within three minutes covert infiltration of infantry companies went undetected and on morning of 6 august a company began to patrol towards intended site of their initial patrol base under command of major ewart o donnell by mid morning australians were approximately east of phu my at 10 40 moving north west with 2 platoon leading australians crossed a creek suoi chau pha and shortly afterwards located a fresh track which had only recently been used o donnell ordered lead platoon into ambush positions astride track while he moved forward to conduct a reconnaissance minutes later two viet cong sentries walked into ambush with their weapons slung and they were killed instantly by a short burst from an m60 machine gun likely surprised by silent insertion of australians incident alerted remainder of australians and company prepared for action considering it unlikely that dead men had been alone o donnell assessed that remainder of a viet cong squad was located somewhere further along track and he subsequently requested artillery fire to block any escape while 2 platoon was ordered to sweep forward under command of second lieutenant graham ross 2 platoon commenced its advance before coming under automatic fire along track by a viet cong squad which then went to ground after australians returned fire attempting to take initiative ross began to manoeuvre for a quick attack moving two sections to high ground on right flank while third section provided fire support meanwhile viet cong force which turned out to be larger than first thought by australians also attempted a flanking manoeuvre moving one squad into a defensive position while two squads moved to their left flank deploying to high ground at about same time two assault groups came face to face and a fierce fire fight followed at close range with both sides throwing grenades in an attempt to gain initiative two australians were killed and several more were wounded in initial clashes 2 platoon was in trouble and australians were forced to fight hard in order to survive with numerous acts of heroism on both sides repeatedly exposing himself to fire to throw grenades and to direct his platoon s fire ross dragged two of his wounded men to safety during fighting and despite being wounded in leg by shrapnel he refused to be treated until other wounded had received first aid meanwhile private dennis bathersby although wounded in right arm remained behind his m60 throwing two grenades with his left arm and only withdrawing in order to drag another wounded australian to safety finally after his right arm went numb ross ordered bathersby to hand over his machine gun and he was evacuated to rear elsewhere private keith downward one of forward scouts after edging forward to within then single handedly charged one of viet cong machine guns killing operator and capturing weapon before then dragging a wounded australian soldier out of danger despite himself being wounded amid chaos a wasp nest in a nearby tree was disturbed and a number of australians were so badly stung that they were incapacitated and also needed to be evacuated move and counter move 6 august 1967 o donnell attempted to probe viet cong flank and after locating it on high ground he committed 1 platoon under second lieutenant rod smith to conduct a right flanking attack beginning at 11 30 australian assault soon ran into another viet cong platoon conducting a similar manoeuvre and they became involved in an intense battle at close quarters with each side blocking manoeuvre of other a heavy monsoon rain began drenching men as they faced each other at a range of just with seven viet cong machine guns facing six australian machine guns at height of battle as two viet cong platoons clashed with two australian platoons australians suffered heavily losing two section commanders killed and a dozen men wounded in first few minutes fighting continued for another two hours as both forces traded shots with neither australians nor viet cong able to achieve a decisive advantage a company s forward observer lieutenant neville clark a citizens military force cmf officer had moved to forward platoon and proceeded to calmly direct artillery from guns at fire support base giraffe on to viet cong meanwhile viet cong attempted to use hugging tactics to remain in close contact under artillery barrage while utilising rockets grenades machine guns and small arms to inflict casualties on australians finally with communists massing for an all out attack clark adjusted artillery to within of his own position disregarding his own safety in order to break up attack firing from over away australian 105 mm howitzers were nearly at their maximum range yet they proved to be highly accurate and rounds caused heavy casualties among assaulting troops as they stood up to charge australian positions while a few australians were also slightly wounded after one of rounds struck a tree in total 106th field battery and supporting american battery of us 2 35th artillery battalion fired 1 026 rounds in support of a company during fighting while american 8 inch and 175 mm heavy artillery fired another 156 rounds a number of airstrikes had also supported australians thumb 220px right australian casualties being evacuated to 8th field ambulance at nui dat during fighting by 14 30 viet cong commander finally made decision to withdraw with artillery deciding battle in favour of australians o donnell had commanded battle with cool resolve under constant fire throughout setting standard for his men and on one occasion he had run through heavy fire to drag a wounded medic to safety withdrawing through barrage and a number of airstrikes called in to pursue them viet cong proceeded to drag their dead from battlefield having suffered crippling casualties b company 7 rar was subsequently inserted by helicopter into blocking positions to north however they made no contact and were unable to prevent withdrawal numerous blood trails were later found as australians attempted to follow up viet cong meanwhile even as battle had continued evacuation of australian casualties had begun with a number of iroquois helicopters from no 9 squadron royal australian air force raaf under squadron leader jim cox flying through heavy ground fire to complete dust off hindered by artillery fire and dense foliage operation proved difficult and cox s aircraft was hit by heavy machine gun fire wounding him and an orderly on board safely landing damaged aircraft he then directed operation by radio from ground among worst of casualties was sergeant alexander sutherland from 2 platoon losing an eye and suffering heavy blood loss from multiple shrapnel wounds after a viet cong rocket exploded within a metre of him he was evacuated to 8 field ambulance in vung tau with no pulse his left leg later amputated his wounds were so bad he had to be given a general anaesthetic each time his bandages were changed making a miraculous recovery however he was personally recommended for us medal of honor by westmoreland for his resolute spirit although this was later reduced to a lesser australian award many casualties were beyond help however and battalion chaplain was inserted by winch from a helicopter to administer last rites on basis of documents captured by australians during battle viet cong were identified as being from c12 company 3rd battalion 274th regiment probably assisted by battalion reconnaissance platoon and a number of local force guides it was assessed that at least a second company had helped in recovery of many of viet cong dead later during operations following day a recently occupied battalion sized camp was subsequently located about from site of battle and it was considered likely that viet cong company had fought vigorous action in order delay australians and enable withdrawal of remainder of battalion from their base camp meanwhile elements of chau duc district company were also believed to be located in area aftermath casualties australian casualties had been heavy with five killed one died of wounds and 20 wounded meanwhile extent of viet cong casualties were difficult to assess as most had been removed from battlefield by communists as they had during previous battles a sweep of area by australians subsequently resulted in recovery of a further five dead viet cong however drag marks and extensive blood trails indicated that they had suffered heavily with perhaps another 33 killed or wounded in contact a further 200 casualties were estimated to have occurred from artillery and mortar fire as well as a number of airstrikes terry burstall in his controversial book vietnam australian dilemma lists these casualties as only questioning efficacy of australian reporting however burstall s agenda and research methodology have been widely criticised and official records make it clear that five bodies were indeed counted while a further five bodies were observed but not recovered among dead were one officer believed to have been platoon commander and two non commissioned officers also recovered were a light machine gun a 40 mm recoilless rifle and three ak 47 assault rifles while other weapons a quantity of rice and a battalion sized bunker system were subsequently also captured assessment a classic encounter battle action had been fought between two forces of roughly equal size in heavy monsoon rain at close quarters both companies had deployed to high ground at around same time in a bid to outflank other with australian infantry skilfully using their supporting artillery while viet cong had attempted to nullify australian tactics by remaining in close contact ultimately artillery had decided outcome in favour of australians however and viet cong had been forced to withdraw with heavy casualties in this way fighting bore many similarities to victory twelve months earlier at long tan yet it remained largely unheralded in australia eight australian soldiers received gallantry awards for their actions including military crosses to o donnell ross and clark while sutherland was awarded distinguished conduct medal a number of awards were also made to raaf pilots and aircrew including cox who was awarded distinguished flying cross meanwhile bravery evident by viet cong during battle had also made an impression on australians who later acknowledged their tight fire discipline and of their battle drills and tactics which they found to be similar to those used by australians themselves thumb 180px right australian m113 apc during later stages of operation ballarat 9 august 1967 a month after disappearing viet cong 274th regiment had emerged without warning and had caught 7 rar by surprise with unexpected presence of a viet cong main force regiment in hat dich forcing australians to change their tactics for remainder of operation ballarat australians became more cautious as a result and while 7 rar continued its search and destroy mission only two companies patrolled while other two remained on standby in fire support bases nearby to provide support if required additional artillery support was also made available with 161st field battery royal new zealand artillery airlifted into fire support base giraffe meanwhile graham placed 2 rar on standby to fly into area if needed and us forces were also positioned to north in this manner ballarat continued until 16 august however there was only minor contact which resulted in two more viet cong killed two wounded and one captured for no further loss to australians subsequent operations australian operations in phuoc tuy province continued throughout remainder of 1967 and although they were largely successful at tactical level viet cong continued to be able to enter most of villages in province and were causing increasingly heavy allied casualties with mines lifted from controversial barrier minefield laid by australians operation santa fe a further large scale joint us australian operation took place between october and november but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to resources committed meanwhile despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by ruling military junta south vietnam s presidential elections in september had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide in phuoc tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent graham believed that large public turnout in phuoc tuy had been due to long term effects of australian operations in province which had increased population s sense of security as a result 1 atf now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations however with war approaching a stalemate strategically australians were substantially reinforced following trend of further american troop increases with a third infantry battalion arriving in december while a squadron of centurion tanks and additional iroquois helicopters were added in early 1968 total australian strength in vietnam grew to over 8 000 men its highest level during war effectively doubling combat power available to task force commander likewise american military strength in vietnam had risen to 486 000 men while south vietnamese forces had expanded to 643 000 by end of year in spite of this build up north vietnamese strength in south vietnam also increased growing to 278 000 men and although communist strategy remained fundamentally one of protracted war preparations for a strategic offensive had reached an advanced stage culminating in tet offensive in early 1968 offensive would aim to provoke a popular general uprising among south vietnamese people against government and its american supporters and would take form of a massive simultaneous surprise attack on population centres throughout south vietnam 1 atf would be heavily involved in fighting during tet deploying astride communist lines of communication in support of american and south vietnamese forces defending long binh bien hoa complex north east of saigon during operation
