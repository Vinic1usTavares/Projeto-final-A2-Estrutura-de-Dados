thumb this coral reef in phoenix islands protected area is a rich habitat for sea life thumb few creatures make ice shelves of antarctica their habitat thumb ibex in alpine habitat in ecology a habitat is type of natural environment in which a particular species of organism lives it is characterized by both physical and biological features a species habitat is those places where it can find food shelter protection and mates for reproduction physical factors are for example soil moisture range of temperature and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as availability of food and presence or absence of predators every organism has certain habitat needs for conditions in which it will thrive but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements a habitat is not necessarily a geographical area it can be interior of a stem a rotten log a rock or a clump of moss and for a parasitic organism it is body of its host part of host s body such as digestive tract or a single cell within host s body habitat types include polar temperate subtropical and tropical terrestrial vegetation type may be forest steppe grassland semi arid or desert fresh water habitats include marshes streams rivers lakes and ponds and marine habitats include salt marshes coast intertidal zone estuaries reefs bays open sea sea bed deep water and submarine vents habitats change over time this may be due to a violent event such as eruption of a volcano an earthquake a tsunami a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents or change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in climate as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation other changes come as a direct result of human activities deforestation plowing of ancient grasslands diversion and damming of rivers draining of marshland and dredging of seabed introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife through increased predation through competition for resources or through introduction of pests and diseases to which native species have no immunity definition and etymology word habitat has been in use since about 1755 and derives from latin to inhabit from to have or to hold habitat can be defined as natural environment of an organism type of place in which it is natural for it to live and grow it is similar in meaning to a biotope an area of uniform environmental conditions associated with a particular community of plants and animals environmental factors chief environmental factors affecting distribution of living organisms are temperature humidity climate soil and light intensity and presence or absence of all requirements that organism needs to sustain it generally speaking animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities some plants and animals are generalists and their habitat requirements are met in a wide range of locations small white butterfly pieris rapae for example is found on all continents of world apart from antarctica its larvae feed on a wide range of brassicas and various other plant species and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements it is found only in chalk grassland areas its larvae feed on thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which myrmica ants live disturbance is important in creation of biodiverse habitats in absence of disturbance a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents establishment of other species wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill gaps created similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until seabed is disturbed by a storm and algae swept away or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat types thumb left rich rainforest habitat in dominica terrestrial habitat types include forests grasslands wetlands and deserts within these broad biomes are more specific habitats with varying climate types temperature regimes soils altitudes and vegetation types many of these habitats grade into each other and each one has its own typical communities of plants and animals a habitat may suit a particular species well but its presence or absence at any particular location depends to some extent on chance on its dispersal abilities and its efficiency as a coloniser thumb left wetland habitats in borneo freshwater habitats include rivers streams lakes ponds marshes and bogs although some organisms are found across most of these habitats majority have more specific requirements water velocity its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors but in river systems there are fast and slow sections pools bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats similarly aquatic plants can be floating semi submerged submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates and submerged plants provide oxygenation of water absorb nutrients and play a part in reduction of pollution marine habitats include brackish water estuaries bays open sea intertidal zone sea bed reefs and deep shallow water zones further variations include rock pools sand banks mudflats brackish lagoons sandy and pebbly beaches and seagrass beds all supporting their own flora and fauna benthic zone or seabed provides a home for both static organisms anchored to substrate and for a large range of organisms crawling on or burrowing into surface some creatures float among waves on surface of water or raft on floating debris others swim at a range of depths including organisms in demersal zone close to seabed and myriads of organisms drift with currents and form plankton thumb left desert scene in egypt a desert is not kind of habitat that favours presence of amphibians with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for development of their young nevertheless some frogs live in deserts creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse couch s spadefoot toad scaphiopus couchii emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in transient pools that form tadpoles develop with great rapidity sometimes in as little as nine days undergo metamorphosis and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own other organisms cope with drying up of their aqueous habitat in other ways vernal pools are ephemeral ponds that form in rainy season and dry up afterwards they have their specially adapted characteristic flora mainly consisting of annuals seeds of which survive drought but also some uniquely adapted perennials animals adapted to these extreme habitats also exist fairy shrimps can lay winter eggs which are resistant to desiccation sometimes being blown about with dust ending up in new depressions in ground these can survive in a dormant state for as long as fifteen years some killifish behave in a similar way their eggs hatch and juvenile fish grow with great rapidity when conditions are right but whole population of fish may end up as eggs in diapause in dried up mud that was once a pond many animals and plants have taken up residence in urban environments they tend to be adaptable generalists and use town s features to make their homes rats and mice have followed man around globe pigeons peregrines sparrows swallows and house martins use buildings for nesting bats use roof space for roosting foxes visit garbage bins and squirrels coyotes raccoons and skunks roam streets about 2 000 coyotes are thought to live in and around chicago a survey of dwelling houses in northern european cities in twentieth century found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them including 53 species of beetle 21 flies 13 butterflies and moths 13 mites 9 lice 7 bees 5 wasps 5 cockroaches 5 spiders 4 ants and a number of other groups in warmer climates termites are serious pests in urban habitat 183 species are known to affect buildings and 83 species cause serious structural damage microhabitats a is small scale physical requirements of a particular organism or population every habitat includes large numbers of microhabitats with subtly different exposure to light humidity temperature air movement and other factors lichens that grow on north face of a boulder are different to those that grow on south face from those on level top and those that grow on ground nearby lichens growing in grooves and on raised surfaces are different from those growing on veins of quartz lurking among these miniature forests are microfauna each species of invertebrate with its own specific habitat requirements there are numerous different microhabitats in a wood coniferous forest broad leafed forest open woodland scattered trees woodland verges clearings and glades tree trunk branch twig bud leaf flower and fruit rough bark smooth bark damaged bark rotten wood hollow groove and hole canopy shrub layer plant layer leaf litter and soil buttress root stump fallen log stem base grass tussock fungus fern and moss greater structural diversity in wood greater number of microhabitats that will be present a range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages and a range of features such as streams level areas slopes tracks clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals for example in britain it has been estimated that various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate for a parasitic organism its habitat is particular part of outside or inside of its host on or in which it is adapted to live life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species as well as free living life stages sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats one such organism is trematode flatworm present in brackish water marshes in southeastern united states its first intermediate host is a snail and second a glass shrimp final host is waterfowl or mammal that consumes shrimp extreme habitats thumb right an antarctic rock split apart to show an endolithic lifeform showing as a green layer a few millimeters thick although vast majority of life on earth lives in moderate environments a few organisms most of them microbes have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms there are bacteria for example living in lake half a mile below ice of antarctica in absence of sunlight they must rely on organic material from elsewhere perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from underlying rock other bacteria can be found in abundance in mariana trench deepest place in ocean and on earth marine snow drifts down from surface layers of sea and accumulates in this undersea valley providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria other microbes live in habitats lacking in oxygen and are dependent on chemical reactions other than photosynthesis boreholes drilled into rocky seabed have found microbial communities apparently based on products of reactions between water and constituents of rocks these communities have been little studied but may be an important part of global carbon cycle rock in mines two miles deep also harbour microbes these live on minute traces of hydrogen produced in slow oxidizing reactions inside rock these metabolic reactions allow life to exist in places with no oxygen or light an environment that had previously been thought to be devoid of life intertidal zone and photic zone in oceans are relatively familiar habitats however vast bulk of ocean is to air breathing humans with scuba divers limited to upper or so lower limit for photosynthesis is and below that depth prevailing conditions include total darkness high pressure little oxygen in some places scarce food resources and extreme cold this habitat is very challenging to research and as well as being little studied it is vast with 79 of earth s biosphere being at depths greater than with no plant life animals in this zone are either detritivores reliant on food drifting down from surface layers or they are predators feeding on each other some organisms are pelagic swimming or drifting in mid ocean while others are benthic living on or near seabed their growth rates and metabolisms tend to be slow their eyes may be very large to detect what little illumination there is or they may be blind and rely on other sensory inputs a number of deep sea creatures are bioluminescent this serves a variety of functions including predation protection and social recognition in general bodies of animals living at great depths are adapted to high pressure environments by having pressure resistant biomolecules and small organic molecules present in their cells known as which give proteins flexibility they need there are also unsaturated fats in their membranes which prevent them from solidifying at low temperatures thumb right dense mass of white crabs at a hydrothermal vent with stalked barnacles on right hydrothermal vents were first discovered in ocean depths in 1977 they result from seawater becoming heated after seeping through cracks to places where hot magma is close to seabed under water hot springs may gush forth at temperatures of over and support unique communities of organisms in their immediate vicinity basis for this teeming life is chemosynthesis a process by which microbes convert such substances as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia into organic molecules these bacteria and archaea are primary producers in these ecosystems and support a diverse array of life about 350 species of organism dominated by molluscs polychaete worms and crustaceans had been discovered around hydrothermal vents by end of twentieth century most of them being new to science and endemic to these habitats besides providing locomotion opportunities for winged animals and a conduit for dispersal of pollen grains spores and seeds atmosphere can be considered to be a habitat in its own right there are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic meter of air airborne microbial community may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments however these organisms are not evenly distributed their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions has been little studied but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds and less clear evidence of carbon cycling both facilitated by microbial activity there are other examples of extreme habitats where specially adapted lifeforms exist tar pits teeming with microbial life naturally occurring crude oil pools inhabited by larvae of petroleum fly hot springs where temperature may be as high as and cyanobacteria create microbial mats cold seeps where methane and hydrogen sulfide issue from ocean floor and support microbes and higher animals such as mussels which form symbiotic associations with these anaerobic organisms salt pans harbour salt tolerant microorganisms and also ichthyophaga a fungus ice sheets in antarctica which support fungi spp and snowfields on which algae grow habitat change thumb right twenty five years after devastating eruption at mount st helens united states pioneer species have moved in whether from natural processes or activities of man landscapes and their associated habitats change over time there are slow geomorphological changes associated with geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence and more rapid changes associated with earthquakes landslides storms flooding wildfires coastal erosion deforestation and changes in land use then there are changes in habitats brought on by alterations in farming practices tourism pollution fragmentation and climate change loss of habitat is single greatest threat to any species if an island on which an endemic organism lives becomes uninhabitable for some reason species will become extinct any type of habitat surrounded by a different habitat is in a similar situation to an island if a forest is divided into parts by logging with strips of cleared land separating woodland blocks and distances between remaining fragments exceeds distance an individual animal is able to travel that species becomes especially vulnerable small populations generally lack genetic diversity and may be threatened by increased predation increased competition disease and unexpected catastrophe at edge of each forest fragment increased light encourages secondary growth of fast growing species and old growth trees are more vulnerable to logging as access is improved birds that nest in their crevices epiphytes that hang from their branches and invertebrates in leaf litter are all adversely affected and biodiversity is reduced habitat fragmentation can be ameliorated to some extent by provision of wildlife corridors connecting fragments these can be a river ditch strip of trees hedgerow or even an underpass to a highway without corridors seeds cannot disperse and animals especially small ones cannot travel through hostile territory putting populations at greater risk of local extinction habitat disturbance can have long lasting effects on environment bromus tectorum is a vigorous grass from europe which has been introduced to united states where it has become invasive it is highly adapted to fire producing large amounts of flammable detritus and increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in areas where it has become established it has altered local fire regimen to such an extant that native plants cannot survive frequent fires allowing it to become even more dominant a marine example is when sea urchin populations explode in coastal waters and destroy all macroalgae present what was previously a kelp forest becomes an urchin barren that may last for years and this can have a profound effect on food chain removal of sea urchins by disease for example can result in seaweed returning with an over abundance of fast growing kelp habitat protection protection of habitats is a necessary step in maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife this may take form of setting up of national parks forest reserves and wildlife reserves or it may restrict activities of humans with objective of benefiting wildlife laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species or legislation may prohibit such activities as collecting of bird eggs hunting of animals or removal of plants a general law on protection of habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement a concept introduced in united states in 1973 involves protecting critical habitat of endangered species and a similar concept has been incorporated into some australian legislation international treaties may be necessary for such objectives as setting up of marine reserves another international agreement convention on conservation of migratory species of wild animals protects animals that migrate across globe and need protection in more than one country however protection of habitats needs to take into account needs of local residents for food fuel and other resources even where legislation protects environment a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection faced with food shortage a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as san quintin kangaroo rat and even kill animal as a pest in this regard it is desirable to educate community on uniqueness of their flora and fauna and benefits of ecotourism monotypic habitat a monotypic habitat is one in which a single species of animal or plant is so dominant as to virtually exclude all other species an example would be a sugarcane plantation this is planted burnt and harvested with herbicides killing weeds and pesticides controlling invertebrates monotypic habitat occurs in botanical and zoological contexts and is a component of conservation biology in restoration ecology of native plant communities or habitats some invasive species create monotypic stands that replace and or prevent other species especially indigenous ones from growing there a dominant colonization can occur from retardant chemicals exuded nutrient monopolization or from lack of natural controls such as herbivores or climate that keep them in balance with their native habitats yellow starthistle centaurea solstitialis is a botanical monotypic habitat example of this currently dominating over in california alone non native freshwater zebra mussel polymorpha that colonizes areas of great lakes and mississippi river watershed is a zoological monotypic habitat example predators that control it in its home range in russia are absent and it abundantly even though its name may seem to imply simplicity as compared with habitats monotypic habitat can be complex aquatic habitats such as exotic beds support a similarly rich fauna of macroinvertebrates to a more varied habitat but creatures present may differ between two affecting small fish and other animals higher up food chain see also list of life zones by region
