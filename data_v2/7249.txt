richard coeur de lion is a grade ii listed equestrian statue of 12th century english monarch richard i also known as richard lionheart who reigned from 1189 99 it stands on a granite pedestal in old palace yard outside palace of westminster in london facing south towards entrance to house of lords it was created by baron carlo marochetti an italian sculptor whose works were popular with european royalty and nobility though often less well regarded by critics and artistic establishment statue was first produced in clay and displayed at great exhibition in 1851 where it was located outside west entrance to crystal palace it was well received at time and two years later queen victoria and prince albert headed a list of illustrious subscribers to a fund that aimed to raise money for casting of statue in bronze although money was duly raised and bronze cast of statue was finally completed in 1856 a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years original idea had been to erect statue as a memorial to great exhibition this prompted opposition as did proposals to place it outside charles barry s newly completed palace of westminster various other locations to display statue were initially considered before agreement was reached that it would be placed in old palace yard marochetti s preferred location it was installed in october 1860 though it was not until march 1867 that it was finally completed with addition of bronze bas reliefs on either side of pedestal quality of statue s workmanship caused problems during its first half century horse s tail fell off day after it was installed at great exhibition and forty years after its installation it was discovered to be riddled with holes and to have never been properly attached to its pedestal it narrowly escaped destruction during second world war when a german bomb dropped during blitz landed a few metres away and peppered it with shrapnel pedestal and horse s tail were damaged and richard s sword was bent by blast in 2009 parliamentary authorities undertook a project to conserve and restore statue description statue was created by baron carlo marochetti and is located in old palace yard outside palace of westminster opposite westminster abbey in london with its pedestal it stands high showing king richard i on horseback king is depicted wearing a crowned helmet and a chainmail shirt with a surcoat and lifting a sword into air horse paws ground as if preparing for a charge into battle marochetti described his work as being inspired by richard i rather than accurately depicting a 12th century knight it stands on a granite pedestal also designed by marochetti and made by freeman co of penryn cornwall bas relief panels showing crusaders fighting saracens at battle of ascalon and richard on his deathbed pardoning bertran de born archer who fatally shot him in 1199 were added to east and west sides of pedestal in 1866 67 as statue cannot be accessed by general public area around it is used as house of lords car park west side scene showing richard and bertran is only one visible from street according to marochetti two bas reliefs were designed in style of lorenzo ghiberti s doors at florence baptistry bronze letters on front of pedestal bear inscription richard i coeur de lion 1189 1199 great majority of art in and around houses of parliament is of british origin due to a policy of acquiring british art for building marochetti s statue thus represents one of few examples of a non british artist s work being selected for parliamentary estate history creation and display at great exhibition left thumb original clay statue on display in hyde park during great exhibition 1851 marochetti was born in italy and was ennobled by kingdom of sardinia but lived and worked in france creating a number of prestigious works for royalist french government in 1830s he made his name by creating equestrian statues one of duke of wellington was erected in glasgow in 1840 by 1840s however his popularity in continental europe was in decline french revolution of 1848 which saw final overthrow of french monarchy prompted him to resettle in london and seek new patrons among british elite marochetti was not popular with victorian artistic establishment punch referred to him derisively as count while john timbs wrote that he owed more of his success in life to royal and noble patrons than artistic merit it was certainly true that he benefited from patronage of queen victoria and prince albert his courtly manners impressed victoria on their first meeting in 1849 and soon afterwards he became involved with prince consort s plans for what became great exhibition of 1851 several countries planned to display sculptures of romantic historical figures in their contributions to exhibition genre was common in mainland europe but relatively rare in england at time marochetti was probably aware that belgian sculptor eugene simonis intended to show his statue of godfrey de bouillon leader of first crusade which king leopold i of belgium had commissioned two men had a number of connections they shared same bronze founder soyer of paris and simonis was influenced by marochetti s earlier acclaimed statue of duke of savoy emanuele filiberto italian sculptor was probably motivated by a sense of competition with belgian in designing his richard i marochetti s creation of clay model of statue involved not only sculptor himself but also painter victor king louis philippe s personal physician henri gueneau de and singers mario and garcia all of whom contributed manual input a clay model of statue was displayed as one of two statues positioned outside western entrance of crystal palace in hyde park unfortunately it was so poorly assembled that shortly after opening of exhibition on 1 may 1851 horse s tail fell off it was repaired and statue eventually attracted critical acclaim art critic john ruskin said of model it will tend more to educate public with respect to art than anything we have done for centuries it came to be regarded as one of more popular items in exhibition and prince albert personally took king leopold to see it and statue by simonis which now stands in grand place of brussels art journal was later to describe it as unquestionably a vigorous and spirited example of bravura class of sculpture casting and dispute over location right thumb upright close up view of statue s upper body close fitting of richard s chainmail shirt was criticised as being unrealistic major general charles richard fox proposed during exhibition that a bronze cast should be made of statue to serve as a memorial to exhibition marking one end of site of crystal palace with a statue of prince albert at other end a campaign got underway two years later in may 1853 with a variety of great and good signing a brochure promoting a scheme to erect statue somewhere in london its supporters included duke of sutherland lord lansdowne earl of shaftesbury sculptor john henry foley novelist william makepeace thackeray ceramic manufacturer william taylor copeland and conservative mp and future prime minister benjamin disraeli times was strongly in favour of project due to influence of its foreign affairs reporter henry reeve who had known marochetti since as early as 1839 royal family also let it be known that they were supporters with queen victoria donating ps200 and prince albert ps100 future location of statue was a contentious issue from outset with fox s proposal of a site in hyde park being sidelined in favour of leaving site open for future consideration appropriateness of its theme in relation to great exhibition was also questioned art journal pointed out contradiction between effigy of a valiant crusader and great peace congress of 1851 and asked why a foreign sculptor alone was being selected to commemorate a british exhibition lord mayor of london thomas challis was similarly critical declaring that statue depicted muscular power and almost savage ferocity of war while great exhibition afforded an example of cordial amity of nations his criticism was perhaps not unrelated to fact that he was promoting a rival scheme to commemorate exhibition others criticised statue s lack of realism as times observed after statue s installation sculptor sacrificed probabilities in close fit he has given to richard s mail shirt which is made to display swelling biceps and folded mass of pectoral muscle as accurately as a knitted woollen jersey despite criticism ps5 000 equivalent to ps today was raised by private donations for a bronze version to be created parliament subsequently agreed to contribute ps1 650 for pedestal and a further ps1 500 for two bas reliefs to be installed on its sides in 1854 a plaster version was placed in new palace yard facing west outside westminster hall but charles barry architect of palace was opposed to its placement there art journal criticised new palace yard location on grounds that statue was merely a novelty and worse depicted an unworthy subject a disobedient son and a bad governor it also suffered from being lost against architectural details of palace of westminster by early may 1854 plaster statue had been removed thumb left sculpture in old palace yard in 1856 marochetti had statue cast in bronze at workshop that he had established in early 1850s in sydney mews off fulham road casting and statue s gifting to nation in summer of 1856 made question of its location all more essential to resolve other sites were considered including outside buckingham palace carlton gardens near horse guards and even on top of marble arch prince albert himself suggested locating it outside west entrance of westminster abbey looking down newly created victoria street punch mocked ongoing search for a location in an august 1857 issue calling richard i wandering statue of london anonymous writer asked whether no one will find standing room for this fugitive king is there no spot no royal mews no academic stable where his over driven steed can be taken in to bait marochetti proposed to install it in old palace yard outside south window of westminster hall his idea was considered by fine arts commission for palace of westminster and was deemed acceptable although sir charles barry again opposed it his reasoning was that old palace yard was too limited in area and too irregular and unsymmetrical in its form and approaches to give due effect to it as a work of art for his part marochetti positively preferred location s irregularity to symmetry of a formally laid out square dispute continued until 1859 when commissioner of works lord john manners finally agreed to install statue in marochetti s favoured location by this time sir charles barry was seriously ill and died on 12 may 1860 so was no longer in a position to offer opposition installation and subsequent history right thumb side view of statue in 2014 showing bas relief on west side of pedestal parliament voted to fund a pedestal for statue carved from cornish granite but transportation delays meant that it was not until 26 october 1860 that statue was placed on its pedestal and unveiled to public it was completely undecorated at first but a bronze shield was placed on front end of pedestal shortly after installation times probably its pro marochetti reporter henry reeve declared that with installation of statue a great reproach had been removed from london which now finally had a great equestrian monument which displayed a combination of life and picturesqueness it claimed that marochetti s richard i ranked with few great statues of that class in europe not all critics were as fulsome british critic and poet francis turner palgrave castigated it as an essentially vulgar and low class work precisely on grounds that call forth wonder of uncultivated spectators it was said to have been particularly appreciated by london s cabbies who tethered their horses nearby marochetti also intended to add bas reliefs to either side of pedestal and had provisioned it with sunk panels ready for reliefs to be installed he proposed to create four alto in style of ghiberti doors on at florence depicting coronation of richard in westminster abbey taking of ascalon richard as a prisoner of saracens and richard on his deathbed he quoted ps2 500 for all four but parliament voted instead to grant him ps1 500 for two scenes ascalon and death of richard left thumb 400px detail of bas relief panel on west side of pedestal depicting richard on his deathbed pardoning archer bertrand de gourdon marochetti accepted commission and created plaster models of reliefs he installed one of models in his chateau in france where it remains today while other was set into wall of a gardener s cottage adjoining his french estate bronze relief of deathbed scene was added to pedestal in august 1866 while taking of ascalon was installed in march 1867 art journal criticised deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in houses of parliament created by john cross that depicted same subject marochetti also pursued an abortive project to install a second giant equestrian statue in old palace yard this time portraying edward black prince he envisaged two statues facing each other on either side of entrance to house of lords although scheme was reported in several journals including illustrated london news art journal and athenaeum and was strongly criticised for its perceived thematic inappropriateness nothing came of it three different versions of model for marochetti s black prince came to light at turn of 21st century they appear to have been designed at same time as his richard i demonstrating their common origins models of two statues almost certainly would have co existed in his workshop and marochetti probably intended to seek a commission from prince albert however death of prince consort in 1861 deprived him of his most influential patron and marochetti s own death was to follow in 1867 queen victoria purchased one of marochetti s statuette versions of black prince following sculptor s death and gave it to her son edward prince of wales it is still part of royal collection statue has required repair work on several occasions to fix damage and defects only a few months after it was installed it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen legs if necessary during winter of 1908 09 frost damaged one of forelegs of horse part of statue it was found that between 60 80 leaks were letting water into interior of statue and causing further damage when it froze it was also discovered that statue had never been properly attached to pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on two ends of its base repair work took place to remedy these problems statue was damaged during second world war when a large german bomb hit old palace yard on 26 september 1940 during blitz bomb exploded only a few metres away from statue and reportedly lifted it bodily off ground upper part of sword was bent and tail of horse suffered several holes from pieces of shrapnel vincent massey high commissioner for canada argued that sword should be left unrepaired as it symbolised strength of democracy which will bend but not break under attack sword was replaced in 1947 and other repair work was also done however damage to pedestal can still be seen statue received grade ii listed status in february 1970 in summer of 2009 parliamentary authorities undertook a three week conservation project to repair and restore statue it consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax bronze surface to return it to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and elements bas reliefs on pedestal were also cleaned and treated as was pedestal itself references further reading external links photographs from 2009 project to conserve statue category
