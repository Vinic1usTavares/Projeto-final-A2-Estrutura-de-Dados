1902 ibrox disaster was collapse of a stand at ibrox park now ibrox stadium in glasgow scotland which led to deaths of 25 and injuries to more than 500 supporters during an international association football match between scotland and england on 5 april 1902 stadium had completed construction three years before incident and was hosting its first international fixture with crowd estimated to be over 68 000 match was first time that ground had been used more than half full during first half of match a section of newly built west tribune stand collapsed dropping between 200 and 300 people to concrete floor below two spectators were declared dead at scene and a further twenty three died of injuries sustained in incident soon after last victim dying three weeks later despite collapse match was eventually resumed after a break as match officials feared emptying crowds could interfere with rescue attempts and possibly lead to further panic teams resumed match which ended in a 1 1 draw although both scottish football association and football association later agreed that result should be voided a replay was hastily organised and played a month later at villa park in birmingham with all proceeds from match being donated to a relief fund for victims of disaster disaster led to an overhaul in stadium design with wooden terraced stands being largely replaced by earth or concrete embankments background founded in 1872 rangers had played at various local grounds in glasgow area and had eventually settled at kinning park however ground s capacity originally 2 000 but later expanded to 7 000 was struggling to meet demand for club s fixtures and venue s landlords eventually looked to move rangers on to develop site to combat this club built first ibrox park in 1887 and new ground remained in use for twelve years construction of celtic park by rangers old firm rivals celtic in 1892 led club to seek an improved venue to compete for chance to host scottish cup finals or scotland international matches which could generate considerable income for hosts particularly fixtures against england such was fervour surrounding these international fixtures times noted that attendance is limited only by size of ground original ibrox park had hosted an england scotland match in 1892 but subsequent matches had been awarded to celtic park in 1894 1896 1898 and 1900 rangers directors sanctioned ps20 000 construction of a new ibrox park in an attempt to improve facilities new stadium was built partially overlapping previous site and was officially opened in december 1899 with a capacity of 75 000 construction was soon recognised by scottish football association sfa when new stadium was selected to host 1902 england scotland match by a single vote match was 31st meeting between two sides and was first to be contested by fully professional teams west tribune stand west tribune stand was designed by scottish architect archibald leitch a boyhood rangers fan who offered his services free of charge and had a capacity of 35 913 however leitch himself had expressed concerns over maximum capacity and visited site prior to match to inspect stand but a surveyor passed site fit for purpose there had previously been reports of significant swaying in structure stand had been built using a steel framework using vertical beams set in concrete at foundations horizontal beams were then interlocked with wooden decking used to form a step like construction for spectators to stand on there were 96 steps in total each step measuring four inches in height and around fourteen inches wide it was estimated that at full capacity each spectator had on average a personal space measuring sixteen inches long and fourteen inches wide events match and stand collapse

attendance but estimated figures for match state there was a crowd of over 68 000 half of which were stood in west tribune stand there were around 50 stewards on duty for match most of whom were experienced in their role and had been provided by sfa although they had no way of determining when stand was full they had been given signs declaring stand full that were displayed at an appropriate time stand had never previously held as many supporters never being more than half full in previous uses early in match supporters briefly surged toward front of terracing and on duty police were forced to intervene in order to regulate crowd and disperse them from one area newspaper reports and later studies place incident occurring around 30 minutes into first half of match when back of newly built west tribune stand collapsed sending hundreds of supporters up to to ground below several factors have been reasoned for collapse including heavy rainfall previous night and large crowd stamping and swaying as match progressed one theory in a report following event centred around scottish player bobby templeton regarded as an exciting attacking player templeton was making his debut for scottish national team and had gained possession of ball moments prior to collapse investigation stated that crowd s desperation to see templeton dribble with ball caused them to surge forward which may have contributed to collapse an investigation of scene afterwards found that seventeen joints had given way causing a hole approximately long to open up in stand several witnesses in crowd reported hearing loud cracking noises prior to collapse and one witness who worked as a joiner claimed to have seen wooden boards split prior to collapse response immediately following collapse crowd around hole fled onto playing field in an attempt to escape stand scottish player alex raisbeck later stated that players were unaware of incident and initially believed that surging crowd was a pitch invasion as supporters scrambled over railings surrounding field he would later describe scene stating when we saw ambulance men at work we knew that something serious had happened we were told to retire to dressing rooms i shall never forget scenes inside dead bodies and groaning men were lying on seats where only a short time ago scottish players had stripped even some of players clothing was requisitioned for bandages officials estimated that between 200 and 300 spectators fell through hole to ground below majority of fatal injuries that occurred were directly caused by people impacting with either ground or steel girders as they fell mass of people eventually became heaped on ground with historians from western infirmary in glasgow where deceased were taken commenting those who first reached ground alive must then have been at hazard from suffocation due to volume of people newspaper reporters from herald wrote that rescuers first on scene were met by a scene of indescribable horror and confusion a mass of mangled and bleeding humanity victims piled one above other some spectators had become entangled in steel beams during their fall and were suspended in air until they could be rescued local hospitals were overwhelmed with casualties and cells of nearby govan police station were used as emergency treatment rooms newspaper reporters visiting scene in following days remarked on lack of debris at site as vast amounts of shattered metal and wood had been used to form stretchers to carry injured spectators despite chaos match officials feared that abandoning match would lead to further injury if exiting supporters began exiting stadium en masse and could hinder rescue attempts they instead chose to resume match after a twenty minute delay although some players and officials disagreed with decision match resumed with raisbeck who supported continuation commenting none of players were sorry when final whistle went as they were all heartily sick scottish goalkeeper ned doig was reported to have wept consistently throughout second half of match a significant number of spectators were unaware of severity of incident fixture ended in a 1 1 draw casualties in total 25 people died and over 500 were reported as injured ranging between dangerously to slightly most common cause of death was listed as a fracture at base of skull with fourteen of victims being recorded under this category two of fourteen alexander murray and bruce crawford were listed as instantaneous and were only two victims to be pronounced dead at ibrox park itself eight victims were listed with causes of death pertaining to crush injuries sustained by large mass of bodies such as severe internal chest injuries and broken ribs remaining three deaths were attributed to either shock or cardiac arrest final victim died three weeks after disaster two weeks after disaster scotsman issued a list of injuries that read dangerously injured 24 seriously injured 168 injured 153 slightly injured 171 totalling 517 injuries in total other reports put injured as high as 588 a large number of injuries were described as cuts and to heads of spectators believed to have been caused by jagged edging of wooden decking left by collapse aftermath no charges were brought against rangers or sfa over incident a criminal investigation into disaster did bring charges against timber merchant alexander mcdougall who was charged with culpable homicide mcdougall had supplied wood used in construction of stand and was accused of attempting to cut corners by using yellow pine instead of higher quality red pine noted civil engineers sir benjamin baker and sir william arrol appeared as witnesses in mcdougall s defence both testified that they believed selection of yellow pine had played no part in disaster and instead blamed accident on construction of stand design was deemed too light for work it was built for having been based on out of date textbooks baker concluded that stand s design made it safe for a load of per square foot but estimated that on day of match it had experienced loads of up to per square foot mcdougall was later unanimously acquitted of charge leitch himself was distraught over incident and begged rangers for a chance to fix mistakes made stating i need hardly say what unutterable anguish accident caused me following accident wooden frameworks on steel frames were discredited and replaced throughout united kingdom by terracing supported by earthworks or reinforced concrete rangers had won four consecutive scottish league championships prior to disaster but club invested heavily in major redevelopment of ibrox following accident several of their best players were sold to raise funds and old firm rivals celtic were able to take advantage winning following six league titles benefit matches on 19 april 1902 a meeting of fa council declared that match would be officially listed as unfinished during meeting it was also agreed for a relief fund to be created for victims and their families with fa donating ps500 themselves and a replay match organised with all proceeds being donated to fund sfa later agreed on all counts replay was held four weeks later at villa park in birmingham on 3 may 1902 and ended in a 2 2 draw with majority of players remaining unchanged from original match scotland making three changes a one off club tournament british league cup was also organised to raise funds rangers old firm rivals celtic organised a match against english side blackburn rovers to raise funds later incidents at ibrox during 1963 concerns were raised about safety of stairway adjacent to passageway 13 colloquially known as stairway 13 exit closest to copland road subway station on 16 september 1961 two people were killed in a crush on stairway and there were two other incidents in 1967 and 1969 where several people were injured rangers had by then spent a total of ps150 000 on improvements a very significant sum of money for time despite this another larger disaster occurred at ibrox in 1971 when 66 people were killed in a crush as supporters tried to leave stadium at an old firm match as thousands of spectators were leaving ground by stairway 13 it appears that someone possibly a child being carried on his father s shoulders fell causing a chain reaction pile up of people see also
