upright 1 2 thumb cover of 1992 release of symphony no 3 conducted by david zinman symphony no 3 op 36 also known as symphony of sorrowful songs is a symphony in three movements composed by henryk gorecki in katowice poland between october and december 1976 work is indicative of transition between gorecki s dissonant earlier manner and his more tonal later style and represented a stylistic breakthrough austerely plaintive emotionally direct and steeped in medieval modes it was premiered on 4 april 1977 at royan international festival with stefania woytowicz as soprano and ernest bour as conductor thomas 163 a solo soprano sings polish texts in each of three movements first is a 15th century polish lament of mary mother of jesus second a message written on wall of a gestapo cell

first and third movements are written from perspective of a parent who has lost a child and second movement from that of a child separated from a parent dominant themes of symphony are motherhood and separation through war until 1992 gorecki was known only to connoisseurs primarily as one of several composers from polish school responsible for postwar polish music renaissance that year elektra nonesuch released a recording of 15 year old symphony performed by london sinfonietta that topped classical charts in britain and united states alison moore is unspeakable singable henryk gorecki s symphony of sorrowful songs and ethics of holocaust empathy portal journal of multidisciplinary international studies 8 1 january 2011 1 17 to date it has sold more than a million copies vastly exceeding expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th century composer this success however has not generated similar interest in gorecki s other works background despite a political climate that was unfavorable to modern art often denounced as formalist by communist authorities post war polish composers enjoyed an unprecedented degree of compositional freedom following establishment of warsaw autumn festival in 1956 gorecki had won recognition among avant garde composers for experimental dissonant and serialist works of his early career he became visible on international scene through such modernist works as which was a success at 1960 warsaw autumn and his first symphony which was awarded a prize at 1961 paris youth throughout 1960s he continued to form with other experimental and serialist composers such as pierre boulez and karlheinz stockhausen during 1970s gorecki began to distance himself from serialism and extreme dissonance of his earlier work and his third symphony like preceding choral pieces et op 32 1972 and amen op 35 1975 starkly rejects such techniques lack of harmonic variation in gorecki s third symphony and its reliance on repetition marked a stage in gorecki s progression towards harmonic minimalism and simplified textures of his more recent work because of religious nature of many of his works during this period critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures tonality and melody and who also infused many of their works with religious significance like minded composers such as arvo part and john tavener are frequently grouped with gorecki under term holy minimalism although none of composers classified as such has admitted to common influences composition in 1973 gorecki approached polish folklorist adolf dygacz in search of traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in silesia region in south western poland gorecki was impressed by melody where has he gone my dear young son sie mily which describes a mother s mourning for a son lost in war and probably dates from silesian uprisings of 1919 21 gorecki had heard a version of song in 1960s and had not been impressed by arrangement but words and melody of dygacz s new version made a lasting impression on him he said for me it is a wonderfully poetic text i do not know if a professional poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse simple words it is not sorrow despair or resignation or wringing of hands it is just great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son thumb palace in zakopane former nazi gestapo prison was where composer took an inscription scrawled on a cell wall for composition of his symphony later that year gorecki learned of an inscription scrawled on wall of a cell in a german gestapo prison in town of zakopane which lies at foot of tatra mountains in southern poland words were those of 18 year old helena wanda blazusiakowna a highland woman incarcerated on 25 september 1944 it read o mamo nie nie ty oh mamma do not cry no immaculate queen of heaven you support me always composer recalled i have to admit that i have always been irritated by grand words by calls for revenge perhaps in face of death i would shout out in this way but sentence i found is different almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble she is seeking comfort and support in simple short but meaningful words he later explained in prison whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud i m innocent murderers executioners free me you have to save me it was all so loud so banal adults were writing this while here it is an eighteen year old girl almost a child and she is so different she does not despair does not cry does not scream for revenge she does not think about herself whether she deserves her fate or not instead she only thinks about her mother because it is her mother who will experience true despair this inscription was something extraordinary and it really fascinated me gorecki now had two texts one from a mother to her son other from a daughter to her mother while looking for a third that would continue theme he decided on a mid 15th century folk song from southern city of opole its text contains a passage in which virgin mary speaks to her son dying on cross o my son beloved and chosen share your wounds with your mother mily i z matka gorecki said this text was folk like anonymous so now i had three acts three persons originally i wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion i even chose two verses 5 and 6 from psalm 93 94 in translation by wujek they humiliated your people o lord and afflicted your heritage they killed widow and passer by murdered orphans however he rejected this format because he believed structure would position work as a symphony about war gorecki sought to transcend such specifics and instead structured work as three independent laments instrumentation and score symphony is constructed around simple harmonies

nonstandard techniques or virtuosic playing thomas further observes that there is no second hand stylistic referencing although if predecessors were to be sought they might be found distantly removed

jadwiga when asked why gorecki responded who was i supposed to dedicate it to he never sought to explain symphony as a response to a political or historical event instead he maintained that work is an evocation of ties between mother and child gorecki was commissioned to write music in response to holocaust in 1960s but was unable to finish any of pieces he started for that purpose while gorecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to auschwitz he resisted that interpretation of symphony which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context other critics have attempted to interpret symphony in spiritual terms an approach which gorecki also dismissed still others have suggested that symphony can be understood as a compendium of polish history gorecki said of work many of my family died in concentration camps i had a grandfather who was in dachau an aunt in auschwitz you know how it is between poles and germans but bach was a german too and schubert and strauss everyone has his place on this little earth that s all behind me so third symphony is not about war it s not a dies irae it s a normal symphony of sorrowful songs critical and
