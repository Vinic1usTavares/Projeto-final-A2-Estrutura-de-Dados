lumley p 439 franklin is best known for her writings on political and social effects of technology for her technology was much more than machines gadgets or electronic transmitters it was a comprehensive system that includes methods procedures organization and most of all a mindset franklin real world p 12 she distinguished between holistic technologies used by craft workers or artisans and prescriptive ones associated with a division of labour in large scale production holistic technologies allow artisans to control their own work from start to finish prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers franklin real world pp 18 20 franklin argued that dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes a culture of compliance franklin real world p 24 for some franklin belongs in intellectual tradition of harold innis and jacques ellul who warn about technology s tendency to suppress freedom and endanger civilization rose ellen an interview with heather menzies 2003 antigonish review january 1 2004 p 113 franklin herself acknowledged her debt to ellul as well as to several other thinkers including lewis mumford c b macpherson e f schumacher and vandana shiva see franklin reader p 210 for example as well as more comprehensive list on pp 367 368 this debt was not without recognizing that this list was largely absent of women in addition to philosophy of technology she believed that science was severely impoverished because women are discouraged from taking part in exploration of knowledge early life ursula maria martius was born in munich germany on september 16 1921 her mother was jewish and an art historian and her father an ethnographer spurr ben ursula franklin remembered as a pioneer for women a leader for peace toronto star july 25 2016 page a8 came from an old german protestant family franklin once stated that her father was an

and repaired bombed buildings family survived holocaust and was reunited in berlin after war franklin ursula 2014 ursula franklin speaks thoughts and afterthoughts montreal kingston mcgill queen s university press academic career franklin decided to study science because she went to school during a time when teaching of history was censored i remember a real subversive pleasure she told an interviewer many years later that there was no word of authority that could change either laws of physics or conduct of mathematics in 1948 franklin received her ph d in experimental physics at technical university of berlin she began to look for opportunities to leave germany after realizing there was no place there for someone fundamentally opposed to militarism and oppression franklin moved to canada after being offered lady davis postdoctoral fellowship at university of toronto in 1949 she then worked for 15 years from 1952 to 1967 as first a research fellow and then as a senior research scientist at ontario research foundation in 1967 franklin became a researcher and associate professor at department of metallurgy and materials science university of toronto s faculty of engineering where she was an expert in metallurgy and materials science she was promoted to full professor in 1973 and was given designation of university professor in 1984 becoming first female

applies modern materials analysis to archaeology she worked for example on dating of prehistoric bronze copper and ceramic artifacts sheinin p 839 one small example of her work in this field regards what was a standing question on nature of shiny black chinese mirrors found in high quantities in ancient tombs franklin s use of microscopic etching electron and x ray fluorescence analyses produced evidence that what was thought by some to be a corrosive effect was in fact present in these ancient mirrors and weapons at their inception in dark iron oxides intentionally added near objects surfaces franklin additionally pulled from historic and literary accounts of black mirrors in chinese literature to support these findings franklin s expertise was also instrumental to dating glass she guided a study on remains of blue glass beads in north america remaining from early trade relationships between american indian tribes and europe original source bead forum issue 9 october 1986 pages 13 18 in early 1960s franklin was one of a number of scientists who participated in baby tooth survey a project founded by eric and louise reiss along with other scientists such as barry commoner which investigated levels of strontium 90 a radioactive isotope in fallout from nuclear weapons testing in children s teeth this research contributed to cessation of atmospheric weapons testing franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on history and social effects of technology franklin reader p 369 as a member of science council of canada during 1970s franklin chaired an influential study on conserving resources and protecting nature study s 1977 report canada as a conserver society recommended a wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and environmental degradation that goes with it science council of canada 1977 canada as a conserver society

national president muriel duckworth presented a brief to a house of commons committee asserting that canada and united states had entered into military trade agreements without adequate public debate they argued that these commercial arrangements made it difficult for canada to adopt independent foreign policy positions such as calling for an immediate u s military withdrawal from south vietnam kerans marion douglas 1996 muriel duckworth a very active pacifist halifax fernwood publishing p 135 in 1969 franklin and duckworth called on a committee of canadian senate to recommend that canada discontinue its chemical and biological weapons research and spend money instead on environmental research and preventive medicine kerans p 117 franklin was also part of a 1969 vow delegation that urged federal government to withdraw from north atlantic treaty organization and establish a special agency to oversee canadian disarmament kerans p 138 in 1980s franklin participated in an organized campaign to win right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes her 1987 paper written to support campaign argued that well recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations paper appears in ursula franklin reader as nature of conscience and nature of war pp 46 60 franklin asserted that freedom of conscience provision of canadian charter of rights and freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection section 2 of charter states that everyone has certain fundamental freedoms including a freedom of conscience and religion her paper was to be part of an appeal to supreme court of canada lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating income tax act in 1990 however supreme court declined to hear appeal following franklin s retirement she and several other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against university of toronto claiming it had been unjustly enriched by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men in 2002 lawsuit was settled when university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers as a result about 60 retired women faculty received a pay equity settlement intended to compensate them for lower salaries and pensions they had received valpy michael u of t recognizes female academics faced barriers globe and mail april 20 2002 franklin continued to have a strong association with university of toronto s massey college as a continuing senior fellow and senior resident her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science promoting peace and social justice and speaking and writing about social effects of science and technology swenarchuk pp 5 6 9 12 16 29 34 many of her articles and speeches on pacifism feminism technology and teaching are collected in ursula franklin reader published in 2006 franklin is also author of real world of technology which is based on her 1989 massey lectures broadcast on cbc radio in a piece of writing entitled letter to a graduate student franklin encouraged physics career of a student marcia who is devoted to feminism yet interested in physics and unsure of how to integrate two in letter franklin merits of colleague maggie benston whose contributions to feminist thought and pedagogy franklin stated issued from her integrated way of being and philosophical foundation in science she cites as an example benston s point that negative side affects of contraceptive pills are considered tolerable according to present medical practices that are permeated by patriarchal bias of reductionism new methodologies are radically needed she stressed in concord with benston s writings franklin s trust in relying on scientific principles to navigate even daily struggles such as an environment surrounded by jerks characterizes letter s cheerful closing in which she recommends taking field notes and imagining oneself as an explorer come upon a strange tribe in letter franklin mentions as an interested aside extremely early state of research in solid organic matter compared to very well studied condition of solid state physics she speculates that neglect of this research area could have a political component given its benefits to humans rather than to military pacifism feminism and war thumb cover of franklin s 2006 book on pacifism feminism technology teaching and learning ursula franklin explains in a prelude to her 2006 collection of papers interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures in what she terms arrangement and interplay of parts within a whole has been at root of most of her activities franklin reader p 39 looking back after almost 40 years she adds i can see how i have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question how can one live and work as a pacifist in here and now and help to structure a society in which oppression violence and wars would diminish and co operation equality and justice would rise as part of answer franklin turns to metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey increasingly i found maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels she writes i became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting realms of them and us of good guys and bad guys of winning defeating and being defeated in short all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement franklin reader p 41 franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls real world by maps of pacifism and feminism for her feminism meant a completely new point of view feminism isn t an employment agency for women it s an alternative way of ordering social space in which women are prototype rather than men it is based on collaboration rather than competition as a youngster i still remember my feeling of joy that one could look at earth differently that s feminism everything is differently oriented seeing same world with different eyes pacifism and conscience central to franklin s pacifism and her view of life is what she calls quaker vision of world franklin reader p 43 individual conscience is at heart of that vision so too is need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct franklin reader pp 36 37 she notes that for more than 300 years quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription they have worked on reconciliation peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war franklin reader p 53 franklin remarks that quaker principles have not changed but technology has changed nature of war in a modern technological society she argues there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace war planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought women and children become targets franklin reader p 54 nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire franklin reader p 55 she writes that arms race is driven by a technological imperative which requires creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution modern weapons technologies including required research and development are particularly capital intensive and costly time between initial research and deployment of weapon systems can be as long as a decade during which government must provide financial security and political justification for project in other words state not only provides funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure franklin reader p 58 franklin points out that technological nature of war requires states to conscript resources needed to pay for hi tech devices designed for destruction thus people opposed to war are forced through taxation to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience franklin reader pp 55 57 peace and social justice in her 1987 paper reflections on theology and peace ursula franklin contends that peace is not absence of war peace is absence of fear franklin reader p 76 she asserts however that fear of war and violence is not only kind of fear that destroys peace she includes fears arising for example from economic insecurity unemployment and lack of adequate shelter franklin points to what she calls threat system which manages people by instilling fear and uncertainty at all levels of society franklin reader pp 69 70 peace is not absence of war peace is absence of fear ursula franklin in ursula franklin reader for her social justice is essential element needed to banish fear and bring peace justice means freedom from oppression but it also implies equality for all in god s eyes she writes all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love similarly in a society of justice and peace all people matter equally franklin reader p 70 franklin suggests that in consumer oriented societies war and violence are inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice she quotes historian lewis mumford s observation that during rise of capitalism sins of greed gluttony avarice envy and luxury became cardinal virtues franklin reader p 71 mumford goes on to argue that moral change that took place under capitalism can be summed up in fact that human purposes human needs and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry people worked not to maintain life but to increase money and power and to minister to ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power mumford lewis 1973 condition of man new york harcourt brace jovanovich inc p 162 franklin extends mumford s argument by pointing to new global realities such as militarized economies dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees any modern theology of peace she writes must i think take into account worldwide drift towards techno fascism anti people anti justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around world franklin reader pp 71 73 globalization as warfare franklin argues that end of cold war brought two main changes first threat of war between united states and soviet union was replaced by regional wars among smaller states second war was transposed to what franklin calls another key struggle for global commercial and economic dominance franklin reader p 115 she asserts that this new form of war is now called globalization and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets franklin reader p 117 this economic warfare defines enemy as all those who care about values of community whatever cannot be merely bought and sold franklin writes whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain loss transactions stands in way of market as enemy territory to be occupied transformed and conquered franklin reader p 118 a main strategy in this kind of warfare is privatization of formerly public domains such as culture health care prisons and education to generate private profit franklin contends that new economic warlords or marketeers aim for example to transform ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for next round of capitalism franklin reader p 124 she argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by puppet governments who run country for benefit of occupiers franklin has also noted that in democratic politics economy is all that seems to matter canada has almost no foreign policy she says but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements franklin recommends that resistance take form of refusing to speak language of occupiers this language includes such terms as stakeholders users health care providers and consumers of education to refer to teachers and students doctors nurses patients and communities franklin reader p 125 franklin also calls for resistance through court challenges and creative use of electronic media to bypass occupation forces control of information finally franklin is a strong supporter of citizen politics a civic movement which focuses on practical solutions to common problems everything from absence of peace to homelessness and local traffic congestion franklin reader p 280 borrowing a quaker term franklin calls on citizens to engage in process of sitting down together to discuss and clarify common moral and political concerns she writes that citizen politics does not seek to overthrow existing governments but to improve them whether those in power like it or not franklin reader p 281 movement also tries to defend communities against those intent in franklin s words on turning globe into one giant commercial resource base while denying a decent and appropriate habitat to many of world s citizens franklin reader p 288 war failure and 9 11 again and again in her writings speeches and interviews ursula franklin insists that war and its violence are not only morally wrong but also ineffective impractical and costly during a radio interview broadcast two days after september 11 attacks in u s franklin argued that violence nowadays is always unsuccessful even for powerful who try to use it nothing has been resolved by violence over past fifty years franklin said rational thinking that force does not work even for enforcer is staring us in face how world has changed an interview broadcast on ideas cbc radio september 13 2001 quoted in franklin reader p 129 in a newspaper article published just before first anniversary of 9 11 franklin wrote it is crucial to recognize that war and war measures are fundamentally dysfunctional instruments of problem solving violence begets more violence war begets further wars more enemies and more suffering on first anniversary of september 11 toronto star august 30 2002 quoted in franklin reader p 135 war does not work not even for warriors ursula franklin on first anniversary of september 11 attacks franklin reader p 135 franklin suggested that it would have been more effective if instead of launching a war on terrorism u s had interpreted attacks as a political earthquake instead of an act of war she argued that social and political structures are as inherently unstable as geological ones geological fissures and human terrorists are created in a context of forces that can be understood and at times mitigated neither can be eliminated by bombing franklin reader pp 134 135 franklin asserts that militarism is ultimate development of hierarchical social structures and threat based systems they all work under implicit assumption that some people matter much less than others and that all people are of interest only as long as they are needed to support system or to justify it franklin reader p 101 she notes that many prominent advocates for women s rights such as jane addams and sylvia pankhurst were pacifists to me struggle for women s rights and opposition to militarism in all its forms are two sides of same coin franklin reader p 102 when a cbc radio interviewer suggested to franklin that her ideas about peace and justice were not connected with what was actually happening in aftermath of 9 11 she readily agreed yes you are quite right they are totally unconnected i have spent best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into stream that makes decisions and i ve been spectacularly unsuccessful that i think is a reflection on my ability in climate of time not on value of thoughts franklin reader p 131 technological society for ursula franklin technology is a set of practices in here and now rather than an array of machines or gadgets franklin reader pp 16 137 it is also a comprehensive system technology involves organization procedures symbols new words equations and most of all a mindset her definition is similar to french thinker jacques ellul s concept of technique like ellul franklin asserts that technological methods dominate modern world technology has built house in which we all live she writes today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house franklin real world p 11 as such technology is a central element of here and now in broadest sense of term here and now is our environment that is all that is around us ever changing overlay of nature built environment institutional and social structures within which human activities take place as well as activities themselves way things are done around here franklin reader p 137 franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect advancement of justice and peace holistic and prescriptive technologies according to ursula franklin technology is not a set of neutral tools methods or practices she asserts that various categories of technology have markedly different social and political effects she distinguishes for example between work related and control related technologies work related technologies such as electric typewriters are designed to make tasks easier computerized word processing makes typing easier still but when computers are linked into work stations part of a system word processing becomes a control related technology now workers can be timed franklin writes assignments can be broken up and interaction between operators can be monitored franklin real world p 18 thumb an ancient chinese bronze ding franklin describes prescriptive methods used in producing such ritual vessels franklin extends distinction between work and control related technologies to larger concept of holistic and prescriptive ones this enables her to consider social implications of how work is performed she writes that holistic technologies are usually associated with craft work artisans be they potters weavers metal smiths or cooks control process of their own work from beginning to finish artisans may specialize in a particular kind of product but they are always in total control of process of production and each thing they make or create is unique franklin real world p 19 prescriptive technologies on other hand break work down into a series of discrete standardized steps each step is carried out by a separate worker or group of workers who need to be familiar only with skills of performing that one step franklin real world p 20 although division of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with industrial revolution franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times chinese bronze casting before 1200 bc for example required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process as well as a strict division of labour franklin describes chinese bronze casting in some detail in real world pp 20 23 franklin writes that when she studied chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me i began to understand what they meant not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning of organization and command franklin real world pp 22 23 technology s culture of compliance franklin argues that in modern society control related and prescriptive technologies are dominant when work is organized as a sequence of separately executable steps control over work moves to organizer boss or manager she writes in political terms prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance franklin real world p 23 emphasis in original for franklin workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary they also come to believe that there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks while we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient they come with an enormous social mortgage mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal and to accept that there is only one way of doing it franklin real world p 24 franklin points out that prescriptive technologies have moved beyond materials production to realms of administration government and social services she argues that tasks which require nurturing or caring for people in health and education for example are best done yet such tasks are increasingly coming under sway of prescriptive technologies based on what franklin calls a production model professor heather menzies an admirer of franklin describes for example how nursing tasks are performed in keeping with preset computerized check lists which leave little discretionary time for dealing with unexpected or talking with patients who are lonely or distressed menzies heather 2005 no time stress and crisis of modern life vancouver douglas mcintyre ltd pp 126 130 franklin herself notes that schools and universities test and promote students based on strict production schedules yet if there ever was a holistic process a process that cannot be divided into rigid predetermined steps it is education franklin real world p 29 technology and power thumb franklin writes that household sewing on machines such as this gave way to industrial production of cheap clothing in sweatshops that exploited female labour ursula franklin rejects idea that powerful technologies automatically determine ways in which people live and work she maintains that uses of technology are not preordained but are result of conscious choices franklin real world p 115 dominant prescriptive technologies establish structures of power and control that follow what franklin sees as male patterns of hierarchy authoritarianism competition and exclusion franklin real world p 103 female workers are often victims of these patterns mechanical sewing machines were introduced in 1851 with promise that they would liberate women from household drudgery but when machines ended up in factory sweatshops to produce cheap clothing new technology was used to exploit female workers franklin real world pp 100 101 a strictly prescriptive technology with classic division of labour arose from introduction of new supposedly liberating domestic machines franklin notes in subsequent evolution of garment industry much of designing cutting and assembling began to be automated often to complete exclusion of workers franklin real world p 101 she points to similar examples in other industries female operators helped introduce telephone only to be replaced by automated switchboards after technology had been successfully established while secretaries struggled to make early mechanical typewriters function properly but ended up performing fragmented and increasingly meaningless tasks franklin real world pp 106 110 many technological systems when examined for context and overall design are basically anti people franklin writes people are seen as sources of problems while technology is seen as a source of solutions franklin real world p 76 as a result people live and work under conditions structured for well being of technology even though manufacturers and promoters always present new technologies as liberating franklin real world p 86 dreams of flight of fast private transportation of instant communication across continents and of helpful machines all stress liberation from hard physical labour at work or drudgery at home franklin real world pp 95 96 but once technologies are accepted and standardized they often enslave or displace their users franklin argues that work could be made less prescriptive in workplaces that are less rigidly hierarchical if we adopted more holistic practices based on way women traditionally work in running households for example or in caring for children franklin real world p 104 communications technologies franklin asserts that powerful communications technologies have reshaped political and social realities distancing people from each other and their immediate environments radio and television for example transmit messages instantaneously from afar messages that are separated from people s experiences in vicinities where they live and work franklin calls such messages pseudorealities she writes they are based on images that are constructed staged and selected to create emotional effects and illusion of being there as a participant not just as an observer franklin real world p 42 she asserts however that one way communications technologies reduce or eliminate reciprocity normal give and take of face to face communication franklin real world pp 48 49 in fact franklin writes that she would like to call these non communications technologies because of their lack of reciprocity according to franklin selective fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced to attract and hold people s attention by focusing on unusual over usual she acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio people can explore other channels of communication but pseudorealities created by media are still there and world is structured to believe in them franklin real world p 44 she argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force and somewhere someone will have to ask how come right to change our mental environment to change constructs of our minds and sounds around us seems to have been given away without anybody s consent franklin real world p 44 franklin s question is somewhat similar to marshall mcluhan s warning about effects of commercial media once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves we don t really have any rights left leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over common speech to a private corporation or like giving earth s atmosphere to a company as a monopoly see mcluhan marshall 2003 understanding media extensions of man critical edition edited by w terrence gordon corte madera ca gingko press inc pp 99 100 silence and commons silence franklin writes possesses striking similarities to aspects of life and community such as unpolluted water air or soil that were once taken as normal and given but have become special and precious in technologically mediated environments franklin reader p 157 she argues that technological ability to separate recorded sound from its source makes sound as permanent as muzak that plays endlessly in public places without anyone s consent franklin reader pp 158 161 for franklin such canned music is a manipulative technology programmed to generate predictable emotional responses and to increase private profit she compares this destruction of silence to british enclosure laws which fenced off commons for private farming franklin reader pp 162 163 franklin maintains that core of strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events quakers she writes worship god in collective silence i think that if any one of you attended a quaker meeting particularly on a regular basis she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology you would find that suddenly out of silence someone will speak about something that had just entered your mind it s an uncanny thing but strength of collective silence is probably one of most powerful spiritual forces franklin reader p 160 franklin advocates defending human right to public silence negotiating one music free elevator for example or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings she also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence franklin reader p 164 personal life in 1952 ursula franklin married fred franklin born 1921 an engineer of german jewish ancestry who had been exposed to quakerism while living in england where he had been sent to boarding school to escape nazis in 1936 and remained until emigrating to canada in 1948 they had no family in canada and after their two children were born they searched for a spiritual home and joined society of friends quakers in 1964 we were pacifists before we were quakers franklin says but it was a very easy transition to quakerism for us and it has been a very good home and an extended family for us and our children franklin spent her last years in a nursing home with fred who survived her she died on july 22 2016 at age of 94 jonathan ursula franklin renowned canadian scientist dead at 94 cbc news jul 23 2016 donation to seneca college in april 2013 franklin donated her extensive collection of writings devoted to chinese culture and history to confucius institute at seneca college in toronto collection included more than 220 texts books publications and journals interpreting chinese culture and history from perspective of western scholars it also contained some of franklin s own working papers and files collection is by seneca archives and special collections a service of seneca libraries https seneca
