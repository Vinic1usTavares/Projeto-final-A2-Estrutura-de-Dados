written by screenwriters zack stentz and ashley edward miller in first several drafts of episode it was initially called this is night mail which was based on a poem by w h auden episode completed gun arc storyline which began with olivia hurtling out of her suv in season premiere and being too weak to control her gun during her physical recovery and ended with killing of shapeshifter posing as charlie francis miller and stentz elaborated i think it s jeff pinkner who described first several episodes as gun arc because really gun played out until olivia was whole again her actions with gun in all of those episodes symbolized where she was on journey and it culminates in her being able to use it to kill someone who looks exactly like her best friend co executive producer joe chappelle worked as episode director he commented i was so looking forward to directing because it was a payoff of a full season and three episodes of work you ve been laying all this groundwork of information for all characters and backstory actors loved doing it because they re earned moments episode was shot in vancouver during summer where temperatures were over 100 degrees fahrenheit executive producer jeff pinkner commented that despite heat guest actor leonard nimoy was doing pages and pages of dialogue and he handled it like a pro while co star joshua jackson joked that nimoy s wife said he practices biofeedback so he knows how to control his body temperature chappelle called episode intriguing because it s a summation of everything that came before it so we re resolving a lot of issues and a lot of questions but it s also a springboard into rest of season actor john noble who played walter bishop called it probably one of our strongest and densest episodes because it changes whole direction of show not knowing when his next billed episode would be nimoy said in an interview before momentum deferred aired that he s waiting to see what these terribly imaginative writers come up with for future i m expecting that i probably will be going back to work for them before too much longer i m looking forward to what they send me on page after shooting episode pinkner said we want him back as much as he wants to come back nimoy s next appearance occurred six episodes later in grey matters as a reference to a brief appearance by nimoy s character william bell sound editor bruce tanis was instructed to create bells as a recurring motif in scene when bell encounters olivia and gives her vital information about parallel universe tanis explained that because he couldn t put sound of bells in everything he took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and reverbed them to become ringing tones that i played underneath whole scene tanis also used some reversed ship s bells as well as crystal glass rubs in order to make bell s office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds he referred to scene as a little ominous but not too cliche prop master rob smith joined series during its second season and had to quickly learn about all gadgets featured in fringes debut season smith was asked to create a neural in script to momentum deferred but didn t really know episodes well enough to say oh ok that s exactly what it is so i talked to director who had been on season 1 and he goes oh i don t know it s just something that goes on guy s head smith discovered that headpiece in question had been rented during first season causing him to recreate prop over one weekend he called this process a little bit stressful gadget smith explained was important because it defined way that walter works he s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it as it were and then thing that struck me about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it smith added it s one of those things that people love and hate about fringe it puts your out of your comfort zone that s sort of what i was trying to say about walter there s kind of a bird s nest of wires everywhere and then they end up on guy s head and from that he can tell what guy s thinking it s quite cool casting thumb upright episode marked only appearance by guest actress theresa russell momentum deferred marked first appearance of guest actor sebastian roche as thomas jerome newton a new recurring villain from parallel universe often referred to as omega man newton was named in honor of english musician david bowie who played a character with same name in film man who fell to earth german actor thomas kretschmann was originally

newton s one scene in episode at end when they show a sewn up head but roche s head instead appears near end of first season in late may 2009 actor kirk acevedo announced he was fired off of show from his facebook page executive producer jeff pinkner denied it soon after explaining that like all things on fringe there is more to this story than meets eye and reminded viewers that an alternate version of his character had already appeared in a first season episode later that summer at comic con in july he reiterated that rumors of charlie s demise are premature and at august television critics association press tour he commented about charlie possibly showing up in previously visited parallel universe momentum deferred marked actor s last appearance in prime universe in response to why character was killed off entertainment weeklys michael ausiello reported that storyline dictated charlie wasn t going to have much to do this season and rather than waste kirk s time they cut him loose character s doppelganger from parallel universe returned in season finale over there despite initial reports stating guest actress theresa russell would be playing a recurring character episode marked her only appearance as an adult version of character russell plays rebecca kibner a former test subject and love interest of walter s a younger version played by actress tegan moss is seen in season premiere a new day in old town in dvd audio commentary writers explained that when they were looking for an actress to play character casting director april webster acting on jeff pinkner s instructions called kibner both a blessing and a curse because writers wanted to explore burden of what it meant to be special one writer explained kibner and walter s past relationship had not been a long term affair but instead more of a little fling episode also marked first appearance of canadian actor ryan mcdonald as recurring character brandon fayette a massive dynamic scientist according to

rating for adults 18 49 this rating helped fox increase 39 in rating share from previous year on their thursday night shows reviews josh wigler from mtv loved revelations from conversation with william bell along with appearance of shapeshifters he thought episode was fringe at its absolute finest as mystery of week and overarching plot worked in complete harmony with one another proving that fringe is entirely capable of delivering on both a serialized and episodic basis entertainment weekly ken tucker praised guest actor leonard nimoy s terrific coolly controlled performance and wrote that he continued to admire way fringe can mind meld its scientific fiction with workplace family drama and light comedy juggling an increasing number of characters and subplots while still maintaining a strong narrative through line a v club noel murray graded episode a b explaining that episode was much better than previous week and also praising introduction of two new characters and long awaited meeting between olivia and william bell murray concluded his review somewhat negatively if whole episode had maintained yes we re aware this is kinda tone of that one great line i d have bumped it up one more notch to a level i m holding back only because momentum deferred was such an info dump and played a fraction too soberly writing for mania com stephen lackey thought alternate universe plotline was risky because it had potential to cause fringe to mak e a complex plot convoluted by taking off in flights of fancy with writing and forgetting what has been written before but he does not believe that point has been reached yet he also thought meeting between olivia and bell wasn t as epic as it has been teased but enjoyed fascinating cliffhanger at end ultimately calling it a good episode website blogger io9 listed momentum deferred as one of crucial episodes new viewers must watch to get into show in january 2013 ign ranked episode as third best of series explaining that early seasons of fringe specialized in putting olivia in dire circumstances and letting her fight her way out like a she boss momentum deferred was one of those episodes and it brought more exciting moments than most series get in a whole season references external links momentum deferred at fox category fringe season 2 episodes category 2009 american television episodes
