byzantine empire and left his nephew tancred in syria to administer antioch two charters show that tancred styled himself prince of antioch in 1108 in september of that year bohemond i was forced to sign treaty of devol which authorized byzantine empire to annex principality of antioch upon his death bohemond i died in apulia in 1111 bohemond ii was still a minor so his mother took charge of

bequeathed antioch to his sister s son roger of salerno roger s legal status during his rule in antioch is uncertain according to william of tyre tancred made roger his successor with understanding that at demand of bohemond or his heirs he should not refuse to return it suggesting that roger was simply regent for child bohemond roger adopted title of prince which implies that he regarded himself ruler of antioch in his own right contemporaneous fulcher of chartres accused roger of depriving of his his own lord son of bohemond i then living in apulia with his mother charters issued in bohemond s italian domains between 1117 and 1119 emphasized that he was son of prince of antioch but did not style him prince after roger and most antiochene noblemen perished in battle of field of

by usama ibn munqidh also occurred during this period bohemond came into conflict with joscelin i of edessa in 1127 although sources do not reveal reason behind enmity of two christian rulers according to runciman joscelin seized former antiochene territories from il bursuqi governor of mosul furthermore bohemond refused to cede azaz to joscelin despite fact that roger of salerno promised it to joscelin as dowry of his second wife maria of salerno taking advantage of bohemond s absence due to a campaign joscelin invaded antioch with assistance of turkish mercenaries plundering villages along frontier bernard of valence latin patriarch of antioch imposed an interdict on county of edessa baldwin ii of jerusalem hurried to syria to mediate between bohemond and joscelin in early 1128
