and polish destroyers then in service but design grew as kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser design work appears to have been rushed and not well thought out as short forecastle and lack of flare at bow compromised ships seakeeping schmolke pp 13 14 and their stability was inadequate groner p 199 only real innovative part of design high pressure water tube boilers were an
