cage belgian film critics association grand prix in a 2005 survey writers guild of america named adaptation 77th best movie screenplay ever written response from susan orlean having been submitted screenplay for approval susan orlean was strongly opposed to making of film she ended up reluctantly approving its production and was ultimately very impressed with final result in 2012 she said reading screenplay was a complete shock my first reaction was absolutely not they had to get my permission and i just said no are you kidding this is going to ruin my career very wisely they didn t really pressure me they told me that everybody else had agreed and i somehow got emboldened it was certainly scary to see movie for first time it took a while for me to get over idea that i had been insane to agree to it but i love movie now orlean called streep s portrayal of her one of my favorite performances by her and appreciated that her version of character was based not on real orlean but on how streep imagined orlean based on orchid thief despite film s fictional parts orlean praised its fidelity to book s spirit what i admire most is that it s very true to book s themes of life and obsession and there are also insights into things which are much more subtle in book about longing and about disappointment kevin perry new yorker s susan orlean on crafting a story and being played
