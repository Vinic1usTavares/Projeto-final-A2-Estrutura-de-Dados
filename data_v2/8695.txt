windows 10 is a series of personal computer operating systems produced by microsoft as part of its windows nt family of operating systems it is successor to windows 8 1 and was released to manufacturing on july 15 2015 and broadly released for retail sale on july 29 2015 windows 10 receives new builds on an ongoing basis which are available at no additional cost to users in addition to additional test builds of windows 10 which are available to windows insiders latest stable build of windows 10 is version 1909 november 2019 update devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower pace or use long term support milestones that only receive critical updates such as security patches over their ten year lifespan of extended support one of windows 10 s most notable features is its support for universal apps an expansion of metro style apps first introduced in windows 8 universal apps can be designed to run across multiple microsoft product families with nearly identical pcs tablets smartphones embedded systems xbox one surface hub and mixed reality windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse oriented interface and a touchscreen optimized interface based on available input on 2 in 1 pcs both interfaces include an updated start menu which incorporates elements of windows 7 s traditional start menu with tiles of windows 8 windows 10 also introduced microsoft edge web browser a virtual desktop system a window and desktop management feature called task view support for fingerprint and face recognition login new security features for enterprise environments and directx 12 windows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release in july 2015 critics praised microsoft s decision to provide a desktop oriented interface in line with previous versions of windows contrasting tablet oriented approach of 8 although windows 10 s touch oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon touch oriented interface of windows 8 critics also praised improvements to windows 10 s bundled software over windows 8 1 xbox live integration as well as functionality and capabilities of cortana personal assistant and replacement of internet explorer with edge however media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors including mandatory update installation privacy concerns over data collection performed by os for microsoft and its partners and adware like tactics used to promote operating system on its release although microsoft s goal to have windows 10 installed on over a billion devices within three years of its release had failed on over 900 million over four years later it still has an estimated usage share of 65 of all windows versions on traditional pcs and thus 50 of traditional pcs were running windows 10 across all platforms pc mobile tablet and console 35 of devices run some kind of windows windows 10 or older development at microsoft worldwide partner conference in 2011 andrew lees chief of microsoft s mobile technologies said that company intended to have a single software ecosystem for pcs phones tablets and other devices we won t have an ecosystem for pcs and one for phones and one for ll all come together in december 2013 technology writer mary jo foley reported that microsoft was working on an update to windows 8 codenamed threshold after a planet in microsoft s halo video game franchise similarly to blue which became windows 8 1 foley called threshold a wave of operating systems across multiple microsoft platforms and services scheduled for second quarter of 2015 foley reported that among goals for threshold was to create a unified application platform and development toolkit for windows windows phone and xbox one which all use a similar windows nt kernel in april 2014 at build conference microsoft s terry myerson unveiled an updated version of windows 8 1 build that added ability to run windows store apps inside desktop windows and a more traditional start menu in place of start screen seen in windows 8 new start menu takes after windows 7 s design by using only a portion of screen and including a windows 7 style application listing in first column second column displays windows 8 style app tiles myerson said that these changes would occur in a future update but did not elaborate microsoft also unveiled concept of a universal windows app allowing windows store apps created for windows 8 1 to be ported to windows phone 8 1 and xbox one while sharing a common codebase with an interface designed for different device form factors and allowing user data and licenses for an app to be shared between multiple platforms windows phone 8 1 would share nearly 90 of common windows runtime apis with windows 8 1 on pcs screenshots of a windows build which purported to be threshold were leaked in july 2014 showing previously presented start menu and windowed windows store apps followed by a further screenshot in september 2014 of a build identifying itself as windows technical preview numbered 9834 showing a new virtual desktop system a notification center and a new file explorer icon announcement threshold was officially unveiled during a media event on september 30 2014 under name windows 10 myerson said that windows 10 would be microsoft s most comprehensive platform ever providing a single unified platform for desktop computers laptops tablets smartphones and all in one devices he emphasized that windows 10 would take steps towards restoring user interface mechanics from windows 7 to improve experience for users on non touch devices noting criticism of windows 8 s touch oriented interface by keyboard and mouse users despite these concessions myerson noted that touch oriented interface would evolve as well on 10 in regards to microsoft naming new operating system windows 10 instead of windows 9 terry myerson said that based on product that s coming and just how different our approach will be overall it wouldn t be right to call it windows 9 he also joked that they could not call it windows one alluding to several recent microsoft products with a similar brand such as onedrive and xbox one because windows 1 0 already existed tony prophet microsoft vice president of windows marketing said at a san francisco conference in october 2014 that windows 9 came and went and that windows 10 is not an incremental step from windows 8 1 but a material step we re trying to create one platform one eco system that unites as many of devices from small embedded internet of things through tablets through phones through pcs and ultimately into xbox further details surrounding windows 10 s consumer oriented features were presented during another media event held on january 21 2015 entitled windows 10 next chapter keynote featured unveiling of cortana integration within operating system new xbox oriented features windows 10 mobile an updated office mobile suite surface large screened windows 10 device for enterprise collaboration based upon perceptive pixel technology along with hololens augmented reality eyewear and an associated platform for building apps that can render holograms through hololens additional developer oriented details surrounding universal windows platform concept were revealed and discussed during microsoft s developers conference build among them were unveiling of which provides a middleware toolchain for compiling objective c based software particularly ios software to run as universal apps on windows 10 and windows 10 mobile a port of candy crush saga made using toolkit which shared much of its code with ios version was demonstrated alongside announcement that king developed game would be bundled with windows 10 at launch release on june 1 2015 microsoft announced that windows 10 would be released on july 29 2015 microsoft began an advertising campaign centering on windows 10 upgrade your world on july 20 2015 with premiere of television commercials in australia canada france germany japan united kingdom and united states commercials focused on tagline a more human way to do emphasizing new features and technologies supported by windows 10 that sought to provide a more personal experience to users campaign culminated with launch events in thirteen cities on july 29 which celebrated unprecedented role our biggest fans played in development of windows 10 features windows 10 makes its user experience and functionality more consistent between different classes of device and addresses shortcomings in user interface that were introduced in windows 8 windows 10 mobile successor to windows phone 8 1 shared some user interface elements and apps with its pc counterpart windows runtime app ecosystem was revised into universal windows platform uwp these universal apps are made to run across multiple platforms and device classes including smartphones tablets xbox one consoles and other compatible windows 10 devices windows apps share code across platforms have responsive designs that adapt to needs of device and available inputs can synchronize data between windows 10 devices including notifications credentials and allowing cross platform multiplayer for games and are distributed through microsoft store rebranded from windows store since september 2017 developers can allow cross buys where purchased licenses for an app apply to all of user s compatible devices rather than only one they purchased on e g a user purchasing an app on pc is also entitled to use smartphone version at no extra cost on windows 10 microsoft store serves as a unified storefront for apps video content and ebooks windows 10 also allows web apps and desktop software using either win32 or net framework to be packaged for distribution on microsoft store desktop software distributed through windows store is packaged using app v system to allow sandboxing user interface and desktop thumb left task view display is a new feature to windows 10 allowing use of multiple workspaces a new iteration of start menu is used on windows 10 desktop with a list of places and other options on left side and tiles representing applications on right menu can be resized and expanded into a full screen display which is default option in tablet mode a new virtual desktop system was added a feature known as task view displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them or switch between multiple workspaces universal apps which previously could be used only in full screen mode can now be used in self contained windows similarly to other programs program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of screen by dragging them to corner when a window is snapped to one side of screen task view appears and user is prompted to choose a second window to fill unused side of screen called snap assist windows system icons were also changed charms have been removed their functionality in universal apps is accessed from an app commands menu on their title bar in its place is action center which displays notifications and settings toggles it is accessed by clicking an icon in notification area or dragging from right of screen notifications can be synced between multiple devices settings app formerly pc settings was refreshed and now includes more options that were previously exclusive to desktop control panel windows 10 is designed to adapt its user interface based on type of device being used and available input methods it offers two separate user interface modes a user interface optimized for mouse and keyboard and a tablet mode designed for touchscreens users can toggle between these two modes at any time and windows can prompt or automatically switch when certain events occur such as disabling tablet mode on a tablet if a keyboard or mouse is plugged in or when a 2 in 1 pc is switched to its laptop state in tablet mode programs default to a maximized view and taskbar contains a back button and hides buttons for opened or pinned programs task view is used instead to switch between programs full screen start menu is used in this mode similarly to windows 8 but scrolls vertically instead of horizontally system security thumb windows hello unlock prompt on a surface pro 4 while using a password manager windows 10 incorporates multi factor authentication technology based upon standards developed by fido alliance operating system includes improved support for biometric authentication through windows hello platform devices with supported cameras requiring infrared illumination such as intel allow users to log in with iris or face recognition similarly to kinect devices with supported readers allow users to log in through fingerprint recognition support was also added for palm vein scanning through a partnership with fujitsu in february 2018 credentials are stored locally and protected using asymmetric encryption in addition to biometric authentication windows hello supports authentication with a pin by default windows requires a pin to consist of four digits but can be configured to permit more complex pins however a pin is not a simpler password while passwords are transmitted to domain controllers pins are not they are tied to one device and if compromised only one device is affected backed by a trusted platform module tpm chip windows uses pins to create strong asymmetric key pairs as such authentication token transmitted to server is harder to crack in addition whereas weak passwords may be broken via rainbow tables tpm causes much simpler windows pins to be resilient to brute force attacks while this is not a security vulnerability and can be easily mitigated by using option in bios tools like kon boot an be used in order to bypass windows 10 authentication including both local passwords online live pin passwords when windows 10 was first introduced multi factor authentication was provided by two components windows hello and passport not to be confused with passport platform of 1998 later passport was merged into windows hello enterprise version of windows 10 offers additional security features administrators can set up policies for automatic encryption of sensitive data selectively block applications from accessing encrypted data and enable device guarda system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or microsoft device guard is designed to protect against zero day exploits and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from operating system itself on august 11 2019 researchers reported that windows 10 users may be at risk for critical system compromise due to design flaws of hardware device drivers from multiple providers also in august 2019 computer experts reported that bluekeep security vulnerability that potentially affects older microsoft windows versions via program s remote desktop protocol allowing for possibility of remote code execution may now include related flaws collectively named affecting newer windows versions i e windows 7 and all recent versions including windows 10 as well in addition experts reported a microsoft security vulnerability based on legacy code involving microsoft ctf and ctfmon ctfmon exe that affects all windows versions from older windows xp version to most recent windows 10 versions a patch to correct flaw is currently available command line win32 console windows can now be resized without any restrictions can be made to cover full screen by pressing and can use standard keyboard shortcuts such as those for cut copy and paste other features such as word wrap and transparency were also added these functions can be disabled to revert to legacy console if needed anniversary update adds windows subsystem for linux which allows installation of a user space environment from a supported linux distribution that runs natively on windows subsystem translates linux system calls that linux system uses to those of windows nt kernel environment can execute bash shell and 64 bit command line programs windows applications cannot be executed from linux environment and vice versa linux distributions for windows subsystem for linux are obtained through microsoft store feature initially supported an ubuntu based environment microsoft announced in may 2017 that it would add fedora and environment options as well storage requirements to reduce storage footprint of operating system windows 10 automatically compresses system files system can reduce storage footprint of windows by approximately 1 5gb for 32 bit systems and 2 for 64 bit systems level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by oems which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance furthermore refresh and reset functions use runtime system files instead making a separate recovery partition redundant allowing patches and updates to remain installed following operation and further reducing amount of space required for windows 10 by up to these functions replace mode introduced on windows 8 1 update which allowed oems to configure low capacity devices with flash based storage to use windows system files out of compressed wim image typically used for installation and recovery windows 10 also includes a function in its settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device s storage capacity is being used by different types of files and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an sd card by default online services and functionality windows 10 introduces a new default web browser microsoft edge it features a new standards compliant rendering engine forked from trident annotation tools and offers integration with other microsoft platforms present within windows 10 internet explorer 11 is maintained on windows 10 for compatibility purposes but is deprecated in favor of edge and will no longer be actively developed windows 10 incorporates microsoft s intelligent personal assistant cortana which was first introduced with windows phone 8 1 in 2014 cortana replaced windows embedded search feature supporting both text and voice input many of its features are a direct carryover from windows phone including integration with bing setting reminders a notebook feature for managing personal information as well as searching for files playing music launching applications and setting reminders or sending emails cortana is implemented as a universal search box located alongside start and task view buttons which can be hidden or condensed to a single button microsoft family safety is replaced by microsoft family a parental controls system that applies across windows platforms and microsoft online services users can create a designated family and monitor and restrict actions of users designated as children such as access to websites enforcing age ratings on microsoft store purchases and other restrictions service can also send weekly e mail reports to parents detailing a child s computer usage unlike previous versions of windows child accounts in a family must be associated with a microsoft allows these settings to apply across all windows 10 devices that a particular child is using windows 10 also offers wi fi sense feature originating from windows phone 8 1 users can optionally have their device automatically connect to suggested open hotspots and share their home network s password with contacts either via skype people or facebook so they may automatically connect to network on a windows 10 device without needing to manually enter its password credentials are stored in an encrypted form on microsoft servers and sent to devices of selected contacts passwords are not viewable by guest user and guest user is not allowed to access other computers or devices on network wi fi sense is not usable on 802 1x encrypted networks adding at end of will also block corresponding network from being used for this feature universal calling and messaging apps for windows 10 are built in as of november 2015 update messaging skype video and phone these offer built in alternatives to skype download and sync with windows 10 mobile multimedia and gaming windows 10 provides heavier integration with xbox ecosystem xbox smartglass is succeeded by xbox console companion formerly xbox app which allows users to browse their game library including both pc and xbox console games and game dvr is also available using a keyboard shortcut allowing users to save last 30 seconds of gameplay as a video that can be shared to xbox live onedrive or elsewhere windows 10 also allows users to control and play games from an xbox one console over a local network xbox live sdk allows application developers to incorporate xbox live functionality into their apps and future wireless xbox one accessories such as controllers are supported on windows with an adapter microsoft also intends to allow cross buys and save synchronization between xbox one and windows 10 versions of games microsoft studios games such as and quantum break are intended as being exclusive to windows 10 and xbox one candy crush saga and microsoft solitaire collection are also automatically installed upon installation of windows 10 windows 10 adds native game recording and screenshot capture ability using newly introduced game bar users can also have os continuously record gameplay in background which then allows user to save last few moments of gameplay to storage device windows 10 adds flac and and support for media container allowing these formats to be opened in windows media player and other applications directx 12 windows 10 includes directx 12 alongside wddm 2 0 unveiled march 2014 at gdc directx 12 aims to provide console level efficiency with closer to metal access to hardware resources and reduced cpu and graphics driver overhead most of performance improvements are achieved through low level programming which allow developers to use resources more efficiently and reduce single threaded cpu caused by abstraction through higher level apis directx 12 will also feature support for vendor agnostic multi gpu setups wddm 2 0 introduces a new virtual memory management and allocation system to reduce workload on kernel mode driver fonts

sold at retail in most countries and as pre loaded software on new computers home is aimed at home users while pro is aimed at small businesses each edition of windows10 includes all of capabilities and features of edition below it and add additional features oriented towards their market segments for example pro adds additional networking and security features such as bitlocker device guard windows update for business and ability to join a domain remaining editions enterprise and education contain additional features aimed towards business environments and are only available through volume licensing as part of microsoft s unification strategies windows products that are based on windows 10 s common platform but meant for specialized platforms are marketed as editions of operating system rather than as separate product lines an updated version of microsoft s windows phone operating system for smartphones and also tablets was branded as windows 10 mobile editions of enterprise and mobile will also be produced for embedded systems along with windows 10 iot core which is designed specifically for use in small footprint low cost devices and internet of things iot scenarios and is similar to windows embedded on may 2 2017 microsoft unveiled windows 10 s referred to in leaks as windows 10 cloud a feature limited version of windows 10 which was designed primarily for devices in education market competing in particular with chrome os netbooks such as surface laptop that microsoft also unveiled at this time os restricts software installation to applications obtained from microsoft store device may be upgraded to windows 10 pro for a fee to enable unrestricted software installation as a time limited promotion microsoft stated that this upgrade would be free on surface laptop until march 31 2018 windows 10 s also contains a faster initial setup and login process and allows devices to be provisioned using a usb drive with windows intune for education platform in march 2018 microsoft announced that windows 10 s would be deprecated due to market confusion and would be replaced by s mode an oem option wherein windows defaults to only allowing applications to be installed from microsoft store but does not require payment in order to disable these restrictions preview releases a public beta program for windows10 known as windows insider program began with first publicly available preview release on october 1 2014 insider preview builds are aimed towards enthusiasts and enterprise users for testing and evaluation of updates and new features users of windows insider program receive occasional updates to newer preview builds of operating system and will continue to be able to evaluate preview releases after general availability ga in july is in contrast to previous windows beta programs where public preview builds were released less frequently and only during months preceding ga windows insider builds continued being released after release to manufacturing rtm of windows10 public release microsoft promoted that windows 10 would become generally available ga on july 29 2015 in comparison to previous windows releases which had a longer turnover between release to manufacturing rtm and general release to allow for testing by vendors and in some cases development of upgrade kits to prepare systems for installation of new version an hp inc executive explained that because it knew microsoft targeted operating system for a release in 2015 company was able to optimize its then current and upcoming products for windows 10 in advance of its release negating need for such a milestone general availability build of windows10 numbered 10240 was first released on july 15 2015 to windows insider channels for pre launch testing prior to its formal release although a microsoft official said that there would be no specific rtm build of windows 10 10240 was described as an rtm build by media outlets because it was released to all windows insider members at once rather than to users on fast ring first it no longer carried pre release branding and desktop watermark text and because its build number had mathematical connections to in reference to operating system s naming enterprise edition was released to volume licensing on august 1 2015 users are able to in place upgrade through get windows10 application gwx and windows update or media creation tool which is functionally identical to windows 8 online installer and can also be used to generate an iso image or usb install media in place upgrades are supported from most editions of windows 7 with service pack 1 and windows8 1 with update 1 while users with windows8 must first upgrade to windows8 1 changing between architectures e g upgrading from 32 bit edition to a 64 bit editions via in place upgrades is not supported a clean install is required in place upgrades may be rolled back to device s previous version of windows provided that have not passed since installation and backup files were not removed using disk cleanup windows 10 was available in and 111 languages upon its launch and as part of efforts to re engage with users in china microsoft also announced that it would partner with and tencent to help promote and distribute windows10 in china and that chinese pc maker lenovo would provide assistance at its service centers and retail outlets for helping users upgrade to windows10 at retail windows 10 is priced similarly to editions of windows 8 1 with u s prices set at 119 and 199 for windows and pro respectively a windows 10 pro pack license allows upgrades from windows 10 home to windows 10 pro retail copies only ship on usb flash drive media however system builder copies still shipped as dvd rom media new devices shipping with windows10 were also released during operating system s launch window windows rt devices cannot be upgraded to windows10 free upgrade offer during its first year of availability ended on july 29 2016 upgrade licenses for windows10 could be obtained at no charge for devices with a genuine license for an eligible edition of windows7 or8 1 this offer did not apply to enterprise editions as customers under an active software assurance sa contract with upgrade rights are entitled to obtain windows 10 enterprise under their existing terms all users running non genuine copies of windows and those without an existing windows7 or8 license were ineligible for this promotion although upgrades from a non genuine version were possible they result in a non genuine copy on general availability build of windows10 version 1507 to activate and generate digital entitlement for windows10 operating system must have first been installed as an in place upgrade during free upgrade a xml file is created in background and system s motherboard details are registered with a microsoft product activation server once installed operating system can be reinstalled on that particular system via normal means without a product key and system s license will automatically be detected via online activation in essence microsoft product activation server will remember system s motherboard and give it green light for product re activation due to installation issues with upgrade only installs in november 2015 windows 10 version 1511 was released with additional activation mechanisms this build treated windows7 and windows8 8 1 product keys as windows10 product keys meaning they could be entered during installation to activate free license without need to upgrade first to activate hardware with microsoft s activation servers for major original equipment manufacturers oems windows 8 8 1 and windows 10 oem product keys are embedded in firmware of motherboard and if correct edition of windows 10 is present on installation media they are automatically inputted during installation since release of windows 10 version 1709 microsoft decided to release multi edition installation media to alleviate installation and product activation issues users experienced due to accidentally installing wrong edition of windows 10 despite 1 year free upgrade offer having long expired all activation mechanisms involving windows 7 and windows 8 keys still work with all subsequent builds of windows 10 even windows 7 and windows 8 8 1 product keys that have never been used for a previous windows 10 installation windows insider preview version of windows10 automatically updated itself to generally released version as part of version progression and continues to be updated to new beta builds as it had throughout testing process microsoft explicitly stated that windows insider was not a valid upgrade path for those running a version of windows that is ineligible for upgrade offer although if it was not installed with a license carried over from an in place upgrade to 10 insider preview from windows7 or8 insider preview does remain activated as long as user does not exit windows insider program offer was promoted and delivered via get windows10 application gwx which was automatically installed via windows update ahead of windows 10 s release and activated on systems deemed eligible for upgrade offer via a notification area icon users could access an application that advertised windows10 and free upgrade offer check device compatibility and reserve an automatic download of operating system upon its release on july 28 a pre download process began in which windows10 installation files were downloaded to some computers that had reserved it microsoft said that those who reserved windows10 would be able to install it through gwx in a phased rollout process operating system could alternatively be downloaded at any time using a separate media creation tool setup program similar to windows8 s setup program that allows for creation of dvd or usb installation media microsoft announced in may 2016 that free upgrade offer would be extended to users of assistive technologies however microsoft did not implement any means of certifying eligibility for this offer which some outlets thereby promoted as being a loophole to fraudulently obtain a free windows 10 upgrade microsoft said that loophole is not intended to be used in this manner in november 2017 microsoft stated that this program would end december 31 2017 licensing during upgrades windows10 licenses are not tied directly to a product key instead license status of system s current installation of windows is migrated and a digital license also known as digital entitlement in version 1511 or earlier is generated during activation process which is bound to hardware information collected during process if windows10 is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation such as a motherboard change online activation process will automatically recognize system s digital entitlement if no product key is entered during installations however unique product keys are still distributed within retail copies of windows10 as with previous non volume licensed versions of windows significant hardware changes will invalidate digital entitlement and require windows to be re activated updates and support unlike previous versions of windows windows update does not allow selective installation of updates and all updates including patches feature updates and driver software are downloaded and installed automatically users can only choose whether their system will reboot automatically to install updates when system is inactive or be notified to schedule a reboot if a wireless network is designated as metered a function which automatically reduces operating system s background network activity to conserve limits on internet usage most updates are not downloaded until device is connected to a non metered network redstone 2 allows wired ethernet networks to be designated as metered but windows may still download certain updates while connected to a metered network updates can cause compatibility or other problems a microsoft troubleshooter program allows bad updates to be uninstalled windows update can also use a peer to peer system for distributing updates by default users bandwidth is used to distribute previously downloaded updates to other users in combination with microsoft servers users can instead choose to only use peer to peer updates within their local area network original rtm release of windows10 windows10 released in july 2015 receives mainstream support for five years after its original release followed by five years of extended support but this is subject to conditions microsoft s support lifecycle policy for operating system notes that updates are cumulative with each update built upon all of updates that preceded it that a device needs to install latest update to remain supported and that a device s ability to receive future updates will depend on hardware compatibility driver availability and whether device is within oem s support period a new aspect not accounted for in lifecycle policies for previous versions this policy was first invoked in 2017 to block intel clover trail devices from receiving creators update as microsoft asserts that future updates require additional hardware support to provide best possible experience and that intel no longer provided support or drivers for platform microsoft stated that these devices would no longer receive feature updates but would still receive security updates through january 2023 feature updates windows 10 is often described by microsoft as being a service as it receives regular feature updates that contain new features and other updates and fixes in april 2017 microsoft stated that in future these updates would be released twice a year every march and september pace at which feature updates are received by devices is dependent on which release channel is used default branch for all users of windows10 home and pro is semi annual channel targeted formerly current branch or cb which receives stable builds after they are publicly released by microsoft each build of windows 10 is supported for 18 months after its original release in enterprise environments microsoft officially intends that this branch is used for targeted deployments of newly released stable versions so that they can be evaluated and tested on a limited number of devices before a wider deployment once a stable build is certified by microsoft and its partners as being suitable for broad deployment build is then released on semi annual channel formerly current branch for business or cbb which is supported by pro and enterprise editions of windows 10 semi annual channel receives stable builds on a four month delay from their release on targeted channel administrators can also use windows update for business system as well as existing tools such as and system center configuration manager to organize structured deployments of feature updates across their networks windows insider branches receive unstable builds as they are released it is divided into two channels fast which receives new builds immediately after their release and slow whose releases are slightly delayed from their fast release enterprise licensees may use windows 10 enterprise ltsc formerly ltsb edition where ltsc stands for long term servicing channel which only receive quality of life updates i e security patches and has a full 10 year support lifecycle for each build this edition is designed for special purpose devices that perform a fixed function such as automated teller machines and medical equipment for this reason it excludes cortana microsoft store and all bundled universal windows platform apps including but not limited to microsoft edge hence these builds ship only with internet explorer as browser microsoft director stella explained that we have businesses that may have mission critical environments where we respect fact they want to test and stabilize environment for a long time three ltsc builds have been released correlating with 1507 1607 and 1809 versions of windows 10 respectively mainstream builds of windows 10 are labeled with yy representing two digit year and mm representing month of release for example version 1809 was released in september ninth month of 2018 in july 2017 microsoft announced changes in terminology for windows branches as part of its effort to unify update cadence with that of office 365 and windows server 2016 branch system now defines two paces of upgrade deployment in enterprise environments targeted initial deployment of a new version on selected systems immediately after its stable release for final testing and broad deployment afterwards hence current branch is now known as semi annual channel targeted and current branch for business for broad deployment is now referred to as semi annual channel in february 2019 microsoft announced changes again in delivering updates in beginning next feature update a single sac will be released and sac t will be retired and users are no longer able to switch to different channels instead these updates can be deferred from 30 60 or 90 days or depending how device was configured to deferred updates in april 2019 it was announced that in addition feature updates will no longer be automatically pushed to

system previously codenamed project neon a revamp of microsoft design language 2 that will include guidelines for designs and interactions used within software designed for all windows 10 devices and platforms new design language will include more prominent use of motion depth and translucency effects microsoft stated that implementation of this design language would be performed over time and it had already started to implement elements of it in creators update and fall creators update on december 7 2016 microsoft announced that as part of a partnership with qualcomm it planned to introduce support for running win32 software on arm architecture with a 32 bit x86 processor emulator in 2017 terry myerson stated that this move would enable production of qualcomm snapdragon based windows devices with cellular connectivity and improved power efficiency over intel compatible devices and still capable of running majority of existing windows software unlike previous windows rt which was restricted to windows store apps microsoft is initially targeting this project towards laptops microsoft launched branding always connected pcs in december 2017 to market windows 10 devices with cellular connectivity which included two arm based 2 in 1 laptops from asus and hp featuring snapdragon 835 system on chip and announcement of a partnership between amd and qualcomm to integrate its snapdragon x16 gigabit lte modem with amd s ryzen mobile platform in august 2019 microsoft began testing changes to its handling of user interface on convertible devices downplaying existing tablet mode option in favor of presenting normal desktop with optimizations for touch when a keyboard is not present such as increasing space between taskbar buttons and displaying virtual keyboard when text fields are selected system requirements hardware requirements for windows 10 component minimum recommended processor 1ghz clock 32 or x86 64 architecture with support for pae nx and 64 cpus must also

attention hardware equivalent of or key sequence secure boot uefi v2 3 1 errata b with microsoft windows certification authority in its database speech recognition microphone windows hello illuminated infrared camera basic hardware requirements to install windows 10 were initially same as for windows 8 1 and windows 8 and only slightly higher than windows 7 as of may 2019 update minimum disk space requirement has been increased to 32 gb in addition on new installations windows permanently reserves up to 7 gb of disk space in order to ensure proper installation of future feature updates 64 bit versions require a cpu that supports certain instructions devices with low storage capacity must provide a usb flash drive or sd card with sufficient storage for temporary files during upgrades some pre built devices may be described as certified by microsoft certified tablets must include and keys and keys are no longer required as with windows 8 all certified devices must ship with uefi secure boot enabled by default unlike windows 8 oems are no longer required to make secure boot settings user configurable meaning that devices may optionally be locked to run only microsoft signed operating systems a supported infrared illuminated camera is required for windows hello face authentication and a supported fingerprint reader is required for windows hello fingerprint authentication device guard requires a uefi system with no third party certificates loaded and cpu virtualization extensions including slat and enabled in firmware beginning with intel lake and amd bristol ridge windows 10 is only version of windows that microsoft will officially support on newer cpu terry myerson stated that microsoft did not want to make further investments in optimizing older versions of windows and associated software for newer generations of processors these policies were criticized by media who especially noted that microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware particularly intel s cpus which was also originally targeted by new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted on windows 8 1 a version of windows that was still in mainstream support until january 2018 in addition an enthusiast created modification was released that disabled check and allowed windows 8 1 and earlier to continue to work on platform windows 10 creators update and later does not support intel clover trail system on chips per microsoft s stated policy of only providing updates for devices during their oem support period reception critics characterized initial release of windows 10 in july 2015 as being rushed citing incomplete state of some of operating system s bundled software such as edge web browser as well as stability of operating system itself on launch however techradar felt that windows10 would be new windows7 citing operating system s more familiar user interface improvements to bundled apps performance improvements a rock solid search system and settings app being more full featured than its equivalents 1 microsoft edge web browser was praised for its performance although it was not in a feature complete state at launch while considering them a great idea in principle concerns were shown for microsoft s focus on universal app ecosystem noting that it s by no means certain that developers are going to flock to windows10 from ios and android simply because they can convert their apps easily it may well become a no brainer for them but at moment a conscious decision is still required engadget was similarly positive noting that upgrade process was painless and that windows10 s user interface had balanced aspects of windows8 with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic cortana s always on voice detection was considered to be its true strength also citing its query capabilities and personalization features but noting that it was not as pre emptive as google now windows10 s stock applications were praised for being improved over their windows 8 counterparts and for supporting windowed modes xbox app was also praised for its xbox one streaming functionality although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over wi fi in conclusion it was argued that windows10 delivers most refined desktop experience ever from microsoft and yet it s so much more than that it s also a decent tablet os and it s ready for a world filled with hybrid devices and barring another baffling it looks like a significant step forward for mobile heck it makes xbox one a more useful machine ars technica panned new tablet mode interface for removing charms and app switching making start button harder to use by requiring users to reach for button on bottom left rather than at center of screen when swiping with a thumb and for making application switching less instantaneous through use of task view microsoft edge was praised for being tremendously promising and a much better browser than internet explorer ever was but criticized it for its lack of functionality on launch in conclusion contrasting windows8 as being a reliable platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts windows10 was considered best windows yet and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be comfortable and effective across a wide array of form factors but that it was than previous versions of windows were on launch extremetech felt that windows10 restricted choices of users citing its more opaque setting menus forcing users to give up bandwidth for peer to peer distribution of updates and for taking away user control of specific functions such as updates explaining that it feels once again as if microsoft has taken seed of a good idea like providing users with security updates automatically and shoved throttle to maximum critics have noted that windows10 heavily emphasizes freemium services and contains various advertising facilities some outlets have considered these to be a hidden cost of free upgrade offer examples of these have included microtransactions in bundled games such as microsoft solitaire collection default settings that display promotions of suggested apps in start menu and tips on lock screen that may contain advertising ads displayed in file explorer for office 365 subscriptions on creators update and various advertising notifications displayed by default which promote microsoft edge when it is not set as default web browser including in a september 2018 build nag pop ups displayed to interrupt installation process of competitors market share and sales up to august 2016 windows 10 usage was increasing with it then plateauing while eventually in 2018 it became more popular than windows 7 though in 2019 windows 7 is still more used in some countries in asia and africa operating system is running on more than 800 million devices twenty four hours after it was released microsoft announced that more than 14million devices were running windows10 on august 26 microsoft said more than 75million devices were running windows10 in and on more than 90 000 unique pc or tablet models according to terry myerson there were more than devices running windows10 as of october 6 2015 on january 4 2016 microsoft reported that windows10 had been activated on more than 200million devices since operating system s launch in july 2015 according to statcounter windows 10 overtook windows 8 1 in december 2015 iceland was first country where windows 10 was ranked first not only on desktop but across all platforms with several larger european countries following for one week late in november 2016 windows 10 overtook first rank from windows 7 in united states before losing it again by february 2017 windows 10 was losing market share to windows 7 in middle of january 2018 windows 10 had a slightly higher global market share than windows 7 with it noticeably more popular on weekends while popularity varies widely by region e g windows 10 was then still behind in africa and far ahead in some other regions e g oceania update system changes windows 10 home is permanently set to download all updates automatically including cumulative updates security patches and drivers and users cannot individually select updates to install or not microsoft offers a diagnostic tool that can be used to hide updates and prevent them from being reinstalled but only after they had been already installed then uninstalled without rebooting system tom warren of verge felt that given web browsers such as google chrome had already adopted such an automatic update system such a requirement would help to keep all windows10 devices secure and felt that if you re used to family members calling you for technical support because they ve failed to upgrade to latest windows service pack or some malware disabled windows update then those days will hopefully be over concerns were raised that due to these changes users would be unable to skip automatic installation of updates that are faulty or cause issues with certain system configurations although build upgrades will also be subject to public beta testing via windows insider program there were also concerns that forced installation of driver updates through windows update where they were previously designated as optional could cause conflicts with drivers that were installed independently of windows update an example of such a situation occurred just prior to general release of operating system when an nvidia graphics card driver that was automatically pushed to windows10 users via windows update caused issues that prevented use of certain functions or prevented their system from booting at all criticism was also directed towards microsoft s decision to no longer provide specific details on contents of cumulative updates for windows 10 on february 9 2016 microsoft retracted this decision and began to provide release notes for cumulative updates on windows website some users reported that during installation of november upgrade some applications particularly utility programs such as cpu z and were automatically uninstalled during upgrade process and some default programs were reset to microsoft specified defaults such as photos app and microsoft edge for pdf viewing both without warning further issues were discovered upon launch of anniversary update redstone including a bug that caused some devices to freeze but addressed by cumulative update released on august 31 2016 and that fundamental changes to how windows handles webcams had caused many to stop working in june 2017 a redstone 3 insider build which is known as rs iot on mobile was accidentally released to insider as well as non insider users on all windows 10 pcs and mobile but update was retracted with microsoft apologizing and releasing a note on their windows insider program blog describing how to prevent build from being installed on their device according to dona sarkar because an inadvertent deployment to engineering system that controls which builds which rings to push out to insiders a gartner analyst felt that windows 10 pro was becoming increasingly inappropriate for use in enterprise environments due to support policy changes by microsoft including consumer oriented upgrade lifecycle length and only offering extended support for individual builds to enterprise and education editions of windows 10 critics have acknowledged that microsoft s update and testing practices had been affecting overall quality of windows 10 in particular it was pointed out that microsoft s internal testing departments had been prominently affected by a major round of layoffs undertaken by company in 2014 microsoft relies primarily on user testing and bug reports via windows insider program which may not always be of sufficient quality to identify a bug as well as correspondence with oems and other stakeholders in wake of known folder redirection data loss bug in version 1809 it was pointed out that bug reports describing issue had been present on feedback hub app for several months prior to public release following incident microsoft updated feedback hub so that users may specify severity of a particular bug report when announcing resumption of 1809 s rollout microsoft stated that it planned to be more transparent in its handling of update quality in future through a series of blog posts that will detail its testing process and planned development of a dashboard that will indicate rollout progress of future updates distribution practices microsoft was criticized for tactics that it used to promote its free upgrade campaign for windows 10 including adware like behaviours using deceptive user interfaces to coax users into installing operating system downloading installation files without user consent and making it difficult for users to suppress advertising and notifications if they did not wish to upgrade to 10 upgrade offer was marketed and initiated using get windows 10 gwx application which was first downloaded and installed via windows update in march 2015 registry keys and group policies could be used to partially disable gwx mechanism but installation of patches to gwx software via windows update could reset these keys back to defaults and thus reactivate software third party programs were also created to assist users in applying measures to disable gwx in september 2015 it was reported that microsoft was triggering automatic downloads of windows 10 installation files on all compatible windows 7 or 8 1 computers configured to automatically download and install updates regardless of whether or not they had specifically requested upgrade microsoft officially confirmed change claiming it was an industry practice that reduces time for installation and ensures device readiness this move was criticized by users who have data caps or devices with low storage capacity as resources were consumed by automatic downloads of up to 6 gb of data other critics argued that microsoft should not have triggered any downloading of windows 10 installation files without user consent in october 2015 windows 10 began to appear as an optional update in windows update interface but pre selected for installation on some systems a microsoft spokesperson said that this was a mistake and that download would no longer be pre selected by default however on october 29 2015 microsoft announced that it planned to classify windows 10 as a recommended update in windows update interface some time in 2016 which will cause an automatic download of installation files and a one time prompt with a choice to install to appear in december 2015 it was reported that a new advertising dialog had begun to appear only containing upgrade now and upgrade tonight buttons and no obvious method to decline installation besides close button in march 2016 some users also alleged that their windows 7 and 8 1 devices had automatically begun upgrading to 10 without their consent in june 2016 gwx dialog s behavior changed to make closing window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade despite this an infoworld editor disputed claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all testing showed that upgrade to windows 10 would only begin once user accepts end user license agreement eula presented by its installer and that not doing so would eventually cause windows update to time out with an error thus halting installation attempt it was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked accept prompt without full knowledge that this would begin upgrade in december 2016 microsoft chief marketing officer chris admitted that company had gone too far by using this tactic stating that we know we want people to be running windows 10 from a security perspective but finding right balance where you re not stepping over line of being too aggressive is something we tried and for a lot of year i think we got it right on january 21 2016 microsoft was sued in small claims court by a user whose computer shortly after release of os had attempted to upgrade to windows 10 without her consent upgrade failed and her computer was left in a broken state thereafter which disrupted ability to run her travel agency court ruled in favor of user and awarded her 10 000 in damages but microsoft appealed however in may 2016 microsoft dropped appeal and chose to pay damages shortly after suit was reported on by seattle times microsoft confirmed that it was updating gwx software once again to add more explicit options for opting out of a free windows 10 upgrade final notification was a full screen pop up window notifying users of impending end of free upgrade offer and contained remind me later do not notify me again and notify me three more times options in march 2019 microsoft announced that it would display notifications on windows 7 devices informing users of upcoming end of extended support for platform and direct users to a website urging them to upgrade to windows 10 or purchase new hardware this dialog will be similar to previous windows 10 upgrade prompts but not explicitly mention windows 10 privacy and data collection privacy advocates and other critics have expressed concern regarding windows10 s privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data under default express settings windows10 is configured to send various information to microsoft and other parties including collection of user contacts calendar data and associated input data to personalize speech typing and inking input typing and inking data to improve recognition allowing apps to use a unique for analytics and advertising personalization functionality introduced by windows 8 1 and allow apps to request user s location data and send this data to microsoft and trusted partners to improve location detection windows8 had similar settings except that location data collection did not include trusted partners users can opt out from most of this data collection but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to microsoft and this cannot be disabled on non enterprise versions of windows10 microsoft s privacy policy states however that basic level telemetry data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify an individual user or device use of cortana also requires collection of data such as your pc location data from your calendar apps you use data from your emails and text messages who you call your contacts and how often you interact with them on your pc to personalize its functionality rock paper shotgun writer alec meer argued that microsoft s intent for this data collection lacked transparency stating that there is no world in which of policy documents and opt out settings split across settings screens and an external website constitutes real transparency joel hruska of extremetech writes that company that brought us campaign now hoovers up your data in ways that would make google jealous however it was also pointed out that requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm citing increased reliance on cloud computing and other forms of external processing as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as google now and siri in august 2015 russian politician nikolai called for windows10 to be banned from use within russian government as it sends user data to servers in united states country had passed a federal law requiring all online services to store data of russian users on servers within country by september 2016 or be blocked writing for zdnet ed bott said that lack of complaints by businesses about privacy in windows10 indicated how utterly normal those privacy terms are in 2015 in a computerworld editorial preston gralla attempted to defend microsoft by making false claim that kind of information windows10 gathers is no different from what other operating systems gather but microsoft is held to a different standard than other companies microsoft services agreement reads that company s online services may automatically download software updates or configuration changes including those that prevent you from accessing services playing counterfeit games or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices critics interpreted this statement as implying that microsoft would scan for and delete unlicensed software installed on devices running windows10 however others pointed out that this agreement was specifically for microsoft online services such as microsoft account office 365 skype as well as xbox live and that offending passage most likely referred to digital rights management on xbox consoles and first party games and not plans to police pirated video games installed on windows10 pcs despite this some torrent trackers announced plans to block windows10 users also arguing that operating system could send information to anti piracy groups that are affiliated with microsoft writing about these allegations ed bott of zdnet compared microsoft s privacy policy to apple s and google s and concluded that he didn t see anything that looks remotely like big brother columnist kim komando argued that microsoft might in future run scans and disable software or hardware it sees as a security threat consistent with windows10 update policy in september 2019 microsoft hid option to create a local account during a fresh installation if pc is connected to internet this move was criticized by users who did not want to use an online microsoft account see also bluekeep security vulnerability comparison of operating systems history of operating systems list of operating systems microsoft windows version history
