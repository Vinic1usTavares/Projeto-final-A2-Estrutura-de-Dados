mosaics of delos are a significant body of ancient greek mosaic art most of surviving mosaics from delos greece an island in cyclades date to last half of 2nd century bc and early 1st century bc during hellenistic period and beginning of roman period of greece hellenistic mosaics were no longer produced after roughly 69 bc due to warfare with kingdom of pontus and subsequently abrupt decline of island s population and position as a major trading center among hellenistic greek archaeological sites delos contains one of highest concentrations of surviving mosaic artworks approximately half of all surviving tessellated greek mosaics from hellenistic period come from delos paved walkways of delos range from simple pebble or chip pavement constructions to elaborate mosaic floors composed of tesserae most motifs contain simple geometric patterns while only a handful utilize opus tessellatum and opus vermiculatum techniques to create lucid naturalistic and richly colored scenes and figures mosaics have been found in places of worship public buildings and private homes latter usually containing either an irregular shaped floor plan or peristyle central courtyard although there are minor traces of punic phoenician and romano italian influence delian mosaics generally conform to major trends found in hellenistic art same wealthy patrons who commissioned paintings and sculptures at delos may have also been involved in hiring mosaic artists from abroad delian mosaics share characteristics with those in other parts of greek world such as macedonian mosaics in pella they also bear some attributes with greek painting traditions and often employ a similar black background technique found in red figure pottery of classical period some of styles and techniques found at delos are evident in roman art and mosaics although contemporary roman examples from pompeii for instance reveal significant differences in production and design of mosaics in western versus eastern mediterranean dating precisely 354 mosaics from delos survive and have been studied by french archaeologist philippe bruneau most date to late hellenistic period contiguous with late roman republic i e last half of 2nd century bc and early 1st century bc a handful were dated to classical period with one mosaic attributed to imperial roman era bruneau believed that nominally undated pieces on basis of their styles were produced within same period as majority of examples roughly between 133 and 88 bc in 167 or 166 bc after roman victory in third macedonian war rome ceded island of delos to athenians who expelled most of original inhabitants roman destruction of corinth in 146 bc allowed delos to at least partially assume former s role as premier trading center of greece delos commercial prosperity construction activity and population waned significantly after island was assaulted by forces of mithridates vi of pontus in 88 and 69 bc during mithridatic wars with rome despite invasions by pontus island was only gradually abandoned after rome secured a more direct trading link with orient that marginalized delos as a pivotal midway point for trade leading to east characteristics composition composition of delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions chip pavement made of white marble ceramic fragments and pieces of tesserae latter falls into two categories simpler tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae on average eight by eight millimeters and finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four by four millimeters many delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials while chip pavement is most common latter is found in 55 homes and usually reserved for ground floor majority of delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery brick and tile fragments for purpose of waterproofing thin strips of lead set into cement are often used to distinguish contours of geometric patterned mosaics but are absent in more complex tessellated figured mosaics thumb left a cubic floor mosaic in a house on island of delos arrangement and location while some mosaics have been unearthed from religious sanctuaries and public buildings most of them were found in residential buildings and private homes majority of these houses possess an irregular shaped floor plan while second largest group were built with a peristyle central courtyard simple mosaics were usually relegated to normal walkways whereas rooms designated for receiving guests featured more richly decorated mosaics however only 25 houses of delos feature opus tessellatum mosaics and only eight houses possess opus vermiculatum style motifs and figured scenes vast majority of decorated floors feature only simple geometric patterns it is also more common for opus vermiculatum and opus tessellatum mosaics to be found in upstairs rooms than on ground floors of ancient delian homes with exception of house of dionysos and house of dolphins courtyards of peristyle homes in delos feature only floral and geometric motifs thumb left a delian mosaic bearing central rosette motif surrounded by a single wave border pattern patterns and motifs among various patterns and motifs found in delian mosaics is triple colored lozenge that creates a three dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for viewer this pattern appears in fifteen different locations making it one of most common other motifs include waves and stepped triangles while major themes include maritime theatrical natural or mythological objects and figures single wave pattern a common motif in hellenistic art is most predominant type of border design for mosaics at delos and can be found at other sites such as albeit arranged in opposite direction rosette motif which is found in mosaics of various hellenistic sites across mediterranean is often coupled with single wave borders in delian mosaics typical hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of delos to fill four corners around a central rosette motif illusion of three dimensional relief in figured scenes of delian mosaics was usually achieved by use of polychrome with white black yellow red blue and green hues origins of composition techniques layout and style of delian mosaics can be found in 5th century bc pebble mosaics of olynthus in chalcidice of northern greece with mosaics positioned in center of cement floors and utilizing garland meander and wave patterns around a centralized motif or figured scene this design scheme is similar to that of 4th century bc mosaics of pella in macedonia although pebble mosaics there employ a wider range of colors to create effects of volume transition from pebble mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics perhaps originated in hellenistic greek sicily during 3rd century bc developed at sites such as morgantina and syracuse much like olynthus mosaics of morgantina contain garland wave and meander patterns although latter was finally executed with perspective culture and ethnic origins aside from a symbol of punic phoenician goddess tanit all pavement motifs are typically hellenistic greek in origin although some pavement mortars used with tesserae designs betray some italian influence three major ethnic groups of delos included greeks largely of athenian origin syrians phoenicians and italians romans but it is very likely that many of these italians were greek speaking natives of magna graecia in what is now southern italy delian inhabitants of either greek italian and syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households but vincent j bruno asserts that designs of their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to greek artistic traditions significance surviving corpus of hellenistic mosaic art french archaeologist francois considered mosaics of delos as high water mark and pinnacle of ancient greek mosaic art utilizing tesserae to create rich detailed and colorful scenes this hellenistic style of mosaic continued until end of antiquity and may have influenced widespread use of mosaics in western world during middle ages in her study of households and artworks of mediterranean trading centers birgit tang analyzed three archaeological sites delos in aegean carthage in what is now modern tunisia and modern in catalonia spain which was once a greek colony reasons for her choosing these sites in particular for investigation and comparison include their status as major maritime trading hubs as well as their relatively well preserved ruins of urban households ruth westgate writes that delos contains roughly half of all surviving tessellated greek mosaics from hellenistic period in her estimation sites of delos and morgantina and in sicily contain largest amount of surviving evidence for hellenistic greek mosaics asserts that delos mosaics represent single largest collection of greek mosaics she also states that only macedonian capital of pella ranks as an equal in having private homes as opposed to royal residences decorated with elaborate wall paintings signed mosaics and freestanding marble sculptures katherine m d dunbabin writes that while many hellenistic mosaics have been found in mainland greece asia minor and northeast africa i e cyrene it is only at site of delos where they occur in sufficient numbers to allow general conclusions about their use and nature comparisons with roman pompeii in her comparative analysis of mosaic art in greco roman world hetty joyce chose mosaics of delos and roman pompeii as chief representative samples for determining distinctions in form function and production techniques of mosaics in greek east and latin west her reasoning for selection of these two sites are their well preserved pavements secure dating of samples to late 2nd and early 1st centuries bc and thanks to extensive documentation of delian mosaics by bruneau a sufficient amount of academic literature dedicated to each site to form comparisons ruth westgate in her survey and comparative study of hellenistic greek mosaics with mosaics of pompeii concludes that roman mosaics dated to pompeian first style of wall painting in late 2nd and early 1st centuries bc were derived from greek tradition however she stresses that pompeian mosaics departed from their greek counterparts by almost exclusively featuring figured scenes instead of abstract designs in plain pavement most likely set by local craftsmen and produced separately from figured panels latter of which were perhaps made by greek artisans for their roman patrons due to similarities between hellenistic wall paintings at delos and first style of pompeii joyce contends that differences in delian and pompeian mosaics are deliberate product of artistic preference rather than result of ignorance of each other s traditions these differences include widespread use of opus signinum at pompeii with only four known examples at delos use of opus sectile at pompeii and its complete absence at delos prevalent use of polychrome patterns and intricate three dimensional figured designs in delian mosaics versus two dimensional designs at pompeii which at best utilize two colors complex three dimensional figured mosaics using polychrome designs to achieve illusion of light and shadow were not produced at pompeii until pompeian second style of wall painting 80 20 bc and are considered an adoption from hellenistic art trends while lead strips were used in hellenistic mosaics of delos athens and pella greece pergamon turkey romania alexandria egypt and chersonesus crimean peninsula they are absent in western mediterranean mosaics of malta sicily and italian peninsula westgate affirms that hellenistic mosaics can be divided into two broad categories eastern and western based on their different styles and production techniques connections to other mediums of ancient greek art red figure pottery was no longer produced by time delos mosaics were made black background technique of red figure pottery was still appreciated in 4th century bc macedonian pebble mosaics from pella and in mosaics at delos such as white figured triton mosaic with tesserae black background technique was later used in glass art such as cameo glass particularly roman glass e g portland vase gemma augustea great cameo of france etc undulating garland motif against a black background from masonry style mural paintings at delos were earlier featured in greek works ranging from vases to 4th century bc macedonian mosaics of pella particularly stag hunt mosaic however painters of delos arguably invented their own decorative genre using a combination of these older elements with new naturalistic coloring aside from black background mosaics like stag hunt mosaic were also inspired by illusionist three dimensional qualities of greek paintings at delos paintings and mosaics inherited same classical greek standards of craftsmanship lighting shading and coloring sculptors painters and mosaic artists may have all been part of same system of patronage at delos which in some instances would have necessitated importation of foreign artists houses and city quarters mosaics from northern quarter northern quarter of delos contains jewelry quarter where older structures such as workshops and other archaeological remains dating to 3rd century bc and early 2nd century bc have been discovered by second half of 2nd century bc these were replaced by private homes built in most characteristic fashion for delos a narrow rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard a vestibule service room in front and a larger main room in rear quarter of house of masks is only area of delos without this archetypal house plan some houses of northern quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes including lycurgus of thrace and ambrosia in an upper story mosaic as well as athena and hermes together with a seated woman in a main room mosaic mosaics from theatre quarter most houses in crowded theatre quarter of delos have irregular shaped floor plans such as trapezoidal designs as opposed to square or rectangular designs narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters where streets usually meet at approximately right angles similar to majority of excavated homes of delos those in theatre quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes instead of peristyle layout with columns some of houses in theatre quarter lack interior decoration altogether with neither wall murals nor mosaics which is unusual for most delian homes house of dionysos delos mosaic of dionysos riding a tiger in house of dionysos is one of finest examples of opus vermiculatum according to dunbabin and is comparable to dionysos riding a leopard from house of masks if not simpler pebble mosaic predecessor from macedonian capital at pella a key thematic difference however are wings of dionysos that suggest his incarnation as a daimon instead of a god tesserae materials made of glass faience terracotta and natural stones are fashioned into pieces measuring roughly one millimeter square allowing for sharp detail and an elaborate color scheme house of masks house of masks is named after mosaic motif of theatre masks decorating ivy scrolls arranged in strips around a central surface area decorated in a cubic pattern more intricately decorated mosaics are found in four different rooms branching off from peristyle courtyard paved with marble chips with corridor mosaics utilizing amphora fragments in center of one mosaic is figure of dionysos riding a leopard against a similar black background to mosaic in house of dionysos another central mosaic features a flute player and a dancing figure latter perhaps representing silenus only dionysos figure employs vermiculatum method other mosaics of house fail to achieve naturalism of finer figure scenes and motifs but they nevertheless demonstrate an attempt at mimicking their illusionist qualities with tesselated technique house of dolphins house of dolphins contains a peristyle floor mosaic design that is unusual for delos with a circle enclosed by a square outline in each corner of square are pairs of dolphins ridden by tiny winged figures bearing emblems of various greek deities namely caduceus trident and one object that is missing due to damage circle contains a central rosette design surrounded by floral garlands and griffins mosaic signed by a certain asclepiades of in ancient phoenicia now western syria is one of only two examples from delos that bear a signature of original artist house of lake similar to design of majority of delian homes house of lake is an irregular shaped home as opposed to a rectangular or square floor plan located near a sacred lake and inhabited from roughly 300 to 100 bc peristyle is decorated with a geometric patterned motif around a central rosette surrounded on all sides by monolithic columns in ionic style house of trident house of trident contains peristyle panels with motif of a black dolphin situated around a red anchor and black tridents against a white background theme suggests that owners of house were somehow connected to maritime pursuits these simple two dimensional mosaics stand in contrast to multicolored finely detailed three dimensional hellenistic mosaics of figures and motifs they are perhaps comparable or even linked to black and white pavement mosaics that appear in roman italy some decades later see also archaeological museum of delos history of cyclades late antique and medieval mosaics in italy notes
