thumb right upright 1 3 a repeater signal in montague street tunnel which mirrors indications of signal directly around curve thumb right upright 1 3 a signal in flushing main street station most trains on new york city subway are manually operated system currently uses automatic block signaling with fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops many portions of signaling system were installed between 1930s and 1960s because of age of subway system many replacement parts are unavailable from signaling suppliers and must be custom built for new york city transit authority which operates subway additionally some subway lines have reached their train capacity limits and cannot operate extra trains in current system there are two different schemes of signaling in system most used scheme is used on all b division lines originally built to brooklyn manhattan transit corporation bmt and independent subway system ind s wider specifications and on most of a division lines built to narrower specifications of interborough rapid transit company irt an older system was used on all of a division but with conversion of irt avenue line signals to b division scheme in september 2017 this system is no longer in use retrieved april 30 2018 as part of modernization of new york city subway mta plans to upgrade much of system with communications based train control cbtc technology which will control speed and starting and stopping of subway trains cbtc system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system which reduces headways between trains increases train frequencies and capacities and relays trains positions to a control room rather than a fixed block system implementation of cbtc requires new rolling stock to be built for subway routes using technology as only newer trains use cbtc block signaling new york city subway system has for most part used block signaling since its 1904 opening system consists of about 14 850 signal blocks 3 538 mainline switches 183 major track junctions 10 104 automatic train stops and 339 191 signal relays trains used to be controlled by signal towers at interlockings but this was eventually phased out in favor of master towers eventually these master towers were replaced by a single rail control center new york city transit power control center in midtown manhattan these signals work by preventing trains from entering a block occupied by another train typically blocks are long although some highly used lines such as irt lexington avenue line use shorter blocks insulators divide track segments into blocks two traveling rails form a track circuit as they conduct electric current if track circuit is open and electricity cannot travel between rails signal will light up as green as it is unoccupied by a train when a train enters block metal wheels close circuit on rails and signal turns red marking block as occupied train s maximum speed will depend on how many blocks are open in front of it however signals do not register trains speed nor do they register where in block train is located if a train passes a red signal train stop automatically engages and prevents train from moving forward new york city subway generally distinguishes its current signals between automatic signals which are solely controlled by train movements approach signals which can be forced to display a stop aspect by interlocking tower home signals whose route is set by interlocking tower and additional signals such as call on dwarf marker sign repeater and time signals common automatic and approach signals consist of one signal head showing one of following signal aspects stop one red light with special rules for call on and timer signals clear next signal at clear or caution one green light proceed with caution be prepared to stop at next signal one yellow light where different directions are possible subway uses both speed and route signaling upper signal head indicates speed while lower signal head is used for routes with main route shown in green and diverging route shown in yellow old signals break down more easily since some signals have outlasted their 50 year service life by up to 30 years and signal problems accounted for 13 of all subway delays in 2016 additionally some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and cannot operate extra trains with current automatic block signaling system types of block signals standard block signals following indications are used for blocks where there are no track divergences i e junctions in block immediately ahead older signals on former irt lines may use different indications which are not shown lights on older irt signals from top to bottom were green red and yellow lights on current signals from top to bottom are green yellow and red thumb right upright 0 9 a modern un renovated subway signal at bowling green station key by signals system also has automatic and manual key by red signals where conductor can insert a physical key into wayside block signal changing signal indication from red to yellow signals involve operation of an automatic stop with an automatic or manual release then a procedure with caution with preparations to stop in case of debris or other obstructions on track until 1970 when a train paused at a red block signal train operator was allowed to pass red signal by keying by train operator would pause at red signal and then got out of cab descended to tracks level and cranked down track trip with a key like device after a series of accidents including a crash north of hoyt street station in 1970 in which train operators keyed by and crashed into trains in front procedure was banned unless permission was granted by train dispatchers time signals speed control on subway is ensured by time signals a timer counting up is started as soon as train passes a certain point and will clear signal ahead as soon as predefined time elapsed minimum time is calculated from speed limit and distance between start of timer and signal time signals are distinguished into grade timers for speed supervision at grades curves or in front of buffer stops and station timers to allow one train to enter a station just as another is leaving as long as these trains are going at a reduced speed there are two types of grade time signals first type two shot timers are generally used on down grades where train must be under a set speed for a longer length of track they are so named because a train operator would have two chances or shots to pass signal within posted speed limit one shot timers on other hand are found at sharp curves and are named because operator only has one chance to pass signal within speed limit repeater signals repeater signals are also used to maintain safe train operation around curves these signals repeat indication of a signal up ahead around a curve and are located on opposite side of track from signals they repeat wheel detectors another addition to system s transit signals are wheel detectors these are sensors that can determine how fast a train is moving based on how quickly axles of a given car are moving first introduced in 1996 at interlockings they further enforce speed at which a train is traveling through an interlocking and they are only active when a switch is set to divergent route wheel detectors prevent train operators from running slowly at beginning of a grade timing segment and then increasing speed beyond allowable limit without being tripped when indication is flashing train is too fast and is about to be tripped gap filler signals gap filler signals are used at 14th street union square station on irt lexington avenue line and at times square 42nd street station on 42nd street shuttle station they were formerly used at brooklyn bridge city hall and south ferry loop stations these stations are part of a division which consists of lines built by interborough rapid transit company irt at these stops gap fillers extend out from platforms to bridge space between platform and car body and door at curved stations signal consists of a single red lamp and a gf indicator underneath when signal is red gap fillers are extended and when red light is no longer lit up gap fillers have been retracted and train operator can increase speed of train and leave station types of interlocking signals interlockings consist of two or more tracks that are connected by railroad switches routes typically may conflict at these locations they are arranged in a specific way with switches and signals that prevent conflicting movements once one route is set up interlocking signals are fixed signals within an interlocking containing two separate red yellow green signal heads and often other indications a home signal is defined as an interlocking signal at entrance to a route or block to control trains entering that route or block most interlockings only have one controlled signal on each track some home signals contain a third yellow aspect on bottom and are known as call on signals these signals allow train operator to press a lever near signal to lower trip arm allowing train to pass signal at slow speed even if signal is displaying a red light similar signals can be found in yards three aspects on these signals when all displaying yellow allow train operator to go past signal at a slow speed without stopping train interlocking signals are controlled by human operators in a signal tower near switches not by trains themselves a train operator must use a punch box which is located besides cab window in station closest to interlocking to notify switch operator of which track train needs to go to switch operator has a switchboard in their tower that allows them to change switches interlocking signals also tell train operators which way switches on subway are set top part of an interlocking signal indicates condition of block ahead while lower part indicates route selected following interlocking signals are used on new york city subway excluding older a division lines variants until dekalb avenue junction s reconstruction in 1958 there was a unique situation in which there was a three way switch as there were three possible options a special blue signal was used another signal type is a dwarf signal which is often used at switches to allow for occasional movements against usual direction of train traffic controlled manually from a tower they are not part of ordinary operations and they generally do not include trip arms modifications to signals after a collision between two trains on williamsburg bridge in 1995 in which a train operator was killed after speeding his train into back of another mta modified both signals and trains to lower their average speeds trains maximum speeds were reduced from to and mta installed grade time signals around system to ensure that a train could only travel under a certain maximum speed before it was allowed to proceed some of these time signals malfunctioned they prevented trains from passing even if operator had slowed down train to speed that was indicated and so some operators slowed trains further in case a time signal forced trains to wait for longer than was indicated this resulted in overcrowded trains since fewer trains per hour were able to proceed on certain sections of track by 2012 over 1 200 signals had been modified and of these 0 1 13 signals caused passengers to spend 2 851 more hours on trains per weekday compared to before modifications by mid 2018 that number had grown to 1 800 before going up to 2 000 at years end some of oldest block signals in system were 80 years old and they broke down frequently causing more delays and prompting mta to declare a state of emergency for subway in 2017 an mta investigation found that between december 2017 and january 2018 broken signals caused 11 555 train delays in summer 2018 new york city transit started evaluating twenty places where signal timers affect service most speed limits have remained relatively unchanged even as improvements in track geometry and car design allow trains to operate at higher speeds where possible agency has sought to increase speed limits in summer 2018 new york city transit president andy byford created speed unit to reduce delays by modifying operating and service practices soon after mta began testing timers as part of first systemwide review of timers to determine whether they are allowing trains to run at posted maximum speed mta eventually identified 267 faulty timer signals that disallowed trains from proceeding at speed limit and thus forced trains to run significantly slower than intended train operators that pass signals at or near their posted speeds have gotten punished due to agency s strict discipline culture even though signals are malfunctioning byford stated that i don t think that safety and speed are incompatible by december 2018 speed unit had found 130 locations where speed limit could be increased some of which were in process of being fixed it was also announced that speed limits would be doubled in some parts of system and that average speeds would generally be increased from to in january 2019 it was announced that 95 of timers had been tested and that 320 faulty timers discovered were in process of being fixed in addition 68 locations had been approved for increases in speed limits following month mta hired subway signal expert pete tomlin chaining to precisely specify locations along new york city subway lines a chainage system is used it measures distances from a fixed point called chaining zero following path of track so that distance described is understood to be railroad distance not distance by most direct route as crow flies this chaining system differs from milepost or mileage system new york city subway system differs from other railroad chaining systems in that it uses engineer s chain of rather than surveyor s chain of chaining is used in new york city subway system in conjunction with train radios in order to ascertain a train s location on a given line automatic train supervision thumb right upright 1 1 as a bonus feature automatic train supervision allows for next train indicators to be installed on a division lines new york city subway uses a system known as automatic train supervision ats for dispatching and train routing on a division irt flushing line and trains used on do not have ats for two reasons they are isolated from main line a division and they were already planned to get communications based train control cbtc before ats on a division or ats a project had started ats allows dispatchers in operations control center occ to see where trains are in real time and whether each individual train is running early or late dispatchers can hold trains for connections re route trains or short turn trains to provide better service when a disruption causes delays ats is used to facilitate installation of train arrival displays which count down number of minutes until a train arrives on a division and on bmt canarsie line ats was first proposed for bmt canarsie line and a division in 1992 after a 1991 derailment killed five people on a 4 train that derailed near 14th street union square station cbtc for canarsie line was proposed two years later deployment of ats a involved upgrading signals to be compatible for future cbtc retrofitting as well as consolidating operations from 23 different master towers into power control center parsons corporation helped mta install system on of a division track as well as doing some preliminary planning for ats on b division project ended up costing 200 million its completion was delayed by five years and it ultimately took 14 years to implement ats a however ats a s deployment was delayed due to several issues unique specifications of new york city subway s equipment mta s choice to use its own workers rather than outside contractors and inadequate training of contractors all contributed to delays in addition mta kept missing deadlines for testing ats single biggest issue during project though was fact that mta and contractors did not cooperate well which was attributed mostly to poor communication in 2006 2008 and 2010 mta considered upgrading b division to ats but dismissed proposal because it was too complex and would take too long however mta stated that due to high customer demand for train arrival displays it would use a combination of cbtc and a new system named integrated service information and management abbreviated isim b simpler isim b system started in 2011 would essentially combine all of data from track circuits and unify them into digital databases only upgrades that were needed were to be performed on signal towers at time although entire a division had ats only seven lines of b division had a modernized control system ind concourse line 63rd street lines bmt astoria line bmt brighton line bmt franklin avenue line bmt sea beach line and bmt west end line as well as part of ind culver line and tracks around queens plaza originally slated to be completed by 2017 isim b was later delayed to 2020 in 2015 mta awarded siemens a contract to install a cbtc compatible ats system on most of b division at a cost of 156 172 932 contract excluded canarsie line which already had cbtc and ind queens boulevard line and approaches which was set to receive cbtc by 2021 queens boulevard line routes are served by but since n and q routes also share tracks with r train in manhattan they will also have ats installed cost of ats contract for b division was later increased by 8 75 million automation thumb left upright 1 1 cbtc is being overlaid onto traditional block signaling system for example this block signal located at 34th street hudson yards station on irt flushing line is being automated trains using cbtc locate themselves based on measuring their distance in relation to fixed transponders installed between rails trains equipped with cbtc have a transponder interrogator antenna beneath each carriage which communicates with fixed trackside transponders and report trains location to a wayside zone controller via radio then controller issues movement authority to trains this technology upgrade will allow trains to be operated at closer distances slightly increasing capacity will allow mta to keep track of trains in real time and provide more information to public regarding train arrivals and delays and will eliminate need for complex interlocking towers trains are also equipped with computers inside cab so that conductor can monitor train s speed and relative location wayside controllers themselves are located in enclosed boxes that can withstand floods and natural disasters traditional block systems will remain on these lines despite installation of cbtc block system handles all control and supervision of routes through interlockings including switch point control and switch status for broken rail protection and tracking of trains that are not operating using cbtc lines equipped with cbtc are fully track circuited with power frequency single rail track circuits however broken rail protection is only guaranteed on one of two rails of a track equipment aboard every train identifies location of train using wayside transponders as a basis once zone controller has determined based on track circuit information and train localization that cbtc train is a single discrete train they use this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead cbtc zone controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from wayside legacy signaling system trains with cbtc can then operate closer together although as before platform dwell times and train performance are true limiting factors in terms of headway performance with new system signals and interlockings are still required their job being done better by relay interlockings or solid state interlocking controllers ats system at control center is not a vital system and serves only to automate routing of trains based on overall timetable location of train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times mta s form of cbtc uses a reduced form of old fixed block signaling system requiring that both be maintained at high cost only newer generation rolling stock that were first delivered in early 2000s are designed for cbtc operation these rolling stock include r143s r188s and 68 r160s fleet numbers however remaining of r160 fleet is also proposed to receive cbtc for queens boulevard automation future car orders are also being designed to be cbtc compatible such as r179 and after retirement of and cars all revenue cars except those on g j m and z trains as well as shuttles will be equipped with cbtc bmt canarsie line was first line to implement automated technology using siemens s trainguard mt cbtc system most subway services cannot significantly increase their frequencies during rush hours except for g j z l and m trains l service already is automated with cbtc therefore transit planners are viewing installation of cbtc as a way to free up track capacity for more trains to run and have shorter headways between trains however installing cbtc in new york city subway is harder than in other systems due to subway s complexity mta hopes to install of cbtc equipped tracks per year while regional plan association wants mta to install cbtc signals on of tracks per year however even without cbtc system is currently retrofitted to operate at frequencies of up to 60 trains per hour tph on ind queens boulevard line 30 tph on each of local and express pairs of tracks made possible by jamaica 179th street terminal which has four sidings past terminal for each set of tracks and 33 tph on irt flushing line bmt canarsie line is limited to a 26 tph frequency due to bumper blocks at both of its terminals and power constraints however irt lexington avenue line operates at frequencies of 27 tph without cbtc by contrast lines on moscow metro can operate at frequencies of up to 40 tph since lines in moscow metro unlike most of new york city subway but like jamaica 179th street station typically have four sidings past terminals instead of bumper blocks or one or two sidings 42nd street shuttle automation thumb upright 1 1 right 42nd street shuttle was first line in new york city subway to be automated using track 4 shown on right 42nd street shuttle which runs from grand central to times square was briefly automated from 1959 to 1964 chairman of board of transportation sidney h bingham in 1954 first proposed a conveyor belt like system for shuttle line but plan was canceled due to its high cost subsequently in 1958 newly formed new york city transit authority nycta started studying feasibility of automatically operated trains which did not have motormen nycta conducted study in conjunction with general railway signal company union switch and signal division of westinghouse air brake company general electric and western electric next year nycta president charles patterson made a speech about results of automated mass transit study it was estimated that on 42nd street shuttle alone full automation could result in a 150 000 annual savings sea beach line test track starting in december 1959 fully automatic train was tested on bmt sea beach line express tracks between 18th avenue and new utrecht avenue stations idea of automation at that time relied on commands that were sent to train while train is at a station to keep its doors open train was equipped with a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at two shuttle terminals at each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers relays controlled train s starting acceleration braking and stopping as well as opening and closing of car doors when commands cease doors would promptly close a new series of commands would start train and gradually accelerate it to its full speed slowing to when coming into two stations when entering stations train passed through a series of detectors which caused a series of tripper arms at trackside to go into open position if train was going at correct speed if train was going too quickly tripper arms would stay upright and train s brakes would automatically be set equipment was built and installed by general railway signal and union switch and signal nycta contributed between 20 000 to 30 000 on project and supplied three r22 subway cars to be automated bulk of money between 250 000 and 300 000 was contributed by two companies which paid for installation maintenance and technological oversight of automation process including signaling automation of shuttle was opposed by president of transport workers union michael j quill who pledged to fight project and called device insane were fitted with different types of brake shoes to see which one would negotiate rail joints better it was eventually found that automated trip took 10 seconds longer than manual operation about 95 seconds compared to 85 seconds as tests on sea beach line progressed grade time stops were added to ensure safety on line and on 42nd street shuttle train was dubbed sam and was to operate on track 4 of shuttle line implementation and demise in afternoon of january 4 1962 three car automated train began service with a ceremony trains carried a stand by motorman during six month trial period train had scheduled to begin service on december 15 1961 but quill threatened a walkout at all of city s municipal and privately owned transit if train ran under new contract with twu nycta agreed to put a motorman in train during experimental period while in its experimental period automated train was only operating during rush hours in july test was extended for three more months and in october test was extended for six additional months chairman of nycta charles patterson was disappointed by automated shuttle train doubting that train could be operated without any transit personnel on board initially automation of shuttle was expected to save 150 000 a year in labor costs however with one employee still required on train there would essentially be no savings if test succeeded it was planned to automate irt flushing line bmt canarsie line bmt myrtle avenue line franklin avenue shuttle and culver shuttle these lines were chosen because train services on all five lines as well as 42nd street shuttle did not regularly share tracks with any other services at time nycta did not have plans to automate whole system rest of system included a myriad of instances where several different services merged and shared tracks and automating rest of system would have been logistically difficult canarsie and myrtle avenue lines were later cut from plans but it was expected that other three lines would be automated if test was successful a severe fire at grand central station on april 21 1964 destroyed demonstration train fire began under a shuttle train on track 3 and it became larger feeding on wooden platform train on track 1 was saved when motorman saw smoke and reversed train basements of nearby buildings were damaged tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on april 23 1964 while track 3 returned to service on june 1 1964 reinstallation of track 3 was delayed because of need to replace 60 beams that were damaged in fire reconstruction of line continued through 1967 automated rapid transit technology was later installed in san francisco bay area s bart system and philadelphia metropolitan area s patco speedline after fire that destroyed automated shuttle subway cars ideas for new york city subway automation lay dormant for years until an intoxicated motorman caused a train crash at union square station that killed 5 people and injured 215 collision was a catalyst to a 1994 business case outlining arguments for automatic train operation ato and cbtc which led to automation of bmt canarsie line starting in early 2000s in 1997 year canarsie line project started whole subway was to be automated by 2017 but by 2005 completion date had been pushed back to 2045 cbtc test cases first two lines totaling of track miles received cbtc from 2000 to 2018 two lines with initial installations of cbtc were both chosen because their respective tracks are relatively isolated from rest of subway system and they have fewer junctions along route canarsie line cbtc canarsie line on which l service runs was chosen for cbtc pilot testing because it is a self contained line that does not operate in conjunction with other subway lines in new york city subway system 10 mile length of canarsie line is also shorter than majority of other subway lines as a result signaling requirements and complexity of implementing cbtc are easier to install and test than more complicated subway lines that have junctions and share trackage with other lines siemens transportation systems built cbtc system on canarsie line cbtc project was first proposed in 1994 and approved by mta in 1997 installation of signal system was begun in 2000 initial testing began in 2004 and installation was mostly completed by december 2006 with all cbtc equipped subway cars in service by that date due to an unexpected ridership increase on canarsie line mta ordered more r160 cars and these were put into service in 2010 this enabled agency to operate up to 20 trains per hour up from may 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour an achievement that would not be possible without cbtc technology or a redesign of previous automatic block signal system r143s and r160s both use trainguard mt cbtc supplied by siemens in 2015 2019 capital program funding was provided for three more electrical substations for line so service could be increased from 20 to 22 trains per hour also included in capital program is installation of automatic signals on line to facilitate movement of work trains between interlockings flushing line cbtc thumb upright 1 1 r188 subway cars constructed for flushing line have cbtc next line to have cbtc installed was pre existing irt flushing line and its western extension opened in 2015 served by flushing line was chosen for second implementation of cbtc because it is also a self contained line with no direct connections to other subway lines currently in use aside from merging of express and local services 2010 2014 mta capital program provided funding for cbtc installation on flushing line with scheduled installation completion in 2016 r188 cars were ordered in 2010 to equip line with compatible rolling stock this order consists of new cars and retrofits of existing cars for cbtc in late winter 2008 mta embarked on a 5 week renovation and upgrade project on between flushing main street and 61st street woodside to upgrade signaling and tracks for cbtc on february 27 2008 mta issued an accelerated capital program to continue funding completion of cbtc for and to begin on ind queens boulevard line installation is being done by thales group which was awarded contract for project on june 16 2010 cbtc as well as new track configuration added in line s 2015 extension allowed to run 2 more tph during peak hours increasing service from 27 to 29 tph first train of r188 cars began operating in passenger service on november 9 2013 test runs of r188s in automated mode started in late 2014 however cbtc retrofit date was later pushed back to 2017 and then to 2018 after a series of problems that workers encountered during installation including problems with r188s project also went over budget costing 405 million for a plan originally marked at 265 6 million in february 2017 mta started overnight testing of cbtc on flushing line from main street to 74th street with cbtc being used in regular passenger service by august and full implementation in october by february 2018 rest of line from 74th street to 34th street hudson yards was projected to begin operating in cbtc service in fall 2018 cbtc was activated on segment between 74th street and steinway tunnel over eight weekends in mid 2018 remaining segment of flushing line between steinway tunnel and 34th street hudson yards began operating in cbtc service on november 26 2018 however mta also stated that several more weeks of maintenance work would be needed before system was fully operational project was substantially completed on march 7 2019 and full ato operation began in may 2019 allowing for increase in service to 29 tph project was 96 complete as of june 2019 and remaining work will be complete by september 2019 mta s independent engineering consultant noted that cbtc can support operation of additional service and recommended that nyct use a simulation of line to identify line constraints and bottlenecks and undertake projects to increase capacity of line wider installation of cbtc as part of 2015 2019 capital program there will be of lines that will get cbtc at a cost of 2 152 billion part of a 2 766 billion automation signaling project that is being funded in capital program another 337 million is to be spent on extra power substations for cbtc this installation of cbtc would require siemens and thales to cooperate on installation process for all of lines they had worked separately in installing canarsie line s and flushing line s cbtc systems respectively culver line cbtc funding was allocated for installation of cbtc equipment on one of ind culver line express tracks between fourth avenue and church avenue total cost was 99 6 million with 15 million coming from 2005 2009 capital budget and 84 6 million from 2010 2014 capital budget installation was a joint venture between siemens and thales group test track project was completed in december 2015 this installation was intended to be permanent should culver line express service be implemented express service would not use cbtc and testing of cbtc on express track would be limited to off peak hours test trains on track were able to successfully operate using interoperable siemens thales cbtc system that system became standard for all future cbtc installations on new york city transit tracks a third supplier mitsubishi electric power products inc was given permission to demonstrate that its technology could be interoperable with siemens thales technology 1 2 million mitsubishi contract was approved in july 2015 local tracks north of church avenue would also get cbtc as part of 2015 2019 capital program as well as entire line between church avenue and west eighth street new york aquarium three interlockings between church avenue and west eighth street at ditmas avenue kings highway and avenue x would be upgraded a contract for cbtc overlay as well as modernization of ditmas avenue and avenue x interlockings was awarded in february 2019 with substantial completion expected in august 2022 queens boulevard line cbtc thumb upright 1 1 mta will install cbtc on queens boulevard line pictured here at queens plaza mta is planning to implement cbtc on western portion of ind queens boulevard line qbl west cbtc is to be installed on this line in five phases with phase one 50th street 8th avenue and 47th 50th streets rockefeller center to kew gardens union turnpike being included in 2010 2014 capital budget 63rd street connection to 21st street queensbridge would also be retrofitted with cbtc on december 15 2014 a contract to provide consulting services to support installation of cbtc was awarded to systra engineering following success of culver line cbtc test track mta awarded a 205 8 million contract for installment of phase one to siemens on august 24 2015 and thales on august 31 2015 these two suppliers were only mta qualified suppliers that could install cbtc on new york city transit tracks of this initial cost mta will pay 156 2 million to siemens and 49 6 million to thales both of these suppliers would install new signaling system on tracks themselves seven of 8 interlockings in first phase section of line would be upgraded under this contract in conjunction with project 309 four or five car sets of r160s will receive trainguard mt cbtc same cbtc system installed on trains assigned to bmt canarsie line which will be compatible with seltrac cbtc system installed on tracks of 309 units set to be converted for cbtc compatibility 305 will receive new onboard equipment which nyct contractors will install in 301 of these 305 units 155 units had been retrofitted planning for phase one started in 2015 and was complete by february 2016 with major engineering work following in november 2016 on december 22 2016 as part of second phase of cbtc installation on queens boulevard line l k comstock company inc was awarded 223 3 million contract to upgrade existing signals and install communications fiber optic and cbtc infrastructure for new signal system core of phase one was originally supposed to be completed by 2020 or 2021 however by april 2018 mta projected that most of infrastructure from 50th street to union turnpike would be substantially completed by mid 2022 mta would start to train operators by december 2018 and 309 sets of r160s will be cbtc equipped by june 2020 testing of integrated siemens thales system began in august 2018 and was completed by may 2019 followed by start of train operator training simulations in june 2019 phase one was to be substantially completed by march 2021 followed by phase two in july 2022 on march 26 2019 systra s contract to provide consulting services was extended by 23 months to support extension of cbtc from union turnpike to 179th street on queens boulevard line and to jamaica center on ind archer avenue line qbl east total cost for eventually automating entire queens boulevard line is estimated at over 900 million automation of queens boulevard line means that will be able to run 3 more trains during peak hours it currently runs 29 tph this will also increase capacity on local tracks of ind queens boulevard line however as line hosts several services installation of cbtc on line can be much harder than on flushing and canarsie lines eighth avenue line cbtc funding for design of cbtc on ind eighth avenue line from 59th street columbus circle to high street is also provided in 2015 2019 capital program along with modernization of interlockings at 30th and 42nd streets design of eighth avenue line cbtc project will be done concurrently with queens boulevard line automation allowing majority of e route to be semi automated when project is done since nearly all of e s route runs along these two lines it will get two new electrical substations to support cbtc upgrades construction was originally scheduled to begin in october 2018 but a contract for cbtc installation was later pushed back to first quarter of 2019 other lines in a 2014 report mta projected that 355 miles of track would receive cbtc signals by 2029 including most of ind as well as irt lexington avenue line and bmt broadway line mta was also planning to install cbtc equipment on ind crosstown line bmt fourth avenue line and bmt brighton line before 2025 on other hand regional plan association prioritized lexington avenue crosstown eighth avenue fulton street manhattan bridge queens boulevard rockaway and sixth avenue subway lines as those in need of cbtc between 2015 2024 as part of 2015 2019 capital program 34th street and west fourth street interlockings on ind sixth avenue line were completed at a cost of 356 5 million interlocking upgrades would support cbtc installation on queens boulevard culver and eighth avenue lines in march 2018 new york city transit authority president andy byford announced said that he had created a new plan for subway with cbtc which would only take 10 to 15 years compared to previous estimate of 40 years however this would be very expensive as it would cost 8 to 15 billion byford subsequently announced his 19 billion subway modernization plan at a mta board meeting in may 2018 plan involved upgrading signals on system s five most heavily used physical lines as well as accelerating deployment of isim b to all subway lines that did not already have either automatic train supervision or cbtc by 2023 cbtc projects on entire crosstown lexington avenue archer avenue ind and queens boulevard lines would be underway in addition cbtc work already underway on eighth avenue line south of 59th street and on culver line from church avenue to west eighth street new york aquarium would be completed moreover under byford s plan mta would start retrofitting entire broadway line from queensboro plaza to dekalb avenue via both montague street tunnel and manhattan bridge entire fulton street and rockaway lines ind 63rd street line ind sixth avenue line from 59th street columbus circle to jay street metrotech and dekalb avenue via manhattan bridge irt broadway seventh avenue line south of 96th street lenox avenue line and a portion of irt white plains road line to jackson avenue by 2028 at latest this would require nightly and weekend closures of up to two and a half years for every line that would be affected although weekday service would be maintained as part of plan all subway cars would be cbtc equipped by 2028 2015 2019 capital program was revised in april 2018 to fund to design for expedited installation of cbtc on lexington avenue line ind archer avenue line and queens boulevard line east of kew gardens union turnpike known as qbl east in addition funding is allocated for upgrade of negatively polarized direct current cables and replacement of segments of contract rail with low resistance contact rail along lexington avenue to improve power distribution and increase capacity and to upgrade negative cables along queens boulevard draft 2020 2024 capital program calls for adding cbtc to several more lines namely entire lexington avenue crosstown astoria and ind 63rd street lines ind fulton street line west of euclid avenue station and remainder of ind queens boulevard line to jamaica 179th street station implementation of cbtc on 63rd street line from 21st street queensbridge to 57th street and on fulton street line from jay street to ozone park had been slated for 2025 2029 capital program astoria line was not one of lines originally planned for cbtc installation in fast forward plan ultra wideband signaling and other proposals in 2017 mta started testing ultra wideband radio enabled train signaling on ind culver line and 42nd street shuttle ultra wideband train signals would be able to transmit more data wirelessly in a manner similar to cbtc but can be installed faster than cbtc systems ultra wideband signals would have added benefit of allowing passengers to use cellphones while between stations instead of current setup where passengers could only get cellphone signals within stations themselves same year it was reported that full implementation of cbtc systemwide might take 40 to 50 years following subway system s state of emergency that year mta chairman joe lhota described timeline of cbtc installation as simply too long instead proposing ways to speed up work and hosting genius transit challenge to find quicker ways to upgrade signals some of proposals included a wireless signaling system a completely new concept that had never been tested in any other railroad or subway network in march 2018 mta announced that four entities had submitted two winning proposals to challenge one of proposals used ultra wideband signaling technology other proposal entailed installing sensors and cameras on trains with minimal installations on tracks new york city transit chairman andy byford stated that he wanted to test ultra wideband technology at same time that more established systems like cbtc are being installed in march 2019 contracts for installation on canarsie and flushing lines were awarded these installations were set to be finished by december 2019 notes references external links block signaling in new york city
