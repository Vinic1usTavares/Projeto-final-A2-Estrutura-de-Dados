after west virginia became a state confederates who were rebels in american civil war had an army camp near foot of a mountain in sinking creek valley their camp contained about 500 soldiers who were surprised by small group of union cavalry men many of rebels did not have their weapons loaded union cavalry raced into camp with sabers drawn and quickly convinced rebels to surrender in exchange for

forced to retreat from western virginia kanawha river valley to ohio by confederate army this retreat was embarrassing to government army s commander colonel joseph andrew jackson lightburn was replaced by general jacob cox who reorganized troops during late october cox and troops advanced to kanawha river valley against no resistance they made winter quarters in charleston as it was easier to be resupplied because of river among union troops was a cavalry regiment known as 2nd regiment of loyal virginia volunteer cavalry this regiment was organized a year earlier and consisted mostly of volunteers from ohio counties near ohio river its commander was colonel john c paxton regiment s quarters for winter was at camp piatt virginia about southeast of charleston on kanawha river camp had a strategic location at intersection of kanawha river james river and kanawha turnpike kanawha river and kanawha turnpike were water and land routes to ohio river union troops and supplies were often moved by steamboat up kanawha river to charleston and camp piatt charleston also had strategic value since a salt works was located nearby 2nd virginia cavalry was glad to be back at winter quarters in camp piatt virginia and believed they had completed their work for year on november 22 colonel paxton received a surprising order from new division commander recently promoted brigadier general george crook thus paxton would lead cavalry and infantry in an attack on two rebel camps one rebel camp was located in sinking creek valley and other was west of valley near williamsburg before regiment departed general crook confidentially told major william h powell not to return to camp without good results to cold knob mountain thumb 400px right western virginia map from 1862 showing

remain concealed all companies were included except b and c and this totaled to about 475 men their rendezvous point with infantry was on cold knob mountain this mountain is one of taller mountains in today s west virginia with an elevation of following day regiment traveled another in very cold weather before searching for a suitable place to make camp lieutenant jeremiah davidson of advance guard was in charge of selecting a camp site proceeding with a guide far ahead of advance guard he suddenly found himself surrounded by five rebels davidson deceived rebels saying he was scouting for a campsite for colonel albert g jenkins rebel cavalry he also said that he got his blue uniform from a yankee satisfied rebels let davidson proceed shortly thereafter rebels saw rest of advance guard of 2nd virginia cavalry and fled into woods rebels were all captured including a lieutenant captured by major powell regiment continued to top of mountain in extreme cold a snow storm began that night possibly earlier and it was still snowing on morning of 26th colonel philander p lane was commander of 11th ohio infantry his regiment departed from its summerville camp on november 24 with 500 men infantry s departure point and route were different from paxton s cavalry lane s infantry marched through a rain storm on november 25 and reached top of cold knob mountain that evening where there was a snow storm lane s report mentions frozen equipment and estimated that about of snow was on ground paxton s cavalry met with lane s infantry at a point on cold knob mountain around noon on november 26 two colonels conferred and lane decided that his regiment was not in condition to continue mission his men were wet and cold and they began their return to their camp in summerville paxton also considered ending mission but decided to continue after being convinced by major powell powell was assigned to lead advance guard and selected lieutenant jeremiah davidson and 20 men from company g to join him advance guard followed by rest of cavalry regiment proceeded down mountain toward rebel camps raid thumb 300px right major powell leads surprise raid on confederate cavalry camp alt uniformed soldiers on horses using sabers to attack enemy camp as union cavalry s advance guard rounded a sharp turn it encountered four rebel scouts and captured two of them from two prisoners major powell s group was able to learn location and strength of two rebel camps two escaped rebels were not strongly pursued and did not see entire advance guard they assumed they had encountered a small group of union home guard and had no concerns as they returned to a very quiet camp of about 500 men observing that two rebels returning to camp were not challenged by guards powell and his 21 men decided to capture entire camp despite remaining portion of regiment being too far away to offer immediate support each man in powell s group was armed with a saber and two 54 caliber navy colt revolvers meaning group had over 200 shots before needing to reload a decision was made to avoid shooting if possible so second rebel camp which was located about away would not be alarmed powell and his men charged down valley a distance of about to middle of rebel cavalry camp many of surprised rebels did not even have their weapons loaded some of rebels tried to accost union cavalry by grabbing their legs but were met with butt of a colt revolver or a saber powell demanded a surrender in exchange for sparing lives of rebels and this was accepted thus powell davidson and 20 men captured a camp of 500 confederate cavalry men without firing a weapon on november 26 aftermath many of surprised rebels fled and pursuit was difficult because of terrain colonel paxton and regiment did not arrive in time for rebel surrender but sight of union regiment prevented other confederate cavalry camp from attacking a second objective of mission after breaking up rebel camps was to continue to covington to rescue a union sympathizer held by confederates however cavalry was forced to return to its home camp because of large number of prisoners and captured horses in its possession colonel paxton s report said that 2 rebels were killed 2 were wounded and 1 was paroled two officers 1 captain and 1 lieutenant were captured non commissioned officers and privates taken prisoner totaled to 111 also captured were 106 horses and 5 mules about 200 enfield and mississippi rifles were destroyed as were 50 sabers additional supplies and tents were also destroyed union casualties were two horses killed return
