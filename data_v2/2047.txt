maserati mc12 tipo is a limited production two seater sports car produced by italian car maker maserati to allow a racing variant to compete in fia gt championship car entered production in 2004 with 25 cars produced a further 25 were produced in 2005 making a total of 50 cars available for customers each of which was pre sold for eur600 000 us 670 541 with addition of 12 cars produced for racing only a total of 62 of these cars were ever produced maserati designed and built car on chassis of enzo ferrari but final car is much larger and has a lower drag coefficient mc12 is longer wider and taller and has a sharper nose and smoother curves than enzo ferrari which has faster acceleration better braking performance shorter braking distance and a higher top speed top speed of maserati mc12 is 330 kilometres per hour 205 mph whereas top speed of enzo ferrari is 350 kilometres per hour 217 5 mph mc12 was developed to signal maserati s return to racing after 37 years road version was produced to homologate race version one requirement for participation in fia gt is production of at least 25 road cars three gt1 race cars were entered into fia gt with great success maserati began racing mc12 in fia gt toward end of 2004 season winning race held at zhuhai international circuit racing mc12s were entered into american le mans series races in 2005 but exceeded size restrictions and consequently paid weight penalties due to excess range development under direction of giorgio maserati began development of an fia gt eligible race car this car which would eventually be named mc12 was initially called mcc maserati corse competizione and was to be developed simultaneously with a road going version called mcs maserati corse stradale frank stephenson director of ferrari maserati concept design and development at time did majority of body styling but initial shape was developed during wind tunnel testing from an idea presented by mcc has a very similar body shape to mc12 but there are several key differences most notably rear spoiler andrea bertolini served as chief test driver throughout development although some testing was done by michael schumacher who frequently tested mcc at fiorano circuit during development process mcc name was set aside after maserati established car s official name mc12 car is based heavily on enzo ferrari using a slightly modified version of ferrari dino v12 engine same gearbox but given unique name of maserati cambiocorsa and same chassis and track length of axle between wheels windshield is only externally visible component shared with enzo mc12 has a unique body which is wider longer and slightly taller increased size creates greater downforce across mc12 s body in addition to downforce created by two metre spoiler overview thumb maserati mc12 in classic fuji white at monte carlo casino mc12 is a two door coupe with a targa top roof although detached roof cannot be stored in car mid rear layout engine between axles but behind cabin keeps centre of gravity in middle of car which increases stability and improves car s cornering ability standing weight distribution is 41 front and 59 rear at speed however downforce provided by rear spoiler affects this to extent that at 200 kilometres per hour 125 mph downforce is 34 front and 66 rear interior even though car is designed as a homologation vehicle and is a modification of a racing car interior is intended to be luxurious interior is a mix of gel coated carbon fibre blue leather and silver a synthetic material which was found to be too expensive for fashion industry centre console features characteristic maserati oval analogue clock and a blue ignition button but it has been criticised for lacking a radio car stereo or a place to install an aftermarket sound system exterior thumb right rear view body of car made entirely of carbon fibre underwent extensive wind tunnel testing to achieve maximum downforce across all surfaces as a result rear spoiler is two metres 79 in wide but only 30 millimetres 1 2 in thick underside of car is smooth and rear bumper has diffusers to take advantage of ground effect air is sucked into engine compartment through air scoop its positioning on top of cabin makes car taller than enzo exterior is available only in white and blue colour scheme a tribute to america racing team that drove maserati tipo birdcages in early 1960s bespoke colour schemes are available by paying an extra amount car is noted for awkwardness that results from its size very long and wider than a hummer h2 this combined with lack of a rear window can make parking mc12 challenging engine mc12 sports a enzo ferrari derived longitudinally mounted 65deg v12 engine each cylinder has 4 valves lubricated via a dry sump system with a compression ratio of 11 2 1 these combine to provide a maximum torque of at 5 500 rpm and a maximum power of at 7 500 rpm redline rpm is indicated at 7 500 despite being safe up to 7 700 whereas enzo has its redline at 8 000 rpm maserati mc12 can accelerate from 0 to in 3 8 seconds though motor trend magazine managed 3 7 seconds and on to in 9 9 seconds it can complete a standing from stationary in 11 3 seconds with a terminal speed of or a standing kilometre in 20 1 seconds maximum speed of maserati mc12 is power is fed to wheels through a rear mounted six speed semi automatic transmission gearbox is same as enzo s transmission tuned to different gear ratios but renamed maserati cambiocorsa it provides a shift time of just 150 milliseconds and is mechanical with a twin plate dry clutch 15 12 18 11 57 11 19 10 94 10 71 14 10 1 chassis mc12 s chassis is a monocoque made of carbon and nomex with an aluminium sub chassis at front and rear it has a roll bar to provide additional strength comfort and safety double wishbone suspension with push rod operated coil springs provide stability and dampers smooth ride for passengers front of car can be raised for speed bumps and hills by pressing a button that extends front suspension there are two modes for chassis tuning which can also be changed with a button in cabin sport standard setting and race which features less of bosch asr anti slip regulation traction control faster shifts and stiffer suspension wheels thumb right maserati mc12 wheel mc12 has 480 millimetre 19 in wheels with a width of 230

centre lock wheel nuts that hold wheels to chassis are colour coded red on left of car blue on right reception car has generally received mixed reviews with critics saying it is hard to drive overpriced and too large other criticisms include lack of a trunk rear window spare tire and radio and way car s engine was limited or drugged current driver for vitaphone racing team andrea bertolini chief test driver throughout development said car reacts well and is very reliable in its reactions top gear television series acquired an mc12 and test driver stig achieved a lap time of 1 18 9 around top gear track 0 1 seconds faster than his lap in enzo ferrari host jeremy clarkson also drove it comparing it to maserati a car he disliked clarkson criticised car greatly pointing out that unlike enzo it lacks a rear window he also commented that it is difficult due to its size and one of cars he has ever driven meaning a small action by driver results in an exaggerated reaction from car for these reasons he promptly renamed car mc hammer regarding design of a racing car and modification to road standards he said is it a racer is it a gt car is it a de tuned enzo in a fat suit you can t really tell despite his criticisms he complimented smooth ride blockquote motor trend magazine reviewer frank markus had a more positive opinion despite initial skepticism he said it turns out that enzo makes a more comfortable and attractive road car when made over as a butch maserati racer in street couture markus complimented stability of braking and handling ability of mc12 especially drifting allowed by traction control when cornering commenting that there s none of knife edged limit handling we criticised in more extreme enzo it s even more forgiving at limit than an acura nsx when automobile magazine tested an mc12 reviewer preston lerner called it user friendly praising responsiveness and simplicity of driving lerner approved of frank stephenson s work with styling of both car s exterior and interior calling trim speed racer ish but without looking as though it belongs in a nitrous ized civic he also complimented asr s level of intervention commenting that it lets fun factor get reasonably high before kicking in in 2008 an mc12 was at nurburgring nordschleife and obtained a 7 24 29 second lap time this was also second time an mc12 recorded a faster lap time than its ferrari counterpart with enzo lapping track 1 second slower racing fia gt in 2004 maserati completed three mc12 gt1 race cars intended for fia gt gt1 class af corse factory backed squad

2005 governing body of alms international motor sports association imsa allowed mc12s to compete as a guest with agreement that they were not allowed to score championship points and were forced to run a weight penalty some alms teams initially objected to participation of mc12 due to possibility that an accident could eliminate their chances at 24 hours of le mans but mc12 was finally allowed to race aco stood by their ruling on car by forbidding it from entering other le mans series lone mc12 would be campaigned under maserati corse banner but run by american risi competizione team 2005
