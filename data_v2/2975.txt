beautiful nuthatch sitta formosa sometimes called callisitta formosa is a bird species in sittidae family collectively known as nuthatches it is a large nuthatch measuring in length that is not sexually dimorphic its coloration and markings are dramatic upper parts being black and azure streaked with white and pale blue on head and lined with same colors on wing feathers underparts are orange and eyebrow and throat are ochre an irregular dark eyestripe highlights its eye s ecology is not fully described but it is known to feed on small insects and larvae found on trunks and epiphyte covered branches of trees in its range reproduction takes place from april to may nest is placed in hole of an oak rhododendron or other large tree nest is made of plant material and fur in which bird typically lays four to six eggs although species is found in most of countries making up mainland of southeast asia it appears to be rare throughout its range its population being highly localized where it is found bird nests predominantly in mountain forests at an altitudinal range from up to nearly with some seasonal height adjustment down to around in winter its apparent localization within its range makes rigorous estimates of its population difficult but its habitat is threatened by deforestation and species appear to be in decline it has been classified as vulnerable by international union for conservation of nature taxonomy nuthatches constitute a genus sitta of small passerine birds belonging to family sittidae typified by short compressed wings and short square 12 feathered tails a compact body longish pointed bills strong toes with long claws and behaviorally by their unique head first manner of descending tree trunks most nuthatches have gray or bluish upperparts and a black eyestripe sitta is derived from ancient greek name for nuthatches sitte nuthatch first recorded in 1350 is derived from nut and a word probably related to hack since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices genus may be further divided into seven subgenera of which beautiful nuthatch is placed alone in callisitta bonaparte 1850 and species is therefore sometimes called callisitta formosa beautiful nuthatch was first described in 1843 by british zoologist edward blyth from a specimen he examined in darjeeling its kinship with other members of genus is unclear bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to blue nuthatch s or other blue tinted nuthatch species such as velvet fronted nuthatch s frontalis yellow billed nuthatch s and sulphur billed nuthatch s but its distribution being focused in eastern himalayas and uniqueness of its plumage argues against assumption according to international ornithological congress and ornithologist alan p peterson no subspecies have been identified in 2014 eric pasquet et al published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial dna of 21 nuthatch species position of beautiful nuthatch within genus was not established with certainty having a far lower statistical association than others in model nevertheless under findings species appears closest evolutionarily to three clades of nuthatches two nuthatches that prefer rocky environments western rock nuthatch s and eastern rock nuthatch s species in europaea group including eurasian nuthatch s europaea siberian nuthatch s arctica chestnut vented nuthatch s kashmir nuthatch s indian nuthatch s castanea chestnut bellied nuthatch s and burmese nuthatch s neglecta as well as white tailed nuthatch s himalayensis and therefore white browed nuthatch s victoriae these close relatives are generally all species that plaster entrance to their nest with mud description thumb left alt schematic drawing of bird clinging to a vertical support head down drawing depicting main morphological features described by erik in his 1998 treatise nuthatches as a bird that deserves its name beautiful nuthatch has highly distinctive plumage its upperparts are black and azure and it is orange on underparts crown and upper mantle are black streaked with pale blue and white scapulars back and rump are an azure blue greater and medium coverts are black finely edged with white forming two narrow wing bars flight feathers are black and more or less lined with pale blue eyebrow and throat are white and buff and eye is highlighted by an irregular dark eyestripe under wing white base of primary coverts contrasts sharply with gray undertail coverts a distinguishing trait when viewing bird in flight iris is reddish brown or dark brown and bill is black but for a whitish tinge at base of lower mandible lower parts are generally orange cinnamon legs and feet are yellowish brown olive brown or greenish brown there is no sexual dimorphism juveniles are very similar to adults but streaks on mantle are blue rather than white primary coverts of juveniles are also more closely lined with blue and underparts are paler overall especially on chest adults perform a complete moult after breeding season whereas juveniles only have a partial moult in which they replace a variable number of rectrices bird is large as compared with other members of genus sitta measuring in length folded wing measure in males and in females tail is in males and in females beak measures between and and tarsus is in length weight is not known ecology and behavior voice s formosa s vocalizations are not well known but its song is described as low and sweet in tone its call is typical of nuthatches and similar to that of eurasian nuthatch sitta europaea but less strident feeding thumb left in bhutan branches shown are covered with epiphytes beautiful nuthatch forages alone in pairs or in small groups of four to five individuals though an unusual gathering of 21 individuals was observed in one tree in bhutan it often takes part in mixed species foraging flocks and has been notably observed feeding with himalayan cutia cutia nipalensis and velvet fronted nuthatch sitta frontalis two other species that prospect for food on tree trunks other foraging flock partners surveyed are long tailed lesser racket tailed drongo dicrurus maroon oriole and white browed scimitar babbler s formosa forages from about middle to apex of tall trees exploring trunks and epiphyte covered branches lichens mosses orchids for small insects but also prospect on outermost branches in laos individuals were observed feeding while perched on larger branches of a fokienia evergreen fokienia a tree frequently enveloped in epiphytes bird has been described at times as most timid of nuthatches it prospects in a manner typical of many others in its genus sometimes hanging upside down for an extended time surveying its surroundings as compared with other nuthatch species has been described as working as they peck at trunks lichen and other epiphytes searching for prey stomach contents of collected chinese specimens consisted of beetles and insect larvae breeding reproduction in species has not been well studied in northeast of india breeding season is from april to may nest is placed off ground between two and eight meters high and is often built in a hole of a living or dead oak or rhododendron tree or sometimes in other large trees nests are constructed using leaves and bark held together with hair often that of bamboo rats if opening of hole is too large it is cemented with mud to reduce entrance size bird usually lays four to six white eggs speckled with red spots that measure beautiful nuthatch sexes are reported to share equally in nest building and incubation duties distribution and habitat thumb approximate distribution in southeast asia by simon harrap 1996 this species lives in eastern himalayas and has been reported in several scattered sites across southeast asia in northwest of vietnam and in central laos its range stretches west into northeast of india where it was reported seen near darjeeling in west bengal but not since 1933 it is present in bhutan and in indian states of sikkim in town of in meghalaya in khasi hills in assam in dima district in south of arunachal pradesh and in manipur and nagaland its presence in bangladesh is uncertain but it is found further west in north of burma in chin state in chin hills arakan yoma montane forests sagaing region in kachin state and in shan state data on bird from laos is erratic but there are reports of sightings north of and of large numbers of species wintering in center of country in pristine wilderness of nakai nam there are also reports of sightings in southeast of china s yunnan province in northern thailand and in northwestern vietnam its residential and breeding range is estimated to cover thumb left in natural habitat in bhutan beautiful nuthatches typically inhabit both interior and outskirts of evergreen or semi evergreen mountain forests though in northern burma they have been recorded nesting in trees scattered across open areas in central laos bird was found associated with fokienia evergreen they usually live at altitudes of and up to nearly during warm seasons but may make seasonal vertical migration in india for example species spends summer between and but was observed during winter at just in sikkim and in northeastern arunachal pradesh at and between and in burma they were observed at between and in china between and in laos between and and in thailand only observation of species was at a height of threats and protection beautiful nuthatch has always been rare and very localized throughout its distribution perhaps due to very specific ecological requirements though this has been questioned as not in keeping with diversity of habitats in which s formosa has been observed although species is less threatened at high elevations its habitat has been reduced by deforestation due to logging and forest clearance to make way for human habitation in center of laos and northern vietnam fokienia trees which are a known beautiful nuthatch foraging source and nesting site are harvested for their high commercial value research conducted in 2001 indicated a population comprising 2 500 to 10 000 adults and between 3 500 and 15 000 total individuals these numbers are in decline species has been classified as vulnerable by international union for conservation of
