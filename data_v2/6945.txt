sukhoi su 35 35 nato reporting name flanker e is designation for two improved derivatives of su 27 air defence fighter they are single seat twin engine aircraft designed by sukhoi design bureau and built by komsomolsk on amur aircraft plant first variant was designed by soviet union during 1980s as an improvement on su 27 and was known as su 27m this derivative incorporated canards and a multi function radar that transformed aircraft into a multi role aircraft which was structurally reinforced to cope with its greater weight first prototype made its maiden flight in june 1988 as aircraft was not mass produced due to dissolution of soviet union sukhoi re designated aircraft as su 35 to attract export orders fourteen aircraft produced were used for tests and demonstrations one example had thrust vectoring engines and resultant su 37 was used as a technology demonstrator a sole su 35ub two seat trainer was also built in late 1990s that resembled su 30mk family in 2003 sukhoi embarked on a second modernization of su 27 to serve as an interim aircraft awaiting development of sukhoi pak fa su 57 program also known as su 35 this version has a redesigned cockpit and weapons control system compared to su 27m and features thrust vectoring engines in place of canards type made its first flight in february 2008 although aircraft was designed for export russian air force in 2009 became launch customer of aircraft with production version called su 35s china s people s liberation army air force and indonesian air force have also ordered aircraft design and development upgraded su 27 first aircraft design to receive su 35 designation had its origins in early 1980s at a time when su 27 was being introduced into service with soviet armed forces definitive production version of su 27 which had factory code of t 10s started mass serial production with komsomolsk on amur aircraft production association knaapo in 1983 following year this su 27 version reached initial operational readiness with soviet air defence forces having begun work on an upgraded su 27 variant in 1982 gordon 2007 p 69 sukhoi design bureau was instructed in december 1983 by soviet council of ministers to use su 27 as basis for development of su 27m t 10m andrews 2003 p 39 nikolay nikitin would lead design effort throughout much of project s existence under oversight of general director mikhail simonov who had been chief designer of su 27 gordon 2007 pp 58 122 thumb upright left planform view of su 27m while sharing broadly blended wing body design of su 27 su 27m is visibly distinguished from basic version by addition of canards which are small lifting surfaces ahead of wings first tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft canards in complement with reshaped wing leading edge extension redirected airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed airframe to sustain 10 g manoeuvres as opposed to 9 g on su 27 without need for additional structural reinforcement fink 1993 p 45 more importantly when working with relaxed stability design and accompanying fly by wire flight control system aerodynamic layout improved aircraft s manoeuvrability it enabled aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past vertical while maintaining forward momentum because of this theoretically during combat pilot could pitch su 27m up 120 degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at target gordon 2007 pp 122 123 other notable visible changes compared to t 10s design included taller vertical tails provisions for in flight refuelling and use of two wheel nose undercarriage to support heavier airframe williams 2002 p 119 gordon 2007 pp 123 127 besides increase in manoeuvrability another feature that distinguished su 27m from original design was new weapons control system centrepiece of this system was multi function n011 bars literally leopard phased array radar with pulse doppler tracking that allowed it to detect targets below horizon first installed on third prototype radar transformed su 27m from simply being an air defence fighter into a multi role aircraft capable of attacking ground targets gordon 2007 p 124 compared to sword radar of su 27 which could track 10 targets and only direct two missiles towards one target at a time new radar could track fifteen targets and direct missiles towards six of them simultaneously extra weight of n011 radar at front of aircraft necessitated addition of canards engineers would only later discover aerodynamic advantages of these devices butowski 2004 p 38 gordon 2007 p 69 in addition an self defence radar was housed in rearward projecting tail boom making aircraft first in world to have such a radar other changes to aircraft included use of uprated turbofan engines as well as increased use of lightweight composites and aluminium lithium alloys in aircraft s structure gordon 2007 p 123 testing and demonstration in 1987 sukhoi started converting first prototype designated from a t 10s airframe at its experimental plant in moscow although it had canards first prototype like several subsequent aircraft lacked many physical alterations of new design gordon 2007 pp 126 127 it made its first flight after conversion on 28 june 1988 piloted by oleg followed by second prototype in january 1989 gordon 2007 p 128 following conversions of two su 27m prototypes actual production of aircraft was transferred to country s far east where it was carried out by knaapo third aircraft which was first new built su 27m and first to be constructed by knaapo made its first flight in april 1992 by then soviet union had disintegrated and ensuing economic crisis in russia throughout 1990s meant that original plan to mass produce aircraft between 1996 and 2005 was abandoned with aircraft to serve as experimental test beds to validate canards flight control system and thrust vectoring technology in total two prototypes nine flying pre production and three production aircraft were constructed by 1995 production aircraft were delivered in 1996 to russian air force for weapons testing thumb left ninth su 27m in flight by time of disintegration of soviet union sukhoi had been demonstrating su 27m to senior defence and government officials with its debut to a western audience at 1992 farnborough airshow company redesignated aircraft as su 35 gordon 2007 pp 129 131 aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders starting in november 1993 with dubai where viktor pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an su 30mk in front of spectators fink 1993 p 44 gordon 2007 pp 134 135 aircraft thereafter flew in berlin and paris and would be a regular feature at moscow s maks air show russian government cleared aircraft for export during sukhoi s unsuccessful sales campaign in south korea during late 1990s and early 2000s flight international 2001 p 20 company also marketed aircraft to brazil china and united arab emirates as flight test programme of su 27m proceeded engineers discovered that pilot failed to maintain active control of aircraft during certain manoeuvres such as pugachev s cobra eleventh su 27m was therefore equipped with thrust vectoring engine nozzles in 1995 and resultant su 37 technology demonstrator made its first flight on 2 april 1996 gordon 2007 pp 142 144 1996 p 16 it also tested enhanced n011m radar as did twelfth developmental su 27m andrews 2003 pp 58 su 37 s ability to maintain a high angle of attack while flying at close to zero airspeed attracted considerable press attention 1996 p 52 it later received different engines and updated fly by wire controls and cockpit systems for evaluation apart from single seat design a two seat aircraft was also constructed working in cooperation with sukhoi knaapo s own engineers designed su 35ub so as to combine thrust vectoring engines with features of su 27m modified from an su 30mkk airframe aircraft made its first flight on 7 august 2000 and afterwards served as an avionics test bed gordon 2007 pp 172 173 while original su 27m never entered mass production due to a lack of funding barrie 1997 p 8 sukhoi refined su 27m s use of canards and su 37 s thrust vectoring technology and later applied them to su 30mki two seat fighter for indian air force andrews 2003 p 47 tenth su 27m t10m 10 also served as a test bed for saturn al engine that is intended for sukhoi su 57 previously known under acronym pak fa jet fighter gordon 2007 p 173 modernization thumb thrust vectoring nozzle on a sukhoi su 35s with need to update russia s aging fleet of su 27 aircraft sukhoi and knaapo in 2002 started integrating glass cockpits and improved weapons control systems to accommodate a greater variety of weapons to existing air force aircraft su as modified aircraft is called made its first flight in december 2002 fiszer 2004 pp 52 53 initial success of this project led sukhoi in december 2003 to proceed with a follow up modernization programme known internally as t 10bm programme was aimed at a more thorough redesign of airframe to narrow qualitative gap between russian aircraft and foreign fourth generation aircraft resultant design also designated su 35 would serve as an interim solution pending introduction of sukhoi su 57 fifth generation fighter fiszer 2004 p 53 butowski 2007 pp 34 35 many features of which aircraft would incorporate additionally aircraft was to be a single seat alternative to two seat design of su 30mk on export market in many respects t 10bm design outwardly resembles su 27 more than su 27m during tests of thrust vectoring engines and su 27m s aerodynamic layout sukhoi had concluded that loss of manoeuvrability due to removal of canards design of which imposed a weight penalty on airframe could be compensated for by addition of thrust vectoring nozzles industry progress in fields of avionics and radars have also reduced weight and size of such components which shifted centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward butowski 2004 p 39 therefore designers removed canards and dorsal air brake found on su 27m size of vertical tails aft cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced with such changes as well as increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites designers had reduced empty weight of aircraft kopp 2010 p 9 while maintaining a similar maximum take off weight to su 27m thumb left su 35s cockpit layout a head up display two multi function liquid crystal displays and a control stick with hotas controls while su 27m design had avionics to give aircraft nominal designation as a multi role fighter flight tests with russian air force revealed difficulties in efficiently deploying aircraft s armament according to aviation week space technology air force pilots described weapons trials with aircraft in akhtubinsk and lipetsk as a negative experience with a particular emphasis on layout of cockpit and its adverse impact on workload of single pilot designers test pilots and avionics software specialists therefore worked together to redesign cockpit and its attendant systems and improve human machine interface information management system of aircraft s avionics suite had been changed so that it now has two digital computers which process information from flight and weapons control systems information is then displayed on two multi function liquid crystal displays which replaced smaller multi function cathode ray tube displays found on su 27m pilot can also view critical flight information on head up display and is equipped with hands on throttle and stick hotas controls su 35 employs powerful n035 irbis e snow leopard passive electronically scanned array pesa radar which is a further development of n011m radar that had been evaluated on su 27m test beds and constitutes core of su 35 s weapons control system it is capable of detecting an aerial target up to away and can track thirty airborne targets and engage eight of them simultaneously in addition multi function radar is capable of providing high resolution images of ground using synthetic aperture mode gordon 2007 p 175 aircraft is equipped with an ols 35 optoelectronic targeting system ahead of cockpit to provide other forms of tracking including infra red search and track for defences against enemy tracking su 35 is equipped with m electronic countermeasure system while engineers have applied radar absorbent materials to engine inlets and front stages of engine compressor to halve su 35 s frontal radar cross section and minimise detection range of enemy radars sweetman 2004 p 26 multi role su 35 can deploy air to air missiles of up to range and can carry heavy anti ship cruise missile as well as multitude of air to ground weaponry butowski 2007 p 36 gordon 2007 pp 175 176 classical air combat starts at high speed but if you miss on first shot and probability is there because there are maneuvers to avoid missiles combat will be more prolonged after maneuvering aircraft will be at a lower speed but both aircraft may be in a position where they cannot shoot but supermaneuverability allows an aircraft to turn within three seconds and take another shot sergey bogdan sukhoi chief test pilot su 35 is powered by a pair of saturn al 41f1s formerly known as izdeliye product turbofan engines while based on al 31f engine of su 27m it shares some of core design of su 57 s more powerful saturn al izdeliye 117 butowski 2004 pp 39 40 aircraft is equipped with thrust vectoring nozzles which has their rotational axes canted at an angle similar to configuration on su 30mki and su 57 nozzles operate in one plane for pitch but canting allows aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently sweetman 2013 p 44 su 35 s thrust vectoring system and integrated flight and propulsion control systems allow aircraft to attain supermaneuverability enabling it to perform post stall manoeuvres at low speeds this differs from western air combat doctrine which emphasises maintenance of a fighter aircraft s kinetic energy sweetman 2013 p 33 engine gives su 35 limited ability to sustain supersonic speed without use of afterburners according to carlo kopp of think tank air power australia such a supercruise feature allows su 35 to engage an opponent at a greater speed and altitude and increases range of its long range missiles by 30 40 percent he cites aircraft s mature airframe and carefully balanced combination of advanced technology as allowing su 35 to achieve a favourable exchange rate against f 35 stealth fighter kopp 2010 p 10 a rand corporation study in 2008 found that su 35 could shoot down 2 4 f 35s for every aircraft lost archibald 2016 p 13 however us department of defense and lockheed martin had refuted criticisms of aircraft claiming that it is 400 percent more effective in air

primarily at export market butowski 2004 p 40 during early stages of flight test programme sukhoi estimated that there was such a market for 160 aircraft with a particular emphasis on latin america southeast asia and middle east some of candidate countries such as algeria malaysia and india were already operators of su 30mk family as aircraft was to be available for export starting in 2010 gordon 2007 p 111 actual launch order for 48 su 35s aircraft was placed by russian defence ministry at 2009 maks air show as part of a larger deal worth us 2 5 billion for 64 fighter aircraft during type s international debut at 2013 paris air show mikhail general director of sukhoi s parent company united aircraft corporation stated that there was an estimated demand for 200 aircraft split evenly between domestic and export markets it was not until end of 2015 when first export contract was signed with china by then russian government had placed a follow up order for 50 aircraft apart from launch order at 2009 maks air show russian government and state owned development bank agreed to provide sukhoi with capital for aircraft s production in november 2009 knaapo which was renamed in 2013 after it became part of sukhoi company started manufacturing first production aircraft general assembly of which was completed in october 2010 by then pilots and engineers had successfully completed preliminary tests of aircraft s systems first su 35s took its maiden flight in may 2011 and would be delivered along with other aircraft to akhtubinsk to start state joint tests with defence ministry to prepare aircraft for service because production of su 35s occurred alongside trials some early production aircraft were later modified as a result of such tests fomin 2014 p 37 on 11

december 2012 five flew to gromov flight research institute in zhukovsky where aircraft would in february 2013 start second stage of trials this stage which was scheduled to last eighteen months would focus on su 35 s weapons and maneuverability in combat twelve production su 35s fighters were delivered to air force in december 2013 followed by another twelve production aircraft in february 2014 ten of which were handed over to 23rd fighter aviation regiment stationed in far east with remaining two tasked with carrying out final phase of state joint tests handover marked official entry of aircraft into operational service by then 34 of 48 aircraft originally ordered had been delivered with remaining 14 due in 2015 several su 35ss were later transferred to lipetsk to further develop combat tactics and to train service personnel fomin 2014 p 36 russia s su 35ss are also permanently based at besovets air base near finnish border and at centralnaya uglovaya air base near vladivostok introduction of su 35s into service with russian air force is a part of russia s state armament programme for 2011 2020 that was formulated following war with georgia in 2008 with an aim to significantly increase number of modern military equipment in russian armed forces aircraft is delivered alongside su 30m2 and su 30sm and heavier su 34 strike aircraft pyadushkin 2010 p 28 first two are domestic variants of knaapo s su 30mk2 and s su 30mki two seat export aircraft according to reports simultaneous acquisition of three fighter derivatives of original su 27 was to support two aircraft manufacturers amidst a slump in export orders su 30m2 serves as a trainer aircraft for su 35 russian knights aerobatic team initially considered su 35s as main replacement for team s eight su 27 fighters but su 30sm was selected instead because of convenience of a two seat design nevertheless it received four newly built su 35s fighters in november 2019 su 35s attained full operational capability foc in late 2018 2015 russian military intervention in syria thumb a russian defence ministry video of su 35s in january 2016 russia for first time combat deployed four of its su 35s fighters to khmeimim air base in syria as part of russia s air operations in country this occurred following increased tensions between russia and turkey as result of reported incursions by russian aircraft into turkish airspace su 35ss deployed to syria are to provide air cover for su flying combat air patrols as well as for other russia s aircraft when on bombing missions its combat deployment to syria helped to find and subsequently resolve number of problems for example with aircraft avionics this also helped to promote aircraft globally according to united aircraft corporation president on 20 august 2019 two russian air force su 35ss operating from khmeimim air base intercepted two turkish air force f 16s over southern idlib and forced them to leave syrian airspace on 26 august 2019 two russian su 35ss intercepted an israeli air force aircraft over mediterranean sea preparing for a second wave of attacks on syria forced them to retreat russian su 35ss again intercepted several israeli aircraft over southern syria on 10 september 2019 and prevented them from carrying out airstrikes another interception allegedly occurred on 19 september 2019 when two russian su 35ss intercepted israeli aircraft preparing for airstrikes on suburbs of damascus on 15 october 2019 a turkish f 16 fighter was intercepted by russian su 35s fighters and forced to retreat as it was attempting to bomb headquarters of syrian democratic forces in manbij on 12 november 2019 russian su 35ss intercepted an israeli military aircraft during airstrikes on damascus on 7 december 2019 several israeli aircraft were intercepted by russian su 35s fighters and forced to retreat during an attempt to bomb t 4 airbase china during early 1990s a sales arrangement of su 27m to china was discussed sukhoi officials in 1995 announced their proposal to co produce su 27m with china contingent on beijing s agreement to purchase 120 aircraft gill and kim 1995 p 60 however it was alleged that russian foreign ministry blocked sale of su 27m and tupolev tu 22m bomber over concerns about arrangements for chinese production of su 27 zhao 2004 p 216 in november 2015 china became first export customer for su 35 when russian and chinese governments signed a contract worth 2 billion for purchase of 24 aircraft for people s liberation army air force although chinese officials had first shown interest in modernized su 35 design in 2006 it was not until 2010 that rosoboronexport russian state agency responsible for export and import of defence products was ready to start talks with chinese government on sale of su 35 russian officials publicly confirmed that talks had been going on in 2012 when a protocol agreement on purchase of aircraft was signed there were subsequent media reports and official remarks that two countries had signed a contract and deliveries of aircraft were imminent but negotiations would not actually conclude until 2015 discussions over sale of su 35 proved protracted due to concerns over intellectual property rights as china had reverse engineered su 27sk and su 33 to create j 11b and j 15 respectively there were concerns that china would copy airframe and offer copied design on export market at one stage rosoboronexport demanded that china provide a legally binding guarantee against copying however industry sources believed that chinese industry was interested in al engine and irbis e radar pyadushkin 2014 p 19 according to diplomat china was specifically interested in engine of su 35 as country was already test flying j 11d while aircraft reportedly has less range payload and manoeuvrability than su 35 j 11d has an active electronically scanned array radar instead of less advanced pesa radar as found on su 35 various reports have drawn attention to need for chinese industry to close technological gap between its engine industry and those of us europe and russia rosoboronexport insisted on china purchasing a minimum of 48 aircraft to offset risks of copying after kremlin intervened in late 2012 minimum number of aircraft was lowered to 24 another seemingly intractable problem was chinese insistence that aircraft include chinese made components and avionics kremlin again intervened and conceded to such demands and allowed deal to proceed this was viewed as a major concession since sales of such components are reportedly lucrative contract did not include any technology transfer chinese military received first four aircraft in december 2016 followed by ten in 2017 and final ten in 2018 people s liberation army s website opined that with commissioning of j 20 russia had understood that su 35 would lose its value on chinese market in near future article said therefore we hope very much that su 35 will be last combat aircraft china imports su 35s officially entered service with plaaf in april 2018 and are based in guangdong province in southeast china on 20 september 2018 u s imposed sanctions on china s equipment development department and its director li for engaging in significant transactions with rosoboronexport specifically naming china s purchase of ten su 35 combat aircraft in 2017 as well as s 400 surface to air missile system related equipment in 2018 in november 2018 russia completed delivery of 24 su 35 fighters to china under 2015 contract contract is to be fully implemented by 2020 in june 2019 russia offered china a second batch of su 35 fighters indonesia in late 2014 russia offered su 35 to indonesia as country sought to replace its ageing f 5e tiger ii fleet following year indonesian ministry of defence selected su 35 ahead of eurofighter typhoon dassault rafale f 16 and saab jas 39 gripen defence ministry cited indonesian air force s familiarity with su 27sk and su 30mk2 as reason for aircraft s selection by mid 2017 negotiations between two parties for sale of su 35 had reached an advanced stage with indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft in february 2018 russia and indonesia finalised su 35 purchase contract for 11 aircraft worth 1 14 billion first delivery was expected in october 2018 but was delayed to 2019 potential operators united arab emirates in mid 1990s united arab emirates evaluated su 27m but later acquired mirage 2000 due to country s close relationship with france in 2015 its officials entered into negotiations with their russian counterparts about possible contract for modernized su 35 in february 2017 country signed a preliminary agreement for purchase of a number of su 35s later reported to be 24 and also signed an agreement with rostec russia s state owned corporation responsible for development of advanced industrial products to develop a fifth generation aircraft based on mig 29 india india has been reluctant to order sukhoi hal fgfa due to high cost and it has been reported that india and russia are studying an upgrade to su 35 with stealth technology similar to f 15 silent eagle as a more affordable alternative to fgfa su 57 egypt in march 2019 it was reported that egypt would procure over two dozen su 35 aircraft from russia in a deal valued about us 2 billion finalized in late 2018 deliveries are expected to begin as early as 2020 or 2021 however deputy head of rosoboronexport sergei denied any contract regarding to supply of su 35 fighters to egypt has been signed u s secretary of state mike pompeo warned egypt against purchasing russian su 35 saying we ve made clear that if those systems were to be purchased caatsa statute would require sanctions on regime turkey in july 2019 russia offered su 35s to turkey after it was removed from f 35 programme by united states due to purchase of s 400 missile system ceo of russian state corporation rostec sergey chemezov said if our turkish colleagues express a desire we are ready to work out deliveries of su 35 fighter jets previously in may 2019 sergey chemezov had said that russia was ready to cooperate with turkey on export and local production of su 57 others following deployment to syria of several new russian military systems various countries had reportedly expressed interest in su 35 these countries included algeria egypt and vietnam according to kommersant algerian military had requested an su 35 for testing in february 2016 country was satisfied with fighter s flight characteristics and so moscow is waiting for a formal application other countries that had also expressed interest in aircraft include kazakhstan north korea and pakistan although a russian official denied that country was in talks with latter about su 35 sudan has reportedly also expressed an interest in acquiring of su 35 fighters during sudanese
