an ontological argument is a philosophical argument for existence of god that uses ontology many arguments fall under category of ontological and they tend to involve arguments about state of being or existing more specifically ontological arguments tend to start with a priori theory about organization of universe if that organizational structure is true argument will provide reasons why god must exist first ontological argument in western christian tradition there are three main periods in history of ontological arguments first was in 11th century when st anselm of canterbury came up with first ontological argument miroslaw ed ontological proofs today verlag 2012 p 22 was proposed by anselm of canterbury in his 1078 work proslogion anselm defined god as a being than which no greater can be conceived ontological arguments stanford encyclopedia of philosophy 27 4 19 and argued that this being must exist in mind even in mind of person who denies existence of god he suggested that if greatest possible being exists in mind it must also exist in reality if it exists only in mind then an even greater being must be possible one which exists both in mind and in reality therefore this greatest possible being must exist in reality seventeenth century french philosopher rene descartes employed a similar argument descartes published several variations of his argument each of which centred on idea that god s existence is immediately from a clear and distinct idea of a supremely perfect being in early eighteenth century gottfried leibniz augmented descartes ideas in an attempt to prove that a supremely perfect being is a coherent concept a more recent ontological argument came from kurt godel who proposed a formal argument for god s existence norman malcolm revived ontological argument in 1960 when he located a second stronger ontological argument in anselm s work alvin plantinga challenged this argument and proposed an alternative based on modal logic attempts have also been made to validate anselm s proof using an automated theorem prover other arguments have been categorised as ontological including those made by islamic philosophers mulla sadra and allama since its proposal few philosophical ideas have generated as much interest and discussion as ontological argument nearly all of great minds of western philosophy have found argument worthy of their attention and a number of criticisms and objections have been mounted first critic of ontological argument was anselm s contemporary gaunilo of marmoutiers he used analogy of a perfect island suggesting that ontological argument could be used to prove existence of anything this was first of many parodies all of which attempted to show that argument has absurd consequences later thomas aquinas rejected argument on basis that humans cannot know god s nature also david hume offered an empirical objection criticising its lack of evidential reasoning and rejecting idea that anything can exist necessarily immanuel kant s critique was based on what he saw as false premise that existence is a predicate he argued that existing adds nothing including perfection to essence of a being and thus a supremely perfect being can be conceived not to exist finally philosophers including c d broad dismissed coherence of a maximally great being proposing that some attributes of greatness are incompatible with others rendering maximally great being incoherent contemporary defenders of ontological argument include alvin plantinga william alston and david bentley hart classification traditional definition of an ontological argument was given by immanuel kant he contrasted ontological argument literally any argument concerned with being with cosmological and physio theoretical arguments according to kantian view ontological arguments are those founded on a priori reasoning graham oppy who elsewhere expressed view that he see s no urgent reason to depart from traditional definition defined ontological arguments as those that begin with nothing but analytic a priori and necessary premises and conclude that god exists oppy admitted however that not all of traditional characteristics of an ontological argument necessity and a priority are found in all ontological arguments and in his 2007 work ontological arguments and belief in god suggested that a better definition of an ontological argument would employ only considerations entirely internal to theistic worldview oppy ontological arguments into definitional conceptual or modal meinongian experiential mereological higher order or hegelian categories based on qualities of their premises he defined these qualities as follows definitional arguments invoke definitions conceptual arguments invoke possession of certain kinds of ideas or concepts modal arguments consider possibilities meinongian arguments assert a distinction between different categories of existence experiential arguments employ idea that god exists solely to those who have had experience of him and hegelian arguments are from hegel he later categorised mereological as arguments that draw on theory of whole part relation william lane craig criticised oppy s study as too vague for useful classification craig argued that an argument can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce existence of god along with other necessary truths from his definition he suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim that if one fully understood concept of god one must accept his existence william l rowe defined ontological arguments as those that start from definition of god and using only a priori principles conclude with god s existence development although a version of ontological argument appears explicitly in writings of ancient greek philosopher xenophanes and variations appear in writings by parmenides plato and neoplatonists mainstream view is that ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by anselm of canterbury some scholars argued that islamic philosopher avicenna ibn sina developed a special kind of ontological argument before anselm steve a johnson 1984 ibn sina s fourth ontological argument for god s existence muslim world 74 3 4 161 171 but other scholars have doubted this position daniel dombrowski marked three major stages in development of argument anselm s initial explicit formulation eighteenth century criticisms of kant and hume and identification of a second ontological argument in anselm s proslogion by twentieth century philosophers anselm thumb upright anselm of canterbury was first to attempt an ontological argument for god s existence theologian and philosopher anselm of canterbury 1033 1109 proposed an ontological argument in second and third chapters of his proslogion anselm s argument was not presented in order to prove god s existence rather proslogion was a work of meditation in which he documented how idea of god became self evident to him in chapter 2 of proslogion anselm defined god as a being than which no greater can be conceived he suggested that even fool can understand this concept and this understanding itself means that being must exist in mind concept must exist either only in our mind or in both our mind and in reality if such a being exists only in our mind then a greater being that which exists in mind and in reality can be conceived this argument is generally regarded as a reductio ad absurdum because view of fool is proven to be inconsistent therefore if we can conceive of a being than which nothing greater can be conceived it must exist in reality thus a being than which nothing greater could be conceived which anselm defined as god must exist in reality anselm s argument in chapter 2 can be summarized as follows it is a conceptual truth or so to speak true by definition that god is a being than which none greater can be imagined that is greatest possible being that can be imagined god exists as an idea in mind a being that exists as an idea in mind and in reality is other things being equal greater than a being that exists only as an idea in mind thus if god exists only as an idea in mind then we can imagine something that is greater than god that is a greatest possible being that does exist but we cannot imagine something that is greater than god for it is a contradiction to suppose that we can imagine a being greater than greatest possible being that can be imagined therefore god exists in chapter 3 anselm presented a further argument in same vein by definition god is a being than which none greater can be imagined a being that necessarily exists in reality is greater than a being that does not necessarily exist thus by definition if god exists as an idea in mind but does not necessarily exist in reality then we can imagine something that is greater than god but we cannot imagine something that is greater than god thus if god exists in mind as an idea then god necessarily exists in reality god exists in mind as an idea therefore god necessarily exists in reality this contains notion of a being that cannot be conceived not to exist he argued that if something can be conceived not to exist then something greater can be conceived consequently a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist this can be read as a restatement of argument in chapter 2 although norman malcolm believed it to be a different stronger argument rene descartes thumb left upright french thinker rene descartes proposed several arguments that could be termed ontological rene descartes 1596 1650 proposed a number of ontological arguments which differed from anselm s formulation generally speaking they are less formal arguments than natural intuition descartes wrote in fifth meditation descartes argued that god s existence can be deduced from his nature just as geometric ideas can be deduced from nature of shapes he used deduction of sizes of angles in a triangle as an example he suggested that concept of god is that of a supremely perfect being holding all perfections he seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection thus if notion of god did not include existence it would not be supremely perfect as it would be lacking a perfection consequently notion of a supremely perfect god who does not exist descartes argues is unintelligible therefore according to his nature god must exist baruch spinoza in spinoza s ethics he wrote a section titled treating of god and what pertains to him in which he discusses god s existence and what god is he starts off by saying whether there is a god this we say can be proved spinoza b 2002 complete works s shirley m l morgan eds indianapolis in hackett publishing company his proof for god follows a similar structure as descartes ontological argument descartes attempts to prove god s existence by arguing that there must be some one thing that is supremely good through which all good things have their goodness nolan l 2001 june 18 descartes ontological argument spinoza s argument differs in that he does not move straight from of greatest being to existence of god but rather uses a deductive argument from idea of god spinoza says that man s ideas do not come from himself but from some sort of external cause thus things whose characteristics a man knows must have come from some prior source so if man has idea of god then god must exist before this thought because man cannot create an idea of his own imagination gottfried leibniz thumb upright right german philosopher gottfried leibniz attempted to prove coherence of a supremely perfect being gottfried wilhelm leibniz saw a problem with descartes ontological argument that descartes had not asserted coherence of a supremely perfect being he proposed that unless coherence of a supremely perfect being could be demonstrated ontological argument fails leibniz saw perfection as impossible to analyse therefore it would be impossible to demonstrate that all perfections are incompatible he reasoned that all perfections can exist together in a single entity and that descartes argument is still valid mulla sadra mulla sadra c 1571 2 1640 was an iranian shia islamic philosopher who was influenced by earlier muslim philosophers such as avicenna and as well as sufi ibn arabi sadra discussed avicenna s arguments for existence of god claiming that they were not a priori he rejected argument on basis that existence precedes essence or that existence of human beings is more fundamental than their essence sadra put forward a new argument known as argument or argument of righteous argument attempts to prove existence of god through reality of existence and to conclude with god s pre eternal necessity in this argument a thing is demonstrated through itself and a path is identical with goal in other arguments truth is attained from an external source such as from possible to necessary from originated to eternal origin or from motion to unmoved mover in argument of righteous there is no middle term other than truth his version of ontological argument can be summarized as follows there is existence existence is a perfection above which no perfection may be conceived god is perfection and perfection in existence existence is a singular and simple reality there is no metaphysical pluralism that singular reality is graded in intensity in a scale of perfection that is a denial of a pure monism that scale must have a limit point a point of greatest intensity and of greatest existence hence god exists mulla sadra describes this argument in his main work al asfar al arba a four journeys as follows existence is a single objective and simple reality and there is no difference between its parts unless in terms of perfection and imperfection strength and weakness and culmination of its perfection where there is nothing more perfect is its independence from any other thing nothing more perfect should be conceivable as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs this other to become perfect and as it has already been explicated perfection is prior to imperfection actuality to potency and existence to non existence also it has been explained that perfection of a thing is thing itself and not a thing in addition to it thus either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others former is necessary which is pure existence nothing is more perfect than him and in him there is no room for non existence or imperfection latter is other than him and is regarded as his acts and effects and for other than him there is no subsistence unless through him for there is no imperfection in reality of existence and imperfection is added to existence only because of quality of being caused as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence asfar vol 6 pp 14 16 immanuel kant although kant was critical of descartes formulation of ontological argument he did believe that argument was persuasive when created correctly kant s argument rested on belief that everything that it is possible may exist must have a grounds for this possibility in other words nothing is possible merely in virtue of its nature he thus concludes that every possibility must be based upon a single necessity which he identified as being god kant attempted to show in his works that this being possessed many of common attributes of god such as omnipotence omniscience and omnipresence although argument could be identified as being cosmological kant felt that his proof was based upon reason instead of observation and he thus identified it as being ontological nicholas f 2010 kant s possibility proof history of philosophy quarterly 27 3 pp 275 99 kurt godel mathematician kurt godel provided a formal argument for god s existence argument was constructed by godel but not published until long after his death he provided an argument based on modal logic he uses conception of properties ultimately concluding with god s existence definition 1 x is god like if and only if x has as essential properties those and only those properties which are positive definition 2 a is an essence of x if and only if for every property b x has b necessarily if and only if a entails b definition 3 x necessarily exists if and only if every essence of x is necessarily exemplified axiom 1 if a property is positive then its negation is not positive axiom 2 any property entailed by i e strictly implied by a positive property is positive axiom 3 property of being god like is positive axiom 4 if a property is positive then it is necessarily positive axiom 5 necessary existence is positive axiom 6 for any property p if p is positive then being necessarily p is positive theorem 1 if a property is positive then it is consistent i e possibly exemplified corollary 1 property of being god like is consistent theorem 2 if something is god like then property of being god like is an essence of that thing theorem 3 necessarily property of being god like is exemplified godel defined being god like as having every positive property he left term positive undefined godel proposed that it is understood in an aesthetic and moral sense or alternatively as opposite of privation absence of necessary qualities in universe he warned against interpreting positive as being morally or aesthetically good greatest advantage and least disadvantage as this includes negative characteristics instead he suggested that positive should be interpreted as being perfect or purely good without negative characteristics godel s listed theorems follow from axioms so most criticisms of theory focus on those axioms or assumptions made oppy argued that godel gives no definition of positive properties he suggested that if these positive properties form a set there is no reason to believe that any such set exists which is theologically interesting or that there is only one set of positive properties which is theologically interesting modal versions of ontological argument modal logic deals with logic of possibility as well as necessity paul oppenheimer and edward n zalta note that for anselm s proslogion chapter 2 many recent authors have interpreted this argument as a modal one in phrase that than which none greater can be conceived word can could be construed as referring to a possibility nevertheless authors write that logic of ontological argument itself doesn t include inferences based on this modality oppenheimer pe zalta en http stanford edu ontological logic of ontological argument originally published in philosophical perspectives 5 philosophy of religion james tomberlin ed atascadero ridgeview 1991 509 529 even if one were to construe word can in definite description that than which none greater can be conceived in terms of metaphysical possibility logic of ontological argument itself doesn t include inferences based on this modality however there have been newer avowedly modal logic versions of ontological argument and on application of this type of logic to argument james franklin harris writes d versions of ontological argument so called modal versions of argument which arguably avoid part of anselm s argument that treats existence as a predicate began to emerge modal logic version of these forms of defense of ontological argument has been most significant development harris fh analytic philosophy of religion springer science business media 2002 p 105 hartshorne and malcolm charles hartshorne and norman malcolm are primarily responsible for introducing modal versions of argument into contemporary debate both claimed that anselm had two versions of ontological argument second of which was a modal logic version according to james harris this version is represented by malcolm thus if it that than which nothing greater can be conceived can be conceived at all it must exist for no one who denies or doubts existence of a being a greater than which is inconceivable denies or doubts that if it did exist its nonexistence either in reality or in understanding would be impossible for otherwise it would not be a being a greater than which cannot be conceived but as to whatever can be conceived but does not exist if it were to exist its nonexistence either in reality or in understanding would be possible therefore if a being a greater than which cannot be conceived can even be conceived it must exist hartshorne says that for anselm necessary existence is a superior manner of existence to ordinary contingent existence and that ordinary contingent existence is a defect for hartshorne both hume and kant focused only upon whether what exists is greater than what does not exist however anselm s point is that what exists and cannot not exist is greater than that which exists and can not exist this avoids question of whether or not existence is a predicate harris jf analytic philosophy of religion springer science business media 2002 p 109 referring to two ontological arguments proposed by anselm in chapters 2 and 3 of his proslogion malcolm supported kant s criticism of anselm s argument in chapter 2 that existence cannot be a perfection of something however he identified what he sees as second ontological argument in chapter 3 which is not susceptible to such criticism in anselm s second argument malcolm identified two key points first that a being whose non existence is logically impossible is greater than a being whose non existence is logically possible and second that god is a being than which a greater cannot be conceived malcolm supported that definition of god and suggested that it makes proposition of god s existence a logically necessarily true statement in same way that a square has four sides is logically necessarily true thus while rejecting idea of existence itself being a perfection malcolm argued that necessary existence is a perfection this he argued proved existence of an great necessary being jordon sobel writes that malcolm is incorrect in assuming that argument he is expounding is to be found entirely in proslogion chapter 3 anselm intended in proslogion iii not an independent argument for existence of god but a continuation of argument of proslogion ii alvin plantinga thumb 200px alvin plantinga criticized malcolm s and hartshorne s ontological arguments and proposed a variation of his own christian analytic philosopher alvin plantinga criticized malcolm s and hartshorne s arguments and offered an alternative he argued that if malcolm does prove necessary existence of greatest possible being it follows that there is a being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed it does not he argued demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world in an attempt to resolve this problem plantinga differentiated between greatness and excellence a being s excellence in a particular world depends only on its properties in that world a being s greatness depends on its properties in all worlds therefore greatest possible being must have maximal excellence in every possible world plantinga then restated malcolm s argument using concept of maximal greatness he argued that it is possible for a being with maximal greatness to exist so a being with maximal greatness exists in a possible world if this is case then a being with maximal greatness exists in every world and therefore in this world conclusion relies on a form of modal axiom s5 which states that if something is possibly true then its possibility is necessary it is possibly true in all worlds plantinga s version of s5 suggests that to say that p is possibly necessarily true is to say that with regard to one world it is true at all worlds but in that case it is true at all worlds and so it is simply necessary m medieval philosophy an historical and philosophical introduction routledge 2006 p 128 a version of his argument is as follows a being has maximal excellence in a given possible world w if and only if it is omnipotent omniscient and wholly good in w and a being has maximal greatness if it has maximal excellence in every possible world it is possible that there is a being that has maximal greatness premise therefore possibly it is necessarily true that an omniscient omnipotent and perfectly good being exists therefore by axiom s5 it is necessarily true that an omniscient omnipotent and perfectly good being exists therefore an omniscient omnipotent and perfectly good being exists plantinga argued that although first premise is not rationally established it is not contrary to reason michael martin argued that if certain components of perfection are contradictory such as omnipotence and omniscience then first premise is contrary to reason martin also proposed parodies of argument suggesting that existence of anything can be demonstrated with plantinga s argument provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world another christian apologist william lane craig characterizes plantinga s argument in a slightly different way it is possible that a maximally great being exists if it is possible that a maximally great being exists then a maximally great being exists in some possible world if a maximally great being exists in some possible world then it exists in every possible world if a maximally great being exists in every possible world then it exists in actual world if a maximally great being exists in actual world then a maximally great being exists therefore a maximally great being exists according to craig premises 2 5 are relatively uncontroversial among philosophers but epistemic of premise 1 or its denial does not guarantee its metaphysical possibility furthermore richard m gale argued that premise three possibility premise begs question he stated that one only has epistemic right to accept premise if one understands nested modal operators and that if one understands them within system s5 without which argument fails then one understands that possibly necessarily is in essence same as necessarily thus premise begs question because conclusion is embedded within it on s5 systems in general james garson writes that words necessarily and possibly have many different uses so acceptability of axioms for modal logic depends on which of these uses we have in mind garson james modal logic stanford encyclopedia of philosophy summer 2014 edition edward n zalta ed sankara s dictum an approach to supporting possibility premise in plantinga s version of argument was attempted by alexander he started with 8th 9th century ad indian philosopher sankara s dictum that if something is impossible we cannot have a perception even a non one that it is case it follows that if we have a perception that p then even though it might not be case that p it is at least case that possibly p if mystics in fact perceive existence of a maximally great being it follows that existence of a maximally great being is at least possible automated reasoning paul oppenheimer and edward n zalta used an automated theorem prover prover9 to validate anselm s ontological thesis prover9 subsequently discovered a simpler formally valid if not necessarily sound ontological argument from a single non logical premise christoph and bruno paleo used an automated theorem prover to validate scott s version of godel s ontological argument it has been shown by same researchers that godel s ontological argument is inconsistent however scott s version of godel s ontological argument is consistent and thus valid other formulations novelist and philosopher iris murdoch formulated a version of ontological argument in her book metaphysics as a guide to morals though she believed her version of argument to be superior she did reserve praise for descartes formulation her argument was phrased by her in following way there is no plausible proof of existence of god except some form of ontological proof a proof incidentally which must now take on an increased importance in theology as a result of recent de mythologising if considered carefully however ontological proof is seen to be not exactly a proof but rather a clear assertion of faith it is often admitted to be appropriate only for those already convinced which could only be confidently be made on a certain amount of experience this assertion could be put in various ways desire for god is certain to receive a response my conception of god contains certainty of its own reality god is an object of love which uniquely excludes doubt and relativism such obscure statements would of course receive little sympathy from analytical philosophers who would divide their content between psychological fact and metaphysical nonsense in other words atheists may feel objections to such an argument purely on basis that they rely on a priori methodology her formulations rely upon human connections of god and man and what such a faith does to people criticisms and objections gaunilo one of earliest recorded objections to anselm s argument was raised by one of anselm s contemporaries gaunilo of marmoutiers he invited his reader to conceive an island more excellent than any other island he suggested that according to anselm s proof this island must necessarily exist as an island that exists would be more excellent gaunilo s criticism does not explicitly demonstrate a flaw in anselm s argument rather it argues that if anselm s argument is sound so are many other arguments of same logical form which cannot be accepted he offered a further criticism of anselm s ontological argument suggesting that notion of god cannot be conceived as anselm had asserted he argued that many theists would accept that god by nature cannot be fully comprehended therefore if humans cannot fully conceive of god ontological argument cannot work anselm responded to gaunilo s criticism by arguing that argument applied only to concepts with necessary existence he suggested that only a being with necessary existence can fulfill remit of that than which nothing greater can be conceived furthermore a contingent object such as an island could always be improved and thus could never reach a state of perfection for that reason anselm dismissed any argument that did not relate to a being with necessary existence other parodies have been presented including devil corollary no devil corollary and extreme no devil corollary devil corollary proposes that a being than which nothing worse can be conceived exists in understanding sometimes term lesser is used in place of worse using anselm s logical form parody argues that if it exists in understanding a worse being would be one that exists in reality thus such a being exists no devil corollary is similar but argues that a worse being would be one that does not exist in reality so does not exist extreme no devil corollary advances on this proposing that a worse being would be that which does not exist in understanding so such a being exists neither in reality nor in understanding timothy chambers argued that devil corollary is more powerful than gaunilo s challenge because it withstands challenges that may defeat gaunilo s parody he also claimed that no devil corollary is a strong challenge as it no devil corollary which threatens anselm s argument at its very foundations thomas aquinas thomas aquinas while proposing five proofs of god s existence in his summa theologica objected to anselm s argument he suggested that people cannot know nature of god and therefore cannot conceive of god in way anselm proposed ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands essence of god completely aquinas reasoned that as only god can completely know his essence only he could use argument summa theologica ia q2 a1 http www newadvent org summa 1002 htm his rejection of ontological argument led other catholic theologians to also reject argument david hume thumb 145px right david hume reasoned that an ontological argument was not possible scottish philosopher and empiricist david hume argued that nothing can be proven to exist using only a priori reasoning in his dialogues concerning natural religion character cleanthes proposes a criticism hume also suggested that as we have no abstract idea of existence apart from as part of our ideas of other objects we cannot claim that idea of god implies his existence he suggested that any conception of god we may have we can conceive either of existing or of not existing he believed that existence is not a quality or perfection so a completely perfect being need not exist thus he claimed that it is not a contradiction to deny god s existence although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument similar to that of samuel clarke in his first boyle lecture it has been applied to ontological arguments as well immanuel kant thumb 150px left immanuel kant proposed that existence is not a predicate immanuel kant put forward an influential criticism of ontological argument in his critique of pure reason first edition pp 592 603 second edition pp 620 631 his criticism is primarily directed at descartes but also attacks leibniz it is shaped by his central distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions in an analytic proposition predicate concept is contained in its subject concept in a synthetic proposition predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept kant questions intelligibility of concept of a necessary being he considers examples of necessary propositions such as a triangle has three angles and rejects transfer of this logic to existence of god first he argues that such necessary propositions are necessarily true only if such a being exists if a triangle exists it must have three angles necessary proposition he argues does not make existence of a triangle necessary thus he argues that if proposition x exists is posited it would follow that if x exists it exists necessarily this does not mean that x exists in reality second he argues that contradictions arise only when subject and predicate are maintained and therefore a judgement of non existence cannot be a contradiction as it denies predicate kant then proposes that statement god exists must be analytic or synthetic predicate must be inside or outside of subject respectively if proposition is analytic as ontological argument takes it to be then statement would be true only because of meaning given to words kant claims that this is merely a tautology and cannot say anything about reality however if statement is synthetic ontological argument does not work as existence of god is not contained within definition of god and as such evidence for god would need to be found kant goes on to write being is evidently not a real predicate and cannot be part of concept of something he proposes that existence is not a predicate or quality this is because existence does not add to essence of a being but merely indicates its occurrence in reality he states that by taking subject of god with all its predicates and then asserting that god exists i add no new predicate to conception of god he argues that ontological argument works only if existence is a predicate if this is not so he claims ontological argument is invalidated as it is then conceivable a completely perfect being doesn t exist in addition kant claims that concept of god is not of one a particular sense rather it is an object of pure thought he asserts that god exists outside realm of experience and nature because we cannot experience god through experience kant argues that it is impossible to know how we would verify god s existence this is in contrast to material concepts which can be verified by means of senses douglas gasking australian philosopher douglas gasking 1911 1994 developed a version of ontological argument meant to prove god s non existence it was not intended to be serious rather its purpose was to illustrate problems gasking saw in ontological argument gasking asserted that creation of world is most marvellous achievement imaginable merit of such an achievement is product of its quality and creator s disability greater disability of creator more impressive achievement non existence gasking asserts would be greatest handicap therefore if universe is product of an existent creator we could conceive of a greater being one which does not exist a non existent creator is greater than one which exists so god does not exist gasking s proposition that greatest disability would be non existence is a response to anselm s assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection gasking uses this logic to assume that non existence must be a disability oppy criticized argument viewing it as a weak parody of ontological argument he stated that although it may be accepted that it would be a greater achievement for a non existent creator to create something than a creator who exists there is no reason to assume that a non existent creator would be a greater being he continued by arguing that there is no reason to view creation of world as most marvellous achievement imaginable finally he stated that it may be inconceivable for a non existent being to create anything at all coherence of a maximally great being in his development of ontological argument leibniz attempted to demonstrate coherence of a supremely perfect being c d broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for god s perfection are incompatible with a third notion of a supremely perfect being becomes incoherent ontological argument assumes definition of god purported by classical theism that god is omnipotent omniscient and morally perfect kenneth einar himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible if god is omnipotent then he should be able to create a being with free will if he is omniscient then he should know exactly what such a being will do which may technically render them without free will this analysis would render ontological argument incoherent as characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being thus such a being could not exist existence vs essence bertrand russell during his early hegelian phase accepted argument he once exclaimed great god in boots ontological argument is sound autobiography of bertrand russell vol 1 1967 however he later criticized argument asserting that argument does not to a modern mind seem very convincing but it is easier to feel convinced that it must be fallacious than it is to find out precisely where fallacy lies he drew a distinction between existence and essence arguing that essence of a person can be described and their existence still remain in question book 3 part 1 section 11 notes bibliography and in knowledge and certainty essays and
