yarmouth castle is an artillery fort built by henry viii in 1547 to protect yarmouth harbour on isle of wight from threat of french attack just under across square castle was initially equipped with 15 artillery guns and a garrison of 20 men it featured an italianate arrow head bastion on its landward side this was very different in style from earlier circular bastions used in device forts built by henry and was first of its kind to be constructed in england during 16th and 17th centuries castle continued to be maintained and modified seaward half of castle was turned into a solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for fort s gunners a bulwark was built on east side of castle and an additional gun battery was placed on town s quay just to west for most of english civil war of 1640s it was held by parliament following restoration it was refortified by charles ii in 1670s fortification remained in use through 18th and 19th centuries albeit with a smaller garrison and fewer guns until in 1885 these were finally withdrawn after a short period as a coast guard signalling post castle was brought back into military use during first and second world wars in 21st century heritage organisation english heritage operates castle as a tourist attraction history 16th century construction thumb 1559 plan of castle showing original courtyard design arrow head bastion and surrounding moat yarmouth castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between england france and holy roman empire in final years of reign of king henry viii traditionally crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications and while france and empire remained in conflict with one another maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of england seemed unlikely modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in south west and along sussex coast with a few more impressive works in north of england but in general fortifications were very limited in scale in 1533 henry broke with pope paul iii to annul long standing marriage to his wife catherine of aragon and remarry this resulted in france and empire declaring an alliance against henry in 1538 and pope encouraged two countries to attack england henry responded in 1539 by ordering construction of fortifications along most vulnerable parts of coast through an instruction called a device immediate threat passed but resurfaced in 1544 with france threatening an invasion across channel backed by her allies in scotland henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve country s defences particularly along south coast town of yarmouth on isle of wight may have been attacked by french in 1543 if so this raid probably encouraged construction of a castle there as part of second wave of device forts fort functioned alongside existing defences in solent and protected main crossing from west side of island to mainland yarmouth castle was a square artillery fort built around a central courtyard with an angular arrow head bastion protecting landward side it was initially equipped with three cannons and culverins and twelve smaller guns firing from a line of embrasures along seaward side of castle it was garrisoned by a small team of soldiers consisting of a master gunner a porter and 17 soldiers commanded by richard udall castle s first captain udall lived in castle but soldiers resided in local town castle was constructed by george mills under direction of richard worsley captain of island on land belonging to crown possibly on site of a church destroyed during events of 1543 henry had dissolved monasteries in england a few years before and stone from local quarr abbey was probably reused in construction of castle it was finished by 1547 when mills was paid ps1 000 for his work and to discharge soldiers who had been guarding site during project initial use when roman catholic queen mary i succeeded to throne there were changes in leadership on isle of wight and castle worsley was dismissed in favour of a roman catholic appointee in 1553 and udall was executed in 1555 for his role in dudley conspiracy to overthrow queen when protestant elizabeth i came to throne in 1558 however peace was made with france and military attention shifted towards spanish threat to england elizabeth reappointed worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of castle worsley filled in half of castle s courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over sea and he probably also constructed master gunner s house on other side of castle nonetheless an inspection in 1586 showed that fortification was in poor condition work costing ps50 was done in 1587 including erection of an earth bulwark alongside castle to mount additional guns next year saw attempted invasion of england by spanish armada after which further repairs were carried out on castle by 1599 crown was informed that castle which was still considered an important defence for solent needed expensive repairs 17th century thumb castle seen from sea bulwark and quay battery would have been positioned on left and right of castle respectively yarmouth castle continued to be an important military fortification used both as a fortress but also as a transport hub and a stores depot repairs recommended in 1599 were carried out in first years of 17th century and a further ps300 was invested in yarmouth castle and nearby sandown castle in 1609 including adding two angular buttresses along walls facing sea a survey in 1623 by castle s captain john burley reported that garrison comprised only four gunners and captain with buildings in a ruinous state and defences in need of repair similar concerns were raised in 1625 and 1629 suggestions that a half moon battery should be added to defences were not progressed but in 1632 parapets were raised in height and further lodgings and a long room for stores were constructed within castle some of stone used for this may have been reused from nearby sandown whose walls had been destroyed by sea before it was used at sandown stone appears to have been taken from local monasteries civil war broke out in 1642 between followers of king charles i and those of parliament initially captain barnaby burley a relative of john and an ardent royalist held castle on behalf of king with a tiny garrison burley negotiated surrender terms including that he initially be allowed to remain in castle with armed protection and castle remained in control of parliament for rest of war early during interregnum it was decided to increase size of garrison at castle from 30 to 70 soldiers due to concerns about a potential royalist attack from island of jersey most of soldiers lived outside castle itself annual cost of this force was around ps78 and in 1655 garrison was made smaller again to reduce costs thumb left engraving of yarmouth castle in 1794 a gun of quay battery is shown on right when charles ii returned to throne in 1660 he demobilised most of existing army and following year garrison at yarmouth was given four days notice to leave castle king announced that castle s artillery would be sent to cowes unless town of yarmouth agreed to take over financial responsibility of running site themselves town declined to do so but charles repeated offer in 1666 this time yarmouth seems to have taken action appointing four soldiers for a garrison although town did not assign an officer to command them or apparently make any repairs to now dilapidated castle crown took over castle again in 1670 and robert holmes new captain of isle of wight had some of guns brought back from cowes to castle site was refortified and a new battery placed on adjacent quay but older earthworks were demolished and moat was filled in holmes built a mansion for himself alongside castle where on three occasions he hosted king in 1688 charles brother james ii faced widespread revolt and a potential invasion of england by william of orange holmes was a supporter of james but although he intended to control yarmouth castle on monarch s behalf local inhabitants and garrison at yarmouth sided with william preventing him from openly siding with king 18th 21st centuries thumb a naval gun resting on traversing rails on platform yarmouth castle continued to be used and records from 1718 and 1760 show it was equipped with eight and five guns along castle and quay platforms respectively throughout this period it was probably staffed by a captain and six gunners supported by local militia in early 18th century holmes mansion was rebuilt forming its current appearance by 18th century however yarmouth harbour had gradually silted up and been destroyed by industrial developments reducing value of anchorage and design of castle had become outdated in 1813 during napoleonic wars work was carried out to alter design of parapet crimean war sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 south coast of england was refortified yarmouth castle underwent considerable repairs that year four naval guns and traversing rails were installed on castle platform and a regular county army unit was put in place to garrison fort in 1881 a proposal was put forward to modernise entire fortification but this was rejected and in 1885 garrison and guns were withdrawn coastguard began using castle as a signalling station in 1898 in 1901 war department passed castle to commissioners of woods and forests and in 1912 parts of castle were leased to pier hotel which incorporated robert holmes s former mansion pier hotel eventually became george hotel and still occupies part of old castle moat office of works took control of castle in 1913 carrying out a programme of repairs and it was used by military in both first and second world wars it was finally retired from military use in 1950s in 21st century yarmouth castle is run by heritage organisation english heritage as a tourist attraction receiving 9 007 visitors in 2010 it is protected under uk law as a grade i listed building and as a scheduled monument architecture thumb upright looking across courtyard at attic and long room left a small chamber centre and stairs to platform right yarmouth castle is a square fortification nearly across with an arrow head bastion protecting landward side north and west walls face sea protected by angular buttresses and a wide moat originally protected south and east side although this has since been filled in castle s 16th century bulwark which originally covered area to west of pier street and north of quay street and its quay battery have also been destroyed walls of castle are mainly built from ashlar stone with some red brick used on south side walls are pierced by a small number of gunloops including in ears of bastion which would have overlooked moat when first built interior of castle formed a sequence of buildings around a courtyard but southern half of castle was filled in shortly afterwards to produce a solid gun platform able to support heavy guns it was later raised again in 17th century to its current height parapet is now covered with turf with 19th century rounded corners and platform still has rails on which four naval guns would have traversed dating from 1855 a small lodging room built on platform at top of stairs has since been destroyed arrow head design of castle s bastion reflected new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from italy in 16th century earlier henrician castles had used older european style of semi circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in stonework but an arrow headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force yarmouth was among first fortifications in europe and first in england to adopt this design accommodation and other facilities are on south side of castle on ground floor entrance to castle leads through to a courtyard linked to four barrel vaulted rooms in south west corner originally 17th century lodgings for garrison two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and fittings of one of these still remains in place in south east corner is master gunner s house comprising a parlour hall and kitchen on ground floor and a chamber and attic on floors above parlour and hall would have originally been separated by a screen chamber would also have been subdivided on first floor is a small chamber supported on arches above courtyard which was used as a lodging on second floor long room runs on top of barrel vaulted chambers its massive original roof still intact notes references bibliography external links english heritage s visitor site category castles on isle of wight category forts on isle of wight category
