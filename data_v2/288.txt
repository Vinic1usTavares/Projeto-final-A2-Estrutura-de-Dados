portrait diptych of durer s parents or durer s parents with rosaries is collective name for two late 15th century portrait panels by german painter and printmaker albrecht durer they show artist s parents barbara holper c 1451 1514 and albrecht durer elder c 1427 1502 when she was around 39 and he was 63 years portraits are unflinching records of physical and emotional effects of ageing durer family was close and durer may have intended panels either to display his skill to his 2003 45 or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter they were created either as pendants that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other campbell hutchison 2000 186 or diptych wings however this formation may have been a later conception barbara s portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband s and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to viewer s right in paired panels his father s panel is considered superior work and has been described as one of durer s most exact and honest portraits brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 14 they are among four paintings or drawings durer made of his parents each of which examines deteriorating effects of age his later writings contain eulogies for both parents from which love and respect he felt toward them are evident each panel measured 47 5 cm x 39 5 cm 18 7 in x 15 6 in but left hand panel has been cut down they have been separated since at least 1628 until barbara s portrait long considered lost was in 1977 panels were reunited in germanisches nationalmuseum s 2012 exhibition early durer sources and influences three quarter view was widely used in southern german portraiture of late 15th century rosary beads were often included to indicate piety and modesty of sitters although by 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion durer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents faces a technique that draws comparison to work of first generation of early netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier albrecht elder had travelled to flanders and from working with netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for work of both jan van eyck and rogier van der weyden brion 17 45 brion 1960 describes durer s early excessive devotion to van der weyden as delaying his inauguration of a new era in german painting that he passed on this influence to his son is evident from early use of silverpoint a medium which according to erwin panofsky requires an exceptional degree of confidence accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling panofsky erwin 1943 quoted in brion 17 thumb 210px albrecht durer self portrait at twenty eight 1500 alte pinakothek munich durer would have been aware of hans pleydenwurff s portrait of ageing count georg von lowenstein through his teacher michael wolgemut pleydenwurff s portrait was in turn likely influenced by van eyck s 1438 portrait of cardinal niccolo albergati hunter 1993 207 218 believes portrait of durer s father took from pleydenwurff s portrait which she describes as a highly detailed representation of a white haired old man who defies pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation von fircks notes that durer s 1484 self portrait was created with use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self portrait 1500 self portrait at twenty eight from these she concludes that accurate observation and documentary recording of both his own and his parents appearances over time was not just a compulsion but that is indicative of a deeper interest in effects of time and age on human appearance although durer was fascinated by effects of ageing on others he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally self portraits tend to be idealised and 1500 portrait was his last later self portraits are far more understated and executed in a secondary media such as his drawings of man of sorrows and nude drawing of 1505 which depicted an emaciated body during time of plague description albrecht elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490 barbara s portrait may have been completed soon after when she would have been around 39 their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with michael wolgemut and would soon leave for nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter father panel was painted first for aesthetic reasons durer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 10 sitters are presented in three quarter view before flat nondescript lacquer like green backgrounds which although lushly coloured are thinly layered bartl 1999 26 31 each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 5 18 sitter s form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other price 2003 22 brand philip draws attention to similarities of panels linear construction especially manner in which folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes train of barbara s headdress across her chest corresponds with opening of albrecht s fur lined coat it was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for male to be on left hand side positioning here may be an indication that durer originally intended his father s panel to stand alone given that barbara s was painted some time later albrecht elder s panel is regarded as superior of two works this may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits men were allowed more individuality while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring for example showing evidence of ageing in either case father painting is far more closely detailed especially in lining of clothing which is summary in barbara s panel compared to long seam of her husband s gown this contrast in detail can also be seen in treatment of rosaries which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel but are small and relegated in hers kemperdick 2013 95 albrecht elder s panel is usually but not always thought to be first of two to be executed and if so is earliest extant example of his son s painting in contrast a number of art historians have noted that his mother s portrait contains bland passages especially around eyes and may be a near contemporary copy of a lost original brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 5 lotte brand philip believes clumsiness in mother panel indicated that durer painted it first as a youthful attempt at portraiture and that albrecht elder might have later commissioned his own portrait to pair with barbara s brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 17 recent technical examination of two panels confirms that barbara s portrait was painted later than her husband s kemperdick 2013 95 barbara holper barbara holper was daughter of hieronymus holper under whom albrecht elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith brion 1960 16 two men became friends and when she came of age holper gave his daughter into marriage when durer senior was 40 and she was 15 couple were compatible well matched and fond of each other yet their son s writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks three of their 18 children survived into adulthood 17 of whom had been born by time of this portrait brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 11 after her husband died barbara was destitute and went to live with her son kemperdick 2013 94 after she in turn died in 1514 her son wrote this my pious mother often had plague and many other severe and strange illnesses and she suffered great poverty scorn contempt mocking words terrors and great adversities yet she bore no malice also she died hard i felt so grieved for her that i cannot express it sturge moore 1905 71 thumb left 200px detail of barbara s portrait barbara is shown wearing a red dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair indicating her marital status her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder contrasting in colour and shape against black head wear of her husband lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect they are especially evident around her eyes bridge of her nose and around her upper lip barbara was attractive in her youth her son described her as having been comely and of erect bearing brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 12 however by time of this portrait effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face panel was grounded with white paint while composition seems to have changed significantly from imprimatura faint traces of original figuration are visible in parts of background and in darkened areas of her hood at some point panel was cut down at left side shifting compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress thumb 200px portrait of artist s mother at age of 63 march 1514 berlin this drawing was completed two months before she died panel closely resembles durer s 1514 drawing portrait of artist s mother at age of 63 tatlock 2010 116 david price writes of drawing s rough depiction of her flesh emaciated by old age and existential piety in cast of barbara durer s right eye which almost unnaturally directs her vision although barbara is some 25 years older in later drawing and by then terminally ill facial resemblance and pose are unmistakable however there is a dramatic difference between relatively young looking 39 year old woman in diptych and aged and terminally ill widow in 1514 drawing a family resemblance can be detected between both works and durer s vienna self portrait most evidently around mouth kemperdick concludes that these passages are so closely modeled that it is reasonable to presume they were drawn by same hand but is conservative in saying definitively that sitters were related by blood as durer was very young and though precociously talented to some extent still reliant on facial types albrecht durer elder durer s father wears a dark shirt russet coat and a black hat lined with fur his skin is slack at mouth and chin and he has small intelligent eyes which von fircks describes as dark and serious their curves echo those of heavy lids beneath von fircks 2011 419 his eyes are lined with crow s feet and shadowed with brown hatched paint his facial features are built from brush strokes more typical of drawing than painting at this young age durer was a far more skilled draughtsman than painter technical analysis carried out in 2013 by dagmar hirschfelder revealed a detailed background which was over painted by artist sander 2013 18 abandoned interior space consisted of a corner of a room with an arched window looking out to a countryside view this type of interior can be traced to netherlandish tradition and is rare in german portraiture of period kemperdick 2013 98 albrecht elder s lips are thin and tightly pursed and his mouth is broad and down turned yet his features are those of a handsome man marcel brion described him as appearing mild and thoughtful an impression reinforced by uncomplicated design of painting brion 1960 20 this view is reinforced by relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes which seem intended to convey a reserved ascetic piousness durer presents his father more like a low ranking ecclesiastic than a tradesman a calm considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best albeit modest clothes brion 1960 19 after his father s death in 1502 durer wrote that albrecht elder passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself his wife and his children he underwent manifold afflictions trials and adversities but he won just praise from all who knew him he was also of few words and was a god fearing man sturge moore 1905 36 martin conway describes portrayal of a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow conway 1889 35 conway believed strength of portrait is in part achieved through durer s ability to convey this hardship while at same time presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride and possessing a kind old face noting obvious affection between father and son as well as half smile of older man he wonders if that grin might have been born of albrecht elder s satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent who was now about to set out on world for his a contributing factor to this pride is that albrecht elder trained his son in his own profession as a jeweller but at one point came to regret choice of apprenticeship as younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting however his son learned many skills during that period and it gave him a discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work especially in his ability as an engraver conway 1889 36 thumb 220px portrait of durer s father at 70 1497 oil on lime panel national gallery london conway described panel as indicating an astonishing depth of psychological insight for an artist not yet 20 years old in its simple design and detail it shares many of characteristics of and is a key precursor to durer s mature work he portrayed his father again in 1497 when older man would have been around 70 he has aged noticeably in intervening seven years his skin is wrinkles deeper and more pronounced in this later portrait durer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing which are all too evident on his father s face mills 1991 747 according to brion his eyes have lost their distant mystic appearance and now seem less contented conway agrees seeing traces of agitation but holds that two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of man panels each canvas is mounted on two boards of equal width which have been cut vertically and appear have come from same tree tree ring dating of wood suggests it was felled around 1482 wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years giving an approximate dates of 1490 92 for works panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen and in white paint whether durer prepared panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown father panel is signed and dated on both sides in what may be oldest extant instance of durer s signature monogram of a large open a and small d allen 2005 21 however this inscription and 1490 date are later additions conway 1918 2013 99 florence canvas is in relatively poor condition retouching has largely removed durer s top layer of brushwork and left paint hard and dry barbara s panel underwent a restoration in 1974 when surface was cleaned and partially with repairs to damage on reverse sustained from woodboring reverse of albrecht s panel contains a rendition of allied durer and holper families coats of arms campbell hutchison 2002 238 which are shown beneath a winged moor wearing a red dress thausing 2003 46 durer family are represented by a crest showing an open door a pun on word durer meaning albrecht elder was born in hungarian village of is hungarian for door when his parents moved to germany their name changed from tur to dure bailey 1995 36 holper crest features a stag but its significance is lost allen 2005 22 back of barbara s panel contains imagery of a dragon in a lightning storm set against a rocky landscape or cliff albrecht durer barbara durer geb holper recto in german germanisches nationalmuseum retrieved 31 october 2013 provenance and attribution after painter s death in 1528 portraits were held by his brother and then his brother s widow before they passed into collection of willibald imhoff a grandson of durer s friend willibald inventories from imhoff collection from 1573 to 1574 1580 and 1588 list both panels next surviving imhoff inventory of 1628 again lists mother s portrait but it disappears after a mention in 1633 58 account books of hans hieronymus imhoff after which its whereabouts became unknown campbell hutchison 2000 209 durer expert matthias mende described missing portrait of barbara holper as among most severe losses in durer oeuvre brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 7 thumb 200px detail showing monogram in 1977 art historian lotte brand philip proposed that unknown woman in a coif held by germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg was original portrait of barbara holper nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of wolgemut s workshop a franconian artist in his circle or anonymous mainz painter master w b brand philip s attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone theme and size with father panel at uffizi in both works sitters are holding rosary beads and durer attentively describes their hands both portraits show sitter in same pose against a similarly coloured background campbell hutchison 1990 26 both are lit from upper left boards are identically cut in width and depth although 3 cm was removed from left edge of barbara s panel brand philip noted similarities between panel and durer s 1514 charcoal drawing portrait of artist s mother at age of 63 fedja anzelewsky agreed with attribution noting that both portraits bear on their reverse catalogue number recorded in imhoff inventories as well as precisely same design of masses of dark clouds anzelewsky speculated that father s portrait which was not listed in 1628 imhoff inventory had been broken off and sold to rudolph ii of austria hans hieronymus imhoff s lukewarm description of barbara s portrait mother of albrecht durer in oil colors on wood but there are many who do not believe it to be a work of durer led brand philip to conclude that albrecht s panel was likely sold individually as more accomplished and marketable of two brand philip anzelewsky 1978 79 6 attribution is widely accepted today in 2013 stephan kemperdick noted sophistication of nuremberg portrait and that its three dimensional modeling of head displays a level of skill beyond wolgemut and his circle two panels were reunited in 2012 during a durer exhibition in nuremberg having been separated since
