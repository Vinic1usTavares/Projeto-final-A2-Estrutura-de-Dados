battle of apamea was fought on 19 july 998 between forces of byzantine empire and fatimid caliphate battle was part of a series of military confrontations between two powers over control of northern syria and hamdanid emirate of aleppo byzantine regional commander damian dalassenos had been besieging apamea until arrival of fatimid relief army from damascus under jaysh ibn samsama in subsequent battle byzantines were initially victorious but a lone kurdish rider managed to kill dalassenos throwing byzantine army into panic fleeing byzantines were then pursued with much loss of life by fatimid troops this defeat forced byzantine emperor basil ii to personally campaign in region next year and was followed in 1001 by conclusion of a ten year truce between two states background in september 994 michael bourtzes byzantine military governor doux of antioch and northern syria suffered a heavy defeat at battle of orontes at hands of fatimid general manjutakin this fatimid victory shook byzantine position in syria and posed a grave threat to its arab vassal hamdanid emirate of aleppo to prevent its fall emperor basil ii himself intervened in region in 995 forcing manjutakin to retire to damascus after capturing shayzar hims and rafaniya and building a new fortress at antartus emperor withdrew leaving damian dalassenos as new doux of antioch dalassenos maintained an aggressive stance in 996 his forces raided environs of tripoli and arqa while manjutakin again without success laid siege to aleppo and antartus but was forced to withdraw when dalassenos with his army came to relieve fortress next year dalassenos repeated his raids against tripoli rafaniya and al capturing latter at same time inhabitants of tyre under leadership of a sailor named rose up in revolt against fatimids and requested byzantine assistance further south in palestine bedouin leader ibn ibn al jarrah attacked ramlah siege of apamea and fatimid relief expedition in early summer 998 dalassenos learned that a catastrophic fire had broken out in apamea and destroyed most of its provisions so he marched towards city aleppines too endeavoured to seize apamea and arrived there first but withdrew at approach of dalassenos who could not permit a vassal to grow too strong and intended to capture town for emperor although ostensibly allies with byzantines aleppines left provisions they had brought with them to be collected by inhabitants of apamea aiding them in their resistance subsequent events are presented by several authors including brief narrative of john skylitzes and more extensive accounts of christian arab yahya of antioch and armenian stephen of taron arab accounts also survive all apparently drawing upon work of 11th century historian hilal al sabi most detailed version is preserved by ibn al qalanisi governor of apamea al mala iti called for aid upon fatimids according to ibn al qalanisi eunuch regent appointed jaysh ibn samsama to command relief army naming him governor of damascus and giving him a thousand men before confronting byzantines fatimids had to deal with revolt of tyre and rebellion of ibn al jarrah byzantines attempted to aid besieged at tyre by sending a fleet but it was beaten off by fatimids and city captured in june 998 ibn al jarrah s revolt was also suppressed and jaysh ibn samsama returned to damascus where he stayed for three days to gather his forces for relief of apamea there he was joined by troops and volunteers from tripoli assembling a force numbering 10 000 men and 1 000 bedouin riders of banu kilab tribe according to skylitzes fatimid army comprised forces of tripoli beirut tyre and damascus meanwhile dalassenos was vigorously pursuing siege and inhabitants of apamea had been reduced to famine being forced to eat cadavers and dogs which they bought for price of 25 silver dirhams according to abu l faraj two gold dinars a piece battle two armies met on large plain of al cf al surrounded by mountains and located near lake of apamea on 19 july 998 according to ibn al qalanisi fatimid army s left wing was commanded by slav governor of tripoli centre where daylamite infantry and army baggage train were located was under command of badr al attar right was commanded by jaysh ibn samsama and wahid al hilali according to all accounts byzantines charged fatimid army and drove it to flight killing some 2 000 and capturing baggage train only 500 ghilman under bishara ikhshidid remained steadfast and held firm against assault while banu kilab simply abandoned fight and began looting battlefield at that point a kurdish rider named variously as abu l hajar ahmad ibn al dahhak al salil by ibn al athir or as ibn al qalanisi and bar by byzantine sources and abu l faraj rode towards dalassenos who was near his battle standard on top of a height and was accompanied only by two of his sons and ten men of his retinue believing battle won and that kurd wanted to surrender dalassenos took no precautions as he approached byzantine general ibn al dahhak suddenly charged dalassenos lifted his arm to shield himself but kurd launched his spear at him general wore no cuirass and blow killed him dalassenos death changed tide of battle fatimids took heart and shouting enemy of god is dead turned on byzantines who fell into panic and fled garrison of apamea too sallied forth completing byzantine debacle sources give various numbers for byzantine dead maqrizi mentions 5 000 yahya of antioch 6 000 and ibn al qalanisi as many as 10 000 dead most of remaining byzantines 2 000 according to ibn al qalanisi were taken prisoner by fatimids these included several senior officers including famed georgian patrikios a nephew of tornike as well as two sons of dalassenos constantine and theophylact who were bought by jaysh ibn samsama for 6 000 dinars and spent next ten years as captives in cairo stephen of taron gives a slightly different account of battle whereby victorious byzantines were surprised by an attack by regrouped fatimids on their camp and that one of dalassenos s brothers and one of his sons were killed as well as general himself this version is commonly rejected by modern scholars aftermath dalassenos defeat forced basil ii to personally lead yet another campaign in syria following year arriving in syria in mid september emperor s army buried their fallen in field of apamea and then captured shayzar sacked hisn and rafaniya torched arqa and raided environs of baalbek beirut tripoli and in mid december basil returned to antioch where he installed nikephoros ouranos as doux although according to his self description as ruler of east his role seems to have been more extensive with plenipotentiary military and civilian authority over entire eastern frontier in 1001 basil ii concluded a ten year truce with fatimid caliph al hakim references sources apamea category 990s in byzantine empire apamea apamea apamea category apamea syria
