theodore komnenos doukas theodoros komnenos doukas latinized as theodore comnenus ducas died 1253 was ruler of epirus and thessaly from 1215 to 1230 and of thessalonica and most of macedonia and western thrace from 1224 to 1230 he was also power behind rule of his sons john and demetrios over thessalonica in 1237 1246 theodore was scion of a distinguished byzantine aristocratic family related to imperial komnenos doukas and angelos dynasties nevertheless nothing is known about theodore s life before conquest of constantinople and dissolution of byzantine empire by fourth crusade in 1204 following fall of constantinople he served theodore i laskaris founder of empire of nicaea for a few years before being called to epirus where his bastard half brother michael i komnenos doukas had founded an independent principality when michael died in 1215 theodore sidelined his brother s underage and illegitimate son michael ii and assumed governance of epirote state theodore continued his brother s policy of territorial expansion allied with serbia he expanded into macedonia threatening latin kingdom of thessalonica capture of latin emperor peter ii of courtenay in 1217 opened way to gradual envelopment of thessalonica culminating in city s fall in 1224 as ruler of thessalonica theodore quickly declared himself emperor challenging nicaean emperor john iii doukas vatatzes s claims to byzantine imperial throne in 1225 he advanced to outskirts of constantinople but his final attack against seat of much reduced latin empire was delayed until 1230 in that year theodore amassed an army to besiege constantinople but then diverted it against bulgaria an ambivalent ally which threatened his northern flank theodore was defeated and captured at battle of klokotnitsa and spent next seven years in captivity in meantime he was succeeded by his brother manuel manuel quickly lost thrace most of macedonia and albania to bulgarian tsar john ii asen thessalonica itself became a bulgarian vassal while in epirus proper power was seized by michael ii returning from exile theodore was released in 1237 when his daughter irene married john asen and quickly managed to regain control of thessalonica ousting manuel having been blinded during his captivity and thus disqualified from occupying throne again he installed his eldest son john as emperor but remained de facto regent of state manuel tried to regain thessalonica with nicaean support but a negotiated settlement was reached which gave him thessaly and left thessalonica and its environs to theodore and john in 1241 john iii vatatzes invited theodore to visit nicaea he was welcomed and treated with great honour but was effectively detained there until spring of next year when vatatzes marched on thessalonica with theodore in tow theodore was sent in to negotiate with his son and convince him to accept demotion to rank of despot and to recognize suzerainty of nicaea john died in 1244 and was succeeded by theodore s younger son demetrios in 1246 vatatzes overthrew unpopular demetrios and annexed thessalonica theodore influenced his nephew michael ii to launch an attack on thessalonica in 1251 but in 1252 vatatzes campaigned against them and forced michael to come to terms theodore was taken prisoner and sent into exile in nicaea where he died around 1253 early life and career born between 1180 and 1185 theodore was a son of sebastokrator john doukas and of zoe doukaina his paternal grandparents were constantine angelos and theodora a daughter of byzantine emperor alexios i komnenos theodore s uncle andronikos was father of emperors isaac ii angelos and alexios iii angelos who were theodore s first cousins as with most members of his family he preferred to use surname of doukas or komnenos doukas komnenos o doukas contemporaries variously called him doukas komnenos or even grand komnenos megas komnenos an appellation more usually found among ruling family of empire of trebizond theodore evidently preferred to be associated with more successful dynasties of doukai and komnenoi rather than disastrous reign of angeloi indeed only medieval writers to call him angelos were later hostile pro palaiologos historians nikephoros gregoras and theodore skoutariotes while george akropolites refers to him as komnenos until his defeat at klokotnitsa in 1230 and as angelos after theodore s early life is obscure after fourth crusade captured constantinople in 1204 he followed theodore laskaris to asia minor where laskaris founded empire of nicaea theodore s service under laskaris is relatively unknown except for a brief reference in a letter written by metropolitan of corfu george bardanes one of theodore s apologists bardanes writes that theodore took many dangers for his sake and wrested many fortresses from enemies and subdued them to laskaris rule distinguishing himself through his valour and receiving many rewards from nicaean ruler some modern scholars such as karl hopf and antoine bon have identified a certain theodore who appears as lord of argos and was successor of leo sgouros in leading resistance against crusaders in northwestern peloponnese after sgouros death in 1208 with theodore komnenos doukas this view has been questioned by raymond joseph loenertz who argues that there is no evidence for such an assumption and that conversely it is well established that theodore was in nicaean service at time around 1210 theodore was invited by his half brother michael i komnenos doukas to epirus where michael had founded an independent greek principality michael wanted theodore s aid as his only son future michael ii komnenos doukas was underage and illegitimate while michael s other half brothers were considered to lack ability to rule laskaris allowed theodore to leave but bound him with an oath of allegiance to himself and his heirs before going to epirus theodore had married maria petraliphaina with whom he had four children ruler of epirus thumb 300px alt map of balkans with original core of epirus and its conquered territories shown in various shades of orange expansion of epirote state during reigns of michael i and theodore komnenos doukas from 1210 on michael i komnenos doukas was engaged in territorial expansion chiefly at expense of latin kingdom of thessalonica to his east after initial reverses much of thessaly was conquered by 1214 dyrrhachium and corfu had been recovered from latins as well traditional view of historians is that these events marked michael i s repudiation of allegiance he had sworn to latin empire but historian philip van tricht argues that both michael and later theodore remained at least in theory vassals of latin empire until 1217 michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215 as michael ii was illegitimate and too young theodore had no trouble in sidelining boy according to hagiography of st theodora of arta boy and his mother spent duration of theodore s reign exiled in peloponnese relations with serbia and nicaea theodore was capable and extremely ambitious notwithstanding his oath to laskaris he aspired not only to expand his state at expense of thessalonica but to eventually recover constantinople and revive byzantine empire with himself as its ruler to secure his northern flank theodore allied himself with serbia and albanian clans principality of arbanon had already come in epirote political orbit under michael i and closer ties developed when its ruler demetrios died in 1215 leaving his principality to his widow who promptly remarried next year to a greek magnate gregory against serbs theodore abandoned michael i s attempt to pursue a northward expansion into zeta and instead pursued an alliance with serbian prince stefan ii nemanjic that was directed towards keeping bulgarians in check ties between epirus and serbia were solidified by marriage of theodore s brother manuel komnenos doukas to one of stefan ii s sisters stefan ii then sought to wed one of his sons in all likelihood his eldest son and heir stefan radoslav to michael i s second daughter theodora archbishop of ohrid demetrios chomatianos refused to sanction marriage due to consanguinity theodora was a second cousin of stefan radoslav s mother eudokia angelina a daughter of alexios iii angelos in 1217 stefan ii tried to circumvent this by suggesting himself as groom to theodora s half sister maria but chomatianos vetoed this proposal as well on similar grounds finally stefan radoslav married theodore s firstborn daughter anna in winter 1219 20 with his position thus strengthened theodore expanded his territory into northern macedonia although it is possible that at least part of this region had already been captured by michael i after death of local bulgarian ruler strez in 1214 it is unclear to what extent theodore s expansion involved direct conflict with bulgarian tsar boril but by 1217 he held ohrid prilep and most of plain of pelagonia at least up to strez s old capital at and likely beyond approaching strymon river as greek historian konstantinos varzos has noted capture of ohrid seat of eponymous archbishopric was particularly important for standing of epirote state and theodore s aspirations theodore sponsored election of distinguished canonist chomatianos to archiepiscopal throne in 1217 and chomatianos would repay that support with his steadfast championing of epirote claims to byzantine imperial inheritance vis a vis rival claims of nicaea thumb left 180px alt slightly damaged painting of a bearded middle aged man wearing a golden diadem 13th century fresco portrait of stefan ii nemanjic from monastery following fourth crusade orthodox clergy in two main greek states epirus and nicaea had effectively become separated in 1208 nicaeans had convened a synod and elected michael autoreianos as successor to vacant see of patriarch of constantinople election was uncanonical and therefore of questionable legitimacy this in turn meant that laskaris imperial title was also open to challenge as he had been crowned by same michael autoreianos already under michael i two local synods of bishops had emerged in epirote domains to carry on administration of church largely independent of patriarch one at naupaktos under john apokaukos and one at ohrid under chomatianos more ambitious chomatianos soon became pre eminent western bishop and sought to strengthen de facto epirote autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs including appointment of bishops for local sees without patriarch s interference this policy which dovetailed with theodore s own ambitions of independence from and rivalry towards nicaea brought two branches of greek church to an open quarrel as nicaea based patriarch manuel i sarantenos began appointing bishops of his own to epirote sees whom epirotes refused to accept despite his close ties to epirus stefan ii nemanjic exploited epirote nicaean rivalry to his advantage to secure autocephaly for serbian church which traditionally had been under jurisdiction of archbishop of ohrid brushing aside chomatianos vehement objections stefan managed to have his brother rastko renamed sava consecrated by manuel sarantenos as autocephalous archbishop of serbia in 1219 theodore took care not to let quarrels of churchmen affect his cordial relations with serbian ruler theodore s drive into macedonia disquieted another local strongman alexius slav ruler of melnik a sworn enemy of boril alexius had been abandoned by his erstwhile ally latin emperor henry of flanders who in 1213 allied himself with bulgaria facing a possible attack by theodore as well alexius now preferred to make common cause with him and married a niece of theodore s wife capture of peter of courtenay epirote successes in macedonia worried latins as they opened way to another attack on thessalonica kingdom of thessalonica had been much weakened after death of its founder boniface of montferrat in 1207 since which it had been ruled by a regency for his underage son demetrius interrupting a campaign against nicaeans in asia minor henry of flanders hastened to thessalonica he took up contact with boril and was preparing to march against theodore when he suddenly died on 11 june 1216 probably of malaria although poisoning by his second wife maria of bulgaria has also been suggested death of warlike henry followed by that of pope innocent iii instigator of fourth crusade a month later was a major stroke of good fortune for theodore as it removed two of his most eminent and capable opponents thumb right 200px alt sketch of a medieval seal showing a mounted knight sword unsheathed charging towards right seal of peter of courtenay barons of latin empire then elected peter ii of courtenay a cousin of king philip ii augustus of france as new latin emperor receiving news of his election peter assembled a small army of 160 knights and 5 500 foot and horse and set out from france after being crowned by pope honorius iii in rome he set sail from brindisi in april 1217 peter landed at dyrrhachium which he had promised to conquer and return to venice while his wife yolanda of flanders sailed on to constantinople as in norman invasion of william ii of sicily in 1185 peter intended after capturing dyrrhachium to follow ancient via egnatia to thessalonica wresting albania and macedonia from epirote control in process commonly accepted version of events is that dyrrhachium resisted with success and as his casualties mounted peter was forced to raise siege and start his march towards thessalonica march proved difficult due to both harsh terrain and open hostility of local population western sources annales richard of san germano philippe mouskes and continuator of robert of auxerre also stress loyalty of local albanian population to theodore after a few days theodore with his army confronted peter theodore requested talks with papal legate giovanni colonna whom he assured of his goodwill and support western sources claim that theodore offered to recognize primacy of catholic church and suzerainty of latin empire as well as to support peter in his planned participation in fifth crusade and offered latins food and guides through mountains peter was glad to receive this unexpected help and an agreement between two was concluded as soon as latins let their guard down theodore fell upon them peter of courtenay colonna latin bishop of salona count william i of and many latin nobles were taken captive while peter s army scattered into small roving bands trying to survive akropolites chronicler ephraim and some western sources on other hand claim that dyrrhachium was captured and are followed by some modern scholars including greek i d romanos and french alain according to this view theodore offered to acknowledge peter s suzerainty after city s fall only to treacherously ambush and defeat him as historian john van antwerp fine remarks it is not important which version is correct outcome was same and if lost dyrrhachium was quickly retaken after peter s capture according to philip van tricht theodore s actions were motivated by several factors which led him to regard peter as a threat to himself and his principality peter s attempt to return dyrrhachium to venice even if it had failed for moment boded ill for future peter s recognition of rights of demetrius half brother william vi of montferrat over thessalonica opened way for william to take power there and theodore was loath to see thessalonica whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over epirus strengthened particularly given presence of his exiled nephew michael ii in court of latin principality of achaea at same time theodore and his court resented increased papal interference in greek affairs especially in aftermath of mission of cardinal pelagius previous papal legate to constantinople whose actions had deepened rift between greeks and latins further wars with latins and capture of thessalonica whatever true course of events theodore s unexpected victory echoed throughout greek world and greatly enhanced his standing even usually hostile akropolites was forced to admit in his history that this feat was of great help to romans conversely it dismayed pope honorius who sent letters to latin princes of greece as well as doge of venice and peter of courtenay s son in law king andrew ii of hungary urging them to engage themselves to secure release of peter and colonna he even wrote to andrew and french bishops to call for a crusade against theodore with which he also threatened theodore in a letter with first contingents for crusade assembling at ancona in late 1217 and venetians eager to profit from crusade to recover dyrrhachium pressure bore fruit in march 1218 colonna was released with theodore offering his apologies and assurances of loyalty to pope honorius then changed his policy to point of forbidding doge of venice to harm theodore in slightest hoping thereby to secure release of more prisoners although some of lesser barons were freed peter and many of most senior lords remained in captivity until their death it is unknown when peter of courtenay died but this was probably before september 1219 capture of peter of courtenay left both major latin states in northern greece thessalonica and constantinople in hands of female regents before arriving in constantinople where she gave birth to peter s posthumous son baldwin ii yolanda had stopped at peloponnese there she quickly came to appreciate wealth and strength of principality of achaea and arranged marriage of her daughter agnes to principality s heir geoffrey ii of villehardouin a politically astute ruler yolanda also secured her eastern border by offering her daughter maria of courtenay in marriage to theodore laskaris who had just been widowed for second time before launching his final stroke against thessalonica theodore also took care to secure his southern flank by appointing his brother constantine komnenos doukas as governor in aetolia and acarnania an energetic governor constantine not only effectively shielded epirote domains from threat of duchy of athens but soon recovered neopatras and lamia as well theodore himself turned his attention to clearing thessaly of any remaining latin presence culminating in surrender of great platamon castle in 1218 over next few years one by one theodore captured fortresses around thessalonica itself platamon controlled entrance to thermaic gulf and with surrender of serres in late 1221 theodore cut land connection between constantinople and thessalonica as well thessalonica was left thereby in words of john fine more or less an island in midst of theodore s possessions as fall of thessalonica appeared imminent pope honorius excommunicated theodore ordered an embargo on horses troops and supplies from adriatic ports and sent letters to constantinople urging assistance to demetrius demetrius himself went to italy to seek aid being received by pope in rome in march 1222 and by emperor frederick ii soon after a crusade was proclaimed against theodore and troops began to gather in italy in meantime latin empire now under robert of courtenay was once more embroiled in warfare with nicaea as it supported laskaris brothers in their challenge against new nicaean emperor john iii doukas vatatzes first detachments of assembling crusade under count oberto ii of biandrate arrived at thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined de facto regent guy pallavicini theodore now hastened his move against thessalonica after preliminary operations in late 1222 in early 1223 he laid siege to city honorius excommunicated him again and redoubled his effort to promote crusade which had come to a standstill in meantime at pope s urging venice and emperor frederick promised aid robert of courtenay also pledged to assist while honorius called upon latin princes of southern greece to join in effort crusade finally assembled at brindisi in march 1224 in his instructions to his legate however honorius did not rule out possibility of theodore coming to terms with crusaders true to his word in april 1224 robert of courtenay sent an army to besiege serres during siege latin generals learned of disastrous defeat of main latin army at hands of john iii doukas vatatzes at battle of poimanenon they lifted siege and hastened back to constantinople only to be intercepted by theodore s men most of latin army were killed or taken prisoner this double disaster destroyed pope s plans for crusade as he had envisaged it to land in theodore s rear while he was engaged with robert s army at same time prospective leader of crusade william vi of montferrat fell ill in november pope was forced to postpone crusade s departure for next spring with news of latin defeats and postponement of crusade exhausted defenders of thessalonica surrendered city to theodore sometime in december 1224 crusade to relieve it sailed in march 1225 and landed in thessaly at halmyros crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery allegedly because greeks had poisoned local water supply william of montferrat himself succumbed to it and remnants of army left greece demetrius of montferrat still hoped to recover his realm with help of frederick ii but died

right one as a warrior saint handing a castle to former billon trachy coin of theodore as emperor of thessalonica capture of thessalonica traditionally second city of byzantine empire after constantinople was a major stroke against latins and greatly boosted theodore s standing so much that he now regarded himself as superior to vatatzes and openly claimed byzantine imperial title by putting on purple boots reserved to emperor indeed one of his major supporters eminent metropolitan of naupaktos john apokaukos in a letter to patriarch in 1222 declared that epirotes already regarded theodore as their god sent regent and emperor and later wrote to theodore s wife expressing hope that he might be able to assist at their imperial coronation at thessalonica coronation controversy with nicaea according to byzantine custom coronation of an emperor could only take place in constantinople and be performed by patriarch yet constantinople was still in latin hands and patriarch now germanus ii 1223 40 resided in nicaea theodore thus turned to metropolitan of thessalonica constantine mesopotamites whom he had just restored to his see after removing latin prelate mesopotamites however recognized patriarch at nicaea as legitimate and steadfastly refused to perform rite despite pressure from theodore his brother constantine and john apokaukos rather than submit he preferred to return to exile in response in march 1225 theodore convened a council of bishops of his domains at arta chaired by apokaukos council approved a declaration composed by apokaukos which extolled theodore s achievements against latins and bulgarians his liberation of greek lands eviction of catholic priests and restoration of orthodox bishops and his imperial descent and declared that council recognized only him as emperor armed with this declaration theodore had loyal archbishop of ohrid demetrios chomatianos perform coronation instead although theodore appears to have assumed and was addressed by imperial title almost immediately after capture of thessalonica date of his actual coronation is unknown french scholar lucien stiernon places it in period between june 1227 and april 1228 but greek apostolos d rejects this reasoning that theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long and suggested that he was crowned in 1225 immediately after council of arta eleni bees on other hand based on letters of apokaukos suggests a date between 3 april and august 1227 while has narrowed date down to 29 may 1227 as befitted a byzantine emperor theodore began setting up a court at his new capital and dispensed usual court titles to his relatives and followers not much is known about men that staffed theodore s regime most of available information comes from writings of chomatianos theodore s brothers manuel and constantine were raised to rank of despot long serving john became and mesazon chief minister and a number of scions of old byzantine aristocratic families who had sought refuge in epirus were appointed as provincial governors alongside members of local aristocracy title of doux was used but unlike earlier times these were mostly civilian governors with little military authority theodore awarded titles with such largesse that formerly exclusive titles such as sebastos or were devalued and came to be held by city notables his nicaean rivals notably akropolites mocked him for haphazard way in which titles were used and awarded ignoring old customs of constantinople as if he were a bulgarian or rather a barbarian to secure his new capital theodore instituted a guard of under a thumb left 200px alt head portrait of a middle aged man with a dark forked beard wearing a golden jewel encrusted domed crown john iii doukas vatatzes emperor of nicaea from a 15th century manuscript of extracts of history of john zonaras john vatatzes initially reacted to theodore s proclamation as emperor by offering to recognize him as a sort of viceroy in his lands but theodore rejected this and publicly assumed full titulature of byzantine emperors as basileus and autokrator of romans theodore s coronation deepened rift between western greeks and nicaea which once again was expressed in ecclesiastic sphere at first nicaeans tried to limit blame to chomatianos though writing respectfully of theodore himself patriarch germanus ii expressed his indignation at presumption of chomatianos in usurping patriarchal privilege of crowning an emperor while chomatianos claimed that as successor of ancient see of justiniana prima he was an independent prelate and had authority to do so in 1227 a synod of epirote bishops in arta tried to find a compromise acknowledging overall authority of patriarch at nicaea but requesting administrative autonomy i e right for theodore to appoint bishops in his domains they gave patriarch three months to reply and suggested that if he did not heed their proposals they might be forced to recognize supremacy of pope instead germanus replied by having patriarchal synod condemn theodore s assumption of imperial title conflict escalated when germanus appointed his own candidate to vacant see of dyrrhachium theodore expelled bishop and epirote synod instead elected a friend of chomatianos constantine as bishop germanus now attacked theodore directly in response george bardanes composed a letter to germanus which insisted on epirote ecclesiastical autonomy and challenged very legality of germanus claims to patriarchate result was a full schism between nicaean and epirote churches that lasted until 1232 3 expansion into thrace following theodore s coronation there were four rulers who claimed imperial title and vied for control of constantinople theodore latin emperor robert of courtenay john iii doukas vatatzes of nicaea and young but ambitious john ii asen of bulgaria latin empire was a shadow of its former strength following poimanenon latins had lost most of their territories in asia while in europe it was soon reduced to environs of constantinople itself already in 1224 or at least in 1225 theodore captured chalcidice with mount athos and in spring 1225 he advanced through eastern macedonia and western thrace seizing christopolis xanthi mosynopolis and didymoteicho in an attempt to pre empt him and block his advance onto constantinople nicaeans had answered summons of inhabitants of adrianople and taken over city from latins theodore however crossed evros river and blockaded city until it agreed to surrender nicaean army under protostrator john ises and john was allowed to withdraw unmolested to asia with ships provided by theodore capture of adrianople opened path to constantinople for theodore in order to secure his northern flank he concluded an alliance with john asen sealed by second marriage of his brother manuel to maria an illegitimate daughter of asen at same time latins turned to nicaea and concluded a peace treaty in exchange for further territorial concessions this pact too was sealed by a marriage of theodore laskaris daughter eudokia to latin baron anseau de cayeux in same summer of 1225 theodore led his army to environs of constantinople reaching towns of bizye and vrysis anseau de cayeux leading latin army was heavily wounded in clashes but constantinople itself was not attacked not only was theodore unprepared for a siege against mighty theodosian walls but news of william of montferrat s landing at thessaly forced him to break off operations and return west for reasons that are unknown theodore did not renew his attack on constantinople in 1226 or years thereafter instead he seems to have occupied himself with domestic affairs as well as taking care to improve relations with frederick ii during latter s stop over at corfu and to lead sixth crusade in 1228 in 1229 he even sent a company of greek troops to serve under frederick in italy at same time theodore presided over a rupture in relations with venice after his governor in corfu sequestered cargo of a shipwrecked venetian ship theodore issued an edict on 19 august 1228 prohibiting venetian merchants from practising commerce in his realm in january of same year robert of courtenay died leaving throne of latin empire to his eleven year old brother baldwin ii with a regency taking over governance of state latin empire stood further enfeebled at this moment john asen offered an alliance baldwin ii would marry his daughter helena while john asen would take over regency and lend his assistance at repelling theodore s attacks latin barons viewed offer with mistrust as it would offer john asen every opportunity to take over constantinople himself instead they strung out negotiations and eventually chose 80 year old but energetic john of brienne as regent although bulgarian offer failed it served to open a rift between theodore and his nominal ally in a move clearly directed against john asen in september 1228 theodore agreed to a one year truce with latin empire s regent of with border between two empires running along a line from ainos to vrysis klokotnitsa and bulgarian captivity thumb right 200px alt modern painting of a standing man dressed in a green tunic red cape holding a sceptre and globus cruciger and wearing a gold and red crown modern representation of tsar john ii asen finally in late 1229 theodore began assembling his forces at thessalonica including a contingent of troops sent by frederick ii for projected final attack on constantinople as his troops marched east in spring 1230 he unexpectedly turned his army north and followed evros valley into bulgaria theodore s motives for this sudden change are debated contemporary and later historians like akropolites denounced this as a sign of theodore s duplicity and treachery a more likely suggestion is that theodore hitherto undefeated in battle desired to check bulgarian power and avoid possibility of bulgarians striking in his rear while he was engaged in besieging constantinople although caught by surprise john asen reacted rapidly allegedly affixing text of broken treaty to one of his spears as a flag he rallied his troops and met theodore in battle in april 1230 ensuing battle of klokotnitsa was a crushing victory for bulgarian ruler who took theodore and many of his officers captive in aftermath of klokotnitsa bulgaria emerged as mightiest power in balkans deprived of its energetic ruler theodore s empire collapsed within a few months thrace most of macedonia and albania fell under bulgarian rule as john asen boasted in an inscription in holy forty martyrs church at his capital of tarnovo he occupied all land from adrianople to dyrrhachium greek serbian and albanian alike although dyrrhachium itself apparently remained in greek hands latin duchy of philippopolis was also annexed and alexius slav s principality in rhodope mountains was extinguished in process with alexius spending rest of his life at asen s court theodore s brother manuel who managed to escape from klokotnitsa now took over throne in thessalonica his domain was reduced to environs of city and his family s core territories in epirus and thessaly as well as dyrrhachium and corfu while his brother constantine in aetolia and acarnania recognized his suzerainty as a son in law of john asen manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy but to all intents and purposes he was a client of bulgarian tsar at about same time michael i s bastard son michael ii returned from exile and quickly succeeded apparently with support of local population in taking over control of epirus manuel was forced to recognize fait accompli under pretense that michael recognized his suzerainty in token of which manuel conferred him title of despot in reality michael was fully independent and very quickly ceased to acknowledge manuel s suzerainty by 1236 he had seized corfu in order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter asen s attempts to subordinate epirote church to bulgarian church of tarnovo manuel turned to his brother s erstwhile rivals in nicaea and brought an end to ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging legitimacy and superiority of nicaea based patriarch theodore himself remained in captivity at tarnovo for seven years initially he was treated with honour but at some point during his captivity he was accused of plotting against john asen and blinded as a result this was customary byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals according to a contemporary letter written in hebrew asen initially ordered two jews to carry out deed for theodore had been persecuting jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns theodore begged to be spared and they refused to carry out blinding whereupon enraged tsar had them thrown from a cliff finally in 1237 theodore was released when asen recently widowed fell in love with theodore s sole unmarried daughter irene immediately after marriage theodore was released and allowed to depart tarnovo to wherever he wished return to thessalonica and final years recovery of

a warrior saint holding a sword between them billon trachy of john komnenos doukas as emperor of thessalonica as soon as he was set free theodore returned to thessalonica lacking any escort or followers he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter city in secret there he contacted old supporters and favourites and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted manuel and took over city as byzantine custom barred him from re assuming imperial office due to his blinding theodore installed his son john komnenos doukas as emperor without a coronation ceremony but remained real ruler of empire in his son s name john himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a god given gift and that he was indeed rightful emperor of romans due to his imperial descent deposed manuel was sent to exile at attaleia in asia minor while his wife maria was allowed to return to her father despite theodore s actions and overthrow of his daughter and son in law akropolites reports that john asen remained favourably disposed towards theodore due to his passionate love for irene manuel did not remain quiescent in exile determined to avenge himself from attaleia he secured passage through turkish lands to nicaea there john vatatzes welcomed him and agreed to support him but not before he secured from manuel oaths of loyalty to himself thus in early 1239 manuel with six nicaean ships set sail for greece landing near demetrias in thessaly he received widespread support in province perhaps even from local governor michael i s son in law constantine maliasenos allowing him to raise an army and in a short time occupy larissa and platamon faced with option of open civil war manuel and theodore eventually came to terms by dividing territories of thessalonica among themselves manuel renounced his allegiance to vatatzes and received thessaly john and theodore kept thessalonica and remaining parts of macedonia as far west as vodena and ostrovo and constantine was confirmed in his appanage of aetolia and acarnania to further secure their position both theodore and michael concluded treaties with powerful prince of achaea geoffrey ii of villehardouin submission of thessalonica to nicaea michael ii in epirus was not part of brothers agreement and continued to pursue his own policies independently of his uncles in 1241 when manuel died michael moved quickly to occupy thessaly in june of same year john asen died leaving throne to his seven year old son kaliman coupled with increasingly deteriorating situation of latin empire this development left john vatatzes of nicaea as pre eminent ruler of region and obvious candidate for capture of constantinople before undertaking any moves against constantinople vatatzes realized need to settle affairs with thessalonica and in particular with theodore whose ambition capability and machinations he feared in 1240 or 1241 he therefore issued an invitation with assurances of safe conduct to theodore to visit nicaea theodore accepted and was treated with great honours by vatatzes who deferred to him as his uncle and dined with him at same table in reality theodore was a prisoner in nicaea he was not allowed to leave and throughout his sojourn in nicaean court preparations were in full swing for a campaign against thessalonica in spring 1242 vatatzes crossed over into europe at head of his army with theodore accompanying him as an honorary prisoner facing no resistance nicaean army and fleet arrived before thessalonica city s garrison and inhabitants resisted with success and nicaean army lacking heavy siege equipment had to settle for a drawn out blockade soon however news arrived of a mongol invasion of asia minor which forced vatatzes to break off campaign and return to nicaea nevertheless nicaean emperor kept this news a secret and sent theodore to his son to negotiate john himself reportedly was willing to surrender city outright but his father convinced him to hold out for better terms in end after 40 days of negotiations john was allowed to keep control of thessalonica but renounced his imperial title and accepted nicaean suzerainty and title of despot theodore was also allowed to remain at thessalonica at his son s side john ruled as despot in thessalonica for two years until his death in 1244 theodore himself retired to vodena from where he supervised affairs of state on john s death he raised his younger son demetrios angelos doukas in his place and sent an embassy to nicaea to announce succession as befitted terms of vassalage agreed in 1242 if john was a religious ascetic demetrios was a dissolute youngster who enjoyed partying with his favourites and seducing married women although theodore remained in charge of governance demetrios quickly became so unpopular that many leading citizens began viewing direct nicaean rule with favour things came to a head in autumn 1246 when kaliman of bulgaria died leaving country in hands of a regency for his younger brother michael asen vatatzes quickly attacked bulgaria and within three months captured most of thrace and all of eastern and northern macedonia while michael ii of epirus also took advantage of opportunity to expand into albania and northwestern macedonia at close of this campaign in november as vatatzes was encamped at melnik he was informed of a conspiracy to depose demetrios and deliver thessalonica to him in exchange for a chrysobull guaranteeing traditional rights and privileges of city vatatzes readily granted this and sent envoys to demetrios calling for him to appear in person at his camp demetrios suspicious of vatatzes intentions refused and nicaeans marched on thessalonica after a few days conspirators opened one of gates to nicaean army and city was quickly captured demetrios was captured and exiled to in bithynia while thessalonica and all of macedonia were placed under governance of grand domestic andronikos palaiologos theodore himself isolated and without power in his refuge at vodena apparently remained uninvolved in these events final throw of dice and death with thessalonica secured vatatzes turned to epirus offering michael ii a marriage alliance between michael s eldest son nikephoros and his own granddaughter maria offer was enthusiastically accepted by michael s wife theodora petraliphaina a niece of theodore s own wife and young couple were engaged at pegae michael who had not abandoned his family s ambitions remained ambivalent about nicaean alliance and theodore used his influence over his nephew to turn him against it thus in spring 1251 michael launched a sudden attack on thessalonica city resisted successfully and in spring of next year vatatzes once more crossed into europe to campaign against komnenoi doukai theodore with michael had turned to north capturing prilep and veles and when they received news of vatatzes arrival they withdrew to epirus via kastoria vatatzes besieged and captured theodore s stronghold of vodena but soon became bogged down in skirmishing in area of kastoria stalemate was broken when two epirote generals john and theodore petraliphas defected to nicaeans followed shortly after by ruler of kruja golem this forced michael to come to terms with vatatzes ceding fortresses he had captured as well as his remaining holdings in macedonia and reconfirming marriage alliance with nicaea furthermore vatatzes explicitly demanded handing over of theodore epirote ambassadors met vatatzes at vodena where they offered theodore and young nikephoros as hostages latter was granted title of despot and soon allowed to return to epirus but theodore was moved as a prisoner to asia minor he died shortly after around 1253 assessment modern biographer of komnenoi konstantinos varzos described theodore as an energetic resourceful and exceedingly ambitious statesman who inherited from his ancestor alexios i komnenos his endurance and persistence but not latter s intelligence diplomacy and ability to adapt varzos furthermore points out that despite his great ability theodore s ambition to be one to recover constantinople and his irreconcilable rivalry with nicaea actually hampered and delayed restoration of byzantine empire by several decades theodore s legacy left a lasting mark on political worldview of western greeks byzantinist donald nicol remarks that memory of theodore doukas s victories and of his title to byzantine crown lived on in northern greece and in hearts of his descendants for many years to come michael ii continued his uncle s rivalry with nicaea further delaying recovery of constantinople and even after restoration of byzantine empire by nicaea in 1261 rulers of epirus would continue to challenge revived empire and uphold their own claim to byzantine throne family by his wife maria petraliphaina theodore had four children anna angelina komnene doukaina who married king stefan radoslav of serbia john komnenos doukas who became emperor of thessalonica in 1237 irene komnene doukaina who married john asen
