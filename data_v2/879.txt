charodeika class was a pair of monitors built for imperial russian navy in late 1860s they were designed by british shipbuilder charles mitchell and built in saint petersburg both ships were assigned to baltic fleet and had fairly uneventful careers mostly assigned to training units struck a rock in 1869 and had to be run aground lest she sink they were reclassified as coast defense ironclads in 1892 and rusalka sank during a storm in gulf of finland next year with loss of all hands her sister ship continued in service until 1907 and was eventually scrapped in 1911 12 rusalkas wreck was discovered in 2003 by an expedition sponsored by estonian maritime museum design and description by late 1863 russian admiralty board had begun planning for second generation of ironclads to succeed those ships then under construction and issued a requirement on 12 dates used in this article are new style for a twin screw low freeboard ship that could sail throughout baltic sea it was to be armed with smoothbore dahlgren guns and protected by up to of armor before even deciding which designs to accept admiralty decided to order eight ships of various types in march 1864 charles mitchell was allocated only one of eight ships before he submitted four different designs for competition in may june two ships of his simplest design were awarded to a new builder s g kudriavtsev who was provided facilities at state owned galernyi island shipyard in addition admiralty committed itself to furnishing armament armor engines and boilers as well as a variety of smaller components for two ships mclaughlin p 155 charodeika class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessor and were long at waterline they had a beam of and a maximum draft of ships were designed to displace but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced they were fitted with a plough shaped ram that projected forward of bow were fitted with a double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by watertight bulkheads into 25 compartments their crew numbered 13 officers and 171 crewmen in 1877 mclaughlin pp 156 57 ships had a freeboard of only and their decks were often awash in any sort of moderate sea they rolled heavily and were very unmaneuverable often not responding to ship s wheel until 20 degrees of rudder was applied monitors were fitted with three iron pole masts probably fore and aft rigged and used to steady ship rather than for propulsion mclaughlin pp 154 57 160 propulsion charodeika class had two simple horizontal direct acting steam engines built by baird works of saint petersburg russian monitors and coast defense ships p 306 engines had a bore of and a stroke of and each drove a single four bladed propeller steam was provided by two rectangular boilers at a pressure of engines were designed to produce a total of but only produced which gave ships speeds between when they ran their sea trials in 1869 monitors also had a donkey boiler for small steam engine that powered ventilation fans and pumps charodeika class carried a maximum of their range however is unknown mclaughlin pp 156 159 60 armament monitors were designed to be armed with four obukhov rifled guns a pair in each coles type turret various deckhouses and ventilation hatches prevented turrets from firing directly forward or aft so that each turret could bear approximately 150deg to each side difficulties in manufacturing guns and delayed construction of monitors themselves forced admiralty to change armament to a pair of 9 inch guns in forward turret and a pair of smoothbore muzzle loading rodman guns in aft turret these guns were replaced by another pair of 9 inch rifled guns beginning in 1871 they were replaced in their turn in 1878 79 by two longer more powerful 9 inch obukhov guns ship carried 75 rounds for each gun mclaughlin pp 156 158 light guns for use against torpedo boats are not known to have been fitted aboard charodeika class ships before 1870s when a variety of guns were added although their numbers calibers and locations are only partially known charodeika received four 4 pounder guns two mounted on roofs of each gun turret while rusalka had a total of three guns with only one gun on her aft turret other guns known have been fitted included engstrom quick firing qf guns qf hotchkiss guns qf hotchkiss five barreled revolving cannon and nordenfelt guns mclaughlin p 158 armor charodeika class monitors had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick amidships and thinned to aft and forward it was high and completely covered hull to below waterline armor was backed by of teak turrets had of armor also backed by teak and conning tower was 4 5 inches thick amidships deck was 1 inch thick although it thinned to at ends of ship ships name namesake buildermclaughlin p 152 ordered laid down launched entered service p island shipyard st petersburg 26 january june september 1867 1869 p 384 construction and service monitors were intended to be delivered by 27 may 1867 but construction was held up by delays in delivery of blueprints armor changes made while under construction and untimely death of kudriavtsev in august 1865 contract was transferred to mitchell who completed them in 1869 two years after their scheduled delivery date for cost of 762 000 roubles each both ships spent their entire careers with baltic fleet in june charodeika ripped a long hole in her hull when she struck an uncharted rock in gulf of finland and had to be deliberately run aground to prevent her sinking she was assigned to artillery training detachment of baltic fleet in march 1870 and charodeika was later assigned to mine torpedo training detachment mclaughlin pp 160 162 63 both monitors were reclassified as coast defense ironclads on 13 february 1892 and rusalka sank in a storm on 7 september 1893 during a voyage between reval tallinn and helsingfors helsinki with loss of her entire crew of 177 officers and enlisted men despite an extensive search only traces of her found were one body and some debris that washed ashore charodeika remained in service until 31 march 1907 when she was turned over to port of kronstadt for disposal ship was stricken from navy list on 7 april and was finally scrapped in 1911 12 rusalkas wreck was discovered on 22 july 2003 in gulf of finland south of
