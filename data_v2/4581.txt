hd 217107 6 g piscium is a yellow subgiant star approximately 65 light years away from earth in constellation of pisces fish its mass is very similar to sun s although it is considerably older two planets have been discovered orbiting star one is extremely close and completes an orbit every seven days while other is much more distant taking eight years to complete an orbit distance age and mass hd 217107 is fairly close to sun gaia astrometric satellite measured its parallax as 49 milliarcseconds which corresponds to a distance of 65 47 light years its apparent magnitude is 6 17 making it just barely visible to naked eye under favourable conditions spectroscopic observations show that its spectral type is g7 or g8 which means its temperature is about 5 000 k its mass is thought to be roughly same as sun s although its estimated age of 7 7 billion years is rather older than sun s 4 6 billion years and it is thought to be beginning to evolve away from main sequence having consumed almost all hydrogen in its core in nuclear fusion reactions planetary system a study of radial velocity of hd 217107 carried out in 1998 revealed that its motion along line of sight varied over a 7 1 day cycle period and amplitude of this variation indicated that it was caused by a planetary companion in orbit around star with a minimum mass slightly greater than that of jupiter companion planet was designated hd 217107 b while most planets with orbital periods of less than 10 days have almost circular orbits hd 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit and its discoverers hypothesized that this could be due to gravitational influence of a second planet in system at a distance of several astronomical units au confirmation of existence of a second planet followed in 2005 when long term observations of star s radial velocity variations revealed a variation on a period of about eight years caused by a planet with a mass at least twice that of jupiter in a very eccentric orbit with a semimajor axis of about 4 3 au second planet was designated hd 217107 c references external links extrasolar planet interactions by rory barnes richard greenberg lunar and planetary lab university of arizona category g type subgiants 217107 category pisces constellation category planetary systems with two confirmed planets category durchmusterung objects piscium 6
