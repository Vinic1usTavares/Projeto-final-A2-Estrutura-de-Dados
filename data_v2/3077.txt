astronomica also known as is a latin didactic poem about celestial phenomena written in hexameters and divided into five books astronomica was written c ad by a roman poet whose name was likely marcus manilius little is known of manilius and although there is evidence that astronomica was probably read by many other roman writers no surviving works explicitly quote him earliest work on astrology that is extensive comprehensible and mostly intact astronomica describes celestial phenomena and in particular zodiac and astrology seems to have been inspired by lucretius s epicurean poem de rerum a stoic deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason fifth book of astronomica features a lacuna which has led to debate about original size of poem some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over years whereas others believe only a small section of work is missing poem was rediscovered by italian humanist and scholar poggio bracciolini who had a copy made from which modern text derives upon its rediscovery astronomica was read commented upon and edited by a number of scholars nevertheless it failed to become as popular as other classical latin poems and was neglected for centuries this started to change during early 20th century when between 1903 and 1930 classicist a e housman published a critically acclaimed edition of poem in five books housman s work was followed by latinist g p goold s lauded english translation in 1977 today scholars consider astronomica to be highly technical complicated and occasionally contradictory at same time many have praised manilius s ability to translate highly technical astronomical concepts and complex mathematical computations into poetry authorship and date because no contemporary roman sources mention his name exact identity of astronomicas author is a tantalizing question but his name was probably marcus manilius volk 2009 p 1 this uncertainty has led to marcus manilius being confused over years with manilius antiochus fl c 100bc mentioned by pliny elder in his naturalis historia flavius manlius theodorus fl c a consul in and boethius sixth century roman senator and author of de consolatione philosophiae whose full name was anicius manlius severinus boethius volk 2009 pp 2 4 although poem suggests that writer was a citizen and resident of rome some have contended that manilius was a non roman according to katharina volk a latinist who specializes in manilius this belief is generally based on either poet s supposedly inferior or wish to see manilius as member of a greek intellectual milieu at rome volk 2009 p 162 19th century classicist fridericus jacobs and 19th and 20th century historian paul monceaux have argued that he was an african based largely on his writing style which they say resembles that of other african authors chisholm 1911 pp brock 1911 p 180 volk counters this view arguing that manilius writes from a conventional roman perspective and takes recourse to roman history to illustrate astrological facts he discusses volk 2009 pp work s date has been debated only clear reference to an historical event is a reference to battle of teutoburg foresta decisive loss for rome forcing it to withdraw from magna volk 2009 p 138 in considering poem s date scholars have proposed three hypotheses that it was written entirely under augustus who ruled from 27 bc until ad 14 under reigns of both augustus and tiberius who ruled from ad 1437 or entirely under tiberius first conjecture was favored primarily from renaissance until 19th century when karl lachmann argued that references to emperor in poem made more sense if they were referring to tiberius at turn of 20th century scholars such as a e housman began favoring idea that first two books were written under augustus last two under tiberius and that third was volk 2009 pp this debate has not been settled volk 2009 p 139 although volk has argued that poem should be dated to c ad 1020 contents thumb alt 17th century chart of universe with zodiac signs and earth at center universe as described by manilius is made up of two spheres one solid earth and other hollow firmament resembling this 17th century depiction in andreas cellarius s harmonia according to volk manilius s astronomica is earliest work on astrology that is extensive comprehensible and mostly extant volk wrote that since he dedicates poem to stellar phenomena it is indicative of great fascination that stars held for romans of manilius period volk 2011 p 6 summary astronomica which is written in hexameters opens with manilius contending that he is first to sing of astrology he also claims that god mercury engendered his interest in celestial bodies goold 1997 1977 p xvii in first book he ponders origin of universe considering theories by xenophanes hesiod leucippus heraclitus thales and empedocles before arguing that universe was created from four elements and is governed by a divine spirit manilius astronomica 1 goold 1997 1977 pp xviii xx according to manilius universe is composed of two spheres one earth is solid and other sphere of stars often called firmament is hollow constellations are fixed in firmament earth is stationary and firmament revolves around it explaining movements of stars planets moon and sun also revolve around earth in vast space between its surface and edge of firmament volk 2009 p 25 because earth is in center of universe it is equidistant from firmament and is thus not compelled to fall in any specific direction volk 2009 p 31 according to manilius universe is ruled by a god deus and is governed by reason ratione gubernat manilius astronomica 1 251 manilius next discusses constellations and astronomica 1 and celestial circles manilius astronomica 1 in this section poet spends considerable time contemplating milky way band manilius astronomica 1 which after exploring several hypotheses as to its existence he concludes is likely celestial abode for dead heroes volk 2009 p 266 manilius goold 1997 1977 p 3 first book ends with an exploration of comets which manilius sees as harbingers of calamity or great disaster heilen 2011 p 282 volk 2009 pp thumb left 400px alt illustration of signs of zodiac book three discusses signs of zodiac which are depicted in this 16th century manuscript books two and three deal mainly with finer details of zodiac volk 2014 p 95 book two opens with a preface in which manilius presents a brief history of hexameter poetry singling out homer and hesiod purpose volk argues is to emphasize uniqueness of his poem in comparison to others rather than to insert himself into this poetic tradition according to manilius every path that leads to helicon has been trodden omnis ad est all other topics have been covered and he must find untouched meadows and water integra prata for his poetry astrology manilius astronomica 2 50 2 volk 2010 pp manilius ends book s preface by saying that divine cosmos is voluntarily revealing itself both to mankind as a whole and to poet in particular and that he is set apart from crowd because his poetic mission has been sanctioned by fate volk 2003 p 628 manilius astronomica 2 poet then begins his explanation of first astrologically significant circle zodiac itself he first considers signs of zodiac viz aries taurus gemini cancer leo virgo libra scorpio sagittarius capricorn aquarius and pisces manilius astronomica 2 before discussing aspects and relationships between signs and other objects manilius astronomica 2 in this section poet briefly discusses zodiac signs olympian gods who serve as their protectors and relationship between signs and parts of human body manilius astronomica 2 astronomica then considers astronomica 2 goold 1997 1977 pp before he deviates from zodiac and begins to discuss didactic method manilius astronomica 2 book concludes with a consideration of second astrologically significant circle that of fixed circle of observer volk 2009 pp manilius astronomica 2 last few lines are dedicated to an overview of manilius astronomica 2 third book which focuses mainly on determin ing degree of ecliptic which is rising about horizon at moment of a person s birth opens with manilius s reiteration that his work is original goold 1997 1977 p lxii because his topic is complex and difficult poet tells his audience they can expect truth but not beauty he then discusses third astrologically significant circle lots manilius astronomica 3 which are points on a birth chart that carry special significance subsequent verses explain how to calculate ascendant horoscope manilius astronomica 3 and manilius astronomica 3 and how to determine projected length of one s life manilius astronomica 3 third book concludes with a discussion about tropic signs volk 2009 p 268 manilius astronomica 3 which while not particularly pertinent to astrological content of book allows manilius to end book on a poetic note most scholars consider third book to be highly technical according to goold it is least poetical of five exemplifying for most part manilius s skill in rendering numbers and arithmetical calculations in hexameters manilius goold 1997 1977 p 161 a similar but less favorable sentiment is expressed by green who writes that in this book disjuncture between instruction and medium is most obviously felt because complex mathematical calculations are confined to hexameter and obscured behind poetic green 2014 p 57 thumb alt 16th century painting of a soldier on a flying horse rescuing a chained woman most of work s fifth book deals with myth of andromeda left perseus upper right and a sea monster lower right books four and five are largely about effects of particular celestial phenomena on native book four covers many topics that originated in egypt leading goold to write that manilius based his work on an egyptian source goold 1997 1977 p lxxxiv much of first portion of this book deals with astronomica 4 and manilius astronomica 4 both of which allow manilius another chance to convert mathematical and astrological tables into poetic verse manilius goold 1997 1977 p 221 a short description of rising of individual zodiacal degrees is followed by a more comprehensive survey of zodiacal geography manilius astronomica 4 near end of book manilius writes about ecliptic signs manilius astronomica 4 book is punctuated at lines 4 and 4 by exhortation s of frustrated student where complaints that astrology is difficult and nature is hidden are countered by statements that object of study is nothing less than union with god and universe microcosm wishes to reveal itself to man volk 2009 p 269 most of fifth and final book is a discussion of via myth of andromeda and perseus manilius astronomica 5 manilius recalls how andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents cepheus and cassiopeia andromeda was chained to a cliff but before creature could consume her perseus who had just vanquished medusa arrived he instantly fell in love with andromeda killed sea monster and saved young woman s life according to green digression which is by far longest in poem is very well chosen in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at same time andromeda e g 5 544 perseus e g 5 67 sea monster strictly cetus cf 5 600 but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as 5 544 608 and monstrum 5 581 medusa s head e g 5 567 and andromeda s parents cepheus and cassiopeia green says story is perfect for manilius he is able to use it to justify constellations proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement as he had previously argued in 1 green 2014 p 46 conversely housman compared it unfavorably to ovid s version of story and called manilius s retelling a sewn on patch of far from best purple non sane pannus manilius housman 1930 p 70 a similar sentiment was expressed by cambridge classicist arthur woollgar verrall who wrote that while episode was meant to be a show piece it comes across as a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace verrall 1913 p 630 between lines 5 709 10 there is a large lacuna meaning that at least some of work is missing and then last few lines of book concern stars and other stellar phenomena book ends with a simile about res publica of stars volk 2009 pp volk 2009 p 270 this section in which manilius proposes that stars constitute an elaborate and organized system defined by a hierarchy that prevents cosmic disaster seems to be a way for manilius to assert legitimacy of roman state through analogy volk 2009 p 110 worldview according to volk basic tenet of what we might call manilius natural philosophy is idea that universe is divine she writes that manilius is inconsistent about location of this divinity for instance in his first book manilius claims perfectly regular movement of sun moon planets and stars is proof that universe is product of a god he also says universe itself is a god ipsum esse deum volk 2009 p 217 manilius astronomica 1 later in same book manilius again says universe is work of a great divinity magni ordo manilius astronomica 1 531 concerning this vacillation volk writes it is clear that there is a certain elasticity to manilius concept of divinity of universe is world simply ruled by a cf 1 484 or is it a deus cf 1 485 itself volk 2009 p 218 volk answers that in cosmology of astronomica god can be understood as soul or breath present within world and since this divine entity completely pervades cosmos it makes equally much sense to call cosmos itself a god volk 2009 p 219 according to volk this interpretation of universe which states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly way thus allows manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect affecting everything within cosmos and that fate rules all volk 2009 p 220 volk points out poem borrows or alludes to a number of philosophical traditions including hermeticism platonism and 2009 pp but prevailing belief of commentators is that manilius espouses a stoic worldview in astronomica volk 2009 p 226 a comparison between manilius s beliefs and those of other stoics reveals parallels that according to volk are immediately obvious volk 2009 p 227 for instance stoics and manilius agree on divinity of universe argument from design assumption that supreme god is both creator of universe and active force within it interconnectedness of everything understanding that humans are intimately connected to cosmos importance of considering heavens and belief in an inescapable fate that rules over all volk 2009 p agreement on this latter point is of special importance because according to volk belief in fate is one of most notorious aspects of stoic system volk 2009 p 228 identification of poem as stoic however is not unanimous macgregor 2005 p 41 volk 2009 p 226 note 13 in 1887 against common opinion of contemporaneous scholars gustave contested idea that poem is stoic in 2005 alexander macgregor said that while contemporary scholars such as goold and volk read manilius as a stoic astronomica actually breaks with or contradicts stoic tradition in a number of places macgregor 2005 p 65 manilius exalts plato socrates and pythagoras macgregor 2005 pp 4749 macgregor 2005 p 51 proposes a platonic proof for existence of god macgregor 2005 p 52 denies a key stoic belief in periodic destruction of cosmos by an immense conflagration every great year followed by a cosmic recreation macgregor 2005 p 53 never discusses six stoic paradoxes as discussed by cicero macgregor 2005 p 54 and ignores importance of controlling soul manilius also focuses on a number of pythagorean tenets pythagorean order of planets macgregor 2005 p 56 importance of geometry and numbers macgregor 2005 p and significance of triangular figures made up of ten points arranged in four rows macgregor 2005 p in key places manilius also makes use of non stoics like eudoxus of cnidus and cicero macgregor 2005 p 57 given these factors macgregor concludes that manilius should be classified as an idealistic pythagorean or a platonist rather than a stoic style many consider astronomica to be a work of erudition elegance and passion scaliger and bentley praised manilius s handling of numbers in verse manilius housman 1920 p 51 and harvard university press later echoed this commendation writing that manilius exhibit s great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form and that poet writes with some passion about his stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars housman however calls manilius facile and frivolous but also describes him as one latin poet who excelled even ovid in verbal point and smartness housman 1916 p xix housman 1903 p xxi poem while metrically correct has been noted for its technical language and unusual word choices hatch 2007 p 735 classicist arthur woollgar verrall argues that while at his best manilius may remind us of lucretius metre that he uses has regular and monotonous flow of age jacobs monceaux and others have attributed astronomica idiosyncrasies to manilius s reported african origin they argue he wrote and spoke a form of africitas a putative african dialect of latin with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary syntax sentence structure and style thus explaining poem s quirks wilfrid 1928 p 73 aside from dubiously hypothesized presence of africitas in poem however m dorothy brock argues there is very little evidence that manilius was from africa in addition to its stylistic oddities astronomica includes some internal inconsistencies according to green poem is riddled with confusion and contradiction he cites its presentation of incompatible systems of astrological calculation information overload deferral of meaning and contradictory instruction at same time green notes that similar issues exist in other first to third century astrological works green 2014 p 56 according to caroline stark manilius paradoxically claims astrological knowledge may be acquired by individuals and that it is only granted by divine favor stark 2011 p 267 t barton says manilius may have included these contradictions and complexities so he would be regarded as a figure of unreachable knowledge for novice student reader green while not ruling out this hypothesis says manilius was probably not motivated by a desire to carve out for himself a position of power in new imperial world of experts as barton says rather green says manilius due to his pride in poetic innovation and his deference to emperor sought to present himself as a compliant imperial agent intent on producing a creative poetic enterprise that plots its own way through levels of acceptable stellar discourse in early empire david pingree concludes that poem s principal purpose seems to have been to delight its audience with poetry and to arouse admiration for poet by its cleverness pingree 1980 p 263 completeness it is unknown whether astronomica is a finished work a large lacuna i e a gap between lines 5 709 and 5 710 presents a problem with this discussion according to housman based strictly on contents of astronomica one cannot cast a full horoscope because necessary information such as an in depth survey of planets and effects constellations both inside and outside zodiac produce upon their setting is missing housman 1903 p lxxii according to volk lack of a lengthy consideration of planets is rather puzzling because manilius claims several times that he will examine their zodiacal nature volk 2009 p 5 goold writes that a didactic poem is seldom an exhaustive treatise and argues that manilius likely gave a perfunctory account of planets natures in great lacuna and then considered his obligations duly discharged goold 1997 1977 p xiv others have argued work was originally longer and some hypothesize it comprised eight books these writers base their assertion on a letter sent in ad 983 by gerbertus aureliacensis later pope to archbishop of rheims in which former reports he had recently located eight volumes about astrology by boethius viii volumina boetii de at abbey at bobbio boethius was often confused with manilius because one of former s names was manlius goold 1997 1977 p xi those who favor idea poem was once longer argue manuscript at bobbio was a misattributed eight book version of astronomica goold repudiates this hypothesis noting catalogue at bobbio lists work gerbertus was likely referring to as composed of three books by boethius about arithmetic and rest i e five about astronomy libros boetii iii de et de astronomia this according to goold is evidence gerbertus found one manuscript that contained both boethius s de arithmetica and manilius s astronomica rather than an eight book version of latter goold 1997 1977 p volk when considering problem of completeness proposed several hypotheses work is mostly complete but internally inconsistent about which topics it will and will not consider lacuna in book five may have originally contained missing information lacuna may be relatively small and work is unfinished or entire books may have originally existed but were lost over time through hazardous process of textual transmission influences thumb left alt engraving of roman poet and philosopher lucretius although it was inspired by epicurean poem de rerum natura by lucretius pictured astronomica embraces stoicism manilius frequently imitates lucretius who wrote didactic poem de rerum natura some classicists have suggested that manilius may have sought to emulate lucretius by writing six books but evidence for this hypothesis is scarce and it remains mostly speculative volk 2009 p 120 note 138 while lucretius s work espouses epicureanism a philosophy that emphasizes materialism and skepticism of superstition and divine intervention manilius s work is largely stoic and promotes a greco roman understanding of creationism as well as fatalistic determinism keith 2013 p xix both volk and scholar david butterfield have argued that manilius is in many ways an anti lucretius with former arguing that his presentation in astronomica of an orderly cosmos ruled by fate is a direct attack on random universe depicted by his predecessor volk 2009 p 192 butterfield 2013 p 48 note 9 manilius sometimes conveys his philosophical stance via grammatical voice unlike lucretius who often uses a passive construction to convey his understanding of nature manilius uses active grammatical constructions to convey intentionality he sees in creation e g god and reason which rules all things guide earthly animals by heavenly signs deus et ratio quae gubernat ab animalia signis steele 1932 p 326 manilius astronomica 2 furthermore while lucretius used de rerum natura to present a non theistic account of creation manilius was a creationist rather than a materialistic evolutionist and he consequently refers to one spirit unus spiritus 2 64 a divine power divina potentia 3 90 a creator auctor 3 681 and a god deus 2 475 throughout his poem steele 1932 p 325 astronomica is influenced by ovid s metamorphoses virgil s aeneid ennius s annales and greek didactic poet aratus volk 2009 p 184 latter s influence on manilius is especially noticeable and it seems likely that manilius based much of his first book on portions of aratus s phaenomena volk 2014 p 106 despite his debt to poet manilius diverges from his understanding of cosmos aratus focuses on mythology and graphic description whereas manilius emphasizes scientific aspects of his work abry 2007 pp 1 89 it is uncertain if manilius had direct knowledge of aratus s poem or if he used a translation by cicero ovid or germanicus abry 2007 p 2 note 5 volk 2009 p 189 note 29 latter position is favored by several 21st century scholars such as dora liuzzi and emma gee gee 2013 p 117 in regards to poet s relationship with germanicus wolfgang hubner writes few echoes of germanicus translation of aratus are insufficient for us to establish which of two drew on other or whether two were composed independently of each other astronomica directly references homer as greatest poet maximus vates as well as hesiod calling him nearest to homer manilius astronomica 2 1 2 11 steele 1932 p 320 and alludes to numerous other greek poets and writers such as apollonius rhodius choerilus of choerilus of samos and aeschylus goold 1997 1977 pp 366 369 434 poem also contains a direct allusion to ennius s annales which according to goold is astronomicas one solitary notice of latin literature textual history thumb left alt engraving of poggio bracciolini in middle age astronomica was rediscovered by poggio bracciolini c

late 10th to 11th century was found at monastery of gembloux in brabant in modern day belgium l from library of leipzig was probably written around mid 11th century and has many corrections made by a scribe housman argues that l is superior of two as it was probably copied straight from a whereas g was probably derived from a copy of a copy housman 1930 pp vvi second family b takes its name from now lost archetype and includes manuscript m housman 1930 p v which itself is a direct descendant of manuscript that poggio bracciolini rediscovered i e aforementioned manuscript b near constance

riddled with mistakes prompting bracciolini to sarcastically remark that new copy had to be divined rather than read non legere housman 1903 pp asso 2003 although poorly written m has been singled out as possibly most important surviving manuscript because it was a direct copy of archetype b whereas g and l are derived from a less faithful copy that is a of archetype following invention of printing

between 1903 and 1930 housman published what is considered by many scholars authoritative edition of poem with an additional editio minor in 1932 1933 p 26 according to volk housman s work is might say its bold handling of text its incisive commentary and its merciless invective against other scholars volk 2009 p 3 in 1977 g p goold published a loeb english translation collated both from manuscript m and from photographs of various manuscripts which had once belonged to housman goold 1997 1977 p cx this release marked first time that poem had been translated into english prose first

goold s translation complete with substantial introductory notes and diagrams was called masterly by volk and steven green both of whom argued that it marked a significant development in accessibility of manilius to a larger audience green volk 2011 p viii goold later issued a second edition of his translation in 1992 as well as a corrected edition in 1997 that included information from w s watt s

barely survived into middle ages for this reason a e housman pictured compared poem to a shipwreck citing it as an example of why no man ever ought to trust gods while manilius is not quoted by any extant roman author many scholars argue that he is alluded to by a number of authors including ausonius claudian juvenal lucan manetho martianus capella orientius pseudo empedocles seneca sidonius apollinaris tertullian titus calpurnius siculus and venantius fortunatus volk 2011 p 9 with this said hubner cautions that such assumptions should be considered carefully or downright rejected in cases of manetho and pseudo empedocles as similarities may be due to a lost ancient epic precursor that manilius and others were all alluding to or borrowing from hubner 2012 work of julius firmicus maternus who wrote in time of constantine about astrology and other subjects resembles manilius s work in many ways for instance in his libri octo composed c firmicus follows manilius s method of instruction closely and analyzes poet s astrological fundamentals volk 2009 p 124 this suggests that firmicus almost certainly used manilius or someone inspired by him as a guide but despite similarity between firmicus s work and manilius s firmicus neither mentions manilius by name nor lists him as among few romans viz germanicus cicero and fronto who wrote about astrology volk notes that earliest references to from literary be found in two roman funerary inscriptions both of which bear line we are born to die and our end hangs from beginning ab origine pendet from poem s fourth book volk 2009 p 1 note 1 manilius astronomica 4 16 this theory is not without its detractors and scholars such as a and gomez pallares have suggested that these two inscriptions are forgeries dating from renaissance volk 2009 p 62 note 10 few copies of astronomica survived into medieval period and consequently manilius seems to have been little read during this period however there are a few exceptions to this dearth of attention hubner for instance writes that manilius may have inspired some of writings of columbanus additionally an ad 988 letter from gerbertus aureliacensis to abbey at bobbio in which a request is made for a work by m manilius or possibly manlius about astrology m manilius v l manlius de is evidence that a copy of astronomica was probably kept in library at bobbio volk 2009 pp 12 although it was largely ignored during antiquity and middle ages poem generated scholarly interest upon its 15th century rediscovery italian humanist lorenzo bonincontri delivered lectures on astronomica to large audiences and compiled his lecture notes into work s first commentary heilen 2011 p 278 bonincontri was apparently interested in manilius s treatment of nature of comets in first book of astronomica and according to stephan heilen portions of bonincontri s de rebus et divinis are based on manilius s work heilen 2011 pp despite attention it received after its rediscovery astronomica has never been as widely studied as other classical latin poems with that said interest in poem developed in second half of 20th century when scholars began to study manilius s philosophical and scientific ideas volk 2011 p 1 first full length english monograph on manilius and astronomica was volk s manilius and his intellectual background which was published in 2009 volk 2009 p vii two years later volk and green edited forgotten stars rediscovering manilius astronomica with essays from scholars worldwide book s purpose was to encourage readers to discover manilius and expand scholarly interest in astronomica since previous research of work s poetic scientific and philosophical themes had been primarily limited to germany france and italy volk 2002 p 197 and while manilius and his poem have been analyzed by scholars many lay readers find astronomica confusing and overly technical according to kristine louise haugen ambiguous phrases and extravagant circumlocutions necessitated by manilius s hexameter verse must often have made astronomica seem as it does today rather like a trigonometry textbook rendered as a saturday new york times crossword haugen 2011 p 213 scholars have noted irony of manilius s relative obscurity because he wrote astronomica in hope of attaining literary immortality housman voiced this sentiment in a dedicatory latin poem written for first volume of his edition that contrasted movement of celestial objects with mortality and fate of manilius s work he compared astronomica to a shipwreck carmina arguing that it was incomplete and imperfect having barely survived textual transmission housman mused that because manilius s ambitions of literary fame and immortality had been almost entirely dashed his work should
