mulan is a character inspired by a legendary figure who appears in walt disney pictures 36th animated feature film mulan 1998 as well as it s sequel mulan ii 2004 her speaking voice is provided by actress ming na wen while singer lea salonga provides character s singing voice created by author robert d san souci mulan is based on legendary chinese warrior hua mulan from poem ballad of mulan only child of an aging war veteran mulan disregards both tradition and law by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in army in lieu of her feeble father disney had originally conceived mulan as an oppressed young chinese woman who ultimately elopes to europe to be with a british prince however director tony bancroft who was inspired by well being of his own daughters wanted mulan to be a different unique kind of disney heroine one who is strong and independent whose fate does not depend upon a male character thus relationship between mulan and captain li shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot while mulan s bravery and strength were emphasized in order to ensure that she remained hero of her own story mulan s supervising animator was mark henn who deliberately designed character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors reception towards mulan s personality has been generally positive with critics praising her bravery and heroism however some commentators have accused disney of westernizing character while her romantic relationship with shang has been widely accused of compromising mulan s heroism both wen and salonga have been awarded disney legends for their contributions to role liu yifei will play live action version of character in 2020 live action adaptation of original 1998 film development conception and writing mulan was originally conceived as an animated short in 1994 in which a miserable chinese girl elopes to west to be with a british prince while developing a series of treatments based on traditional stories and folk tales children s book author robert d san souci discovered ballad of mulan an ancient chinese poem about hua mulan a chinese woman who replaces her ailing father in army by disguising herself as a man fascinated by hua mulan s story san souci suggested poem to disney studio hired san souci himself to write film s treatment and story mulan explores age old theme of remaining true to oneself with co director tony bancroft summarizing character s role in film as story of a girl who can t help who she is but she exists in a different society that tells her who she is supposed to be because ballad of mulan is such a beloved and well known story san souci longed to maintain character s integrity however certain creative liberties were taken with story in regards to mulan s role such as character neglecting to ask her parents permission prior to enlisting herself in army additionally mulan s surname was changed from hua to fa finally mulan s true identity is discovered much earlier in film soon after army s initial encounter with enemy whereas her comrades remain ignorant throughout their entire 12 years at war until after mulan has returned home in addition unlike preceding traditional disney animated feature films developing romantic relationship between mulan and li shang is treated as more of a subplot as opposed to a traditional central plot as observed by film critic andy klein of animation world network klein commented mulan isn t waiting for her prince to someday come when he does arrive having known her primarily as a man and having learned to admire her for her deeper qualities romance is muted and subtle throughout movie they are constantly working towards helping each other change into better and truer versions of themselves in order to achieve their true potential voice thumb chinese american actress ming na wen voiced mulan in both animated films alt a close up portrait of mulan s voice actress ming na wen at a conference mulan s speaking voice is provided by chinese american actress ming na wen because character represented traditional chinese values and is depicted as being dramatic close to her father very respectful bancroft believed that wen possessed perfect voice for mulan which he additionally described as very chinese born and raised in macau china wen was very much familiar with both legend of hua mulan and ballad of mulan at time of her audition for role having grown up being read poem by her mother wen explained i think every chinese kid grows up with this story additionally likening poem s popularity in china to that of western parson weems fable in which american president george washington chops down his father s beloved cherry tree mulan served as wen s first voice acting role in an interview with ign actress elaborated on recording process specifically fact that she was required to record majority of character s dialogue in isolation saying i just loved story so much and identified so much with character of mulan it was easy for me i loved using my imagination i felt like i was a little kid again being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon so it was a lot of fun for me in spite of fact that throughout film mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian a miniature chinese dragon named mushu who is voiced by american actor and comedian eddie murphy wen and her co star never actually encountered each other while working on mulan due to fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations upon being cast as mulan s speaking voice wen was immediately informed by disney that she would not be providing character s singing voice actress took no offense to this decision commenting jokingly i don t blame them directors hired filipina singer and actress lea salonga to dub character s respective singing voice heard in film s songs reflection i ll make a man out of you and a girl worth fighting for on wen s behalf according to thomas s hischak author of book disney voice actors a biographical dictionary salonga was originally cast to provide both mulan s speaking and singing voices however directors eventually felt that her attempt at impersonating a man in form of mulan s male alter ego ping was rather unconvincing and ultimately replacing salonga with wen six years prior to mulan salonga provided singing voice of princess jasmine in disney s aladdin 1992 on behalf of american actress linda larkin while auditioning for mulan salonga asked jokingly why do i have to audition i was already a princess before wasn t that enough characterization and design film s screenplay was constantly being revised and re written naturally so was mulan s characterization and role in film writers wanted mulan to represent a different kind of disney heroine specifically described as one who didn t need a tiara but was still just as much as graceful strong and courageous between two bancroft and his twin brother tom an animator who also worked on mulan have a total of seven daughters this further inspired filmmakers to portray mulan as a unique heroine who is not another damsel in distress in favor of having her resemble a strong female disney character who would truly be heroine of her own story instead essentially a female role model characteristics of strength and courage were a must for mulan in an interview with christian post bancroft elaborated on way in which he as film s director continued to consider well being of his two young daughters while working on mulan having wanted to make a unique heroine that hadn t been seen before and provide for them someone who would be strong on her own without a prince saving her addressing way in which mulan differs from traditional disney heroines and princesses bancroft explained most disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change mulan stays consistent from first frame all way through end of movie her personality her drive it all stays same when we drew her we had opportunity to actually adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as ping as a soldier that she was physically a little different in how we drew her than when she was herself as mulan that was something we took advantage of so certainly that was a challenge to have her disguised as a boy whereas she s still a girl who doesn t understand what being a boy is all about or about boys move and act and that s part of how she learns that was part of fun and challenge of doing mulan you have essentially two characters to play with henn on animating mulan as ping visually animators were influenced by both traditional chinese and japanese artwork in specific case of mulan characters simple lines resemble classic asian painting chinese artist chen yi mentored animators helping them to come up with these designs mark henn served as mulan s supervising animator animating character in her male disguise as ping offered an unprecedented challenge for henn in order to solve this unique dilemma henn was provided with opportunity to adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as ping as a soldier that she was physically a little different in how we drew her than when she was herself as mulan physically mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional disney animated heroines specifically pocahontas from pocahontas 1995 and esmeralda from hunchback of notre dame 1996 because you can t pass as a man in army with a barbie style figure henn revealed that he was drawn to mulan s story because it was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from beginning animating characters distinct emotions using traditional chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for henn animator explained we don t create realism in sense that if you re doing a human character it s not going to look realistic balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using visual tools that you have in design to convey believable emotions that you want to get across in addition to mulan henn was also responsible for animating fa zhou mulan s elderly father he described complex relationship between two characters as emotional heart of story fathering one daughter himself henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by two characters several film critics have described mulan as a tomboy andy of ign observed in this slightly modernized version of story mulan is something of a rebel and a tomboy she has no interest in being a good little subservient wife despite her sighing parents wishes jo johnson in contribution to book queers in american popular culture volume 1 film and television wrote that unlike other disney heroines mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy observing way in which character speaks using a full mouth johnson additionally noticed several ways in which mulan s design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional disney heroines and princesses citing character s clumsy awkward demeanor broad shoulders and muscular limbs unruly single strand of hair and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose baggy clothing

rises above male dominated world in which she lives ken fox of tv guide wrote intelligent and fiercely independent mulan runs afoul of social expectations that a woman will be always obedient and duty bound to her husband bridget byrne of boxoffice wrote that mulan has pride charm spirit and aesthetic appeal which prevents her from being upstaged by vigorous and exciting action in which she participates variety s todd mccarthy praised character for inspiring a turn of circle from such age old disney classics in which passive heroines were rescued by blandly noble princes mccarthy continued here it s girl who does rescuing saving not only prince but emperor himself from oblivion and this in a distant culture where women were expected to obey strictly prescribed rules similarly margaret a mcgurk of cincinnati enquirer lauded mulan for ing her g i jane dilemma by proving that brains can do more than brawn hailing character as among strongest heroines in walt s cartoon canon ian freer of empire enthused mulan s engaging mixture of vulnerability and do becomes incredibly easy to root for hollis chacona of austin chronicle dubbed mulan a winning protagonist likewise los

additionally calling her a more likable and resourceful role model than pocahontas although largely well liked mulan s characterization has drawn some mild criticism and speculation inspiring a series of generally mixed to positive reviews from some film critics entertainment weekly s owen gleiberman wrote far more than beauty and beast or stolidly virtuous pocahontas mulan showcases a girl who gets to use her wits a testament to power of mind over brawn however gleiberman continued mulan finally falls a notch short of disney s best because heroine s empowerment remains an emotionally isolated quest similarly moira macdonald of seattle times hailed mulan as a strong engaging character who unlike many of her disney counterparts needs no one to rescue her from danger while questioning her personality asking was it really necessary to bestow mulan with self esteem problems because she seems so confident and intelligent her sad statement that she wants to see something worthwhile in mirror comes as a bit of a shock critics were not unanimous in their praise phoenix s jeffrey gantz felt that character was unoriginal inaccurate and westernized writing her costumes particularly kimono and obi mulan wears to matchmaker and hairdos look japanese give mulan native american features and you have pocahontas similarly james berardinelli of reelviews felt that character s depiction was too familiar reviewing although she looks different from ariel belle jasmine and pocahontas mulan is very much same type of individual a woman with a strong independent streak who is unwilling to bend to customs of her culture which decree that role of female is to be ornamental film isn t very subtle in reinforcing idea of equality between sexes additionally some critics such as alex von tunzelmann of guardian have criticized mulan for her violence writing disney struggles to make mulan both a killer and a heroine gingerly film attempts to tread a middle path implying that mulan annihilates most of hun army by causing an avalanche and having her dispatch shan yu with a load of fireworks very pretty but still technically killing however von tunzelmann did conclude more positively as disney heroines go mulan herself is a clear improvement on standard issue drippy princess relationship with shang unlike generally positive reviews received by mulan critical reception towards character s romantic relationship with li shang has been largely negative drawing much speculation from critics who accused mulan of having a typical girl hooks up with boy ending roger ebert of chicago sun times observed message here is standard feminist empowerment defy matchmaker dress as a boy and choose your own career but mulan has it both ways since inevitably

romantic love new york times janet maslin negatively opined for all of mulan s courage and independence in rebelling against matchmakers this is still enough of a fairy tale to need mr right citing

radical transformations of original works lan dong wrote even though mulan achieves success after she resumes her female self it is compromised by mulan and li shang s potential engagement at end of film cultural significance and accolades mulan is culturally recognized for her unique role in mulan specifically in regards to character s heroism ethnicity and disinterest in romance serving as a departure from traditional disney heroines and princesses because she challenged gender stereotypes and offered up an animated disney experience that isn t princess centric as one of few strong self propelled female characters that disney has kenneth turan of los angeles times observed way in which mulan s role in film as an independent not completely boy crazy heroine is somewhat new for disney according to sara veal of jakarta post mulan promotes self reliance determination and is uninterested in marriage or romance film ends on her saving her country rather than a romantic resolution
