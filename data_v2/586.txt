grenade hand anti tank no 74 commonly known as s t grenade or sticky bomb was a british hand grenade designed and produced during second world war grenade was one of a number of anti tank weapons developed for use by british army and home guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti tank guns in aftermath of dunkirk evacuation designed by a team from mir c including major millis jefferis and stuart macrae grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives this added stability to mix as well as giving it its squash head like effect covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet metal casing when user pulled a pin on handle of grenade casing would fall away and expose sticky sphere pulling another pin would arm firing mechanism and user would then attempt to attach grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle letting go of handle would release a lever that would activate a five second fuse which would then detonate nitroglycerin grenade had several faults with its design in tests it failed to adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and if user was not careful after freeing grenade from its casing it could easily stick to their uniform ordnance board of war department did not approve grenade for use by british army but personal intervention by prime minister winston churchill led to grenade going into production between 1940 and 1943 approximately 2 5 million were produced it was primarily issued to home guard but was also used by british and commonwealth forces in north africa accounting for six german tanks used by allied forces on anzio beachhead including first special service force as well as by australian army units during new guinea campaign french resistance were also issued a quantity of grenades development since at least 1938 jefferis had been toying with idea of a demolition or anti tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare it was to work by having an explosive charge deform so that it had a substantial area of intimate contact with surface of target then when detonated effect of explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an armoured plate much thicker than would otherwise be case sappers call such a device a poultice or squash head charge jefferis enlisted bauer and schulman of colloid science department of cambridge university they experimented with lengths of bicycle inner tube filled with plasticine to represent explosive these were fitted with wooden handles and dipped in rubber solution to make them sticky in experiments these prototypes proved difficult to aim and only by chance did any stick to metal bins used to represent tanks with end of battle of france and evacuation of british expeditionary force from port of dunkirk between 26 may and 4 june 1940 a german invasion of great britain seemed likely however british army was not well equipped to defend country in such an event in weeks after dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty seven divisions army was particularly short of anti tank guns 840 of which had been left behind in france and only 167 were available in britain ammunition was so scarce for remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes under circumstances jefferis considered that his idea might have more general application for british army and home guard jefferis was in charge of a department known as which had been created to develop and deliver weapons for use by guerrilla and resistance groups in occupied europe was now charged with development of sticky bomb problem of designing a sticky bomb was delegated to robert stuart macrae some sort of flexible bag was required to contain an explosive gel so that it did not matter how bomb landed on target however a flexible bag was found to be hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory discussions of problem in macrae s office were overheard by gordon norwood a master printer who macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer but he was not directly working on weapon norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container he obtained a 150 w light bulb with which to demonstrate his point a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool rigid when thrown but on contact glass broke and bomb deformed to required shape experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was way to go grenade needed a delay for thrower to get clear so woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating having covered bomb in glue a non sticky handle was required in handle a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay started as grenade left thrower s hand just like levers found on a conventional mills bomb type hand grenade meanwhile finding a suitable adhesive was a significant problem after unsuccessful experiments with a variety of candidates somebody suggested birdlime a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck birdlime performed better than anything previously tested but it was still not good enough macrae s tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter k and an indication that tin came from stockport but with no more clues as to manufacturer macrae got on a train to stockport and there found a taxi driver who took him to kay brothers ltd company s chief chemist was soon working on problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks problem was solved to macrae s satisfaction filling for bomb was developed by ici it was nitroglycerin based with a variety of additives to make it more stable and viscous glass flask containing main charge held about of this explosive that was described as having consistency of vaseline adhesive surface was protected by a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge inside of case was fitted with a number of rubber spikes that kept it clear of glued surface of grenade early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round neck of casing development continued but there were problems with service regulations that were not written with such an unconventional weapon in mind sticky bomb was inevitably rather fragile and even a specially designed box could not fully meet army s demanding requirements for withstanding rough handling without damage it seemed there were problems at every turn prime minister winston churchill who was concerned with state of country s anti tank defences learnt about grenade and urged its development ordnance board of war office did not approve grenade to be used by army however churchill ordered further tests to be conducted in july and after personally viewing a demonstration of grenade ordered that it immediately be put into production his memo of october 1940 simply read sticky bomb make one million a couple of days later anthony eden then secretary of state for war added a scribbled note to a cabinet minute that recorded order to go ahead with bomb in spite of top level pressure arguments rumbled on trials were disappointing it was not possible to get bomb to adhere to any surface that was wet or covered with even thinnest film of dried mud a customary condition of tanks as major general ismay on 27 june pointed out churchill was not amused macrae ismay and churchill all saw fit to record these arguments over technical issue of stickiness as eden had pointed out there was a lot at stake british infantry and home guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of molotov cocktails and sip grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke what was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grace by punching through armoured plate sticky bomb could do job and little else was available in his memoirs ismay recalled that he never solved puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of time to right people a thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface however bomb would stick if it was thrown onto top of a tank where plates were more or less horizontal and thinner but this reduced throwing range to twenty yards at most getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting churchill considered any obstruction however well meaning as singularly lacking in imagination in event of invasion he foresaw a desperate fight to last and after war he wrote about how he envisaged use of sticky bomb we had picture in mind that devoted soldiers or civilians would run close up to tank and even thrust bomb upon it though its explosion cost them their lives there were undoubtedly many who would have done it italics added for emphasis he also later recorded how he intended to use slogan you can always take one with you arguments rumbled on and there were endless delays early versions of sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport there were understandable concerns over explosive charge pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to slightest knock but mixture developed by ici proved to be very safe even if it should get into hinges of storage boxes by december 1940 fewer than 66 000 had been produced and rate of production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week further it was suggested that original order of one million be reduced to 200 000 minor improvements to design were made of which most significant was to replace glass flask with plastic finally after passing all required tests sticky bomb now no 74 grenade mk ii was accepted by ordnance board it was put into full scale production and it became a service issue on 14 may 1941 lieutenant general sir ian jacob reflected between 1940 and 1943 approximately 2 5 million were produced design thumb right sticky bomb diagram british explosive ordnance op 1665 naval ordnance systems command 1946 p 381 grenade hand anti tank no 74 consisted of a glass sphere in which was contained approximately of semi liquid nitroglycerin devised by ici sphere was covered in which was coated with a liberal amount of birdlime an extremely adhesive substance from which nickname sticky bomb was derived a casing made out of thin sheet metal and formed of two halves was then placed around sphere and held in place by a wooden handle inside which was a five second fuse handle also contained two pins and a lever first pin was pulled out to make casing fall away and second to activate firing mechanism in grenade this primed grenade with lever being held down to ensure fuse was not triggered then user would run up to tank and stick grenade to its hull using as much force as possible to break sphere and spread nitroglycerin onto hull in a thick paste another alternative was for user to throw it at tank from a distance either way lever would be released and fuse activated and grenade would then detonate grenade did possess several problems with its design users were urged to actually run up to tank and place it by hand rather than throw it thus adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in process user would then be placed in unenviable situation of attempting to pry grenade loose whilst still holding onto lever it was also discovered that as time passed nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable which made it even more difficult to use as grenade was a short range weapon users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until tank went past them and then to stick grenade to rear of tank where its armour was thinnest users were relatively safe from a few yards away as long as they were not in line with handle when it detonated mark ii design used a plastic casing instead of glass and a detonator instead of a cap operational use according to a war office training pamphlet dated 29 august 1940 sticky bomb should be regarded as a portable demolition device which can be quickly and easily applied it was reckoned to be effective against armour of up to thickness and was suitable for use against baby tanks armoured cars and vulnerable points on medium and heavy tanks safest and easiest application was simply to drop it from an upstairs window otherwise it could be used in an ambush of mobile tanks moving along a narrow road or in an attack on tanks parked up for night sticky bomb could be either thrown or slapped in place by hand in latter case advice was to use sufficient force to break glass thereby creating a greater area of contact resulting in a more effective explosion finally there was also option of placing bomb first and then pulling out pin at a safe distance by means of a length of string macrae credits australian army with developing technique of slapping a sticky bomb directly onto a tank instead of throwing it from a relatively safe distance since bomb used a blast effect it was safe to do this and walk away provided only that bomb s handle was pointing away from bomber handle would be shot away from explosion like a bullet macrae gives no date for development of this tactic macrae confirmed that placing bomb rather than throwing it gives better adhesion and allows thicker plates to be penetrated potential of sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected a good example being david niven s novel go slowly come back quickly unfortunate officer while attempting to demolish a smelly privy loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident sticky bomb also featured in british television comedy series dad s army in episode fallen idol lance corporal jack jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid by july 1941 215 000 sticky bombs had been produced of these nearly 90 000 had been sent abroad to north and south africa middle east and to greece where they did useful service remainder were stored at ordnance depots or distributed to army and home guard units grenade was first issued in 1940 to home guard units who appeared to have taken a liking to it despite its flaws although ordnance board had not approved grenade to be used by regular army units a quantity were provided for training purposes however a number of sticky bombs did find their way to british and commonwealth units participating in campaign in north africa and were used as anti tank weapons during afrika korps advance towards town of in february 1943 they accounted for six german tanks they were also issued to units of australian army who used them during battle of wau and battle of milne bay they were used by various allied units on anzio beachhead namely first special service force who obtained them from british a large number were also supplied to french resistance recognition in 1947 royal commission on awards to inventors considered claims from macrae and from managing director of kay brothers macrae s legal representative was edward terrell himself a wartime inventor at time crown opposed granting an award when macrae was asked what elements of sticky bomb he claimed to have invented he replied i am claiming no invention i merely claim development of bomb which was my job however in 1951 commission recommended that macrae should receive an ex gratia payment of ps500 and norwood received ps250 for his contribution users users of grenade included see also british anti invasion
