mental status examination or mental state examination mse is an important part of clinical assessment process in neurological and psychiatric practice it is a structured way of observing and describing a patient s psychological functioning at a given point in time under domains of appearance attitude behavior mood and affect speech thought process thought content perception cognition insight and judgment there are some minor variations in subdivision of mse and sequence and names of mse domains purpose of mse is to obtain a comprehensive cross sectional description of patient s mental state which when combined with biographical and historical information of psychiatric history allows clinician to make an accurate diagnosis and formulation which are required for coherent treatment planning data are collected through a combination of direct and indirect means unstructured observation while obtaining biographical and social information focused questions about current symptoms and formalised psychological tests trzepacz baker 1993 ch 1 mse is not to be confused with mini mental state examination which is a brief neuropsychological screening test for dementia thumb scream by edvard munch has been described as a representation of anxiety theoretical foundations mse derives from an approach to psychiatry known as descriptive 1995 ch 1 or descriptive phenomenology taylor f 1967 role of phenomenology in psychiatry british journal of psychiatry 113 765 770 which developed from work of philosopher and psychiatrist karl jaspers owen g and harland r 2007 editor s introduction theme issue on phenomenology and psychiatry for 21st century taking phenomenology seriously schizophrenia bulletin 33 1 pp 105 107 from jaspers perspective it was assumed that only way to comprehend a patient s experience is through his or her own description through an approach of empathic and non theoretical enquiry as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes analyst might understand experiences or processes of which patient is unaware such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives in practice mse is a blend of empathic descriptive phenomenology and empirical clinical observation it has been argued that term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry current usage as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient a synonym for signs and symptoms is incompatible with original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient s subjective experience berrios ge 1989 what is phenomenology journal of royal society of medicine 82 425 pj 1992 phenomenology and history of psychiatry australian and new zealand journal of psychiatry 26 4 532 45 application mental status examination is a core skill of qualified mental health personnel it is a key part of initial psychiatric assessment in an outpatient or psychiatric hospital setting it is a systematic collection of data based on observation of patient s behavior while patient is in clinician s view during interview purpose is to obtain evidence of symptoms and signs of mental disorders including danger to self and others that are present at time of interview further information on patient s insight judgment and capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and choice of an appropriate treatment setting it is carried out in manner of an informal enquiry using a combination of open and closed questions supplemented by structured tests to assess cognition mse can also be considered part of comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non mental health settings trzepacz baker 1993 preface information is usually recorded as free form text using standard headings but brief mse checklists are available for use in emergency situations for example by paramedics or emergency department staff kaufman dm zun l a 1995 a quantifiable brief mental status examination for emergency patients journal of emergency medicine jul aug 13 4 449 56 information obtained in mse is used together with biographical and social information of psychiatric history to generate a diagnosis a psychiatric formulation and a treatment plan domains appearance clinicians assess physical aspects such as appearance of a patient including apparent age height weight and manner of dress and grooming colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania while unkempt dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression if patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self care or ill health clothing and accessories of a particular subculture body modifications or clothing not typical of patient s gender might give clues to personality observations of physical appearance might include physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse such as signs of malnutrition nicotine stains dental erosion a rash around mouth from inhalant abuse or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self neglect or alcohol intoxication trzepacz baker 1993 p 13 19 weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder physical illness anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety gelder geddes 2005 attitude attitude also known as rapport or cooperation sims 1995 p 13 refers to patient s approach to interview process and quality of information obtained during assessment trzepacz baker 1993 p 19 21 behavior abnormalities of behavior also called abnormalities of activity trzepacz baker 1993 p 21 include observations of specific abnormal movements as well as more general observations of patient s level of activity and arousal and observations of patient s eye contact and gait abnormal movements for example or movements may indicate a neurological disorder a tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or side effects of antipsychotic medication patient may have tics involuntary but quasi purposeful movements or vocalizations which may be a symptom of tourette s syndrome there are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia such as catalepsy waxy flexibility and or holding against stereotypies repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging or mannerisms repetitive quasi purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism more global behavioural abnormalities may be noted such as an increase in arousal and movement described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity which might reflect mania or delirium an inability to sit still might represent akathisia a side effect of antipsychotic medication similarly a global decrease in arousal and movement described as psychomotor retardation or stupor might indicate depression or a medical condition such as parkinson s disease dementia or delirium examiner would also comment on eye movements repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that patient is experiencing hallucinations and quality of eye contact which can provide clues to patient s emotional state lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism hamilton 1985 p 92 1995 p baker 1993 p 21 38 mood and affect distinction between mood and affect in mse is subject to some disagreement for example trzepacz and baker 1993 trzepacz baker 1993 p 39 describe affect as external and dynamic manifestations of a person s internal emotional state and mood as a person s predominant internal state at any one time whereas sims 1995 sims 1995 p 222 refers to affect as differentiated specific feelings and mood as a more prolonged state or disposition this article will use trzepacz and baker 1993 definitions with mood regarded as a current subjective state as described by patient and affect as examiner s inferences of quality of patient s emotional state based on objective observation supported for example by mood is described using patient s own words and can also be described in summary terms such as neutral euphoric angry anxious or apathetic individuals may be unable to describe their subjective mood state an individual who is unable to experience any pleasure may be suffering from anhedonia thumb vincent van gogh s 1889 self portrait suggests artist s mood and affect in time leading up to his suicide affect is described by labelling apparent emotion conveyed by person s nonverbal behavior anxious sad etc and also by using parameters of appropriateness intensity range reactivity and mobility affect may be described as appropriate or inappropriate to current situation and as congruent or incongruent with their thought content for example someone who shows a bland affect when describing a very distressing experience would be described as showing incongruent affect which might suggest schizophrenia intensity of affect may be described as normal blunted affect exaggerated flat heightened or overly dramatic a flat or blunted affect is associated with schizophrenia depression or post traumatic stress disorder heightened affect might suggest mania and an overly dramatic or exaggerated affect might suggest certain personality disorders mobility refers to extent to which affect changes during interview affect may be described as fixed mobile immobile constricted restricted or labile person may show a full range of affect in other words a wide range of emotional expression during assessment or may be described as having restricted affect affect may also be described as reactive in other words changing flexibly and appropriately with flow of conversation or as unreactive a bland lack of concern for one s disability may be described as showing la belle indifference french beautiful indifference a feature of conversion disorder which is historically termed hysteria in older texts hamilton 1985 ch 1995 ch baker 1993 ch 3 speech patient s speech is assessed by observing patient s spontaneous speech and also by using structured tests of specific language functions this heading is concerned with production of speech rather than content of speech which is addressed under thought process and thought content see below when observing patient s spontaneous speech interviewer will note and comment on paralinguistic features such as loudness rhythm prosody intonation pitch phonation articulation quantity rate spontaneity and latency of speech a structured assessment of speech includes an assessment of expressive language by asking patient to name objects repeat short sentences or produce as many words as possible from a certain category in a set time simple language tests form part of mini mental state examination in practice structured assessment of receptive and expressive language is often reported under cognition see below see for example language assessment will allow recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia and specific language disorders such as stuttering or mutism people with autism spectrum disorders may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech echolalia repetition of another person s words and repetition of subject s own words can be heard with patients with autism schizophrenia or alzheimer s disease a person with schizophrenia might use neologisms which are made up words which have a specific meaning to person using them speech assessment also contributes to assessment of mood for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid loud and pressured speech on other hand depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow quiet and hesitant manner hamilton 1985 p 56 1995 ch baker 1993 ch 4 thought process thumb paintings of outsider artist adolf could be seen as a visual representation of formal thought disorder thought process in mse refers to quantity tempo rate of flow and form or logical coherence of thought thought process cannot be directly observed but can only be described by patient or inferred from a patient s speech form of thought is captured in this category one should describe thought from as thought directed a b normal vs formal thought disorders a pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder and might be described more specifically as thought blocking fusion loosening of associations tangential thinking derailment of thought or knight s move thinking thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions but remains focused on broad topic regarding tempo of thought some people may experience flight of ideas a manic symptom when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent although in flight of ideas a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic syllabic rhyming associations in patient s speech i e i love to eat peaches beach beaches sand castles fall in waves braves are going to finals fee fi fo fum golden egg alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations poverty of thought is a global reduction in quantity of thought and one of negative symptoms of schizophrenia it can also be a feature of severe depression or dementia a patient with dementia might also experience thought perseveration thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to same limited set of ideas circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders hamilton 1985 ch 1995 ch baker 1993 p 83 91 thought content a description of thought content would be largest section of mse report it would describe a patient s suicidal thoughts depressed cognition delusions overvalued ideas obsessions phobias and preoccupations one should separate thought content into pathological thought versus non pathological thought importantly one should specify suicidal thoughts as either intrusive unwanted and not able to translate in capacity to act on these thoughts mens rea versus suicidal thoughts that may lead to act of suicide actus reus abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals thoughts in an open ended conversational manner with regard to their intensity salience emotions associated with thoughts extent to which thoughts are experienced as one s own and under one s control and degree of belief or conviction associated with thoughts hamilton 1985 p 41 baker p 91 1995 p 118 125 delusions a delusion has three essential qualities it can be defined as a false unshakeable idea or belief 1 which is out of keeping with patient s educational cultural and social background 2 held with extraordinary conviction and subjective certainty 3 sims 1995 p 82 and is a core feature of psychotic disorders for instance an alliance to a particular political party or sports team would not be considered a delusion in some societies patient s delusions may be described within segue pm mnemonic as somatic delusions grandiose delusions unspecified delusions envious delusions c f delusional jealousy or paranoid delusions or multifactorial delusions there are several other forms of delusions these include descriptions such as delusions of reference or delusional misidentification or delusional memories i e i was a goat last year among others delusions should be reported as primary coming from no particular source secondary sourced from another delusion or hallucinations tertiary sourced from a secondary delusion or a delusional system a network of associated delusions delusional symptoms can be reported as on a continuum from full symptoms with no insight partial symptoms where they may start questioning these delusions nil symptoms where symptoms are resolved or after complete treatment there are still delusional symptoms or ideas that could develop into delusions you can characterize this as residual symptoms delusions can suggest several diseases such as schizophrenia disorder a brief psychotic episode mania depression with psychotic features or delusional disorders one can differentiate delusional disorders from schizophrenia for example by age of onset for delusional disorders being older with a more complete and unaffected personality where delusion may only partially impact their life and be fairly encapsulated off from rest of their formed personality i e believing that a spider lives in their hair but this belief not affecting their work relationships or education whereas schizophrenia typically arises earlier in life with a disintegration of personality and a failure to cope with work relationships or education other features differentiate diseases with delusions as well delusions may be described as mood congruent delusional content in keeping with mood typical of manic or depressive psychosis or mood incongruent delusional content not in keeping with mood which are more typical of schizophrenia delusions of control or passivity experiences in which individual has experience of mind or body being under influence or control of some kind of external force or agency are typical of schizophrenia examples of this include experiences of thought withdrawal thought insertion thought broadcasting and somatic passivity schneiderian first rank symptoms are a set of delusions and hallucinations which have been said to be highly suggestive of a diagnosis of schizophrenia delusions of guilt delusions of poverty and nihilistic delusions belief that one has no mind or is already dead are typical of depressive psychoses overvalued ideas an overvalued idea is an emotionally charged belief that may be held with sufficient conviction to make believer emotionally charged or aggressive but that fails to possess all three characteristics of delusion most importantly incongruity with cultural norms therefore any strong fixed false but culturally normative belief can be considered an overvalued idea hypochondriasis is an overvalued idea that one is suffering from an illness that a part of one s body is abnormal and anorexia nervosa that one is overweight or fat obsessions an obsession is an undesired unpleasant intrusive thought that cannot be suppressed through patient s volition trzepacz baker p 101 but unlike passivity experiences described above they are not experienced as imposed from outside patient s mind obsessions are typically intrusive thoughts of violence injury dirt or sex or obsessive ruminations on intellectual themes a person can also describe obsessional doubt with intrusive worries about whether they have made wrong decision or forgotten to do something for example turn off gas or lock house in obsessive compulsive disorder individual experiences obsessions with or without compulsions a sense of having to carry out certain ritualized and senseless actions against their wishes phobias a phobia is a dread of an object or situation that does not in reality pose any threat trzepacz baker p 103 and is distinct from a delusion in that patient is aware that fear is irrational a phobia is usually highly specific to certain situations and will usually be reported by patient rather than being observed by clinician in assessment interview preoccupations preoccupations are thoughts which are not fixed false or intrusive but have an undue prominence in person s mind clinically significant preoccupations would include thoughts of suicide homicidal thoughts suspicious or fearful beliefs associated with certain personality disorders depressive beliefs for example that one is unloved or a failure or cognitive distortions of anxiety and depression suicidal thoughts mse contributes to clinical risk assessment by including a thorough exploration of any suicidal or hostile thought content assessment of suicide risk includes detailed questioning about nature of person s suicidal thoughts belief about death reasons for living and whether person has made any specific plans to end his or her life most important questions to ask are do you have suicidal feeling now have you ever attempted suicide highly correlated with future suicide attempts do you have plans to commit suicide in future and do you have any deadlines where you may commit suicide i e numerology calculation doomsday belief mother s day anniversary christmas perceptions a perception in this context is any sensory experience and three broad types of perceptual disturbance are hallucinations pseudohallucinations and illusions a hallucination is defined as a sensory perception in absence of any external stimulus and is experienced in external or objective space i e experienced by subject as real an illusion is defined as a false sensory perception in presence of an external stimulus in other words a distortion of a sensory experience and may be recognized as such by subject a is experienced in internal or subjective space for example as voices in my head and is regarded as akin to fantasy other sensory abnormalities include a distortion of patient s sense of time for example deja vu or a distortion of sense of self depersonalization or sense of reality derealization hallucinations can occur in any of five senses although auditory and visual hallucinations are encountered more frequently than tactile touch olfactory smell or gustatory taste hallucinations auditory hallucinations are typical of psychoses third person hallucinations i e voices talking about patient and hearing one s thoughts spoken aloud or echo de la are among schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia whereas second person hallucinations voices talking to patient threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy drug intoxication or drug withdrawal many of visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations as they are distortions of sensory experiences and are not experienced as existing in objective reality auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders deja vu derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders sims 1995 ch baker 1993 p 106 120 cognition this section of mse covers patient s level of alertness orientation attention memory visuospatial functioning language functions and executive functions unlike other sections of mse use is made of structured tests in addition to unstructured observation alertness is a global observation of level of consciousness i e awareness of and responsiveness to environment and this might be described as alert clouded drowsy or stuporous orientation is assessed by asking patient where he or she is for example what building town and state and what time it is time day date attention and concentration are assessed by several tests commonly serial sevens test subtracting 7 from 100 and subtracting 7 from difference 5 times alternatively spelling a five letter word backwards saying months or days of week in reverse order serial threes subtract three from twenty five times and by testing digit span memory is assessed in terms of immediate registration repeating a set of words short term memory recalling set of words after an interval or recalling a short paragraph and long term memory recollection of well known historical or geographical facts visuospatial functioning can be assessed by ability to copy a diagram draw a clock face or draw a map of consulting room language is assessed through ability to name objects repeat phrases and by observing individual s spontaneous speech and response to instructions executive functioning can be screened for by asking similarities questions what do x and y have in common and by means of a verbal fluency task e g list as many words as you can starting with letter f in one minute mini mental state examination is a simple structured cognitive assessment which is in widespread use as a component of mse mild impairment of attention and concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and including psychotic states but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium dementia or intoxication specific language abnormalities may be associated with pathology in wernicke s area or broca s area of brain in korsakoff s syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions visuospatial or constructional abnormalities here may be associated with parietal lobe pathology and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate frontal lobe pathology this kind of brief cognitive testing is regarded as a screening process only and any abnormalities are more carefully assessed using formal neuropsychological testing trzepacz baker 1993 ch 6 mse may include a brief neuropsychiatric examination in some situations frontal lobe pathology is suggested if person cannot repetitively execute a motor sequence e g paper scissors stone posterior columns are assessed by person s ability to feel vibrations of a tuning fork on wrists and ankles parietal lobe can be assessed by person s ability to identify objects by touch alone and with eyes closed a cerebellar disorder may be present if person cannot stand with arms extended feet touching and eyes closed without swaying romberg s sign if there is a tremor when person reaches for an object or if he or she is unable to touch a fixed point close eyes and touch same point again pathology in basal ganglia may be indicated by rigidity and resistance to movement of limbs and by presence of characteristic involuntary movements a lesion in posterior fossa can be detected by asking patient to roll his or her eyes upwards s syndrome focal neurological signs such as these might reflect effects of some prescribed psychiatric medications chronic drug or alcohol use head

characteristic of psychosis and dementia and is an important consideration in treatment planning and in assessing capacity to consent to treatment trzepacz baker 1993 p 167 171 judgment judgment refers to patient s capacity to make sound reasoned and responsible decisions one should frame judgement to functions or domains that are normal vs impaired i e poor judgement is isolated to petty theft able to function in relationships work academics traditionally mse included use of standard hypothetical questions such as what would you do if you found a stamped addressed envelope lying in street however contemporary practice is to inquire about how patient has responded or would respond to real life challenges and contingencies assessment would take into account individual s executive system capacity in terms of impulsiveness social cognition self awareness and planning ability impaired judgment is not specific to any diagnosis but may be a prominent feature of disorders affecting frontal lobe of brain if a person s judgment is impaired due to mental illness there might be implications for person s safety or safety of others trzepacz baker 1993 ch 7 cultural considerations there are potential problems when mse is applied in a cross cultural context when clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds for example patient s culture might have different norms for appearance behavior and display of emotions culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs need to be distinguished from delusions and hallucinations these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots cognitive assessment must also take patient s language and educational background into account clinician s racial bias is another potential d k 1997 cross cultural psychiatric assessment advances in psychiatric treatment 3 103 110 children there are particular challenges in carrying out an mse with young children and others with limited language such as people with intellectual impairment examiner would explore and clarify individual s use of words to describe mood thought content or perceptions as words may be used with a different meaning from that assumed by examiner in this group tools such as play materials puppets art materials or diagrams for instance with multiple choices of facial expressions depicting emotions may be used to facilitate
