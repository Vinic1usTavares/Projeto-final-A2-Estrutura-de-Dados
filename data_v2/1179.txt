director david lynch had previously studied for a career as an artist and he had created several short films to animate his paintings by 1970 however he had switched his focus to film making and at age of 24 he accepted a scholarship at american film institute s center for advanced film studies lynch disliked course and considered dropping out but after being offered chance to produce a script of his own devising he changed his mind he was given permission to use school s entire campus for film sets he converted school s disused stables into a series of sets and lived there in addition greystone mansion also owned by afi was used for many scenes lynch had initially begun work on a script titled gardenback based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back gardenback was a surrealist script about adultery which featured a continually growing insect representing one man s lust for his neighbor script would have resulted in a roughly 45 minute long film which afi felt was too long for such a figurative nonlinear script in its place lynch presented eraserhead which he had developed based on a daydream of a man s head being taken to a pencil factory by a small boy several board members at afi were still opposed to producing such a surrealist work but they acquiesced when dean frank daniel threatened to resign if it were to be vetoed lynch s script for eraserhead was influenced by his reading as a film student franz kafka s 1915 novella metamorphosis and nikolai gogol s 1836 short story nose were strong influences on screenplay lynch also confirmed in an interview with metro silicon valley that film came together when he opened up a bible read one verse from it and shut it in retrospect lynch could not remember if verse was from old testament or new testament in 2007 lynch said believe it or not eraserhead is my most spiritual film script is also thought to have been inspired by lynch s fear of fatherhood his daughter jennifer had been born with severely clubbed feet requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were basis for film s themes film s tone was also shaped by lynch s time living in a troubled neighborhood in philadelphia lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of violence hate and filth area was rife with crime inspiring bleak urban backdrop of eraserhead describing this period of his life lynch said i saw so many things in philadelphia i couldn t believe i saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby complaining her nipples hurt this kind of thing will set you back in his book david lynch beautiful dark film critic greg olson posits that this time contrasted starkly with director s childhood in pacific northwest giving director a bipolar heaven and hell vision of america which has subsequently shaped his films initial casting for film began in 1971 and jack nance was quickly selected for lead role however staff at afi had underestimated project s scale they had initially green lit eraserhead after viewing a twenty one page screenplay assuming that film industry s usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would reduce film to approximately twenty minutes this misunderstanding coupled with lynch s own meticulous direction caused film to remain in production for a number of years in an extreme example of this labored schedule one scene in film begins with nance s character opening a door a full year passed before he was filmed entering room nance however was dedicated to producing film and retained unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for entirety of its gestation filming buoyed with regular donations from lynch s childhood friend jack fisk and fisk s wife sissy spacek production continued for several years additional funds were provided by nance s wife catherine e coulson who worked as a waitress and donated her income and by lynch himself who delivered newspapers throughout film s principal photography during one of many lulls in filming lynch was able to produce short film amputee taking advantage of afi s wish to test new film stock before committing to bulk purchases short piece starred coulson who continued working with lynch as a technician on eraserhead eraserhead production crew was very small composed of lynch sound designer alan splet cinematographer herb cardwell who left production for financial reasons and was replaced with frederick elmes production manager and prop technician doreen small and coulson who worked in a variety of roles thumb left alt a screenshot of film showing bizarre animal like infant it has been speculated that lynch used a rabbit to create spencer s alien like baby physical effects used to create deformed child have been kept secret projectionist who worked on film s dailies was blindfolded by lynch to avoid revealing prop s nature and he has refused to discuss effects in subsequent interviews prop which nance nicknamed spike featured several working parts its neck eyes and mouth were capable of independent operation lynch has offered cryptic comments on prop at times stating that it was born nearby or maybe it was found it has been speculated by guardian john patterson that prop may have been constructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb fetus child has been seen as a precursor to elements of other lynch films such as john merrick s make up in 1980 s elephant man and sandworms of 1984 s dune during production lynch began experimenting with a technique of recording dialogue that had been spoken phonetically backwards and reversing resulting audio although technique was not used in film lynch returned to it for episode 2 third episode of his 1990 television series twin peaks lynch also began his interest in transcendental meditation during film s production adopting a vegetarian diet and giving up smoking and alcohol consumption post production lynch worked with alan splet to design film s sound pair arranged and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio where they spent almost a year creating and editing film s sound effects soundtrack is densely layered including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels sounds were created in a variety of ways for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid lynch and splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle floated it in a bathtub and recorded sound of air blown through bottle after being recorded sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch reverb and frequency after a poorly received test screening in which lynch believes he had mixed soundtrack at too high a volume director cut twenty minutes of footage from film bringing its length to 89 minutes among cut footage is a scene featuring coulson as infant s midwife another of a man torturing two women one again played by coulson with a car battery and one of spencer toying with a dead cat soundtrack soundtrack to eraserhead was released by i r s records in 1982 two tracks included on album feature excerpts of organ music by fats waller and song in heaven written for film by peter ivers soundtrack was re released on august 7 2012 by sacred bones records in a limited pressing of 1 500 copies album has been seen as presaging dark ambient music genre and its presentation of background noise and non musical cues has been described by pitchfork media s mark richardson as a sound track two words in literal sense themes and analysis eraserhead sound design has been considered one of its defining elements although film features several hallmark visuals deformed infant and sprawling industrial setting these are matched by their accompanying sounds as incessant mewling and evocative aural landscape are paired with these respectively film features several constant industrial sounds providing low level background noise in every scene this fosters a threatening and unnerving atmosphere which has been imitated in works such as david fincher s 1995 thriller seven and coen brothers 1991 drama barton fink constant low level noise has been perceived by james wierzbicki in his book music sound and filmmakers sonic style in cinema as perhaps a product of henry spencer s imagination and soundtrack has been described as ruthlessly negligent of difference between dream and reality film also begins a trend within lynch s work of relating diegetic music to dreams as when lady in radiator sings in heaven during spencer s extended dream sequence this is also present in episode 2 of twin peaks in which diegetic music carries over from a character s dream to his waking thoughts and in 1986 s blue velvet in which a similar focus is given to roy orbison s in dreams film has also been noted for its strong sexual themes opening with an image of conception film then portrays henry spencer as a character who is terrified of but fascinated by sex recurring images of sperm like creatures including child are a constant presence during film s sex scenes apparent girl next door appeal of lady in radiator is abandoned during her musical number as she begins to violently smash spencer s sperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze in his book monster show a cultural history of horror david j skal describes film as depict ing human reproduction as a desolate freak show an occupation fit only for damned skal also posits a different characterization of lady in radiator casting her as desperately eager for an unseen audience s approval in his book david lynch decoded mark allyn stewart proposes that lady in radiator is in fact spencer s subconscious a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child who embraces him after he does so as if to reassure him that he has done right as a character spencer has been seen as an everyman figure his blank expression and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout film simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control this passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at film s climax his apparent act of infanticide is driven by domineering and controlling influences that beset him spencer s passivity has also been seen by film critics colin odell and michelle le blanc as a precursor to lynch s 1983 92 comic strip angriest dog in world release box office eraserhead premiered at filmex film festival in los angeles on march 19 1977 on

eraserhead release variety offered a negative review calling it a sickening bad taste exercise review expressed incredulity over film s long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable comparing eraserhead to lynch s next film elephant man tom buckley of new york times felt that while latter was a well made film with an accomplished cast former was not buckley called eraserhead pretentious and felt that film s horror aspects stemmed solely from appearance of deformed child rather than from its script or performances writing in 1984 lloyd rose of atlantic felt that eraserhead demonstrated that lynch was one of most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in movies rose described film as being intensely personal finding that unlike previous surrealist films such as luis bunuel s 1929 work un chien andalou or 1930 s l age d or lynch s imagery isn t reaching out to us from his films we re sinking into them in a 1993 review for chicago tribune michael wilmington described eraserhead as unique feeling that film s intensity and nightmare clarity were a result of lynch s attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production in 1995 essay bad ideas art and politics of twin peaks critic jonathan rosenbaum felt that eraserhead represented lynch s best work rosenbaum felt that director s artistic talent declined as his popularity grew and contrasted film with wild at heart lynch s most recent feature film at that time saying even most cursory comparison of eraserhead with wild at heart reveals an artistic decline so

haflidason awarded eraserhead three stars out of five describing it as an unremarkable feat by lynch s later standards haflidason felt that film was a gathering of loosely related ideas adding that it is so consumed with surreal imagery that there are almost limitless possibilities to read personal theories into it reviewer s own take on these themes were that they represented a fear of personal commitment and featured a strong sexual undercurrent a reviewer writing for film4 rated eraserhead five stars out of five describing it as by turns beautiful annoying funny exasperating and repellent but always bristling with a nervous energy film4 reviewer felt that eraserhead was unlike most films released to that point save for collaborations between luis bunuel and salvador dali however lynch denies having seen any of these before eraserhead writing for village voice nathan lee praised film s use of sound writing to see film means nothing one must also hear it he described film s sound design as an intergalactic seashell cocked to ears of an acid tripping gargantua guardian peter bradshaw similarly lauded film also awarding it five stars out of five bradshaw considered it to be a beautiful film describing its sound design as industrial groaning as if filmed inside some collapsing factory or gigantic dying organism he highlighted film s body horror elements comparing it to ridley scott s 1979 film alien jason ankeny writing for allrovi also gave film a rating of five stars out of five he highlighted disturbing sound design of film and described it as an open metaphor he felt that eraserhead sets up obsessions that would follow lynch through his career adding his belief that film s surrealism enhanced understanding of director s later films in an article for daily telegraph film maker marc evans praised both sound design and lynch s ability to make ordinary seem so odd considering film an inspiration on his own work a review of film in same newspaper compared eraserhead to works of irish playwright samuel beckett describing it as a chaotic parody of family life manohla dargis writing for new york times called film less a straight story than a surrealistic assemblage dargis felt that film s imagery evoked paintings of francis bacon and georges franju 1949 documentary blood of beasts film threat phil hall called eraserhead lynch s best film believing
