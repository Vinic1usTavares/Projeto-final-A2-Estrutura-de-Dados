diverse vedder explained we d rather challenge our fans and make them listen to our songs than give them something that s easy to digest there is a lot of music out there that is very easy to digest but we never wanted to be part of it as described by critic jon pareles on his review for rolling stone pearl jam distances itself from grunge that made them famous and delve s elsewhere jumpy post punk and somber meditations tightly wound folk rock and turbulent rockers that sound like they boiled out of jam sessions a few songs on album show classic rock influences intro to opening track breakerfall uses a guitar riff similar to who song i can see for miles from 1967 album who sell out additionally soon forget which features vedder playing a ukulele is heavily influenced by who song blue red and grey from 1975 album who by numbers with vedder describing it as 30 seconds of plagiarising and thanking pete townshend on lyric sheet song nothing as it seems has been compared to style

album yield with gossard describing lyrics as pretty somber vedder addressed social criticism contained in album s lyrics by stating i think what everyone s looking for y know is freedom that s part of being comfortable in your own skin i know i had a problem with being told what to do and had a problem with being mentally and physically constricted all of humanity is searching for freedom and i think it s important to know when you have it too ament stated that gods dice is about judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in god or not and that nothing as it seems is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of northern montana vedder called evacuation a song about change and stated in an interview that moral of insignificance is ineffectiveness of

space telescope photos of helix nebula and eagle nebula are also featured in inside cover and liner notes for this album respectively photos were used with permission of nasa regarding artwork ament said reason that we went with tchad blake is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs so i think we wanted artwork to represent that one of themes that we ve been exploring is just realizing that in big scheme of things even music that we make when we come together no matter how powerful it is it s still pretty minuscule i think for me whole space theme has a lot to do with scale you know you look at some of those pictures and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture album s title is a reference to binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks binaural literally means having or relating to two ears regarding choice of title gossard said when we looked up word binaural it meant to listen with both ears so it seemed like a fitting title for
