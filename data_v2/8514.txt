s cliff hanger two cathedrals left off and what was then only implicit is here made clear president bartlet is running for a second term when asked if he plans to seek re election he answers yeah and i m gonna win from that point on story develops in dual storylines one following immediately upon press conference other taking place four weeks later as staff is preparing for official campaign announcement in manchester new hampshire leo decides to bring in bruno gianelli silver a highly accomplished political consultant to help with re election campaign but conflict soon arises between gianelli s and bartlet s respective staffs conflict is particularly intense between idealistic communications director toby and more pragmatic doug handler a problem appears when it becomes clear that ru 486 an emergency contraception will receive government approval on same day as announcement ceremony this will not only take attention away from event but also give political ammunition to right and raise questions about professionalism of campaign josh strongly wants to wave off fda on release and it later appears that his underlying motive for this is to rectify a previous mistake in early part of story he applied pressure to pass a bill on anti tobacco measures but gianelli points out error in passing a bill that could have given them political leverage against republicans in upcoming election in ongoing conflict in haiti a rescue mission is staged to save american citizens bartlet decides to send in peacekeeping troops in spite of political consequences cj then when announcing decision to press makes a grave mistake by saying that she thinks president s relieved to be focusing on something that matters implying both that ms incident was unimportant and that president was happy to use an incident in which american lives are at risk to deflect attention away from his illness leo responds by sitting her out for next press briefing and she reacts by offering her resignation yet she is eventually persuaded to stay by president s heartfelt assurance that he considers her a vital member of administration bartlet s wife abbey is not pleased with president making his bid for re election without consulting her later on she still decides to join him in manchester she tells him that he needs to reach out to his staff some of whom believe that he should make a public apology for concealing his ms in end he makes apology not publicly but privately to his nearest advisors he assures them that even though gianelli s help is much needed they will still run a campaign that does not shrink from handling controversial issues in a final speech he tells them that we re gonna write a new book right here right now production and cultural references scenes
