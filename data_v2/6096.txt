short story linked by use of a group of people who appear in each story after spending time in bardo group or jati are reincarnated into different times and places while characters in each story are unique they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked for convenience by first letter of their name characters whose names begin with letter k are combative imprudent and prone to getting himself or herself killed and striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering b characters are more comfortable in world and optimistic and survivors nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently waiting for something better i characters are ones who care who follow other two and may be necessary if their works are to flourish but who tend to domestic and always find world worth loving style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect style of writing associated with culture being depicted for example first chapter is written similarly to monkey s journey to west and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism also later chapters take on metafictional elements with characters discussing nature of history whether it is cyclical or linear whether they believe in reincarnation and feelings that some people are intrinsically linked robinson incorporated utopian themes in his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether years of rice and salt qualified as a utopian story those that did call world described in story as utopian cited story s illustration of progress however those that wrote years of rice and salt was not a utopian story say that world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than real history just different robinson calls himself a utopian novelist in that he claims all science fiction has a utopian element in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences several other themes were identified by reviewers robinson had previously used theme of memory or identity and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in bardo but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth reviewer in globe and mail identified feminism and struggles over nature of islam as recurring themes alternate history years of rice and salt belongs to alternate history subgenre of speculative fiction novel starts at point of divergence with timur turning his army away from europe where black death killed 99 of europe s population instead of a third robinson explores world history from that point in ad 1405 807 ah to about ad 2045 1467 ah with mughal emperor akbar being last character with a real world counterpart robinson s take on alternate history is that because it is set in same lawful universe as ours its science must be same and because its people have same basic human needs their societies resemble ours therefore despite difference in who specifically is there great majority of humanity is doing their work and that work would tend to forge along at a certain pace as people tried to solve problems of making themselves more comfortable in this world while most alternate histories use great man theory of history focusing on leaders wars and big events robinson writes more about social history similar to annales school of historical theory and marxist historiography focusing on lives of ordinary people living in their time and place this is reflected in title of novel years of rice and salt which refers to everyday chores of raising a family often performed by women despite politics and wars of men reviewers noted this allows for history to be experienced by readers on a human scale and an implicit but thorough rebuke to kind of war gaming determinism that most alternate histories embody novel has characters that explore subjects like philosophy theology history and scientific theory publication and

overlong but blessed with moments of wry and gentle beauty likewise roz kaveney stated that if there is a weakness in robinson s work it is perhaps this his characters are so intelligent that they
