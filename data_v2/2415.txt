likely lloyd lonergan he was an experienced newspaperman employed by new york evening world while writing scripts for thanhouser productions film director is unknown but it may have been barry o neil or lucius j henderson sometimes directional credit is given to theodore marston apparent origin of this error is from american film index 1908 1915 film historian q david bowers consulted one of co authors of book gunnar lundquist and confirmed that credit of marston was in error theodore marston worked with pathe kinemacolor vitagraph and other companies but there is no record of marston working with thanhouser this error has persisted in several works including complete index to literary sources in film cameramen employed by company during this era included blair smith carl louis gregory and alfred h moses jr though none are specifically credited role of cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions cast credits are unknown but many 1910 thanhouser productions are fragmentary in late 1910 thanhouser company released a list of important personalities in their films list includes g w abbe justus d barnes frank h crane irene crane marie eline violet heming martin j faust thomas fortune george middleton grace moore john w noble anna rosemond mrs george walters musical accompaniment for silent films were not provided by studios and thanhouser productions were no exception musical program for screenings were decided and played by individual at times musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals but for looking forward a dispute serves to provide one musical credit provided by mrs buttery of pennsylvania in responding to an editorial in moving picture world mrs buttery stated that john took me home to see his mother was played during film at some unstated point release and reception single reel comedy approximately 1 000 feet long was released on december 20 1910 new york dramatic mirror stated here is a rather exaggerated farce with a good many laughs in it it has for its basis recent cartoons but has original treatment male members of cast seemed to enjoy their roles perhaps for reason that it is a man s picture laugh seems on ladies a more contemporary analysis of film was covered in a paper by eric dewberry who credits this film as thanhouser s first film portraying suffragists dewberry writes that film presents idea of a woman mayor something which was not farfetched for women to find to be humorous despite jack s lack of power in new era which he awakes to he managed to win heart of a powerful woman and easily restore rights of men taken one way film seems to advance idea that a women of power are controlled by their hearts dewing writes on one hand it mocks many female suffrage fighting tactics as suffragists in an attempt to not appear too extremist and exploited conservative ideas of feminine virtue in order to assert their citizenship and reform desires in film man assumes effeminate passions to woo mayor on other hand those sympathetic to cause can see this as proof that these tactics can work in politics film also toys with fears men harbored concerning loss of power over females in public spaces a threat to masculinity and manhood film is also believed to have been first adaptation of curwood s work see also list of american films of 1910 notes references category 1910 films category 1910s
