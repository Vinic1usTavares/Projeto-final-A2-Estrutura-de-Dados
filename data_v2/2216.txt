pearl fishers is an opera in three acts by french composer georges bizet to a libretto by eugene cormon and michel carre it was premiered on 30 september 1863 at theatre lyrique in paris and was given 18 performances in its initial run set in ancient times on island of ceylon sri lanka opera tells story of how two men s vow of eternal friendship is threatened by their love for same woman whose own dilemma is conflict between secular love and her sacred oath as a priestess friendship duet generally known as pearl fishers duet is one of best known in western opera at time of premiere bizet born on 25 october 1838 was not yet 25 years old he had yet to establish himself in parisian musical world commission to write arose from his standing as a former winner of prestigious prix de rome despite a good reception by public press reactions to work were generally hostile and dismissive although other composers notably hector berlioz found considerable merit in music opera was not revived in bizet s lifetime but from 1886 onwards it was performed with some regularity in europe and north america and from mid 20th century has entered repertory of opera houses worldwide because autograph score was lost post 1886 productions were based on amended versions of score that contained significant departures from original since 1970s efforts have been made to reconstruct score in accordance with bizet s intentions modern critical opinion has been kinder than that of bizet s day commentators describe quality of music as uneven and at times unoriginal but acknowledge opera as a work of promise in which bizet s gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident they have identified clear foreshadowings of composer s genius which would culminate 10 years later in

in 1856 when 18 year old composer was a student at conservatoire de paris it was bizet s winning entry in a competition organised by celebrated composer jacques offenbach and gained him a cash award a gold medal and a performance of prize work at theatre des bouffes dean 1965 pp 9 10 in 1857 bizet was awarded prestigious prix de rome and as a result spent most of following three years in italy where he wrote don procopio a short opera buffa in style of donizetti dean 1965 p 20 by this time bizet had written several non stage works including his symphony in c but poor reception accorded to his 1858 a religious work he composed in rome helped convince him that his future lay primarily with musical theatre curtiss pp 68 71 he planned and possibly began several operatic works before his return to paris in 1860 but none of these projects came to fruition dean 1965 pp 260 61 in paris bizet discovered difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers trying to get their operas performed of capital s two state subsidised opera houses opera and opera comique former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers particularly rossini and meyerbeer were dominant even established french composers such as gounod had difficulty getting works performed there steen p 1965 pp 36 39 at opera comique innovation was equally rare although more french works were performed style and character of most productions had hardly changed since 1830s however one condition of opera comique s state funding was that from time to time it should produce one act works by former prix de rome laureates under this provision bizet wrote la guzla de l emir with a libretto by jules barbier and michel carre and this went into rehearsal early in 1862 dean 1965 pp 47 48 in april 1862 as rehearsals proceeded bizet was approached by leon carvalho manager of independent theatre lyrique company carvalho had been offered an annual grant of 100 000 francs by retiring minister of fine arts count walewski on condition that each year he stage a new three act opera from a recent prix de rome winner carvalho had a high opinion of bizet s abilities and offered him libretto of les pecheurs de perles an exotic story by carre and eugene cormon set on island of ceylon now sri lanka sensing opportunity for a genuine theatrical success bizet accepted commission because walewski restricted his grant to composers who had not had any previous work performed commercially bizet hurriedly withdrew la guzla from opera comique it has never been performed and music has disappeared

libretto with eugene cormon libretto was written by eugene cormon and michel carre cormon was a prolific author of libretti and straight drama usually in collaboration with other writers in his career he wrote or co wrote at least 135 works of which set to music by aime maillart was perhaps most successful carre who had initially trained as a painter had worked with jules barbier on gounod s opera faust and had co written play which became basis of libretto for offenbach s opera tales of hoffmann before cormon and carre had previously written a libretto for maillart on a similar theme which had been performed in 1860 they had originally planned to set their new story in mexico before changing its location to ceylon by general critical consent libretto of is a work of poor quality weak plot as bizet s biographer winton dean observes turns on unlikely coincidence regarding leila s necklace and no real effort is made in text to bring any of characters to life they are regulation sopranos tenors etc with their faces blacked dean 1965 pp 170 71 mina curtiss in her book on bizet dismisses text as banal and imitative donal henahan of new york times writing in 1986 said that libretto rank ed right down there with most appallingly inept of its kind writers themselves admitted its shortcomings cormon commented later that had they been aware of bizet s quality as a composer they would have tried harder carre was worried about weak ending and constantly sought suggestions for changing it curtiss records that in exasperation theatre manager carvalho suggested that carre burn libretto this facetious remark curtiss asserts led carre to end opera with fishermen s tents ablaze as leila and nadir make their escape curtiss p 135 because he did not receive carvalho s commission until april 1863 with projected opening night set for mid september bizet composed quickly with curtiss says a tenacity and concentration quite foreign to him in his roman days curtiss p 133 he had some music available on which he could draw through previous winter he had worked on score of an opera ivan iv with promise which fell through that work would be staged in baden baden ivan iv provided music for three numbers in les pecheurs de perles prelude part of zurga s une fille inconnue and third act duet o lumiere sainte brahma divin brahma chorus was adapted from rejected te deum and chorus ah chante chante encore from don procopio lacombe herve p 312 it is also likely that music composed for cancelled la guzla de l emir found its way into new opera s score which was completed by early

audience s appreciation was not reflected in majority of press reviews which generally castigated both work and what they considered bizet s lack of modesty in appearing on stage gustave bertrand in le menestrel wrote that this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success and even then we prefer to have composer dragged on in spite of himself or at least pretending to be

neither fishermen in libretto nor pearls in music he considered that on every page score displayed bias of school to which bizet belongs that of richard wagner bertrand compared work unfavourably with

opera was superior to anything that established french opera composers of day such as auber and thomas were capable of producing in its initial run ran for 18 performances alternating with mozart s marriage of figaro it closed on 23 november 1863 and although it brought theatre little financial success bizet had won admiration from his peers carvalho was satisfied enough to ask bizet to quickly finish ivan iv with a view to its early production at theatre lyrique this idea eventually came to nothing ivan iv remained unperformed until 1946 early revivals after its opening run was not performed again until 11 years after bizet s death when on 20 march 1886 it was presented in italian at la scala milan after this it received regular stagings in european cities often with italian version of libretto these revivals which possibly reflected growing success of carmen were followed by publication of several versions of music that incorporated significant differences from bizet s original in particular finale was altered to provide a more dramatic ending a grand holocaust according to dean dean 1965 pp 288 89 this revised conclusion included a trio composed by benjamin godard

orchestral prelude principal theme of which prefigures leila s entrance opening chorus is punctuated by a lively dance critic john w klein describes it as electrifying nadir s first significant contribution is his aria sung to an accompaniment of cellos and bassoons under a string tremolo that indicates possible influence of meyerbeer flutes and harps are used to introduce main theme of celebrated pearl fishers duet in what opera historian herve lacombe identifies as most highly developed poetic scene in opera lacombe pp 175 78 duet s theme has become opera s principal musical signature repeated in work whenever issue of men s friendship arises though in dean s view tune is not worthy of weight it carries dean suggests that bizet s ability to find appropriate musical phrase with style and economy is better demonstrated in his treatment of leila s oath of chastity where a simple phrase is repeated twice in minor third steps dean 1965 pp 175 77 nadir s aria je crois entendre encore towards end of act 1 is written on a rhythm with a dominant cor anglais whereby says lacombe t he listener has impression that horn is singing in act 2 a short orchestral introduction is followed by an off stage chorus notable for its sparse accompaniment a tambourine and two piccolos after nourabad reminds leila of her oath and leaves her alone she sings her cavatina two french horns introduce theme supported by cellos when her voice enters says lacombe it replaces first horn whose characteristic sound it seems to continue dean likens this song to micaela s aria from carmen nadir s de mon amie which follows cavatina has says dean a haunting beauty its introductory phrase recalls oboe theme in bizet s youthful symphony in c dean 1965 pp 172 74 dean cites second act finale with its repeated climaxes as crowds demand errant couple s deaths as an example of bizet s developing skills in writing theatrical music third act divided into two brief scenes begins with zurga s entrance to quiet chromatic scales played over a tonic pedal an effect that bizet would later use in his incidental music to duet je says dean has clear hints of verdi s and fiery chorus des que le soleil is reminiscent of a mendelssohn scherzo but otherwise final act s music is weak and lacking in dramatic force in closing scene in which zurga bids a last farewell to his dreams of love friendship theme from act 1 duet sounds for final time according to lacombe is characteristic of french opera lyrique in particular through bizet s use of arioso and dramatic recitative his creation of atmospheres and his evocation of exotic lacombe p 249 berlioz described opera s score as beautiful expressive richly coloured and full of fire but bizet himself did not regard work highly and thought that a few numbers apart it deserved oblivion parisian critics of day attuned to gentler sounds of auber and offenbach complained about heaviness of bizet s orchestration which they said was noisy overloaded and wagnerian a fortissimo in three acts conductor hans von bulow dismissed work contemptuously as a tragical operetta and when it was revived after 1886 resented having to conduct it modern writers have generally treated piece more generously music may be of uneven quality and over reflective of works of bizet s contemporaries says dean but there are interesting hints of his mature accomplishments dean 1980 pp 754 55 others have given credit to composer for overcoming limitations of libretto with some genuinely dramatic strokes and occasional inspiring melody musical

les pecheurs de perles were lost or given away curtiss p 440 choudens published a second piano vocal score in 1887 88 and a nouvelle edition in 1893 that incorporated changes that had been introduced into recent revivals of opera a full orchestral score based on nouvelle edition was published in 1893 a trend towards greater authenticity began after hammond s orchestrations in 1970s provided a basis for staging work in its original form this process was further aided by discovery in 1990s of bizet s 1863 conducting score in this orchestral parts were reduced to six staves but notes and other markings in manuscript provided additional clues to original orchestration these new finds became basis for brad cohen s critical edition of score published by edition peters in 2002 recordings
