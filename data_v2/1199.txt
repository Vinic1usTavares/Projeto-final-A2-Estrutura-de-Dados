blame and decide that henceforth each will wear a green sash in recognition of gawain s adventure and as a reminder to be always honest gawain poet though real name of gawain poet or poets is unknown

most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is john massey of cotton cheshire he is known to have lived in dialect region of gawain poet and is thought to have written poem st erkenwald which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to gawain st erkenwald however has been dated by some scholars to a time outside gawain poet s era thus ascribing authorship to john massey is still controversial and most critics consider gawain poet an unknown verse form 2 530 lines and 101 stanzas that make up sir gawain and green knight are written in what linguists call alliterative revival style typical of 14th century instead of focusing on a metrical syllabic count and rhyme alliterative form of this period usually relied on agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at beginning of line and another pair at end each line always includes a pause called a caesura at some point after first two stresses dividing it into two half lines although he largely follows form of his day gawain poet was somewhat freer with convention than his or her predecessors poet broke alliterative lines into variable length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as bob and wheel in which bob is a very short line sometimes of only two syllables followed by wheel longer lines with internal rhyme gawain translation bob ful clene wheel for wonder of

knight sources and analogues woodbridge d s brewer 1992 in first branch of medieval welsh collection of tales known as four branches of mabinogi pwyll exchanges places for a year with arawn lord of otherworld despite having his appearance changed to resemble arawn exactly pwyll does not have sexual relations with arawn s wife during this time thus establishing a lasting friendship between two men this story may then provide a background to gawain s attempts to resist wife of green knight thus story of sir gawain and green knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of celtic beheading game and seduction test stories additionally in both stories a year passes before completion of conclusion of challenge or exchange some scholars disagree with this interpretation however as arawn seems to have accepted notion that pwyll may reciprocate with his wife making it less of a seduction test per se as seduction tests typically involve a lord and lady conspiring to seduce a

and green knight london kegan paul ltd 1965 p 162 hunting and seduction scholars have frequently noted parallels between three hunting scenes and three seduction scenes in gawain they are generally agreed that fox chase has significant parallels to third seduction scene in which gawain accepts girdle from bertilak s wife gawain like fox fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from green knight s axe like his counterpart he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin fox uses tactics so unlike first two animals and so unexpectedly that bertilak has hardest time hunting it similarly gawain finds lady s advances in third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts she changes her evasive language typical of courtly love relationships to a more assertive style her dress relatively modest in earlier scenes is suddenly voluptuous and revealing deer and boar hunting scenes are less clearly connected although scholars have attempted to link each animal to gawain s reactions in parallel seduction scene attempts to connect deer hunt with first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels deer hunts of time like courtship had to be done according to established rules women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned hinds first described in poem are probably from red deer a species with large antlers like american elk while subsequent dos and of other dere does and other deer likely refer to smaller fallow deer ong walter j green knight

scene follows in a similar vein with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger entire exchange is humorously portrayed boar hunting scene is in contrast laden with detail boars were and are much more difficult to hunt than deer approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat in hunting sequence boar flees but is cornered before a ravine he turns to face bertilak with his back to ravine prepared to fight bertilak dismounts and in ensuing fight kills boar he removes its head and displays it on a pike in seduction scene bertilak s wife like boar is more forward insisting that gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her gawain however is successful in parrying her attacks saying that surely she knows more than he about love both boar hunt and seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory both gawain and bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant masculinity has also been associated with hunting theme of masculinity is present throughout in an article by vern l bullough being a male in middle ages he discusses sir gawain and how normally masculinity is often viewed in terms of being sexually active he notes that sir gawain is not part of this normalcy nature and chivalry some argue that nature represents a chaotic lawless order which is in direct confrontation with civilisation

threatening order of men and courtly life nature invades and disrupts order in major events of narrative both symbolically and through inner nature of humanity this element appears first with

of christianity of time particularly as embodied in christian chivalry of arthur s court in its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism christianity had cut itself off from sources of life in nature and female green girdle represents all pentangle lacks arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge unattainability of ideals of round table and for sake of realism and wholeness recognize and incorporate pagan values represented by green knight this interpretation was first advanced by john speirs in scrutiny vol xvi iv 1949 incorporated in his medieval english poetry non chaucerian

steeply contrasted by fact that king arthur s court is christian and initial beheading event takes place while celebrating christmas violence of an act of beheading seems to be counterintuitive to chivalric and christian ideals and yet it is seen as part of knighthood question of politeness and chivalry is a main theme during gawain s interactions with bertilak s wife he cannot accept her advances or else lose his honour and yet he cannot utterly refuse her advances or else risk upsetting his hostess gawain plays a very fine line and only part where he appears to fail is when he conceals green girdle from bertilak games word gomen game is found 18 times in gawain its similarity to word man which appears 21 times has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness as when green knight challenges court s right to its good name in a christmas game game of exchanging gifts was common in germanic cultures if a man received a gift he was obliged to provide giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour almost like an exchange of blows in a fight or in a beheading game poem revolves around two games an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings these appear at first to be unconnected however a victory in first game will lead to a victory in second elements of both games appear in other stories however linkage of outcomes is unique to gawain sir gawain and green knight edited j r r tolkien and e v gordon revised norman davis 1925 introduction xv asin b000ipu84u times and seasons

leaves camelot on all saints day and arrives at bertilak s castle on christmas eve furthermore green knight tells gawain to meet him at green chapel in a year and a day a period of time seen often in medieval literature for reasons not entirely understood celts used phrase a year and a day to refer to exactly one year see for example w j mcgee s beginning of mathematics american anthropologist oct 1899 vol 1 iss 4 pp 646 674 some scholars interpret yearly cycles each beginning and ending in winter as poet s attempt to convey inevitable fall of all things good and noble in world such a theme is strengthened by image of troy a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which according to aeneid fell to greeks due to pride and ignorance trojan connection shows itself in presence of two virtually identical descriptions of troy s destruction poem s first line reads since siege and assault were ceased at troy and final stanzaic line before bob and wheel is after siege and assault were ceased at troy emotion and narrative empathy entire gawain poem follows one individual experiencing highly emotional situations he participates in beheading contest watches as a man he has beheaded walks away unscathed prepares for a journey where he will then also receive a blow that will behead him is tempted by sexual advances of sir bertilak s wife decides what to do with moral conundrum that is girdle suffering humiliation and returning to court to retell his entire adventure these events invite reader to empathize with gawain flawed hero and understand that he is also human humans experience an emotional contagion which was defined by psychologists elaine hatfield john and richard rapson as tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize expressions vocalizations postures and movements with those of another person and consequently to converge emotionally amy coplan explains that emotional contagion is something that happens so quickly and automatically that we are typically unaware of it happening poet capitalized on this emotional reaction and thus has reader empathizing with sir gawain almost without realizing it symbolism significance of colour green thumb

could either mean grey or green in death of curoi one of irish stories from bricriu s feast curoi stands in for bertilak and is often called man of grey mantle though words usually used for grey in death of curoi are or roughly meaning milk coloured and shadowy respectively in later works featuring a green knight word glas is used and may have been basis of misunderstanding girdle thumb 300px left another famous arthurian woman lady of shalott with a medieval girdle around her waist john william waterhouse 1888 girdle s symbolic meaning in sir gawain and green knight has been construed in

academy of america speculum vol 35 no 2 1960 it is not entirely clear if winner is sir gawain or lady bertilak girdle is given to gawain by lady bertilak to keep him safe when he confronts green knight when lord bertilak comes home from his hunting trip gawain does not reveal girdle to his host instead he hides it this introduces spiritual interpretation that gawain s acceptance of girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in god at least in face of death berger sidney e gawain s departure from morgantown west virginia university press 1985 to some green knight is christ who overcomes death while gawain is every christian who in his struggles to follow christ faithfully chooses easier path in sir gawain easier choice is girdle which promises what gawain most desires faith in god alternatively requires one s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what god has planned it is arguably best to view girdle not as an either or situation but as a complex multi faceted symbol that acts to test gawain in more ways than one while gawain is able to resist bertilak s wife s sexual advances he is unable to resist powers of girdle gawain is operating under laws of chivalry which evidently have rules that can contradict each other in story of sir gawain gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks accepting girdle and keeping his promise

symbolises phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality arthur pp 33 34 many poets use symbol of circle to show infinity or endlessness but gawain s poet insisted on using something more complex in medieval number theory number five is considered a circular number since it reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers arthur p 34 furthermore it replicates itself geometrically that is every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this process may be repeated forever with decreasing thus by reproducing number five which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility gawain s pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility arthur p 35 lady s ring gawain s refusal of lady bertilak s ring has major implications for remainder of story while modern student may tend to pay more attention to girdle as eminent object offered by lady readers in time of gawain would have noticed significance

to be a ruby or carbuncle indicated when gawain poet describes it as a sunne line 1819 a fiery sun this red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty divinity and passion of christ something that gawain as a knight of round table would strive for cooke lady s blushing 3 but this colour could also represent negative qualities of temptation and covetousness cooke lady s blushing 4 given

second and second to last parts are only one stanza long and middle five parts are eleven stanzas long number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature being one more than

body and soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin neck specifically was believed to correlate with part of soul related to will

less than courageous evade death in a dishonest way gawain s wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound green knight s series of tests shows gawain weakness that has been in him all along desire to use his will for personal gain rather than submitting his will in humility to god green knight by engaging with greatest knight of camelot also reveals moral weakness of pride in all of camelot and therefore all of humanity however wounds of christ believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies are mentioned throughout poem in hope that this sin of prideful will be healed among fallen mortals arthur pp 121 123 interpretations gawain as medieval romance thumb right gawain represented perfect knight as a fighter a lover and a religious devotee vigil by john pettie 1884 many critics argue that sir gawain and green knight should be viewed above all as a romance medieval romances typically recount marvellous adventures of a chivalrous heroic knight often of super human ability who abides by chivalry s strict codes of honour and demeanour embarks upon a quest and defeats monsters thereby winning favour of a lady thus medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment as term romance implies today but on adventure frye northrop anatomy of criticism p 186 gawain s function as medieval scholar alan markman says is function of romance hero to stand as champion of human race and by submitting to strange and severe tests to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action through gawain s adventure it becomes clear that he is merely human reader becomes attached to this human view in midst of poem s romanticism relating to gawain s humanity while respecting his knightly qualities gawain shows us what moral conduct is we shall probably not equal his behaviour but we admire him for pointing out way markman alan m meaning of sir gawain and green knight pmla september 1957 72 4 pp 574 586 in viewing poem as a medieval romance many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and courtly love laws under english order of garter group s motto honi soit qui mal y pense or shamed be he who finds evil here is written at end of poem some critics describe gawain s peers wearing girdles of their own as evidence of origin of order of garter however in parallel poem greene knight lace is white not green and is considered origin of collar worn by knights

213 footnote christian interpretations thumb scholars have pointed out parallels between girdle bertilak s wife offers gawain and fruit eve offered to adam in biblical garden of eden adam and eve lucas cranach ca 1513 poem is in many ways deeply christian with frequent references to fall of adam and eve and to jesus christ scholars have debated depth of christian elements within poem by looking at it in context of age in which it was written coming up with varying views as to what represents a christian element of poem and what does not for example some critics compare sir gawain to other three poems of gawain manuscript each has a heavily christian theme causing scholars to interpret gawain similarly comparing it to poem cleanness also known as purity for example they see it as a story of apocalyptic fall of a civilisation in gawain s case camelot in this interpretation sir gawain is like noah separated from his society and warned by green knight who is seen as god s representative of coming doom of camelot gawain judged worthy through his test is spared doom of rest of camelot king arthur and his knights however misunderstand gawain s experience and wear garters themselves in cleanness men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction one of key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders in his depiction of camelot poet reveals a concern for his society whose inevitable fall will bring about ultimate destruction intended by god gawain was written around time of black death and peasants revolt events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture however other critics see weaknesses in this view since green knight is ultimately under control of morgan le fay often viewed as a figure of evil in camelot tales this makes knight s presence as a representative of god problematic goodlad lauren m 1987 of sir gawain and green knight comitatus a journal of medieval and renaissance studies vol 18 article 4 while character of green knight is usually not viewed as a representation of christ in sir gawain and green knight critics do acknowledge a parallel lawrence besserman a specialist in medieval literature explains that green knight is not a figurative representative of christ but idea of christ s divine human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports poet s serious comic account of green knight s supernatural human qualities and actions this duality exemplifies influence and importance of christian teachings and views of christ in era of gawain poet furthermore critics note christian reference to christ s crown of thorns at conclusion of sir gawain and green knight after gawain returns to camelot and tells his story regarding newly acquired green sash poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to thorn crowned god sir gawain and green knight line 2529 besserman theorises that with these final words poet redirects our attention from circular girdle turned sash a double image of gawain s to circular crown of thorns a double image of christ s humiliation turned triumph throughout poem gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in christianity when gawain sets out on his journey to find green chapel he finds himself lost and only after praying to virgin mary does he find his way as he continues his journey gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with green knight instead of praying to mary as before gawain places his faith in girdle given to him by bertilak s wife from christian perspective this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when green knight points out his betrayal cox catherine genesis and gender in sir gawain and green knight chaucer review 2001 35 4 pp

unknown feminist literary critics see poem as portraying women s ultimate power over men morgan le fay and bertilak s wife for example are most powerful characters in poem morgan especially as she begins game by enchanting green knight girdle and gawain s scar can be seen as symbols of feminine power each of them diminishing gawain s masculinity gawain s misogynist passage in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists many men who have fallen prey to women s wiles further supports feminist view of ultimate female power in poem in contrast others argue that poem focuses mostly on opinions actions and abilities of men for example on surface it appears that bertilak s wife is a strong leading character burns e jane courtly love who needs it recent feminist work in medieval

entirely case however while lady is being forward and outgoing gawain s feelings and emotions are focus of story and gawain stands to gain or lose most burns p 24 lady makes first move so to speak but gawain ultimately decides what is to become of those actions he therefore is in charge of situation and even relationship in bedroom scene both negative and positive actions of lady are motivated by her desire her feelings cause her to step out of typical female role and into that of male thus becoming more empowered rowley p 161 at same time those same actions make lady appear adulterous some scholars compare her with eve in bible cox p 378 by forcing gawain to take her girdle i e apple pact made with bertilak and therefore green knight is broken cox p 379 in this sense it is clear that at hands of lady gawain is a good man seduced postcolonial interpretations from 1350 to 1400 period in which poem is thought to have been written wales experienced several raids at hands of english who were attempting to colonise area gawain poet uses a north west midlands dialect common on welsh english border potentially placing him in midst of this conflict patricia clare ingham is credited with first viewing poem through lens of postcolonialism and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over extent to which colonial differences play a role in poem most critics agree that gender plays a role but differ about whether gender supports colonial ideals or replaces them as english and welsh cultures interact in poem a large amount of critical debate also surrounds poem as it relates to bi cultural political landscape of time some argue that bertilak is an example of hybrid anglo welsh culture found on welsh english border they therefore view poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions other scholars however argue that historically much welsh blood was shed well into 14th century creating a situation far removed from more friendly hybridisation suggested by ingham to support this argument further it is suggested that poem creates an us versus them scenario contrasting knowledgeable civilised english with uncivilised borderlands that are home to bertilak and other monsters that gawain encounters in contrast to this perception of colonial lands others argue that land of hautdesert bertilak s territory has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism they suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency one that plays a central role in story bonnie lander for example argues that denizens of hautdesert are intelligently immoral choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others a position which creates a distinction of moral insight versus moral faith lander thinks that border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical and in case of bertilak s appearance at arthur s court literal sense lander s argument about superiority of denizens of hautdesert hinges on lack of self awareness present in camelot which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism in this view it is not bertilak and his people but arthur and his court who are monsters gawain s journey several scholars have attempted to find a real world correspondence for gawain s journey to green chapel anglesey islands for example are mentioned in poem they exist today as a single island off coast of wales in line 700 gawain is said to pass holy head believed by many scholars to be either holywell or cistercian abbey of poulton in pulford holywell is associated with beheading of saint winifred as story goes winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances her uncle another saint put her head back in place and healed wound leaving only a white scar parallels between this story and gawain s make this area a likely candidate for journey gawain s trek leads him directly into centre of pearl poet s dialect region where candidates for locations of castle at hautdesert and green chapel stand hautdesert is thought to be in area of

wilderness of wirral in sir gawain and green knight vol 23 no 1 2013 53 homoerotic interpretations according to medieval scholar richard zeikowitz green knight represents a threat to homosocial friendship in his medieval world zeikowitz argues that narrator of poem seems entranced by knight s beauty him in poetic form green knight s attractiveness challenges homosocial rules of king arthur s court and poses a threat to their way of life zeikowitz also states that gawain seems to find bertilak as attractive as narrator finds green knight bertilak however follows homosocial code and develops a friendship with gawain gawain s embracing and kissing bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression men of time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under chivalric code nonetheless green knight blurs lines between homosociality and homosexuality representing difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating two zeikowitz richard e befriending medieval queer a pedagogy for literature classes college english special issue lesbian and gay studies queer pedagogies vol 65 no 1 sep 2002 pp 67 80 carolyn dinshaw argues that poem may have been a response to accusations that richard ii had a male lover an attempt to reestablish idea that heterosexuality was christian norm around time poem was written catholic church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males many religious figures were trying to make distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality still pearl poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire in his other poem cleanness he points out several grievous sins but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail his obsession seems to carry into gawain in his descriptions of green knight dinshaw carolyn a kiss is just a kiss heterosexuality and its in sir gawain and green knight diacritics vol 24 no 2 3 summer 1994 pp 204 226 beyond this dinshaw proposes that gawain can be read as a woman like figure he is passive one in advances of lady bertilak as well as in his encounters with lord bertilak where he acts part of a woman in kissing man however while poem does have homosexual elements these elements are brought up by poet in order to establish heterosexuality as normal lifestyle of gawain s world poem does this by making kisses between lady bertilak and gawain sexual in nature but rendering kisses between gawain and lord bertilak unintelligible to medieval reader in other words poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having possibility of leading to sex while in a heterosexual world kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility modern
