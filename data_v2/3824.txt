haras old norse army god may be interpreted as depicting sleipnir simek 2007 140 theories john lindow theorizes that sleipnir s connection to world of dead grants a special poignancy to one of kennings in which sleipnir turns up as a horse word referring to skald ulfr uggason s usage of sea sleipnir in his husdrapa which describes funeral of baldr lindow continues that his use of sleipnir in kenning may show that sleipnir s role in failed recovery of baldr was known at that time and place in iceland it certainly indicates that sleipnir was an active participant in mythology of last decades of paganism lindow adds that eight legs of sleipnir have been interpreted as an indication of great speed or as being connected in some unclear way with cult activity hilda ellis davidson says that eight legged horse of odin is typical steed of shaman and that in shaman s journeys to heavens or underworld a shaman is usually represented as riding on some bird or animal davidson says that while creature may vary horse is fairly common in lands where horses are in general use and sleipnir s ability to bear god through air is typical of shaman s steed and cites an example from a study of shamanism by mircea eliade of an eight legged foal from a story of a shaman davidson says that while attempts have been made to connect sleipnir with hobby horses and steeds with more than four feet that appear in carnivals and processions but that a more fruitful resemblance seems to be on bier on which a dead man is carried in funeral procession by four bearers borne along thus he may be described as riding on a steed with eight legs as an example davidson cites a funeral dirge from gondi people in india as recorded by verrier elwin stating that it contains references to bagri maro horse with eight legs and it is clear from song that it is dead man s bier davidson says that song is sung when a distinguished dies and provides a verse davidson 1990 142 143 what horse is this it is horse of bagri maro what should we say of its legs this horse has eight legs what should we say of its heads this horse has four heads catch bridle and mount horse davidson adds that representation of odin s steed as eight legged could arise naturally out of such an image and that this is in accordance with picture of sleipnir as a horse that could bear its rider to land of dead ulla loumand cites sleipnir and flying horse as prime examples of horses in norse mythology as being able to mediate between earth and sky between and and between world of mortal men and underworld loumand 2006 133 encyclopedia of indo european culture theorizes that sleipnir s eight legs may be remnants of horse associated divine twins found in indo european cultures and ultimately stemming from proto indo european religion encyclopedia states that sleipnir is born with an extra set of legs thus representing an original pair of horses like freyr and njordr sleipnir is responsible for carrying dead to otherworld encyclopedia cites parallels between birth of sleipnir and myths originally pointing to a celtic goddess who gave birth to divine horse twins these elements include a demand for a goddess by an unwanted suitor hrimthurs demanding goddess freyja and seduction of builders mallory adams 1997 163 modern influence thumb horseshoe shaped canyon asbyrgi according to icelandic folklore
