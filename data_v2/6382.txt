of archduke charles over french forces commanded by jean baptiste jourdan battle occurred during holy week 1799 amid rain and dense fog initially french were able to take and hold ostrach and nearby hamlet of hosskirch plus several strategic points on ostrach marsh as engagement began habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed french defenses by evening french left wing was flanked and jourdan s men retreated from ostrach to pfullendorf heights on next morning as jourdan considered a counter attack weather broke and he could look down on austrian battle array numbers and dispositions of austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless and that he could not hope to maintain his position in heights as he withdrew a portion of his right flank was cut off from main force although casualties appeared even on both sides austrians had a significantly larger fighting force both on field at ostrach and stretched along a line between lake constance and ulm french casualties amounted to eight percent of force and austrian approximately four percent french withdrew to engen and stockach where a few days later armies engaged again this time with greater losses on both sides and an austrian victory background initially rulers of europe such as joseph ii holy roman emperor viewed revolution in france as an event between french king and his subjects and not something in which they should interfere as rhetoric grew more strident however other monarchies started to view events with alarm in 1790 leopold succeeded his brother joseph as emperor and by 1791 he considered situation surrounding his sister marie antoinette and her children with greater and greater alarm in august 1791 in consultation with french emigre nobles and frederick william ii of prussia he issued declaration of pillnitz in which they declared interest of monarchs of europe as one with interests of louis and his family they threatened ambiguous but quite serious consequences if anything should

exact territorial and remunerative details to be convened at rastatt french demand for more territory than originally agreed upon stalled negotiations despite their agreement at campo formio and ongoing meetings at rastatt two primary combatants of first coalition france and austria were highly suspicious of other s motives several diplomatic incidents undermined agreement austrians were reluctant to cede designated territories and rastatt delegates could not or would not orchestrate transfer of agreed upon territories to compensate german princes for their losses ferdinand of naples

matched ambitious tyranny of austrians charles had driven his army hard he wrote and austrians would not pursue gallant liberty loving french charles failure to pursue french affirmed jourdan s perception that his had not been a defeat followed by retreat but rather a strategic withdrawal jourdan probably did not know that charles had been ordered to maintain a continuous and orderly defensive line with troops to south jourdan s own assessment did not match that of his superiors in paris who recognized that loss of twelve percent of fighting force versus less than four percent for adversary did not amount to a draw phipps pp 49 50 young p 230 furthermore this first attempt to cut austrians off from access to upper rhine and lake constance had not succeeded phipps pp 49 50 young

or even harass their retreat charles slow pursuit might have been due to his own disgruntlement with vienna s overarching defensive strategy and undoubted difficulty of battle itself conducted with troops wearied by a forced march of fighting in rain fog and on normally boggy terrain made more soggy by heavy spring rains and snow melt regardless he more than made up for these shortcomings within week blanning pp 232 264 phipps pp 49 50 five days after jourdan s departure from ostrach and pfullendorf french and austrian armies continued fight at stockach this time decision could not be argued army of danube could not hold territory and withdrew into black forest blanning p 264 battle at ostrach had been difficult as jourdan pointed out due largely to dense fog and terrible weather that hampered his observation of his enemy s movements yet same fog that blinded him to austrian movements did not seem to hamper charles phipps pp 49 50 young pp 228 230 fog and rainy weather did play a
