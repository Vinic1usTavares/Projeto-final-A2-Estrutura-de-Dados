eugene scribe and germain delavigne robert le diable is regarded as one of first grand operas at paris opera it has only a superficial connection to medieval legend of robert devil opera was immediately successful from its first night on 21 november 1831 at opera dramatic music harmony and orchestration its melodramatic plot its star singers and its sensational stage effects compelled frederic chopin who was in audience to say if ever magnificence was seen in theatre i doubt that it reached level of splendour shown in robert it is a masterpiece meyerbeer has made himself immortal brown robert le diable p 572 robert initiated european fame of its composer consolidated fame of its librettist scribe and launched reputation of new director of opera louis desire veron as a purveyor of a new genre of opera it also had influence on development of ballet and was frequently mentioned and discussed in contemporary french literature robert continued as a favourite in opera houses all over world throughout nineteenth century after a period of neglect it began to be revived towards end of twentieth century background upright 0 6 thumb left meyerbeer c 1825 shortly before he commenced working on robert giacomo meyerbeer s early studies had been in germany but from 1816 to 1825 he worked in italy there he studied opera then dominated by gioachino rossini and wrote his own italian operas which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other european countries conway 2012 pp 246 248 success of il crociato in egitto 1824 throughout europe including at paris in 1825 persuaded meyerbeer who was already thirty three years old to fulfil at last his ambition to base himself in paris and to seek a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there conway 2012 pp 249 50 meyerbeer first mentions robert le diable in his diaries in february 1827 journal de paris announced on 19 april 1827 that libretto of scribe and delavigne had been passed by censor and that music is to be entrusted to a composer m meyer beer who having acquired a brilliant reputation in germany and italy is extending it to our country where several of his works have been already successfully represented meyerbeer 1999 p 384 pp 422 3 libretto was fabricated on basis of old legends about duke robert magnificent of normandy father of william conqueror alleged in some versions to have been son of devil librettists padded out this outline with a variety of melodramatic incidents plot reflected fantastic legendary elements which fascinated opera public of 1830 a taste which had evolved from 1824 paris production of carl maria von weber s der freischutz in its french version robin des bois which also features a doubtful hero befriended by a demon promising him success crosten 1948 p 2010 p 217 libretto was originally planned as a three act opera comique for opera comique theatre meyerbeer stopped work on opera in 1827 when theatre underwent financial difficulties in august 1829 composer and librettists agreed to refashion work in a five act form to meet requirements of paris opera brzoska 2003 p 190 this entailed some significant rewriting of storyline reducing essentially comic role of raimbaut who vanishes after act 3 in final version but whose antics including spending of bertram s money continued throughout in earlier libretto it also meant that traditional pairing of lovers in opera comique robert isabelle paralleled throughout by lower class raimbaut alice was swept aside in favour of concentration on more sensational story line of robert s diabolic ancestry 1992 p 1357 for details of earlier version see everist 1994 contract for opera specifying it as a grand opera in five acts and seven scenes was signed by then director of opera emile on 29 december 1829 meyerbeer completed composition of work in spa belgium in june and july 1830 meyerbeer 1999 p 391 its characterisation as a grand opera placed it in succession to auber s la de 1828 and rossini s guillaume tell 1829 in this new genre composer undertook further work on opera in early 1831 converting spoken passages to recitatives and adding ballet episodes including in act 3 ballet of nuns which was to prove one of opera s great sensations and which henri duponchel had suggested to replace original humdrum scenario set in olympus he also rewrote two major male roles of bertrand and robert to suit talents of nicolas levasseur and adolphe nourrit respectively heubner 1992 p 1357 performance history premiere seasons in paris 300px thumb degas ballet of nuns from act 3 of robert le diable 1876 version opera premiered on 21 november 1831 at paris opera success owed much to opera s star singers levasseur as bertram nourrit as robert and to provocative ballet of nuns in third act featuring great ballerina marie taglioni choreography for ballet was elaborated by ballerina s father filippo taglioni audience s prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by reviewer for revue des deux mondes a crowd of mute shades glides through arches all these women cast off their nuns costume they shake off cold powder of grave suddenly they throw themselves into delights of their past life they dance like they play like lords they drink like sappers what a pleasure to see these light women cited in williams 2003 p 71 set for ballet was an innovative and striking design by henri duponchel and pierre luc charles ciceri carnegy p 15 6 duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for staging including english traps for sudden appearance and disappearance of ghosts meyerbeer was led to complain that spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into background carlson 1972 p 75 taglioni danced abbess only six times in paris she was replaced by louise fitzjames who danced role 232 times jurgenson 1998 p 76 at invitation of nourrit falcon made her debut at age of 18 at opera in role of alice on 20 july 1832 cast included nourrit although suffering from stage fright falcon managed to sing her first aria without error and finished her role with ease and competence her tragic demeanor and dark looks were highly appropriate to part pitou 1990 p 449 and she made a vivid impression on public fetis 1862 p 179 which included on that night auber berlioz halevy maria malibran giulia grisi honore daumier alexandre

sang role of robert until 1837 when he was replaced as premier tenor at opera by gilbert whom however meyerbeer did not like in role nor did he approve of an alternative lafont however he was impressed by newcomer mario cavaliere giovanni matteo di candia and wrote for him a new aria for robert which was performed at his debut in revival of opera on 30 november 1838 mario s debut was launch of his very successful career others singing in 1838 revival included julie dorus gras alice prosper bertram and francois raimbaut kuhnhold 1988 by meyerbeer s death in 1864 opera had been

1840 meyerbeer took particular care over first london and berlin productions he travelled to london to check singers and production for original version conway 2012 pp 114 5 and requested that german translation for berlin be undertaken by poet ludwig strongly recommending that taglioni and her father be re engaged and that ciceri s sets should be reproduced although taglioni danced and sets were retained translation was eventually carried out by meyerbeer s friend theodor hell letter of 4 february 1832 to berlin theatre director count von see becker 1989 pp 48 49 meyerbeer wrote additional ballet music for taglioni for berlin production danish choreographer august bournonville saw fitzjames s performance as abbess in paris in 1841 and based his own choreography which was used in

century during early twentieth century meyerbeer s operas gradually disappeared from stage partly due to their length and expense to mount partly due to their denigration by supporters of wagnerian opera in 1898 george bernard shaw in perfect wagnerite had already cast scorn on robert and commented that nowadays young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken meyerbeer s influence seriously shaw 1981 vol 3 pp 530 531 nevertheless productions of robert included those in new orleans and nice in 1901 paris at gaite lyrique in 1911 barcelona in 1917 at vienna volksoper in 1921 and

to great rejoicing costume designs for first production costumes were designed by letellier 2012 pp 130 131 reception a number of factors influenced opera s very favourable reception initial cast contained leading singers of period and as it changed equally brilliant stars e g falcon were introduced as replacements sensational plot and notoriety of nuns ballet ensured that opera was a hot topic in journals and reviews this was assisted by marketing skills of director veron and publisher schlesinger scenery was of exceptional quality this was as much an opera to see as to hear and it has been argued that real hero behind robert le diable was ciceri designer meyerbeer was keen to keep influential persons on his side for example he sent free tickets for a good box to heinrich heine letter from meyerbeer to heine of december 1831 cited in becker 1989 p 46 and of course businessman veron knew how to use and pay claque and its leader augustin levasseur crosten 1948 p p 47 but undoubtedly novelty and colour of music of meyerbeer deserves major credit alliance of his german musical training along with his study of opera for many years in italy was highly attractive to a parisian audience which asked only to be astonished and surprised theophile gautier cited in crosten 1948 p 114 critic wrote that meyerbeer straight away took his position at crossroads where italian song and german orchestration have to meet cited in brzoska 2003 p 192 meyerbeer paid close attention to unusual combinations and textures and original orchestration examples being use of low brass and woodwind playing chromatic passages associated with bertram use of a brass band and male choir to characterise demons in act 3 and so on hector berlioz was particularly impressed he wrote an entire article in revue et gazette musicale entitled on orchestration of robert le diable which concluded robert le diable provides most astonishing example of power of instrumentation when applied to dramatic music a power of recent introduction which has achieved its fullest development in hands of m meyerbeer a conquest of modern art which even italians will have to acknowledge in order to prop up as best they can their miserable system which is collapsing in ruins article of 12 july 1835 cited in berlioz and meyerbeer in hector berlioz website retrieved 7 april 2012 opera was perceived to have weaknesses of characterization for example robert s dithering behaviour led to one comment that what is least diabolical in robert le diable is robert himself cited in crosten 1948 p 99 crosten comments in fact robert is so fundamentally characterless that it is a matter of wonder why either heaven or hell should be inclined to worry over his destiny but critic fetis gave consensus opinion robert le diable is not only a masterpiece it is also a remarkable work within history of music it seems to me to unite all qualities needed to establish a composer s reputation success of opera led to meyerbeer himself becoming a celebrity king frederick william iii of prussia who attended second performance of robert swiftly invited him to compose a german opera and meyerbeer was invited to stage robert in berlin becker 1989 p 39 in january 1832 he was awarded membership of legion d honneur everist 1994 p 210 this success coupled with meyerbeer s known family wealth inevitably also precipitated envy amongst his peers berlioz wrote i can t forget that meyerbeer was only able to persuade opera to put on robert le diable by paying administration sixty thousand francs of his own money and chopin lamented meyerbeer had to work for three years and pay his own expenses for his stay in paris before robert le diable could be staged three years that s a lot it s too much both cited in conway 2012 pp 252 3 both veron and meyerbeer however were later to deny rumours that composer had subsidized production see becker 1989 pp 147 8 influence success of robert had profound consequences for institution of paris opera itself for music staging and popularity of nineteenth century opera as a whole and for ballet thumb left first page of manuscript of grand duo concertant on themes of robert by chopin and fortuitous timing of opera s premiere not long after july revolution and its sensational and novel effects meant that it was widely identified with new liberal ideas of july monarchy as berlioz commented meyerbeer had not only luck to be talented but talent to be lucky berlioz 1970 p 569 honore de balzac in his novella brzoska 2003 p 193 and heinrich heine in his poem angelique conway 2012 p 254 are just two of contemporary writers to express their fascination with opera alexandre dumas set a chapter of count of monte cristo between two acts of robert and george sand wrote about it at length in her lettres d un voyageur everist 1994 212 it is only nineteenth century opera to have a rose named after it everist 1994 213 see also com for a picture link accessed 9 june 2012 also absence of starchy historical content in robert doubtless played a part in attracting bourgeoisie to opera until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment success of opera also justified government s policy of privatization in selling management to veron and this was a landmark in dilution of state control and patronage in fine arts heubner 1992 p 1359 although veron had not commissioned it having taken control only after revolution robert was his first new production as manager of opera and its success underwrote his policy of commissioning similar works these were to include meyerbeer s les huguenots fromental halevy s la juive and daniel auber s gustave iii however while they used same dazzling theatrical rhetoric as robert they led to uniformly horrific with gripping moral urgency their more sophisticated plot lines reflecting changes in taste of new opera clientele taruskin 2010 p 218 they established paris as europe s opera capital with opera itself as its centre in period 1830 until 1850 act 3 ballet is regarded by some as first of ballets blancs whereby principal ballerina and corps de ballet are all clothed in white which became a favourite of nineteenth century repertoire later examples include la 1832 also choreographed by filippo taglioni and danced by his daughter giselle 1841 pas de quatre 1845 and les

success of robert whose score was also published by schlesinger was said to have saved him from bankruptcy conway 2012 p 238 frederic chopin and auguste jointly composed a grand duo concertant on
