cane toad rhinella marina also known as giant neotropical toad or marine toad is a large terrestrial true toad native to south and mainland central america but which has been introduced to various islands throughout oceania and caribbean as well as northern australia it is world s largest toad it is a member of genus rhinella but was formerly assigned to genus bufo which includes many true toad species found throughout central and south america cane toad is a prolific breeder females lay single clump spawns with thousands of eggs its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding it has a diet unusual among anurans of both dead and living matter adults average in length largest recorded specimen had a snout vent length of cane toad is an old species a fossil toad

names including giant toad and marine toad former refers to its size and latter to binomial name r marina it was one of many species described by linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae 1758 linnaeus based specific epithet marina on an illustration by dutch zoologist albertus seba who mistakenly believed cane toad to inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments other common names include giant neotropical toad dominican toad giant marine toad and south american cane toad in trinidadian english they are commonly called french word for toad genus rhinella is considered to constitute a distinct genus of its own thus changing scientific name of cane toad in this case specific name marinus masculine changes to marina feminine to conform with rules of gender agreement as set out by international code of zoological nomenclature changing binomial name from bufo marinus to rhinella marina binomial rhinella marinus was subsequently introduced as a synonym through misspelling by robertson sites and noonan 2008 though controversial with many traditional herpetologists still using bufo marinus binomial rhinella marina is gaining in acceptance with such bodies as iucn encyclopaedia of life amphibian species of world and increasing numbers of scientific publications adopting its usage thumb left alt a large adult cane toad showing light colouration present in some specimens of species light coloured cane toad in australia adults may be confused with large native frogs from genera cyclorana and these species can be distinguished from cane toad by absence of large parotoid glands behind their eyes and lack of a ridge between nostril and eye cane toads have been confused with giant burrowing frog heleioporus because both are large and warty in appearance however latter can be readily distinguished from former by its vertical pupils and its silver grey as opposed to gold irises juvenile cane toads may be confused with species of genus but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by lack of bright colouring on groin and thighs in united states cane toad closely resembles many species in particular it could be confused with southern toad bufo terrestris which can be distinguished by presence of two bulbs in front of parotoid glands genetics cane toad genome has been sequenced and certain australian academics believe this will help in

found in areas of lower population density they have a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years in wild and can live considerably longer in captivity with one specimen reportedly surviving for 35 years skin of cane toad is dry and warty it has distinct ridges above eyes which run down snout individual cane toads can be grey yellowish red brown or olive brown with varying patterns a large parotoid gland lies behind each eye ventral surface is cream coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown pupils are horizontal and irises golden toes have a fleshy webbing at their base and fingers are free of webbing typically juvenile cane toads have smooth dark skin although some specimens have a red wash juveniles lack adults large parotoid glands so they are usually less poisonous tadpoles are small and uniformly black and are bottom dwellers tending to form schools tadpoles range from in length ecology behaviour and life history common name marine toad and scientific name rhinella marina suggest a link to marine life but cane toads do not live in sea however laboratory experiments suggest that tadpoles can tolerate salt concentrations equivalent to 15 of seawater 5 4 0 and

found in subtropical forests although dense foliage tends to limit their dispersal cane toad begins life as an egg which is laid as part of long strings of jelly in water a female lays 8 000 25 000 eggs at once and strings can stretch up to in length black eggs are covered by a membrane and their diameter is about rate at which an egg grows into a tadpole increases with temperature tadpoles typically hatch within 48 hours but period can vary from 14 hours to almost a week this process usually involves thousands of tadpoles which are small black and have short tails forming into groups between 12 and 60 days are needed for tadpoles to develop into juveniles with four weeks being typical similarly to their adult counterparts eggs and tadpoles are toxic to many animals when they emerge toadlets typically are about in length and grow rapidly while rate of growth varies by region time of year and gender an average initial growth rate of per day is seen followed by an average rate of per day growth typically slows once toads reach sexual maturity this rapid growth is important for their survival in period between metamorphosis and young toads lose toxicity that protected them as eggs and tadpoles but have yet to fully develop parotoid glands that produce bufotoxin because they lack this key defence only an estimated 0 5 of cane toads reach adulthood as with rates of growth point at which toads become sexually mature varies across different regions in new guinea sexual maturity is reached by female toads with a snout vent length between while toads in panama achieve maturity when they are between in length in tropical regions such as their native habitats breeding occurs throughout year but in subtropical areas breeding occurs only during warmer periods that coincide with onset of wet season cane toad is estimated to have a critical thermal maximum of and a minimum of around ranges can change due to adaptation to local environment cane toad has a high tolerance to water loss some can withstand a 52 6 loss of body water allowing them to survive outside tropical environments diet most frogs identify prey by movement and vision appears to be primary method by which cane toad detects prey however it can also locate food using its sense of smell they eat a wide range of material in addition to normal prey of small rodents reptiles other

large quantities toad licking could result in serious illness or death in addition to releasing toxin cane toad is capable of inflating its lungs puffing up and lifting its body off ground to appear taller and larger to a potential predator since 2011 experimenters in kimberley region of western australia have used poisonous sausages containing toad meat to try to protect native animals from cane toads deadly impact western australian department of environment and conservation along with university of sydney developed baits to train native animals not to eat toads by blending bits of toad with a nausea inducing chemical baits train animals to stay away from amphibians predators many species prey on cane toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat including broad snouted caiman caiman latirostris banded cat eyed snake annulata eels family various species of killifish rock rupestris some species of catfish order some species of ibis subfamily and paraponera clavata bullet ants predators outside cane toad s native range include whistling kite haliastur sphenurus black rat rattus rattus and water monitor varanus salvator tawny frogmouth podargus strigoides and papuan frogmouth podargus papuensis have been reported as feeding on cane toads some australian crows corvus spp have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads such as using their beak to flip toads onto their backs have been observed eating hearts and livers of toads where toads have moved into their territory opossums of genus didelphis likely can eat cane toads with impunity meat ants are unaffected by cane toads toxins so are able to kill them cane toad s normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill attacker which allows ants to attack and eat toad distribution cane toad is native to americas and its range stretches from rio grande valley in south texas to central amazon and southeastern peru and some of continental islands near venezuela such as trinidad and tobago this area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments density of cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced in south america density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100 m 109 yd of shoreline 1 to 2 of density in australia introductions cane toad has been introduced to many regions of world particularly pacific for biological control of agricultural pests these introductions have generally been well documented and cane toad may be one of most studied of any introduced species before early 1840s cane toad had been introduced into martinique and barbados from french guiana and guyana an introduction to jamaica was made in 1844 in an attempt to reduce rat population despite its failure to control rodents cane toad was introduced to puerto rico in early 20th century in hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging sugarcane plantations puerto rican scheme was successful and halted economic damage caused by beetles prompting scientists in 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests as a result many countries in pacific region emulated lead of puerto rico and introduced toad in 1930s introduced populations are in australia florida papua new guinea philippines ogasawara ishigaki island and daito islands of japan most caribbean islands fiji and many other pacific islands including hawaii since then cane toad has become a pest in many host countries and poses a serious threat to native animals australia thumb right distribution of cane toad in australia map out of date current range includes northern wa northern nsw nt and qld australian government policy on cane toads alt a map of australia with cane toad s distribution highlighted area follows northeastern coast of australia ranging from northern territory through to north end of new south wales following apparent success of cane toad in eating beetles threatening sugarcane plantations of puerto rico and fruitful introductions into hawaii and philippines a strong push was made for cane toad to be released in australia to negate pests ravaging queensland cane fields as a result 102 toads were collected from hawaii and brought to australia queensland s sugar scientists released toad into cane fields in august 1935 after this initial release commonwealth department of health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into feeding habits of toad study was completed in 1936 and ban lifted when large scale releases were undertaken by march 1937 62 000 toadlets had been released into wild toads became firmly established in queensland increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into northern territory and new south wales in 2010 one was found on far western coast in broome western australia cane toad found on wa coast australian geographic july 21 2010 however toad was generally unsuccessful in reducing targeted grey backed cane beetles dermolepida albohirtum in part because cane fields provided insufficient shelter for predators during day and in part because beetles live at tops of sugar cane and cane toads are not good climbers since its original introduction cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on australian biodiversity population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined such as varanid lizards varanus mertensi v and v panoptes land snakes pseudechis australis and acanthophis antarcticus and crocodile species crocodylus johnstoni in contrast population of agamid lizard gilberti known to be a prey item of v panoptes has increased on snake populations see caribbean cane toad was introduced to various caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops while it was able to establish itself on some islands such as barbados jamaica and puerto rico other introductions such as in cuba before 1900 and in 1946 and on islands of dominica and grand cayman were unsuccessful earliest recorded introductions were to barbados and martinique barbados introductions were focused on biological control of pests damaging sugarcane crops and while toads became abundant they have done even less to control pests than in australia kennedy anthony quoted in toad was introduced to martinique from french guiana before 1944 and became established today they reduce mosquito and mole cricket populations a third introduction to region occurred in 1884 when toads appeared in jamaica reportedly imported from barbados to help control rodent population while they had no significant effect on rats they nevertheless became well established other introductions include release on antigua possibly before 1916 although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date and montserrat which had an introduction before 1879 that led to establishment of a solid population which was apparently sufficient to survive soufriere hills volcano eruption in 1995 in 1920 cane toad was introduced into puerto rico to control populations of white grub spp a sugarcane pest before this pests were manually collected by humans so introduction of toad eliminated labor costs a second group of toads was imported in 1923 and by 1932 cane toad was well established after a completely successful method of killing white grubs by chemical means was found only opportunities for its use in puerto rico have been limited to small areas in pineapple plantations at elevations where toad is even yet not present in sufficient abundance population of white grubs dramatically decreased and this was attributed to cane toad at annual meeting of international sugar cane technologists in puerto rico however there may have been other factors six year period after 1931 when cane toad was most prolific and white grub had a dramatic decline had highest ever rainfall for puerto rico nevertheless cane toad was assumed to have controlled white grub this view was reinforced by a nature article titled toads save sugar crop and this led to large scale introductions throughout many parts of pacific cane toad has been spotted in carriacou and dominica latter appearance occurring in spite of failure of earlier introductions on september 8 2013 cane toad was also discovered on island of new providence in bahamas philippines thumb r marina in philippines are referred to as kamprag a corruption of american frog cane toad was first introduced deliberately into philippines in 1930 as a biological control agent of pests in sugarcane plantations after success of experimental introductions into puerto rico it subsequently became most ubiquitous amphibian in islands it still retains common name of or kamprag in visayan languages a corruption of american frog referring to its origins it is also commonly known as bullfrog in philippine english fiji cane toad was introduced into fiji to combat insects that infested sugarcane plantations introduction of cane toad to region was first suggested in 1933 following successes in puerto rico and hawaii after considering possible side effects national government of fiji decided to release toad in 1953 and 67 specimens were subsequently imported from hawaii once toads were established a 1963 study concluded as toad s diet included both harmful and beneficial invertebrates it was considered economically neutral today cane toad can be found on all major islands in fiji although they tend to be smaller than their counterparts in other regions new guinea cane toad was introduced into new guinea to control hawk moth larvae eating sweet potato crops first release occurred in 1937 using toads imported from hawaii with a second release same year using specimens from australian mainland evidence suggests a third release in 1938 consisting of toads being used for human pregnancy tests many species of toad were found to be effective for this task and were employed for about 20 years after discovery was announced in 1948 initial reports argued toads were effective in reducing levels of cutworms and sweet potato yields were thought to be improving as a result these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of region although their effectiveness on other crops such as cabbages has been questioned when toads were released at wau cabbages provided insufficient shelter and toads rapidly left immediate area for superior shelter offered by forest a similar situation had previously arisen in australian cane fields but this experience was either unknown or ignored in new guinea cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas united states cane toad naturally exists in south texas but attempts both deliberate and accidental have been made to introduce species to other parts of country these include introductions to florida and to islands of hawaii as well as largely unsuccessful introductions to louisiana initial releases into florida failed attempted introductions before 1936 and 1944 intended to control sugarcane pests were unsuccessful as toads failed to proliferate later attempts failed in same way however toad gained a foothold in state after an accidental release by an importer at miami international airport in 1957 and deliberate releases by animal dealers in 1963 and 1964 established toad in other parts of florida today cane toad is well established in state from keys to north of tampa and they are gradually extending further northward in florida toad is a regarded as a threat to native species and pets so much so florida fish and wildlife conservation commission recommends residents to kill them thumb right upright cane toad merchandise alt a selection of cane toad merchandise including key rings made from their legs a coin purse made from head front limbs and body of a toad and a stuffed cane toad around 150 cane toads were introduced to oahu in hawaii in 1932 and population swelled to 105 517 after 17 months toads were sent to other islands and more than 100 000 toads were distributed by july 1934 eventually over 600 000 were transported uses other than use as a biological control for pests cane toad has been employed in a number of commercial and noncommercial applications traditionally within toad s natural range in south america would milk toads for their toxin which was then employed as an arrow poison toxins may have been used as an entheogen by olmec people toad has been hunted as a food source in parts of peru and eaten after careful removal of skin and parotoid glands when properly prepared meat of toad is considered healthy and as a source of omega 3 fatty acids more recently toad s toxins have been used in a number of new ways bufotenin has been used in japan as an aphrodisiac and a hair restorer and in cardiac surgery in china to lower heart rates of patients new research has suggested that cane toad s poison may have some applications in treating prostate cancer in haiti native toad s poison was used in combination with datura and pufferfish to create zombie poison described in 1985 book serpent and rainbow by wade davis other modern applications of cane toad include pregnancy testing as pets laboratory research and production of leather goods pregnancy testing was conducted in mid 20th century by injecting urine from a woman into a male toad s lymph sacs and if spermatozoa appeared in toad s urine patient was deemed to be pregnant tests using toads were faster than those employing mammals toads were easier to raise and although initial 1948 discovery employed bufo for tests it soon became clear that a variety of anuran species were suitable including cane toad as a result toads were employed in this task for around 20 years as a laboratory animal cane toad is regarded as ideal they are plentiful and easy and inexpensive to maintain and handle use of cane toad in experiments started in 1950s and by end of 1960s large numbers were being collected and exported to high schools and universities since then a number of australian states have introduced or tightened importation regulations even dead toads have value cane toad skin has been made into leather and novelty items stuffed cane toads posed and accessorised have found a home in tourist market and attempts have been made to produce fertiliser from their bodies invasive species cane toads pose a serious threat to native species when introduced to a new ecosystem classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries multiple reports exist of cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in biodiversity in that region most documented region of cane toad s invasion and subsequent effect on native species is australia where multiple surveys and observations of toad s conquest have been completed best way to illustrate this effect is through plight of northern quoll as well as mertens water monitor a large lizard native to south and southeast asia two sites were chosen to study effects of cane toads on northern quoll one of which was at mary river ranger station which is located in southern region of kakadu national park other site was located at north end of park in addition to these two sites a third site was located at east alligator ranger station and this site was used as a control site where cane toads would not interact with northern quoll population monitoring of quoll population began at mary river ranger station using radio tracking in 2002 months before first cane toads arrived at site after arrival of cane toads population of northern quolls in mary river site plummeted between october and december 2002 and by march 2003 northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of park as no northern quolls were caught in trapping trips in following two months in contrast population of northern quolls in control site at east alligator ranger station remained relatively constant not showing any symptoms of declining evidence from kakadu national park is compelling not only because of timing of population of northern quolls plummeting just months after arrival of cane toad but also because in mary river region 31 of mortalities within quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion as no signs of disease parasite infestation or any other obvious changes at site were found that could have caused such a rapid decline most obvious evidence that supports hypothesis that invasion of cane toads caused local extinction of northern quoll is that closely monitored population of control group in absence of cane toads showed no signs of decline in case of mertens water monitor only one region was monitored but over course of 18 months this region is located 70 km south of darwin at manton dam recreation area within manton dam recreation area 14 sites were set up to survey population of water monitors measuring abundance and site occupancy at each one seven surveys were conducted each of which ran for 4 weeks and included 16 site visits where each site was sampled twice per day for 2 consecutive days throughout 4 weeks each site visit occurred between 7 30 and 10 30 am and 4 00 7 00 pm when varanus mertensi can be viewed sunbathing on shore or wrapped around a tree branch close to shore whole project lasted from december 2004 to may 2006 and had a total of 194 sightings of varanus mertensi in 1568 site visits of seven surveys abundance was highest during second survey which took place in february 2005 2 months into project following this measurement abundance declined in next four surveys before declining sharply after second to last survey in february 2006 in final survey taken in may 2006 only two v mertensi lizards were observed cane toads were first recorded in region of study during second survey during february 2005 also when water monitor abundance was at its highest over course of study numbers of cane toad population stayed low for next year after introduction and then skyrocketed to its peak in last survey during may 2006 when compared two populations side by side clearly show that onset of cane toads had an immediate negative impact on monitors as their population began to drop in february 2005 which was when first cane toads entered manton dam recreation area at end of study some scattered populations of water monitors remained in upper sites of manton dam which suggests that local extinctions occurred at certain shoreline sites within manton dam but a complete extinction of population did not occur references notes bibliography external links species profile cane toad rhinella marina national invasive species information center united states national agricultural library lists general
