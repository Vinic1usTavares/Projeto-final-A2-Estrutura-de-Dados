held offices in english church and government nigel owed his advancement to his uncle as did nigel s probable brother alexander who like nigel was advanced to episcopal status nigel was educated on continent before becoming a royal administrator he served as treasurer of england under king henry before being appointed to see or bishopric of ely in 1133 his tenure was marked by conflicts with monks of his cathedral chapter who believed that nigel kept income for himself that should properly have gone to them following accession of henry i s successor king stephen nigel remained as treasurer only briefly before his family was ousted from political office by new king nigel rebelled and deserted to stephen s rival matilda but eventually reconciled with stephen although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts he never regained high office under stephen on king s death nigel was returned to by new king henry ii nigel s second tenure as treasurer saw him return administration to practices of henry i he withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164 following an attack of paralysis he was succeeded as treasurer by his son richard fitzneal whom he had trained in operations of exchequer or treasury of england most historians then and now have felt that nigel s administrative abilities were excellent he is considered to have been more talented

malmesbury a medieval chronicler considered both alexander and nigel to be well educated and diligent nigel attended consecration of bernard as bishop of st david s at westminster in 1115 and may have

appointment is unclear as until he became a bishop royal charters listed him as nephew of bishop roger of salisbury rather than by any office he held in 1131 though he was listed in a papal letter as nigel treasurer which securely establishes that he held office at that date in 1133 roger of salisbury secured bishopric of ely for nigel ely had been without a bishop since 1131 after two year vacancy king henry made appointment because he was settling outstanding business before leaving england to return to normandy at this time henry also appointed geoffrey rufus to durham and aethelwold

to king a plan by which abbey would become a bishopric presumably with abbot himself as bishop richard died before proposal could be put into operation but in 1109 custodian of vacant abbey secured permission to make change and became first bishop of ely however administrative changes needed to make abbey into a bishopric took longer and were still unresolved at time of nigel s appointment miller abbey and bishopric of ely pp 75 76 regardless nigel was constantly at court as shown by his appearance 31 times as a witness to charters during last 10 years of henry i s reign this left little time for administration of his diocese and nigel appointed a married clergyman ranulf of salisbury to administer diocese ranulf seems to have monks of cathedral chapter and nigel appears to have done little to protect his monks from abuse kealey roger of salisbury p 144 later during early years of stephen s reign nigel claimed to have uncovered a plot led by ranulf to assassinate normans exact nature of conspiracy is obscure and it is unclear what prompted it kealey roger of salisbury pp 167 168 medieval chronicler orderic vitalis claimed that ranulf planned to kill all normans in government and hand country over to scots after discovery of plot ranulf fled country and nigel made peace with monks of his cathedral chapter another source of conflict with his monks was desire of cathedral chapter to enjoy same liberty as a corporate body that bishops did in diocese this liberty was a group of rights that abbey had originally held and had transferred to bishop when abbey became a bishopric rights included sake and soke or right to command dues from land and right to levy tolls they also included right to hold courts dealing with theft miller abbey and bishopric of ely pp 26 27 around 1135 nigel conceded this point to monks miller abbey and bishopric of ely pp 199 200 although he restored some of lands that had been taken from monks by ranulf liber eliensis house

succession was disputed between king s nephews stephen and his elder brother theobald ii count of champagne and henry s surviving legitimate child matilda usually known as empress matilda because of her first marriage to holy roman emperor henry v king henry s only legitimate son william had died in 1120 after matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father who married her to geoffrey count of anjou all magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry s heir but when henry i died in 1135 stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald or matilda could react norman barons accepted stephen as duke of normandy and theobald contented himself with his possessions in france matilda though was less sanguine and secured support of scottish king david who was her maternal uncle and in 1138 also support of her half brother robert earl of gloucester an illegitimate son of henry i huscroft ruling england pp 71 73 after stephen s accession nigel was at first retained as treasurer but king came to suspect him and his family of secretly supporting empress matilda barlow english church p 95 prime movers behind stephen s suspicions against bishops were beaumont family headed by twin brothers robert earl of leicester and waleran count of meulan huscroft ruling england p 73 ref name yoshitake arrest of bishops journal

devizes sherborne malmesbury sleaford and newark callahan arrest of bishops haskins society journal p 98 beaumonts alleged that roger and his family were fortifying castles they held in preparation for turning them over to matilda they urged king to confiscate castles before they were lost although gesta stephani or deeds of king stephen a medieval chronicle of events of stephen s reign alleges that roger was disloyal to stephen evidence is against such action by roger as he had been an opponent of matilda since 1126 when she was first put forward as her father s heir roger and his family also had been early supporters of stephen s seizure of crown after henry i s death contemporary chronicler orderic vitalis felt that roger s family were going to betray king but william of malmesbury believed that allegations were based on envy from powerful laymen crouch beaumont twins pp 43 44 whatever roger s position nigel s own position on matilda is less clear and it is possible that he was never as opposed to her as his uncle kealey roger of salisbury p 186 no evidence survives that he was estranged from stephen however as nigel continued to witness charters throughout first four years of stephen s reign according to historian marjorie chibnall nigel s family may have been caught up in a dispute between henry of blois and beaumonts chibnall empress matilda p 79 arrest of bishops left thumb modern day remains of sleaford castle which once was in nigel s custody alt a small pile of stones overgrown with shrubs in 1139 supporters of roger and his family brawled in public with

in june 1139 stephen required roger of salisbury alexander of lincoln and nigel to surrender their castles as a consequence of brawl when roger and his family delayed king ordered their arrest nigel managed to escape arrest by fleeing to castle of devizes and king followed and began a siege crouch reign of king stephen p 96 king threatened to hang roger in front of castle unless it capitulated and nigel under pressure from roger s wife surrendered castle after siege had lasted three days all three bishops then submitted and surrendered their secular offices and castles they were however allowed to retain their dioceses nigel surrendered newark castle and sleaford castle both of which had been constructed by alexander pettifer english castles pp 148 201 stephen promptly gave newark to robert earl of leicester who was in turn excommunicated by alexander of lincoln crouch beaumont twins p 45 stephen s brother henry of blois who was bishop of winchester and papal legate in england called an ecclesiastical council at winchester on 29 august 1139 and summoned king to answer charges that he had unlawfully arrested clergy king refused to attend and sent a representative instead after meeting for a few days council was dismissed on 1 september without deciding anything except to appeal to pope in rome yoshitake arrest of bishops journal of medieval history p 99 in end appeal never reached rome yoshitake arrest of bishops journal of medieval history p 103 part of problem confronting assembled bishops was that stephen had not expelled roger s family from their ecclesiastical offices merely their secular ones stephen s representatives argued that bishops had given up their castles and money voluntarily to avoid secular charges defence taken by king was not novel it had been used before by william i and william ii against odo of bayeux and william de st calais respectively callahan arrest of bishops haskins society journal pp 99 101 traditionally arrest of bishops has been seen as a turning point in stephen s reign and event that turned ecclesiastical hierarchy against him recent historians have held a lively debate on issue a few still hold to traditional interpretation loyn english church pp 126 arrest of bishops haskins society journal pp 97 106 but most have decided that reactions in english church were more ambivalent yoshitake arrest of bishops journal of medieval history pp 97 king stephen pp 84 85 91 reign of king stephen pp 97 100 one modern historian david crouch believes that arrest of bishops signalled beginnings of anarchy not because of any alienation of church but through court politics where stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating factions of his court ascendency of beaumonts was marked by placement of one of their proteges philip de harcourt as chancellor roger died in december 1139 while in king s custody after death of his uncle nigel then in east anglia revolted in january 1140 he fortified isle of ely but was soon besieged and forced to flee davis king stephen p 41 even his own cathedral chapter refused to support him and his revolt collapsed in january nigel took refuge at court of stephen s rival empress matilda who had landed in england in south on 30 september 1139 in a bid to take throne revolt stood little chance of succeeding for there were no supporters of matilda close to east anglia and it is likely that nigel reacted more out of fear and anger at his uncle s death than anything else crouch reign of king stephen p 115 it appears likely that nigel appealed to pope innocent ii at this time for in october 1140 innocent issued a papal bull or papal instruction ordering restoration to nigel of lands of his bishopric and it appears that after capture of stephen matilda managed to restore nigel to ely briefly in 1141 nigel along with his brother alexander was one of supporters of matilda who after capture of stephen by matilda s forces reached an agreement with henry of blois to replace stephen with matilda on throne davis king stephen p 52 ultimately this agreement came to nothing when matilda s chief supporter her half brother robert of gloucester was captured and later exchanged for stephen huscroft ruling england p 74 stephen s release meant that king was free to send geoffrey de mandeville against nigel and nigel submitted to king probably in 1142 stephen s later reign in 1143 nigel became involved in a quarrel with powerful henry of blois charges of depriving a priest of a church giving church property to laymen and encouraging sedition were brought against nigel and he was forced to go to rome to defend himself only reaching rome in 1144 he did not return to his diocese until 1145 davis king stephen pp 77 78 he probably accompanied theobald of bec archbishop of canterbury who went to rome around this time on separate business saltman theobald p 20 while he was in rome pope lucius ii issued a number of rulings in nigel s favor ordering his restitution to ely he was then finally reconciled with stephen by paying a fine of ps200 and offering his son richard fitzneal as a hostage bartlett england under norman and angevin kings pp 49 50 while nigel was at rome ely was attacked by king s forces monks sent to geoffrey de mandeville for aid and geoffrey came and occupied isle of ely while king s forces occupied lands of diocese outside isle both occupying forces did damage to lands of diocese and cathedral chapter knowles monastic order pp 270 271 monks in liber eliensis complained that nigel had taken items from church to finance his trip to rome fairweather liber eliensis pp 400 401 and that they were required to help contribute to bribe when nigel was reconciled with stephen fairweather liber eliensis pp 411 412 by 1147 nigel was again witnessing stephen s charters and in 1153 or 1154 he was named in a grant of lands to st s priory in cambridge he assisted with consecration of hilary of chichester as bishop of chichester in august 1147 saltman theobald pp 100 101 he took part in shire courts in both norfolk and suffolk in 1150 and continued to assist with episcopal consecrations throughout remainder of stephen s reign saltman theobald pp 104 107 119 123 no records exist of him being involved with treasury affairs during this time his witnessing of charters is sparse and almost always in company with other bishops this suggests that he was only at court for councils or other similar events karn nigel historical research pp 302 303 nigel was a witness to stephen s charter that left england to matilda s son henry of anjou when henry succeeded stephen nigel was present at coronation return to exchequer after accession of henry ii nigel was summoned to reorganize exchequer or treasury that was responsible for production of government s financial records including pipe rolls karn nigel historical research pp 300 301 king had to ask nigel several times to return before bishop agreed and one reason for nigel s reluctance may have been that he would have to work with robert earl of leicester one of beaumonts who had been responsible for turning stephen against nigel s family in 1139 warren henry ii p 266 another of nigel s colleagues in administration was a layman richard de lucy who served as a justice until 1178 richard and sayles governance of mediaeval england p 167 nigel was only surviving minister of henry i and his knowledge of exchequer was needed to help reorganize revenues of king and restore administrative practices lost during stephen s reign huscroft ruling england p 155 lone pipe roll to survive from henry i s reign for year 1130 may be nigel s own copy brought with him to exchequer when he returned under henry ii nigel was able to increase revenues compared to what had been collected under stephen but he was unable to quickly return them to amounts collected under henry i matthew king stephen pp 218 219 it may have been nigel who urged king to attempt to recover estates that had been alienated during stephen s reign richardson and sayles governance of mediaeval england pp 262 263 pipe roll for 1155 1156 has several entries which declare that nigel was making decisions about monetary affairs and issuing writs but later pipe rolls do not contain any such entries it appears likely that after initial reorganization of exchequer nigel s involvement lessened he continued to be active though and obtained tax exemptions and other privileges until his death in 1169 his son richard fitzneal who is main source for information about nigel s career in exchequer stated that he fulfilled nigel s treasury duties when nigel was ill karn nigel historical research p 304 nigel continued to spar with robert earl of leicester and richard fitzneal relays a story about nigel and robert confronting each other at exchequer over traditional exemptions of barons of exchequer or judges of exchequer crouch beaumont twins p 91 among reforms carried out by nigel were restoration of blanch farm system whereby a random sample of coins was assayed and any shortage was collected from sheriff and restoration of collections from a swath of counties that had quit paying taxes during stephen s reign most substantial change was return to a unified system of finances which in turn required a reconciliation of two different systems in use by stephen and matilda karn nigel historical research p 305 despite nigel s reinstatement to exchequer and nomination of his son as treasurer nigel did not enjoy power that his uncle had wielded under henry i karn nigel historical research p 310 exact date of richard s appointment as treasurer is obscure but it was sometime between 1158 and 1160 as he is securely attested as treasurer in 1160 chrimes introduction to administrative history p 51 liber eliensis states that nigel paid king ps400 to secure office for richard some historians have seen nigel as henry ii s minister of finance richardson and sayles governance of mediaeval england p 150 nigel also served as a royal justice under henry ii although his relations with government had improved his relations with monks of his cathedral chapter which had never been good continued to be marked by quarrels in 1156 english pope adrian iv threatened to suspend nigel from office unless bishop restored all lands that had belonged to church when nigel became bishop restitution was hampered by absence of king from england and dispute dragged on until finally it was resolved by nigel pledging in front of theobald of bec archbishop of canterbury to restore lands by 1158 nigel had managed to restore enough possessions that adrian relaxed conditions saltman theobald p 150 even this did not end quarrels with monks as nigel then named a married clerk as sacrist of ely an action which was condemned by thomas becket new archbishop of canterbury nigel did manage to secure a reduction in assessment of knight s fees due from diocese

nigel died on 30 may 1169 in either 1164 or in 1166 or possibly both he had been struck by paralysis and after this he seems to have withdrawn from active affairs he took little part in disputes

possibly marks his tomb nigel was a married bishop poole domesday book to magna carta p 183 and his son richard fitzneal was later lord treasurer and bishop of london another son was william called william englishman richard who wrote dialogus de or dialogue concerning exchequer about procedures of exchequer had been taught those procedures by his father nigel s uncle roger had at least one son

probably starting around 1140 remains of one castle on cherry hill in ely probably date to nigel s fortifications miller abbey and bishopric of ely p 157 early in his time as bishop he was active in recovering lands of church that had been granted to knights by his predecessors and soon after his consecration he ordered an inquest made into lands actually owned by diocese and cathedral chapter miller abbey and bishopric of ely pp 167 169 bishop spent most of his life in debt but in year he died he managed to clear it with his son s help bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p 349 monks of his cathedral chapter did not like fact that they were required to pay for bishop s appeals to rome to recover his see or pay for regaining king s favour their dislike of their bishop is evident in liber eliensis matthew king stephen pp 136 137 art historian c r dodwell wrote of nigel s efforts when nigel needed to raise money in order to repair his own political fortunes he stripped down sold or used as security a quite astounding number of ely s monastic treasures these numbered crucifixes of gold and silver from anglo saxon past and they included an alb with gold embroidered apparels given by st aethelwold and a chasuble given by king edgar which was almost all of gold a gold and bejewelled textile covering was sold to bishop of lincoln alexander who took it with him to rome as a gift of particular splendour it is a biting commentary on attitudes of anglo norman to anglo saxon art that it was left to pope to point out that such an artistic heirloom should never have left ely in first place and to order its return dodwell anglo saxon art pp 220 221 most historians have seen nigel as an administrator not a religious bishop historian david knowles wrote that nigel had devoted all his energies and abilities to matters purely secular in department of financial administration he was supreme and more than any other man he helped to ensure continuity and development of excellent administrative practice initiated under henry i historian w l warren said that stephen probably paid dearly for dismissal of bishop roger of salisbury and bishop nigel of ely for expertise of exchequer was lodged in their expertise warren governance of norman and angevin england p 99 whatever nigel s administrative talent his ecclesiastical abilities are generally held to be low gesta stephani says of both him and alexander that they were men who loved display and were rash in their reckless presumption disregarding holy and simple manner of life that befits a christian
