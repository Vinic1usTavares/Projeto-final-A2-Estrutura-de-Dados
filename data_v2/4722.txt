monitors were designed to meet need of brazilian navy for small shallow draft armored ships capable of withstanding heavy fire during paraguayan war which saw argentina and brazil allied against paraguay two foreign built river monitors already in service drew enough water that they could not operate on shallower rivers in paraguay monitor configuration was chosen as a turreted design did not have same problems engaging enemy ships and fortifications as did casemate ironclads already in brazilian service oblong gun turret sat on a circular platform that had a central pivot it was rotated by four men via a system of gears 2 25 minutes were required for a full 360deg rotation a bronze ram was fitted to these ships as well hull was sheathed with muntz metal to reduce biofouling gratz p

itself weighed holley p 34 most unusually guns brazilian designed iron carriage was designed to pivot vertically at muzzle this was done to minimize size of gunport through which splinters and shells could enter gratz p 155 armor hull of para class ships was made from three layers of wood that alternated in orientation it was thick and was capped with a layer of peroba hardwood ships had a
