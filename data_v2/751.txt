harry s walls are remains of an unfinished artillery fort started in 1551 by government of edward vi to defend island of st mary s in isles of scilly constructed to defend harbour of hugh town from possible french attack fortification incorporated italianate style bastions with protective orillons and would have been most advanced design in kingdom at time it was not completed probably due to a shortage of funds and passing of invasion threat and only south west side remains in 21st century harry s walls are managed by english heritage and open to visitors history in 16th century isles of scilly were ruled by king of england they were an important strategic location on route between mainland europe ireland and scotland but threatened by forces of france and spain under henry viii a sequence of defensive works called device programme had been built to protect english mainland from french attack but although a garrison was established at castle on island of st mary s no actual construction work was carried out in islands after henry s death in 1547 his nine year old son edward vi assumed throne with government controlled by edward seymour duke of somerset his brother thomas inspected scilly resulting in new investments in their defences initially focused on island of tresco duke fell from power in 1549 and a fresh survey was conducted by captain william tyrrell work then began on protecting island of st mary s thumb left diagram from early 1550s depicting intent for harry s walls produced after work had started in may 1551 john killigrew captain of pendennis castle in falmouth was ordered to construct a fort on st mary s probably with intent of guarding entrance to new harbour at hugh town his instructions stated that it was to be positioned upon little hill betwixt water and st marie roode and was accompanied by a promise that lead would be sent for roofing that summer a document from early 1550s noted that a brewhouse and a mill were ready to be sent to st mary s from south wales as part of project to be installed by fresh water pond name harry s walls is result of defences being popularly but incorrectly attributed to edward s father henry contemporary plans showed an intention to create a square fortification with four angular arrow head bastions with protective orillons with living quarters arranged around a square courtyard for garrison in centre it was intended to develop italianate ideas first introduced in portsmouth and yarmouth under henry and would have been what historian andrew saunders considers to be most advanced piece of military engineering for its date to be seen in this country in 1554 two light artillery guns called sakers were reported installed in fort during reign of mary i an unsuccessful attempt was made to create a garrison of 150 men on island in 1554 partially to provide manpower to complete project and in 1591 proposals were again put forward to complete work defences were never completed instead new defences were constructed at star castle in 1593 and remains of harry s walls were used in 17th and 18th centuries for dumping of rubbish earlier analysis blamed poor siting of harry s walls for abandonment of project antiquary william borlase was critical of fort during his 1752 visit noting that it had been begun in a poor location writer john troutbeck who visited at end of 18th century argued that if fortification had been completed it would have been of little use being placed too far within head lands and commanding none of sounds to any effect during 20th century criticism was levied about its position in relation to anchorage and about size of site which was felt to be both too small for proposed design and too difficult to defend thumb detail of granite walling more recent research suggests that that fortification actually commanded harbour adequately no single site would have been completely effective due to rugged coastline and that harry s walls may have been designed to work in concert with another fort furthermore fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend due to surrounding water and marshland instead high costs of england s wider fortification programme edward s government spent an unsustainable ps35 228 on construction work during five years of his reign are blamed for making its completion unviable particularly once french invasion threat had passed south west side of fort comprising two bastions and a connecting curtain wall made of granite blocks and rubble is well preserved angular bastions and their orillons are across and high while curtain wall is long and high exterior blocks have been robbed in various places exposing rubble interior an unfinished defensive ditch long wide and deep runs along outside a prehistoric standing stone later used to help navigation at sea is positioned just to north of fort with a modern navigational aid positioned alongside it in 21st century these remains are managed by english heritage and open to public remains are protected under uk law as an ancient monument see also listed buildings in tresco isles of
