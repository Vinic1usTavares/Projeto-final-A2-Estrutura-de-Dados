production development in september 2015 following airing of season s premiere in which location of character jemma simmons was revealed to be an alien planet executive producer jeffrey bell stated that at some point we will fully explore what s happened to her he called it craziest thing we ve done a different kind of episode next month marvel announced that episode fifth of season would be titled 4 722 hours it is written by craig titley with jesse bochco directing for 4 722 hours instead of normal title sequence used in season series title in episode s typeface silently fades onto screen over back drop of planet simmons is stranded on writing decision to dedicate an entire episode to simmons time on planet was made so that character could rejoin rest of cast early in season while avoiding having second season s cliffhanger feel worthless because she s back and she s fine use of titular hours to mark passage of time came about after idea of planet not having a sunrise was set as using days was then no longer reasonable series writers room worked together to break story which took around an hour and a half rather than usual few weeks series writer and supervising producer brent fletcher came up with an idea to split 4 722 hours into five acts with each written like chapter of book acts were given labels such as stranger and plan and this structure served as basis for titley s script though many similarities were noted between episode and film martian titley had not seen film when he was writing script and instead was inspired by general science fiction trope of a person alone on a planet and such films as enemy mine elizabeth henstridge described episode as a coming of age story i think we see simmons at start and she s never really been combat ready we see her have to survive and just to see her go on this journey from complete despair henstridge also noted thriller elements in episode on moment in 4 722 hours where simmons loses hope henstridge explained i never thought we d see her get to that place it justifies her relationship with will too because she was ready to end it all and he was one who pulled her back from brink concerning that relationship with new character will daniels executive producers worked with titley to try to make it feel earned in episode given fan following of fitzsimmons potential relationship between simmons and leo fitz executive producer jed whedon also noted on this that episode wasn t a story about two of them on this planet but a story about fitz hearing this and how he will respond he breaks your heart at end she breaks your heart and hopefully you re feeling for all three involved having nasa astronauts travel to planet in 2001 was a reference to 2001 a space odyssey which also featured a monolith while titley named daniels fellow astronauts after his favorite cinematic astronauts austin from six million dollar man taylor from planet of apes and brubaker from capricorn one casting in october 2015 marvel revealed that main cast members clark gregg ming na wen brett dalton chloe bennet iain de caestecker henstridge nick blood adrianne palicki henry simmons and luke mitchell would star as phil coulson melinda may grant ward daisy johnson leo fitz jemma simmons lance hunter bobbi morse alphonso mack mackenzie and lincoln campbell respectively however majority of cast does not ultimately appear with only henstridge and de caestecker playing notable roles whedon said that others basically had a week off dillon casey guest stars as will daniels on series having an episode revolving around a single character whedon said we have a lot of people on show and we felt like this year was year to start branching off into things like this so we just committed wholeheartedly in casting casey as daniels producers wanted someone who was older than henstridge physically unlike de caestecker and doesn t look like simmons type to make it less clear that they would end up together filming majority of episode was filmed in a work quarry in simi valley and in northridge los angeles near mojave desert during day with director of photography feliks parnell using a filtering effect inspired by mad max fury road to make it appear to be night time this was seen to be more practical than night shooting in desert given that almost every scene takes place during 18 year long night on planet because of this production struggled with intense heat of desert around 22 minutes of extra footage was shot for episode that had to be cut including a subplot in which simmons loses her grandmother s necklace and daniels finds it for her on how continuity was emphasized during making of episode bochco explained that for each of episode s five acts there was a different stage of hair makeup and wardrobe so crew could depict physical changes to simmons as time progresses rather than try and film episode in complete order which was impossible due to location scheduling needs production just tried to avoid changing from one stage to another and then back again on how much episode shows entity on planet bochco and titley compared it to shark in jaws with this episode just showing its fin from time to time and a bigger reveal of creature coming in a later episode release 4 722 hours was first aired in united states on abc on october 27 2015 episode

involving this was oliver sava at a v club graded episode an a calling it a high point of series that shows value of breaking from established formula he noted how episode played to different strengths than similar martian focusing on more personal aspects of simmons journey rather than s h i e l d s attempts to rescue her he praised performances of henstridge and casey episode s simple yet effective use of colored filters in comparison to series usual drab color palette and depiction of simmons loss of hope and developing relationship with daniels despite predictable progression of story den of geeks rob leane was less positive praising brave decision to focus on simmons and henstridge s performance while noting undeniable similarities between episode and martian and panning introduction of daniels as more like a plot device than a real driving force for episode and unwanted introduction of a love triangle to series molly freeman writing for screen rant called 4 722 hours a strong hour of television featuring a dramatic risk in focusing on simmons that she felt paid off freeman stated once dramatic arc of episode is established it takes a fairly standard route but performance of henstridge helps to bring enough emotion to give storyline weight that it needs kevin fitzpatrick at screen crush called episode inventive and unexpected and a brilliant gamble praising henstridge s performance and immersive quality of episode especially investment in simmons personal development with daniels and attempts to escape planet which he felt was only occasionally marred by required exposition of its more improbable elements fitzpatrick positively compared 4 722 hours to buffy vampire slayer episode hush joseph mccabe of nerdist stated on episode this week s agents of s h i e l d is so good that it leaves me in a state of pessimism because i can t see any way to follow it up that gives a satisfying resolution to story it so beautifully presents he called it one of very finest episodes s h i e l d has given us and one of few a viewer with almost no prior knowledge of show can fully appreciate and praised handling of simmons and daniels relationship saying that henstridge and casey complement one another marvelously discussing episode for vox caroline framke called it astonishing praising decision to dedicate an episode to simmons ordeal rather than just reveal it through flashbacks in normal episodes as well as efforts of bochco titley and henstridge and use of sinister on screen hour counter also reviewing episode for den of geek marc buxton scored it 4 5 stars out 5 calling it most experimental episode of agents of s h i e l d to date and it might have been finest hour of series so far buxton felt that episode retroactively improved earlier
