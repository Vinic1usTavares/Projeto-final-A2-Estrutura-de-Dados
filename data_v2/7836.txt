joint expedition against franklin was a joint engagement between united states army and navy against confederate states army during american civil war engagement was intended to move union forces into an area where confederate forces were gathering as they prepared to move on suffolk virginia originally planned as a coordinated two pronged attack with a naval flotilla supporting an infantry advance on franklin virginia communications delays caused union navy to start mission before army was ready to support it instead found union naval forces on blackwater river greatly outnumbered by confederate infantrymen and ultimately forced to retreat naval action alone is also known as action at crumpler s bluff or battle of crumpler s bluff simultaneously a nearby army reconnaissance team conducted a failed assault on town on basis that audibly nearby naval forces which they did not know were then in retreat would bring support outcome left union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded dialogue between officers following conflict left union navy questioning usefulness of gunboats in joint expedition settings in which they would not be capable of supporting themselves conflict background receiving orders early september 12 1862 confederate army s 4th north carolina nc cavalry immediately proceeded from north carolina to franklin virginia arriving late next day there 4th nc cavalry under command of a colonel dennis dozier ferebee was joined by 52nd north carolina infantry edward graham s petersburg artillery and two weeks later 11th north carolina infantry

september 23 peck sent colonel samuel p spear to reconnoiter franklin and confederates therein spear reported back to peck about confederate s replacement bridge capable of supporting artillery pieces as well as an estimated confederate concentration of 10 000 12 000 men peck forwarded this information on to his commanding officer major general john adams dix who in turn developed a twofold mission to enemy from franklin and destroy floating bridge with a joint service attack with union army and navy respectively thumb left lcdr c w flusser 1864 dix requested union naval support from acting rear

commander flusser never received word former s forces were delaying until about 10th peck did however order a reconnaissance mission be undertaken in area at 9 00 p m on october 2 colonel spear left suffolk with 1 300 soldiers one artillery section and orders to survey franklin and determine extent of confederate forces south of suffolk attack thumb 1861 65 on pamunkey river thumb undated photo

began moving towards city while shelling nearby banks attack was led by commodore perry followed by whitehead astern hunchback while union shelled banks of blackwater confederate troops began distributing themselves along riverside to take advantage of concealment there some of 4th north carolina cavalry was dismounted and taken up by colonel marshall of 52nd and positioned along with his men at crumpler s and neighboring bluffs to fire upon riverboats colonel ferebee took rest of 4th nc cavalry and dismounted and positioned them behind trees and bushes along banks of blackwater under command of a lieutenant ruffin according to a union naval officer later confederate s forces along blackwater also included some irregulars and even some negroes at 7 00 a m approximately from franklin commodore perry came under fire from confederate forces along river and atop bluffs as perry was too close to bring her large bore guns to bear commander flusser ordered his sailors to shelter themselves as best they could while ship tried to steam past enemy unfortunately due to narrowness of bend commodore perry ran aground lt ruffin and his men were so close to grounded riverboat they later claimed to have heard perrys officers cursing her enlisted sailors freeing herself perry rounded bend and maneuvered to provide suppressive fire to allow hunchback and whitehead to follow combined shelling of all three ships forced lt ruffin and his detachment to withdraw from banks of river however all three ships progress was soon halted by a barricade in river while barricade was removable with commander flusser s available manpower he could not attempt to do so due to terrible fire to which they were exposed while continuing to assault confederacy with their ix inch grape and shell guns 32 pounder guns field gun and muskets three ships waited at barricade hoping to hear gunfire of general dix s infantry forces at 10 15 a m commander flusser ordered retreat from river barrier all three ships remained under heavy fire by enemy forces from multiple angles until between 2 30 and 3 30 p m an incomplete rear barricade of felled trees failed to stop ships which pushed through with a heavy head of steam flusser later opined that this new barricade would have been impassable had ships remained north of it for several more hours waiting for general dix s quiescent forces meanwhile colonel spear arrived around 1 00 p m and anticipating support from now retreating naval gunships union infantrymen conflicted with confederates in franklin after six hours of combat running low on ammunition realizing that he only had 1 300 men and not 1 700 2 000 he d thought and losing two riflemen to confederate defection spear withdrew union forces around franklin and returned to suffolk abandoning one brass field piece a few overcoats and a horse aftermath upon return to sound commander flusser sent hunchback on to plymouth to bury their dead sailors at roanoke island flusser was lent to carry wounded to norfolk hospital outcome confederate forces around franklin held back navy and ultimately forced them and army reconnaissance team to retreat while union navy lost no ships they suffered four casualties and 15 wounded army suffered one fatality and six wounded although general dix believed infantry to have robbed enemy of 70 100 in return for confederates this was 4th nc cavalry s first combat action of war and gave colonel ferebee and his men confidence in their abilities they and other confederate forces in franklin spent rest of october 1862 surveilling union forces across river after union shelling most of franklin s civilians left town leaving it in hands of confederate soldiers there they did not return until after april 1865
