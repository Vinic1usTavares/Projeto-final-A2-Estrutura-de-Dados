thumb book cover of 1953 edition of rommel papers edited by it was one of foundational texts that helped to build and spread rommel legend as one of components of overarching myth of clean wehrmacht rommel myth or rommel legend is a phrase used by a number of historians for common depictions of german field marshal erwin rommel as an apolitical brilliant commander and a victim of nazi germany due to his presumed participation in 20 july plot against adolf hitler which led to his forced suicide in 1944 according to these historians who take a critical view of rommel such depictions are not accurate description of rommel as a brilliant commander started in 1941 with rommel s participation as a component of nazi propaganda to praise wehrmacht and instil optimism in german public it was picked up and disseminated in west by british war time press as allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat axis forces in north africa genius of rommel was used by dissenters to protest against social inequality within british army and by leaders like churchill to reduce class tensions following war western allies and particularly british depicted rommel as good german and our friend rommel adhering closely to tenets of myth of clean wehrmacht his reputation for conducting a clean war was used in interests of west german rearmament during cold war and reconciliation between former enemies united kingdom and united states on one side and new federal republic of germany on other 1950 biography rommel desert fox and 1953 publication of rommel papers added to myth which has proven resilient to critical examination mythology surrounding rommel has been subject of analysis in recent decades reevaluation has produced new interpretations of rommel including his relationship with nazism his abilities as an operational and strategic level commander and his role in 20 july plot to assassinate hitler historians and commentators conclude that rommel remains an ambiguous figure not easily definable either inside or outside myth terminology early authors such as desmond young and basil liddell hart mention rommel legend in their respective books liddell hart described british efforts to make counterpropaganda against rommel s military reputation while showing respect to his conduct of war thus british commanders and headquarter staffs were compelled to make strenuous efforts to dispel rommel legend as early as 1950 bernard montgomery s former deputy referred to myth in an article titled rommel myth debunked where he aimed to address perceived misconceptions regarding fighting in north african campaign as used by german authors mythos rommel roughly translated into english as rommel myth is a neutral description as can be seen in works by historians such as peter lieb term recognizes per lieb that rommel is and remains a mythos he could not be stuck in a single drawer at any rate one should decide for oneself whether one sees him as a role model or not german authors who use word mythos in this neutral manner include jorg guido knopp and sandra mass origins origins of myth can be found first in rommel s drive for success as a young officer in world war i and then in his popular 1937 book infanterie an infantry attacks that was written in a style that diverged from german military literature of time book became a bestseller and was supposedly read by adolf hitler historian antony beevor places start of rommel legend on 13 may 1940 during battle of france when rommel s troops crossed meuse under fire and established bridgeheads at houx and dinant in nazi and allied propaganda thumb left rommel at paris victory parade june 1940 rommel had access to reich propaganda minister joseph goebbels via karl hanke who served under rommel in 1940 rommel s victories in france were featured in german press and in february 1941 film sieg im victory in west in which he personally helped direct a segment reenacting crossing of somme river rommel s victories in 1941 were played up by nazi propaganda even though his successes in north africa were achieved in germany s least strategically valued theatre of war in november 1941 joseph goebbels head of reich ministry of propaganda wrote about his intention to have rommel elevated to a kind of popular hero rommel with his innate abilities as a military commander and love of spotlight was a perfect fit for role goebbels designed for him in north africa rommel received help in cultivating his image from alfred berndt a senior official at reich propaganda ministry who had volunteered for military service seconded by goebbels berndt was assigned to rommel s staff and became one of his closest aides berndt often acted as liaison between rommel propaganda ministry and fuhrer headquarters he directed rommel s photo shoots and filed radio dispatches describing battles in spring of 1941 rommel s name began to appear in british media in autumn of 1941 and early winter of 1941 1942 he was mentioned in british press almost daily daily express and cairns post wrote no von nonsense about erich nor code of conduct such as it was that most prussian officers have honoured in war he is a gangster general trained in a harder school than chicago he was hitler s thug organiser before he came to power so erich became leader of s s black guard hitler s private army which executes his private revenges and guards his person when at last poland made a stand for democracy it was rommel who led a panzer corps against polish horse cavalry with conspicuous gallantry later in france hitler made him a knight of iron cross for breaking through maginot line at maubeuge with 7th armoured division true french resistance was almost at an end then but erich was entitled to his decoration too toward end of year reich propaganda machine also used rommel s successes in africa as a diversion from wehrmacht s challenging situation in soviet union with stall of operation barbarossa american press soon began to take notice of rommel as well following united states entry into war on 11 december 1941 writing that british admire him because he beat them and were surprised to have beaten in turn such a capable general general claude auchinleck distributed a directive to his commanders seeking to dispel notion that rommel was a superman battle of kasserine pass during tunisian campaign intensified gis admiration towards rommel cult of personality was so strong that according to peter for remainder of war german pows would part with pictures of rommel as reluctantly as gis were eager to get them while allied troops respected rommel civilians held widely accepted negative image of rommel s origin and his connection with nazis as described by rosie goldschmidt waldeck who debunked invented story and new york times in 1943 it has been said that rommel started his career as a hitler hoodlum and owes his quick rise to his early collaboration with himmler this line of propaganda perpetuated until war ended according to atkinson to counter perverse chivalry war without hate in rommel s words that rommel promoted british and american authorities instituted hate training and tried to raise eagerness to kill enemies by stressing enemy brutality as well as slaughterhouse blood in assault training courses general john notes same difference in attitudes to war between leaderships of two sides attention of western and especially british press thrilled goebbels who wrote in his diary in early 1942 rommel continues to be recognised darling of even enemies news agencies rommel was pleased by media attention both domestic and foreign often discussing it in letters to his wife hitler took note of british propaganda as well commenting in summer of 1942 that britain s leaders must have hoped to be able to explain their defeat to their own nation more easily by focusing on rommel rommel was german commander most frequently covered in german media and only one to be given a press conference which took place in october 1942 press conference was moderated by goebbels and was attended by both domestic and foreign media rommel declared today we have gates of egypt in hand and with intent to act keeping focus on rommel distracted german public from wehrmacht losses elsewhere as tide of war began to turn he became a symbol that was used to reinforce german public s faith in an ultimate axis victory military reverses in wake of british victory at second battle of el alamein in november 1942 and other military reverses propaganda ministry directed media to emphasise rommel s invincibility charade was maintained until spring of 1943 even as german situation in africa became increasingly precarious in may 1943 to ensure that inevitable defeat in africa would not be associated with rommel s name goebbels had supreme high command announce that rommel was on a two month leave for health reasons instead campaign was presented by berndt who resumed his role in propaganda ministry as a ruse to tie down british empire while germany was turning europe into an impenetrable fortress with rommel at helm of this success after radio program ran in may 1943 rommel sent berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude thumb one of many nazi propaganda photographs of rommel s inspection tours along atlantic wall although rommel then entered a period without a significant command he remained a household name in germany synonymous with aura of invincibility hitler then made rommel part of his defensive strategy for fortress europe europa by sending him to west to inspect fortifications along atlantic wall goebbels supported decision noting in his diary that rommel was undoubtedly suitable man for task propaganda minister expected move to reassure german public and at same time to have a negative impact on allied forces morale in france a wehrmacht propaganda company frequently accompanied rommel on his inspection trips to document his work for both domestic and foreign audiences in may 1944 german newsreels reported on rommel s speech at a wehrmacht conference where he stated his conviction that every single german soldier will make his contribution against anglo american spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in rommel when rommel was seriously wounded on 17 july 1944 propaganda ministry undertook efforts to conceal injury so as not to undermine domestic morale despite this news leaked to british press to counteract rumors of a serious injury and even death rommel was required to appear at a press conference held on 1 august on 3 august german press published an official report that rommel had been injured in a car accident rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of truth belatedly realising how much reich propaganda was using him for its own ends post war quoting correlli barnett desert war entered british folk memory a source of legend endlessly re written as both history and fiction historian lucio ceva argues that even though myth was of british origin it found its reflections in post war west germany historian peter caddick adams suggests that following his forced suicide rommel emerged as acceptable face of german militarism good german who stood apart from nazi regime ground was thus fertile for myth to be reborn after war in interest of program of german rearmament and allied west german reconciliation after outbreak of korean war in 1950 it became clear to americans and british that a german army would have to be revived to help face off against soviet union many former german officers including adolf heusinger and hans speidel who had served on rommel s staff in france were convinced that no future west german army would be possible without rehabilitation of wehrmacht in october 1950 at behest of west german chancellor konrad adenauer a group of former senior officers produced document that later became known as memorandum intended as both a planning and a negotiating tool document included a key demand for measures to transform domestic and foreign public opinion with regards to german military foundational works rommel s former enemies especially british played a key role in manufacture and propagation of myth german rearmament was highly dependent on moral rehabilitation that wehrmacht needed journalist and historian basil liddell hart an early proponent of these two interconnected initiatives provided first widely available source on rommel in his 1948 book on hitler s generals updated in 1951 portraying rommel as an outsider to nazi regime in 1948 edition liddell hart concluded 1951 text with comments on rommel s gifts and performance that qualified him for a place in role of great captains of history five graves to cairo film 1943 movie five graves to cairo directed by billy wilder was only wartime movie that featured a german general as a major character according to battistelli erich von stroheim s portrayal of rommel might have been far from reality but it certainly contributed to give rise to rommel s myth in june 1943 magazine life comments it will not win any academy awards but is an important film for it re introduces erich von stroheim as screen s arch villain in a prussian uniform this time portraying nazi s much touted field marshal rommel forgetting his early caricatures of pompous prussians he plays field marshal rommel with much finesse shows him to be human as well as cunning brutal and vain film exploits one of standard wartime german stereotypes that of cold ruthless aristocratic junker officer portraying rommel as a wilhelmine officer complete with duelling scars and unbending authority film historian bernard f dick remarks that stroheim s rommel already had sympathetic traits too considering rommel himself was a person screenwriters found hard to vilify or rommel desert fox other foundational text was influential and laudatory 1950 biography rommel desert fox by brigadier desmond young young had served in north africa in indian army in a public relations capacity and was once taken prisoner by rommel s troops young interviewed rommel s widow extensively and worked with several individuals who had been close to him including hans speidel with liddell hart also supporting project speidel had already written in 1946 that he planned to turn rommel into hero of german people to give them a positive role model rommel was a suitable candidate since manner of his death had led to assumption that he had not been a supporter of nazism young subscribed to this view subtly conveying that rommel served regime but was not part of it result was predictably positive bordering on hagiography according to historian patrick major reception of desert fox in britain was enthusiastic book went through eight editions in a year young s biography was another step in development of rommel myth with rommel emerging as an active if not a leading plotter speidel contributed as well starting from early 1950s to bring up rommel s and his own role in plot thus boosting speidel s suitability for a future role in new military force of federal republic bundeswehr and then in nato book was not without its detractors review in time magazine noted legendary status rommel had achieved in his lifetime and quoted another review that described rommel as british army s favorite german general time reviewer concluded that book was just this side of hero worship quoting ernest bevin a noted labour politician it alluded to book being an example of trade union of generals in action field marshal claude auchinleck in a foreword to book honoured rommel as a soldier and a man and field marshal archibald wavell included him among chosen few among very brave very true reviewer noted obvious admiration young had for german generals and that book may well have been written by one richard crossman a labour mp objected to portrayal of rommel as an anti nazi writing as a nation we deceive ourselves into believing that there are two sorts of germans good german and bad german bad germans are nazis militarists anti democratic and perpetrators of atrocities good germans are peace loving democrats and real gentlemen ergo since rommel was a clean fighter he must have been anti nazi and men like him would make good allies of democracy against russians historian hugh trevor roper commented that danger now is not that our friend rommel is becoming not a magician or a bogy man but too much of a hero he pointed out rommel s early proximity to hitler he described rommel as representative of connection between nazism and wehrmacht and support that german officer corps offered for hitler s politics and hitler s war desert fox film 1951 film desert fox story of rommel based on young s biography portrayed rommel in a sympathetic way as a loyal humane soldier and a firm opponent to hitler s policies film played up rommel s disputed role in conspiracy against hitler while omitting rommel s early association with dictator writing in daily telegraph under title rommel a flattering and unconvincing portrait journalist malcolm muggeridge who had served in intelligence in north africa during war commented that film represented a tendency towards collective schizophrenia whereas chivalry towards a captured brigadier is in no wise incompatible with a foreign policy of perfidy and brutal disregard for all elementary of civilised behaviour critical and public response in u s was muted but it was a commercial success in britain along with a less known 1953 film desert rats where james mason reprised his portrayal of rommel film received nearly universally positive reviews in britain while protests at cinemas broke out in vienna and milan liddell hart watched film with a group of high ranking british officers and reported being pleasantly surprised patrick major argues that desert war indeed proved a suitable space to effect reconciliation among former enemies british popular history focused on that theatre of war almost to exclusion of all others he states that desert fox had a catalytic effect in creating an image of german armed forces that would be acceptable to british public rommel was thus successfully integrated into myth of clean wehrmacht petra rau argues that mason s rommel contrasting with five graves to cairo rommel here was presented as representation of british virtues and thus a sympathetic figure like other good germans in popular culture is not portrayed as representative of germans but rather an exceptional case who was surrounded by real nazis rommel papers thumb upright british historian b h liddell hart s introduction to rommel papers drew comparisons between rommel and lawrence of arabia two masters of desert warfare 1953 saw publication of rommel s writings of war period as rommel papers edited by british journalist and historian b h liddell hart former wehrmacht officer fritz bayerlein who served on rommel s staff in north africa and rommel s widow and son volume contained an introduction and commentary by liddell hart historian mark connelly argues that rommel papers was one of two foundational works that lead to a rommel renaissance and anglophone rehabilitation other being young s biography book contributed to perception of rommel as a brilliant commander in an introduction liddell hart drew comparisons between rommel and lawrence of arabia two masters of desert warfare meanwhile liddell hart had a personal interest in work by having coaxed rommel s widow to include material favourable to himself he could present rommel as his pupil when it came to mobile armoured warfare thus liddell hart s theory of indirect approach became a precursor to german blitzkrieg lightning war controversy was described by political scientist john mearsheimer in his work weight of history who concluded that by putting words in mouths of german generals and manipulating history liddell hart was in a position to show that he had been at root of dramatic german successes in 1940 uncritical accounts trend continued with other uncritical biographies such as rommel as military commander 1968 by former british soldier and author ronald lewin and knight s cross a life of field marshal erwin rommel 1994 by former british general david fraser these works focused on rommel s military career it and presenting him strictly as a soldier in another work on north african campaign 1977 life and death of africa korps lewin wrote that it was necessary to assert that purity of desert purified desert war while fraser focused on rommel s battlefield performance and described him as a hero fraser s biography remains a work of high reputation with pier paolo battistelli praising it for outstanding handling of issue of rommel s myth as well as his life and career in general however work has been criticised by historian mark connelly as ing post 1945 hagiographic approach connelly offers example of fraser s description of rommel as one of great masters of manoeuvre in war whose personality transcends time and cuts like a sabre through curtains of history historian patrick major points out that a recent work 2002 book alamein war without hate by colin smith and john bierman borrowed name of rommel s posthumous memoirs for its subtitle connelly includes works by sir john squire and general sir john hackett in uncritical tradition in contrast german biographies such as by journalist wolf heckmann were far less sympathetic elements of myth some early authors who wrote about rommel during war and post war biographers use word legend or myth when describing various pieces of propaganda and rumours that nazi government and allied press spread about life and character of rommel these rumours usually ignored his middle class background and highlighted his connection with lower classes and his early adherence to national socialism or hitler using several invented anecdotes most notable of these according to charles f marshall was that rommel was a storm trooper which was designed by nazi propaganda to show what heights a storm trooper could claim and promote impression of rommel as an ardent nazi supporter at same time that several american encyclopaedias still published a decade after war thumb upright an iconic picture of rommel as common man helping to free up his staff car alongside his men according to historian mark connelly young and liddell hart laid foundation for anglo american myth which consisted of three themes rommel s ambivalence towards nazism his military genius and emphasis of chivalrous nature of fighting in north africa their works lent support to image of clean wehrmacht and were generally not questioned since they came from british authors rather than german revisionists leading german news magazine der spiegel describes myth as gentleman warrior military genius according to watson most dominant element in rommel myth is rommel superior soldier second being rommel common man and last one rommel martyr rosie goldschmidt waldeck writing in 1943 also takes note of image of general who fought with common soldiers with an indelible youthfulness and apparent invulnerability historian sandra mass considers rommel myth a hero cult a synthesis of old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from germany s largely imaginary colonial past in particular proletarian hero cult originally represented by carl peters and bourgeois one represented by paul von lettow vorbeck rommel as portrayed by this hero cult was both chivalrous and ruthless young and old harsh and gentle strong and righteous calder duffy and ricci opine that rommel s military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent that because he was skilled at his profession he must have been an anti nazi hero reevaluation post 1990s scholarship examined rommel s attitude towards national socialism his performance as a military commander his role in 20 july plot and his motivations leading to a more diverse range of interpretations of rommel and elements of myth relationship with national socialism thumb left adolf hitler accompanied by rommel far left inspects troops in goslar 1934 this was first meeting between two men rommel was not a member of nazi party however like other wehrmacht officers he welcomed hitler s seizure of power during his time in goslar he clashed with those sturmabteilung sa men who attacked jews and others who supported them rommel thus showed sympathy towards hitler s elimination of sa believing worst was now over although he opined that in future fuhrer should learn to see his own true strength and refrain from such illegal processes remy dated rommel s support for hitler as 1935 noting a speech in which rommel praised hitler for restoring german s self respect and establishment of way towards an honourable and righteous peace as well as efforts in alleviating disadvantaged people s problems numerous historians such as ralf georg reuth david t zabecki bruce allen watson and peter caddick adams state that rommel was one of hitler s favorite generals and that his close relationship with dictator benefited both his inter war and war time career historian robert citino describes rommel as not apolitical and writes that he owed his career to hitler to whom his attitude was worshipful while historian charles messenger describes rommel s growing admiration towards hitler following invasion of poland speaking at national wwii museum s 2012 international conference on world war ii author nigel hamilton referred to rommel as quite a nazi this sympathy did not extend to party though in this regard he was similar to many other wehrmacht soldiers who with encouragement from hitler erroneously believed army to be most important element of regime rommel showed particular resentment towards sa and later ss for their brutality and absorption of resources and personnel historian alaric searle recasts rommel s early involvement with nazi regime including his role as a liaison between hitler youth and wehrmacht young s biography had described rommel s role in strictly military terms and alluded to a falling out between him and hitler youth leader baldur von schirach on ideological grounds in fact rommel had twice proposed a plan that would have subordinated hitler youth to army removing it from nsdap control that went against schirach s wishes resulting in rommel s quiet removal from project searle describes as patently false another of young s assertions namely that rommel first became close to hitler because hitler had read infantry attacks and wanted to meet author in fall of 1938 this casts doubt on rest of young s narrative as it pertains to rommel s relationship with dictator searle writes that by this time like many other front line officers with little awareness of military planning underway rommel was simply trying to carry out his orders remy points out that incident of rommel using tanks to protect a journey of hitler which has been used by reuth and irving to prove that rommel came to hitler s attention in 1936 actually happened in 1939 in 1936 according to remy rommel was only a part of elaborate spectacle that welcomed hitler and there was no evidence for interaction between two thumb rommel to right of hitler in poland september 1939 during campaign rommel enjoyed close proximity to dictator searle argues that rommel not only found favor with nazi regime but was delighted with preferential treatment he was receiving including access to hitler during 1939 invasion of poland during campaign rommel served as commander of fuhrerbegleitbrigade battalion tasked with guarding hitler and his field headquarters he attended hitler s daily war briefings and had opportunities for one on one conversations with dictator which he proudly reported in letters to his wife in a sign that he lost touch with reality as searle puts it rommel wrote to his wife in october 1939 from devastated warsaw where he was organising a victory parade there has been no water no power no gas no food for two days they have erected numerous barricades which blocked civilian movement and exposed people to bombardments from which they could not escape mayor estimated number of dead and injured to be 40 000 inhabitants probably drew a breath of relief that we have arrived and rescued them in 1939 rommel received a promotion from hitler to rank of generalmajor ahead of more senior officers showalter notes that even at this early stage hitler already regarded rommel as a model for fusion of germany s new and old orders with an intervention by hitler rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured panzer division despite having been turned down by army s personnel office which had offered him command of a mountain division rommel s unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of hitler s favoured commanders after fall of france rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on 7th division rommel received a letter of thanks unknown to rommel though hitler had barely looked at his diary and letter was written by an adjutant remy remarks that by this time hitler still did not treat rommel as a significantly important person when rommel was being considered for appointment as commander in chief of army in summer of 1942 goebbels wrote in his diary that rommel is ideologically sound is not just sympathetic to national socialists he is a national socialist he is a troop leader with a gift for improvisation personally courageous and extraordinarily inventive these are kinds of soldiers we need thumb left rommel and hitler in 1942 according to rick atkinson rommel was known as fuhrer s marshal rommel exercised an almost hypnotic influence on hitler according to albert kesselring and another colleague called him fuhrer s marshal american writer rick atkinson concludes that rommel was loyal in his own fashion and as beguiled by hitler as steel filings by a magnet hitler was a bulwark against bolshevism rommel had told staff officers despite this intimate relationship though he was not provided with basic information on germany s strategic plan rommel did not know that smashing soviet union and major territorial acquisitions in east would be cornerstone of this plan nor did rommel realise that hitler saw no conflict of interest between germany and maritime power great britain which he hoped to make an ally he also had only a week s warning before launch of case white at start of 1943 messenger argues that rommel s attitude towards hitler changed only after allied invasion of normandy when rommel came to realise that war could not be won historian thomas vogel opines that rommel was not a nazi if one uses definition nazis themselves used considering that although he did everything in his power to make his country strong again he showed no support towards racial policies or other aspects of regime operational and strategic level commander british military and political figures contributed to heroic image of man as rommel resumed offensive operations in january 1942 against british forces weakened by redeployments to far east speaking in house of commons churchill addressed british defeats and described rommel as an extraordinary bold and clever opponent and a great field commander trend continued after war following publication of desert fox which also portrays staff officers like wilhelm keitel alfred jodl and franz halder who opposed rommel on strategic issues as having ulterior motives in smearing him former military opponents in britain described rommel as a brilliant commander and a resistance fighter good german with one senior military figure comparing rommel to legendary military leader belisarius praise led bernard montgomery s former deputy brian horrocks to argue in his 1950 article rommel myth debunked that eighth army beat rommel s afrika korps fair and square in 1977 martin van creveld started reevaluation of malta s impact on supply situations and concluded that rommel was largely responsible for his supply problems caused by overextended supply lines which prevented afrika korps from receiving supplies that italians were able to provide in adequate numbers according to creveld capacity of libyan ports were too small and distances to be overcome too great for rommel to advance a more ambitious plan than hitler s original one of defending a limited area certain modern historians such as larry t addington niall barr and robert citino are skeptical of rommel as an operational let alone strategic level commander they point to rommel s lack of appreciation for germany s strategic situation his misunderstanding of relative importance of his theatre to german high command his poor grasp of logistical realities and according to historian ian beckett his penchant for glory hunting citino credits rommel s limitations as an operational level commander as materially contributing to eventual demise of axis forces in north africa meanwhile addington focuses on rommel s disobedience and struggle over north africa strategy whereby his initial brilliant success resulted in catastrophic effects for germany in this theatre of war historian geoffrey p megargee refers to rommel as a talented tactical leader but points out his playing german and italian command structures against each other to his advantage rommel used confused structure of okw supreme command of wehrmacht okh supreme high command of army and italian supreme command to disregard orders that he disagreed with or to appeal to whatever authority he felt would be most sympathetic to his requests rommel often went directly to hitler with his needs and concerns taking advantage of favoritism that fuhrer displayed towards him and adding to german high command s distrust of him military practitioners have also questioned rommel s abilities at operational level while nearly all acknowledge rommel s excellent tactical skills and personal bravery many officers came to accept that rommel was possibly most overrated commander of an army in world history writes u s major general and military historian david t zabecki of united states naval institute quoting opinion of wolf heckmann zabecki notes that rommel s brilliant tactical moves were logistically unsustainable which eventually led to a strategic defeat general klaus naumann who served as chief of staff of bundeswehr agrees with charles messenger that rommel had challenges on operational level and states that rommel s violation of unity of command principle bypassing chain of command in africa was unacceptable some historians such as zabecki and peter lieb also take issue with rommel s absence from normandy on day of allied invasion 6 june 1944 he had left france on 5 june and was at home on 6th celebrating his wife s birthday rommel either planned to proceed to see hitler next day to discuss situation in normandy zabecki calls his decision to leave theatre in view of an imminent invasion an incredible lapse of command responsibility more sympathetic authors point out complex situations that rommel had to face brian hanley from usni s editorial board of directors comments that rommel was beaten moment he arrived in africa considering allied troops outnumbered afrika korps and they worked under a much more straightforward chain of command while orders sent from berlin to north africa were rarely kept confidential hanley sees rommel turning german and italian military authorities against each other as turning liabilities into advantages and that he repeatedly created operational miracles that made a strategic investment in africa theatre attractive in 1942 also according to hanley if rommel stood still his enemy s strength would accumulate while his own depending on an uncertain supply line would diminish thus he needed british stocks of supply to deal with his logistical problems daniel allen butler writes that if rommel was not a formally trained strategist he developed himself into one becoming able to grasp strategic opportunities that others missed starting as a compulsive commander who imperiled his own command and his superiors plans in africa he realized that his opponent s army was main objective and not mere holding of territory butler writes that it was unfair to blame rommel considering that he had been kept ignorant of operation barbarossa butler also questions need to obey his superiors higher strategy considering that hitler never had a coherent grand strategy opines that rommel actually had approval of his german and later italian superiors including hitler and high command in conducting afrika korps as a mobile striking force and for his offensives with such a weak force he came to depend on an automaticity that required constant successful attacks that ceased to function once he gradually lost equipment superiority air cover and good intelligence which in combination with good leadership allowed possibility to offset numerical inferiority to some extent this applied also in case of malta even if island had been captured army s condition would not have been improved immediately but holding ground meant rommel would lose initiative forever according to maurice remy rommel should not be blamed regarding strategic matters considering hitler and mussolini had prepared african offensive strategy from beginning despite warnings of brauchitsch and halder regarding planned invasion of russia that rommel was not informed of as african campaign progressed rommel became aware of strategic and supply situation but his superiors among them kesselring continued to ask him to advance further and promise that supplies would reach battlefield in time like hanley and stumpf remy saw rommel s successes as working against him his superiors assumed that despite his constant requests for more forces and supplies he could manage with minimum remy also opines that rommel s plan for defence of atlantic coastline was correct one although he too made a mistake in seeing calais as main landing zone others like stroud krause and phillips opine that even rommel s recklessness and disobedience during invasion of france benefitted german cause while rescuing hitler s mercurial objectives and inventing actual application of blitzkrieg lightning war and it was hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory according to alan j levine contrary to allegation that he was only a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues shown by his judgements on developing situations and although he was most defeatist german general there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising amount of energy in building normandy defense at same time macgregor knox whose works draw largely on italian sources opines that rather than technical and expertise weaknesses effectiveness in war ultimately depends on culture command style and ethos which in turn breed technological imagination and force structure he points out that few italian mobile units fighting together with afrika korps benefitted from working under rommel who helped them cope with rapidly changing situations in a war without fixed fronts despite interference from ettore bastico marvin knorr expresses a sympathetic view of rommel s attitude to general staff saying that their attitudes towards officers of middle class like him made it understandable that he was wary about them and worried that officers they sent to him would report on him or try to take over despite this he came to trust and depend on these staff officers like friedrich von mellenthin and siegfried westphal who in turn proved their talent and loyalty rick atkinson acknowledges rommel s audacity tactical brilliance and personal style also noting that he had an uncanny ability to dominate minds of his adversaries some authors like stumpf and lewin opine that while creveld s statistics regarding losses of supplies are not wrong and that vast distances were a big problem failure of seaborne supply lines was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of campaigns douglas austin points out that overall port capacity at tobruk and benghazi was actually sufficient and that recently published enigma intercepts show that it was bulk losses at sea and not unloading or getting supplies to forward areas that had greater impact on rommel s decisions as well as those of other german commanders like kesselring levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as afrika korps crucial weaknesses citing evidences gathered on british intelligence by hinsley and bennett others point out rommel s dependence on captured resources as compensation for unstable supply lines and unfulfilled promises by 1942 85 of his transport were captured vehicles butler opines that myth of rommel s bad logistical management is result of rumours started by halder lieb also opines that while his harshest critics who mostly came from general staff often said that rommel was overrated or not suitable for higher commands envy was a big factor here simon ball also notes that this was single group of people in postwar west who had an interest in denigrating rommel who had never been one of them while he opines that various elements in english and german post war government and military circles had an interest in praising him as well role in 20 july plot extent of rommel s involvement in military s resistance against hitler or 20 july plot is difficult to ascertain as people most directly involved did not survive and limited documentation of conspirators plans and preparations exists thus rommel s participation remains ambiguous and perception of it largely has its source in subsequent events especially rommel s forced suicide and post war accounts by surviving participants according to a post war account by karl strolin of stuttgart at that time he and two other conspirators alexander von falkenhausen and carl heinrich von stulpnagel began efforts to bring rommel into anti hitler conspiracy in early 1944 on 15 april 1944 rommel s new chief of staff hans speidel arrived in normandy and reintroduced rommel to stulpnagel speidel had previously been connected to carl goerdeler civilian leader of resistance but not to plotters led by stauffenberg and only came to attention of stauffenberg due to his appointment to rommel s headquarters conspirators felt they needed support of a field marshal on active duty and gave instructions to speidel to bring rommel into their circle speidel met with former foreign minister konstantin von neurath and strolin on 27 may in germany ostensibly at rommel s request although latter was not present neurath and strolin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations with west and according to speidel rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations however around same time plotters in berlin were not aware that rommel had reportedly decided to take part in conspiracy on 16 may they informed allen dulles through whom they hoped to negotiate with western allies that rommel could not be counted on for support rommel opposed assassinating hitler after war his widow maintained that rommel believed an assassination attempt would spark a civil war historian ian beckett argues that there is no credible evidence that rommel had more than limited and superficial knowledge of plot and concludes that rommel would not have acted to aid plotters on 20 july while ralf georg reuth contends that there was no indication of any active participation of rommel in conspiracy historian richard j evans concluded that he knew of a plot but was not involved what is not debated are results of failed bomb plot of 20 july many conspirators were arrested and dragnet expanded to thousands consequently it did not take long for rommel to come under suspicion beginning with evidence ss obtained from stulpnagel who mentioned rommel in delirium after his suicide attempt rommel s name also came up in confessions by stulpnagel s personal adviser caesar von hofacker and was included in goerdeler s papers on a list of potential supporters author and cinematographer discovered a memo from martin bormann head of nazi party chancellery dating from 28 september 1944 in which chief of party chancellery and personal secretary to hitler stated that former general stulpnagel former colonel hofacker kluge s meanwhile executed nephew lieutenant colonel and other defendants still alive gave all testimony that field marshal rommel was indeed in picture rommel agreed that he would be at new government s disposal after a successful plot according to eavesdropped conversations between german generals in british captivity edited by historian sonke neitzel general heinrich eberbach former commander of 5th panzer army claimed on 14 september 1944 that rommel had told him in normandy just a few days before plot that hitler and his entourage would have to be killed if there was any chance for germany to bring war to a satisfactory end summarising most recent findings on rommel s role in 20 july plot peter lieb concludes that rommel did not play any role in operational preparations for plot against hitler and we do not know which post he was supposed to assume after a successful coup hence field marshal was definitely not part of most inner circle of 20 july plotters at same time however he was more than just a mere sympathiser and paid for this with his life he consequently deserves a firm place in military resistance against hitler to a greater extent than it has recently been acknowledged in academia and in public both maurice remy and think that emphasis should be on his plan for a separate peace with west his intention was not to continue hitler s murderous war in east but to prevent disasters that might happen to germany if soviet army arrived which was devised with concrete details and carried out at great personal risk analysis of motivations rommel was an ambitious man who took advantage of his proximity to hitler and willingly accepted propaganda campaigns designed for him by goebbels he sought to level playing field for non nobles and also supported militarism and a strong german empire while treating people only according to their merits he did not display hatred to people of noble descent and in fact was a throwback to medieval knight in his personal traits appearing well versed in ancient customs of chivalry which helped to attract admiration from british who saw in him a romantic archetype rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques citino believes that under modern veneer rommel s story as well as his style of warfare including negative points was actually last manifestation of an older prussian tradition which began with georg von derfflinger in which lowly outsider he was not prussian by birth chose to serve prussian king in whom alone he put his trust and in whose service he was willing to attract ill will from all other powerful people like what seydlitz and had done reuth also comments that rommel tended to blame people around hitler for all bad of regime while seeing hitler sender of criminal orders as source of all that was good certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition most of all from hitler on whom according to watson rommel projected his idea of german people s will thumb upright rommel posing for a propaganda photo in north africa according to klaus naumann rommel was used by nazi regime to create a myth he tolerated this since he had a strong dose of personal ambition and vanity a number of contemporaries noted rommel s vanity in memorandum regarding rommel s betrayal martin bormann remarked he had himself photographed from dawn to dusk he is so vain he does not wear glasses rommel was near sighted in one eye and far sighted in other historian samuel mitchell however noted that martin borman had held a grudge against field marshall as far back as 1939 mitcham samuel w 1984 triumphant fox erwin rommel and rise of afrika korps some modern authors such as are more sympathetic he states that rommel s perceived vanity developed as a reaction to pressure aristocratic and high bourgeois colleagues put on him psychologist norman f dixon remarks that although rommel showed towards hitler an admiration that later faded he did not display urge to submit himself to higher authority or powerful father figures considering that had he been such a person he would not have been so outspoken or risked himself in struggle against people like himmler keitel or jodl showalter comments that rommel was a man who brought his work home but not to point of obsession with personal promotions considering he had spent no effort in building a social circle his wife was person who determined their family s social agenda and guest list and circle she chose was not wide nor prominent messenger points out that rommel had many reasons to be grateful to hitler including his interference to arrange for him to receive command of an armoured division his elevation to status of a national hero and continued interest and support from dictator remy states that attachment to hitler went much deeper than any could explain and that hitler had become rommel s source of motivation some like randall hansen highlight similarities in background and personality that facilitated rapport between two while others like richard overy state that rommel s main appeal to hitler was that he was everything hitler was not while political scientist roland in a review of maurice remy s book comments that despite remy s efforts strange relationship remains hard to understand wolfram remarks that hitler did not compete with rommel for war leader image because two complemented each other perfectly they were similar in sense that they were only ones with a cultural presence and objects around whom german society s grand narrative was being built thus rommel was only german general who would have been capable of challenging hitler s rule had he ever crossed rubicon from his apolitical to core military world and developed a serious critical view of hitler s political dealings however rommel himself had fallen for hitler s charisma almost until end peter lieb opines that relationship between rommel and hitler is overrated they liked each other but relationship became worse and worse since end of 1942 when rommel began to see consequences of hitler s disastrous leadership as well as recognize criminal character of regime according to lieb historians should focus more on goebbels whose propaganda built up rommel italian generals considered rommel apolitical too according to scianna when badoglio took over italy in 1943 allies became hopeful that a similar development would happen in germany with rommel as head of new regime but captured italian generals rebuked this pipe dream telling them that rommel unlike other german generals did not care about politics caddick adams writes that rommel was a complicated man of many contradictions while beckett notes that rommel s myth has proved remarkably resilient and that more work is needed to put him in proper historical context zabecki concludes that blind hero worship only distorts real lessons to be learned from his career and battles and watson notes that legend has been a distraction that obscured evolution of rommel as a military commander and his changing attitudes towards regime that he served john pimlott writes that rommel was an impressive military commander who richly deserved his reputation as a leading exponent of mobile warfare hampered by factors he could not control although he usually accepted high risks and could become frustrated when forced on defensive on other hand pimlott criticises rommel for only disagreeing with hitler for strategic reasons and while accepting that rommel did give chivalrous tone to his battles in africa he points out that this should not be used to ignore responsibility rommel must bear for promoting nazi cause with vigour same sentiment is held by murray and millett who opine that rommel contrary to allegations that he was only a competent tactical commander was most outstanding battlefield commander of war who showed a realistic strategic view despite holding minimal control over strategy they point out that like virtually entire german officer corps he was a convinced nazi while some like scianna are more towards his decisions but also dismiss negative myths such as rommel s abandonment of his allies cornelia hecht author of 2008 exhibition named mythos rommel and a book of same name explains that despite extensive research it is hard to see who rommel really was under all layers of myth she comments that she would not describe rommel as a resistance fighter although he did support assassination attempt patrick major describes rommel as someone who went along with regime as long as it served his needs a fellow traveler rather than a war criminal summing up rommel s career in a 2012 interview with reuters historian sonke neitzel states on one hand he didn t commit war crimes that we know of and ordered a retreat at el alamein despite hitler s order but he took huge german casualties elsewhere and he was a servant of regime he was not exactly a shining liberal or social democrat mostly he was interested in his career historian reuth observes that modern german image of rommel a result of in 1980s and debates on war guilt during 1990s as represented most notably by maurice remy is that of both a national socialist and a hero of resistance reuth argues that rommel was neither one nor other he had understood neither national socialism nor resistance to it like millions of germans he followed hitler into disaster and whilst doing so he believed he was only doing his duty historiography although author david irving and his works have now become controversial for his denial of holocaust he is recognised as historian who started re evaluation of rommel he was first historian to gain access to a large number of rommel s private letters and his well substantiated findings questioned rommel s image as a chivalrous resistance fighter this biography however has been criticized by other authors and hecht for manipulation and misrepresentation of primary sources and even invention of verbatim quotations with aim of portraying hitler in a better light works such as 2002 documentary mythos rommel by remy and book of same name and 2004 book rommel das ende einer legende published in english in 2005 as rommel end of a legend by german historian ralf georg reuth furthered discussion on both rommel and his myth in continued debate on rommel and his legacy christopher gabel criticises documentary rommel s war made by historians and jean christoph caron for using false analogy to prove that rommel was a war criminal by association without providing any evidence even of rommel s knowledge about crimes in his areas of operation according to attacks on rommel s integrity and attempts to link him to war crimes which were started by journalist side in 1990s have been largely repudiated by serious research despite having been repeatedly rehashed and refreshed by some authors and their stickler gives recognition to both remy and reuth for offering possible explanations for rommel s character evolution numerous english speaking authors use rommel myth ambiguously like bruce allen watson who states that masks he wore reflected genuine plurality of man or jill edwards who notes that below all layers historians have removed and added to what remains seems enough to qualify rommel as if controversial a great captain others who mention and depict myth as a phenomenon that is either hard to ascertain or has a core that reflects reality include pier paolo battistelli randall hansen ian baxter t l mcmahon brighton rosie goldschmidt waldeck charles f marshall latimer and showalter a german author who uses word mythos in a critical manner is ralph giordano who describes phenomenon as one of falsehoods of tradition in his book of same name which depicts how image of rommel has been a major basis for warrior cult of bundeswehr sir david hunt describes himself as being critical towards rommel mythology while he has highest praise for his character his impression of rommel as a commander is a dashing cavalryman who gambled deep and lost in end other authors who present popular narratives on rommel as a misguided or deliberately falsified myth include james who criticises both rommel s supposed genius and his treatment of his italian allies and james robinson martin kitchen alaric searle robert citino ralf georg reuth kenneth macksey controversies over modern role as bundeswehr s role model thumb field marshal rommel barracks exercise field with teutoburg forest usually affiliated with arminius in background critics note that blend of two figures represented by placing of a rommel portrait and an arminius statue together in main building seems to combine germanic cults with veneration towards wehrmacht numerous critics take issue with bundeswehr s reverence towards rommel as its primary role model while recognizing his great talents as a commander they point out several problems such as rommel s involvement with a criminal regime his political naivete and that he can not teach society modern values such as democracy pacifism feminism or critical thinking politician scientist calls for his replacement with manfred von richthofen cornelia hecht opines that whatever judgement history will pass on rommel who was idol of world war ii as well as integration figure of post war republic it is now time bundeswehr should rely on its own history and tradition and not any wehrmacht commander a retired bundeswehr officer writes that maintenance of rommel barracks names and definition of rommel as a resistance fighter are capitulation before neo nazi tendencies heiducoff agrees with bundeswehr generals that rommel was one of greatest strategists and tacticians both in theory and practice and a victim of contemporary jealous colleagues but argues that such a talent for aggressive destructive warfare is not a suitable model for bundeswehr a primarily defensive army heiducoff criticizes bundeswehr generals for pressuring ministry of defence into making decisions in favour of man they openly admire green party s position is that rommel was not a war criminal but still had entanglements with war crimes and that he could not be bundeswehr s role model historian michael wolffsohn supports ministry of defense s decision to continue recognition of rommel although he thinks focus should be put on later stage of rommel s life when he began thinking more seriously about war and politics and broke with regime rundfunk mdr reports that wolffsohn declares bundeswehr wants to have politically thoughtful responsible officers from beginning thus a tradition of swashbuckler and humane rogue is not intended according to authors like ulrich vom hagen and sandra mass though bundeswehr as well as nato deliberately endorses ideas of chivalrous warfare and apolitical soldiering associated with rommel according to cornelia hecht bundeswehr believes that chivalry and fairness which rommel embodied more than any other wehrmacht generals are timeless military virtues at a ministry conference soliciting input on matter dutch general ton van loon advised ministry that although there can be historical abuses hidden under guise of military tradition tradition is still essential for esprit de corps and part of that tradition should be leadership and achievements of rommel historian christian hartmann opines that not only rommel s legacy is worthy of tradition but bundeswehr urgently needs to become more rommel while inspector general volker warns that professionalism and morality should befit each other because technical competence and valour are hollow without value education basis of which should be basic law sonke neitzel supports commemoration although he notes that rommel rode waves of regime and only mustered courage to break with it at last minute but in a way unlike any other general he also considers rommel s other virtues and military capability to be important since membership of resistance does not help modern soldiers in mali historian hannes heer argues that that rommel was not a resistance fighter yet and that membership of resistance instead of secondary virtues and military capability should be only touchstone of commemoration historian opines that instead of being symbol for an alternative germany rommel should be symbol for willingness of military elites to become by nazi authorities as for whether he can be treated as a military role model hurter writes that each soldier can decide on that matter for themselves historian argues that it is totally conceivable that resistance saw rommel as someone with whom they could build a new germany according to piper though rommel was a loyal national socialist without crime rather than a democrat thus unsuitable to hold a central place among role models although he can be integrated as a major military leader wolfgang benz also comments his fate gives an idea of possibilities military resistance could have offered had such a charismatic leader of troops been at helm field marshal rommel barracks stresses his leadership and performance as worthy of tradition and identity establishing among other things no proven war crime as a reason to keep name sanitary regiment 3 stationed at rommel barracks in also desires almost unanimously as revealed by an interdepartmental opinion poll to keep name there has also been discussion regarding hammelburg garrison heart of german infantry according to von der which considers rommel as name patron and identification figure together with adolf heusinger main street on which garrison is located is named after rommel while one of barracks is named after heusinger city council has defended street s name parliamentary commissioner for armed forces hans peter bartels spd supports keeping of name and tradition associated with rommel but notes that reasons should not be his initial successes in africa or that former adversary armies have continued to worship him until this day bartels adds that rommel who probably supported resistance is a borderline case regarding which historians find it hard to ascertain and german history is full of such ambiguities in early 2017 german federal ministry of defence in response to a petition championed by historian wolfgang proske and backed by politicians from left party defended naming of barracks after rommel with justification that current state of research does not support their allegations political scientist and politician criticises ministry s undeterred attitude to fact rommel was at least near nazi and did serve unjust regime and comments that association of rommel with spirit of bundeswehr is not new but they did not expect that federal ministry of defence without providing at least a bibliography would declare him a victim of regime as well see also myth of eastern
