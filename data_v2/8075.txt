base of mount everest train departs station to right and climbs a small lift leading to a short drop then circles around to lift hill carrying riders into mountain it is tallest attraction at walt disney world beating twilight zone tower of terror by 6 inches disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low flying planes which disney feels would take out of experience on way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of yeti warning riders that mountain is his territory at top of mountain train curves around main peak and goes through a cave when it emerges it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart presumably by yeti train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an automatic switch rotates piece of track directly behind train train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through mountain it eventually comes to a halt in a large cave where riders see yeti s shadow on wall as he tears up more track this effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic track switch in front of them as shadow moves away train rolls forward out of mountain and down main drop it enters a turn and speeds back up through another cave in mountain where roars of yeti are heard once more train exits from rear of mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into mountain a final time train drops through a cave where yeti is reaching down toward it on reaching bottom of this drop riders return to unloading dock and depart into a gift shop ride lasts 2 minutes and 50 seconds trains expedition everest has six steam like trains each with six cars each train has 17 rows seating two abreast for a total of 34 riders per train trains are themed as rail service and are made to look old and rusty riders must be at least tall and are secured by a lap bar locomotive itself is designed to resemble a vertical boiler configuration and is placed at rear of train rather than front so not to obstruct riders view up to five trains usually operate at once but fewer can be used if guest demand is low to create illusion of a steam powered train engineers placed vents under station when a train comes into station steam comes up through vents and enters loading platform track steel track is long and lift is about high expedition everest is first ride to use vekoma s newest track system which places rails on outside of ties rather than on inside this was first large scale installation of such a system facts and details thumb a close up of one of trains on main drop although moderate in height and length by contemporary standards expedition everest was first ride for disney to have its trains travel both forward and backward this is accomplished through two sets of track switches one before rear segment and one after this was second disney roller coaster to run backwards first being indiana jones et le temple du peril backwards at disneyland resort paris 2000 2004 expedition everest however was first disney roller coaster to switch between forward and backward sections during same ride mountain facade yeti audio animatronic and roller coaster are three independent structures each structure reaches ground level and does not touch other two structures this was achieved via 4 d scheduling software that told builders how to construct it mountain expedition everest is often compared to 1959 matterhorn bobsleds roller coaster at disneyland which also features a snowy mountain setting and an abominable snowman figure throughout ride expedition everest s mountain is made from 1 800 tons of steel and painted with 2 000 gallons of paint it is tallest artificial mountain in world but not as occasionally cited tallest point in florida it is disney s 18th mountain themed attraction artificial mountain is not a model of mount everest but rather of fictional forbidden mountain guarded by yeti in story created for attraction by walt disney imagineering everest is represented by barren background peak on far right which is made to seem far in distance an example of forced perspective yeti yeti is largest and most complex audio animatronic figure ever built by walt disney imagineering it is tall its skin measures and is held in place by 1 000 snaps and 250 zippers its movement is controlled by 19 actuators when functioning in a mode its full mode of operation in a mode it can move horizontally and vertically yeti s roars are provided by voice actor fred tatasciore a few months after ride opened in 2006 yeti figure s framing split threatening catastrophic malfunction if it were to be operated further in a mode since then it has been operated only in alternative b mode in which a strobe light effect is used to give appearance of movement earning it nickname disco yeti from some fans it is speculated that problem was caused by damage to yeti s concrete base structure which is unlikely to be repaired until a major refurbishment in distant future because design limits access to yeti without major disassembly of superstructure problem with concrete is rumored to have occurred due to a glitch in 4 d scheduling software that prevented adequate curing of a portion of yeti s foundation before fabrication of mountain elements and roller coaster track joe rohde in charge of building attraction and animal kingdom was asked about yeti at 2013 d23 expo rohde responded you have to understand it s a giant complicated machine sitting on top of like a 46 foot tall tower in middle of a finished building so it s really hard to fix but we are working on it and we continue to work on it we have tried several things none of them quite get to key turning of 40 foot tower inside of a finished building but we are working on it i will fix yeti someday i swear promotions thumb expedition everest at night discovery networks in 2005 disney discovery networks and
