uranus from latin name uranus for greek god ouranos is seventh planet from sun it has third largest planetary radius and fourth largest planetary mass in solar system uranus is similar in composition to neptune and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of larger gas giants jupiter and saturn for this reason scientists often classify uranus and neptune as ice giants to distinguish them from gas giants uranus atmosphere is similar to jupiter s and saturn s in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium but it contains more ices such as water ammonia and methane along with traces of other hydrocarbons it has coldest planetary atmosphere in solar system with a minimum temperature of and has a complex layered cloud structure with water thought to make up lowest clouds and methane uppermost layer of clouds interior of uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock like other giant planets uranus has a ring system a magnetosphere and numerous moons uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways nearly into plane of its solar orbit its north and south poles therefore lie where most other planets have their equators in 1986 images from voyager 2 showed uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light without cloud bands or storms associated with other giant planets observations from earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as uranus approached its equinox in 2007 wind speeds can reach uranus is only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure from greek mythology from latinised version of greek god of sky ouranos history like classical planets uranus is visible to naked eye but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit sir william herschel announced its discovery on 13 march 1781 expanding known boundaries of solar system for first time in history and making uranus first planet discovered with a telescope discovery thumb left upright william herschel discoverer of uranus in 1781 upright 0 85 left thumb replica of telescope used by herschel to discover uranus uranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet but it was generally mistaken for a star possibly earliest known observation was by who in 128 bc might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into ptolemy s almagest earliest definite sighting was in 1690 when john flamsteed observed it at least six times cataloguing it as 34 tauri french astronomer pierre charles le monnier observed uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769 including on four consecutive nights sir william herschel observed uranus on 13 march 1781 from garden of his house at 19 new king street in bath somerset england now herschel museum of astronomy and initially reported it on 26 april 1781 as a comet with a telescope herschel engaged in a series of observations on parallax of fixed stars journal of royal society and royal astronomical society 1 30 quoted in miner p 8 herschel recorded in his journal in near z tauri either a nebulous star or perhaps a comet royal astronomical society mss w 2 1 2 23 quoted in miner p 8 on 17 march he noted i looked for comet or nebulous star and found that it is a comet for it has changed its place ras mss herschel w 2 1 2 24 quoted in miner p 8 when he presented his discovery to royal society he continued to assert that he had found a comet but also implicitly compared it to a planet herschel notified astronomer royal nevil maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 april 1781 i don t know what to call it it is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to sun as a comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis i have not yet seen any coma or tail to it ras mss herschel w1 13 m 14 quoted in miner p 8 although herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise finnish swedish astronomer anders johan lexell working in russia was first to compute orbit of new object its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet berlin astronomer johann elert bode described herschel s discovery as a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet like object circulating beyond orbit of saturn johann elert bode berliner jahrbuch p 210 1781 quoted in miner p 11 bode concluded that its near circular orbit was more like a planet s than a comet s miner p 11 object was soon universally accepted as a new planet by 1783 herschel acknowledged this to royal society president joseph banks by observation of most eminent astronomers in europe it appears that new star which i had honour of pointing out to them in march 1781 is a primary planet of our solar system in recognition of his achievement king george iii gave herschel an annual stipend of ps200 on condition that he move to windsor so that royal family could look through his telescopes name name of uranus references ancient greek deity of sky uranus father of cronus saturn and grandfather of zeus jupiter which in latin became uranus it is only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure of greek mythology adjectival form of uranus is uranian pronunciation of name uranus preferred among astronomers is with stress on first syllable as in latin uranus in contrast to with stress on second syllable and a long a though both are considered acceptable consensus on name was not reached until almost 70 years after planet s discovery during original discussions following discovery maskelyne asked herschel to do astronomical world to give a name to your planet which is entirely your own and which we are so much obliged to you for discovery of ras mss herschel w 1 12 m 20 quoted in miner p 12 in response to maskelyne s request herschel decided to name object georgium sidus george s star or georgian planet in honour of his new patron king george iii he explained this decision in a letter to joseph banks herschel s proposed name was not popular outside britain and alternatives were soon proposed astronomer jerome lalande proposed that it be named herschel in honour of its discoverer swedish astronomer erik proposed name neptune which was supported by other astronomers who liked idea to commemorate victories of british royal naval fleet in course of american revolutionary war by calling new planet even neptune george iii or neptune great britain in a march 1782 treatise bode proposed uranus latinised version of greek god of sky ouranos in original german translated bode argued that name should follow mythology so as not to stand out as different from other planets and that uranus was an appropriate name as father of first generation of titans he also noted that elegance of name in that just as saturn was father of jupiter new planet should be named after father of saturn in 1789 bode s royal academy colleague martin klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of bode s choice ultimately bode s suggestion became most widely used and became universal in 1850 when hm nautical almanac office final holdout switched from using georgium sidus to uranus uranus has two astronomical symbols first to be proposed was suggested by lalande in 1784 in a letter to herschel lalande described it as un globe par la premiere lettre de votre nom a globe surmounted by first letter of your surname a later proposal is a hybrid of symbols for mars and sun because uranus was sky in greek mythology which was thought to be dominated by combined powers of sun and mars uranus is called by a variety of translations in other languages in chinese japanese korean and vietnamese its name is literally translated as sky king star in thai its official name is dao as in english its other name in thai is dao star of mrtyu after sanskrit word for death mrtyu mrtyu in mongolian its name is tengeriin van tengeriin van translated as king of sky reflecting its namesake god s role as ruler of heavens in hawaiian its name is hele a loanword for discoverer herschel in maori its name is orbit and rotation thumb a 1998 false colour near infrared image of uranus showing cloud bands rings and moons obtained by hubble space telescope s nicmos camera uranus orbits sun once every 84 years taking an average of seven years to pass through each constellation of zodiac in 2033 planet will have made its third complete orbit around sun since being discovered in 1781 planet has returned to point of its discovery northeast of zeta tauri twice since then in 1862 and 1943 one day later each time as precession of equinoxes has shifted it 1deg west every 72 years uranus will return to this location again in 2030 31 its average distance from sun is roughly difference between its minimum and maximum distance from sun is 1 8 au larger than that of any other planet though not as large as that of dwarf planet pluto jean meeus astronomical algorithms richmond va willmann bell 1998 p 271 from 1841 aphelion to 2092 one perihelia are always 18 28 and aphelia always 20 10 astronomical units intensity of sunlight varies inversely with square of distance and so on uranus at about 20 times distance from sun compared to earth it is about 1 400 intensity of light on earth its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by pierre simon laplace with time discrepancies began to appear between predicted and observed orbits and in 1841 john couch adams first proposed that differences might be due to gravitational tug of an unseen planet in 1845 urbain le verrier began his own independent research into uranus orbit on 23 september 1846 johann gottfried galle located a new planet later named neptune at nearly position predicted by le verrier rotational period of interior of uranus is 17 hours 14 minutes as on all giant planets its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in direction of rotation at some latitudes such as about 60 degrees south visible features of atmosphere move much faster making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours axial tilt thumb simulated earth view of uranus from 1986 to 2030 from southern summer solstice in 1986 to equinox in 2007 and northern summer solstice in 2028 uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel with plane of solar system with an axial tilt of 97 77deg as defined by prograde rotation this gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of other planets near solstice one pole faces sun continuously and other faces away only a narrow strip around equator experiences a rapid day night cycle but with sun low over horizon at other side of uranus orbit orientation of poles towards sun is reversed each pole gets around 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness near time of equinoxes sun faces equator of uranus giving a period of day night cycles similar to those seen on most of other planets uranus reached its most recent equinox on 7 december 2007 northern hemisphere year southern hemisphere winter solstice 1902 1986 summer solstice vernal equinox 1923 2007 autumnal equinox summer solstice 1944 2028 winter solstice autumnal equinox 1965 2049 vernal equinox one result of this axis orientation is that averaged over uranian year polar regions of uranus receive a greater energy input from sun than its equatorial regions nevertheless uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown reason for uranus unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty but usual speculation is that during formation of solar system an earth sized protoplanet collided with uranus causing skewed orientation research by jacob of durham university suggests that tilt resulted from a rock larger than earth crashing into planet 3 to 4 billion years ago uranus south pole was pointed almost directly at sun at time of voyager 2 s flyby in 1986 labelling of this pole as south uses definition currently endorsed by international astronomical union namely that north pole of a planet or satellite is pole that points above invariable plane of solar system regardless of direction planet is spinning a different convention is sometimes used in which a body s north and south poles are defined according to right hand rule in relation to direction of rotation visibility mean apparent magnitude of uranus is 5 68 with a standard deviation of 0 17 while extremes are 5 38 and 6 03 this range of brightness is near limit of naked eye visibility much of variability is dependent upon planetary latitudes being illuminated from sun and viewed from earth its angular diameter is between 3 4 and 3 7 arcseconds compared with 16 to 20 arcseconds for saturn and 32 to 45 arcseconds for jupiter at opposition uranus is visible to naked eye in dark skies and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars in larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23 cm uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening with a large telescope of 25 cm or wider cloud patterns as well as some of larger satellites such as titania and oberon may be visible physical characteristics internal structure thumb size comparison of earth and uranus thumb diagram of interior of uranus uranus mass is roughly 14 5 times that of earth making it least massive of giant planets its diameter is slightly larger than neptune s at roughly four times that of earth a resulting density of 1 27 g cm3 makes uranus second least dense planet after saturn this value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices such as water ammonia and methane total mass of ice in uranus interior is not precisely known because different figures emerge depending on model chosen it must be between 9 3 and 13 5 earth masses hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of total with between 0 5 and 1 5 earth masses remainder of non ice mass 0 5 to 3 7 earth masses is accounted for by rocky material standard model of uranus structure is that it consists of three layers a rocky silicate iron nickel core in centre an icy mantle in middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen helium envelope core is relatively small with a mass of only 0 55 earth masses and a radius less than 20 of uranus mantle comprises its bulk with around 13 4 earth masses and upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial weighing about 0 5 earth masses and extending for last 20 of uranus radius uranus core density is around 9 g cm3 with a pressure in centre of 8 million bars 800 gpa and a temperature of about 5000 k ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in conventional sense but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water ammonia and other volatiles this fluid which has a high electrical conductivity is sometimes called a water ammonia ocean extreme pressure and temperature deep within uranus may break up methane molecules with carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through mantle like hailstones very high pressure experiments at lawrence livermore national laboratory suggest that base of mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid diamond with floating solid diamond bergs scientists also believe that rainfalls of solid diamonds occur on uranus as well as on jupiter saturn and neptune bulk compositions of uranus and neptune are different from those of jupiter and saturn with ice dominating over gases hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants there may be a layer of ionic water where water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions and deeper down superionic water in which oxygen crystallises but hydrogen ions move freely within oxygen lattice although model considered above is reasonably standard it is not unique other models also satisfy observations for instance if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in ice mantle total mass of ices in interior will be lower and correspondingly total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher presently available data does not allow a scientific determination which model is correct fluid interior structure of uranus means that it has no solid surface gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into internal liquid layers for sake of convenience a revolving oblate spheroid set at point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar 100 kpa is conditionally designated as a surface it has equatorial and polar radii of and respectively this surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes internal heat uranus internal heat appears markedly lower than that of other giant planets in astronomical terms it has a low thermal flux why uranus internal temperature is so low is still not understood neptune which is uranus near twin in size and composition radiates 2 61 times as much energy into space as it receives from sun but uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all total power radiated by uranus in far infrared i e heat part of spectrum is times solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere uranus heat flux is only which is lower than internal heat flux of earth of about lowest temperature recorded in uranus tropopause is making uranus coldest planet in solar system one of hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat it was left with a depleted core temperature this impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain planet s axial tilt another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in uranus upper layers that prevents core s heat from reaching surface for example convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers which may inhibit upward heat transport perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor atmosphere thumb uranus atmosphere taken during outer planet atmosphere legacy opal program although there is no well defined solid surface within uranus interior outermost part of uranus gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere remote sensing capability extends down to roughly 300 km below level with a corresponding pressure around and temperature of tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from nominal surface which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers troposphere between altitudes of and pressures from 100 to 0 1 bar 10 mpa to 10 kpa stratosphere spanning altitudes between and pressures of between 10 kpa to 10 upa and thermosphere extending from 4 000 km to as high as 50 000 km from surface there is no mesosphere composition composition of uranus atmosphere is different from its bulk consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium helium molar fraction i e number of helium atoms per molecule of gas is in upper troposphere which corresponds to a mass fraction this value is close to protosolar helium mass fraction of indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in gas giants third most abundant component of uranus atmosphere is methane methane has prominent absorption bands in visible and near infrared ir making uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour methane molecules account for 2 3 of atmosphere by molar fraction below methane cloud deck at pressure level of this represents about 20 to 30 times carbon abundance found in sun mixing ratio is much lower in upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature which lowers saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia water and hydrogen sulfide in deep atmosphere are poorly known they are probably also higher than solar values along with methane trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in stratosphere of uranus which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by solar ultraviolet uv radiation they include ethane acetylene and spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in upper atmosphere which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets troposphere troposphere is lowest and densest part of atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude temperature falls from about at base of nominal troposphere at 300 km to at 50 km temperatures in coldest upper region of troposphere tropopause actually vary in range between depending on planetary latitude tropopause region is responsible for vast majority of uranus thermal far infrared emissions thus determining its effective temperature of troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure water clouds are hypothesised to lie in pressure range of ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in range of ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at troposphere is a dynamic part of atmosphere exhibiting strong winds bright clouds and seasonal changes upper atmosphere thumb aurorae on uranus taken by space telescope imaging spectrograph stis installed on hubble middle layer of uranian atmosphere is stratosphere where temperature generally increases with altitude from in tropopause to between at base of thermosphere heating of stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar uv and ir radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons which form in this part of atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis heat is also conducted from hot thermosphere hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300 km corresponding to a pressure range of 1000 to 10 pa and temperatures of between most abundant hydrocarbons are methane acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around relative to hydrogen mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower abundance ratio of water is around 7 ethane and acetylene tend to condense in colder lower part of stratosphere and tropopause below 10 mbar level forming haze layers which may be partly responsible for bland appearance of uranus concentration of hydrocarbons in uranian stratosphere above haze is significantly lower than in of other giant planets outermost layer of uranian atmosphere is thermosphere and corona which has a uniform temperature around 800 to 850 k heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood as neither solar uv nor auroral activity can provide necessary energy to maintain these temperatures weak cooling efficiency due to lack of hydrocarbons in stratosphere above 0 1 mbar pressure level may contribute too in addition to molecular hydrogen thermosphere corona contains many free hydrogen atoms their small mass and high temperatures explain why corona extends as far as or two uranian radii from its surface this extended corona is a unique feature of uranus its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting uranus causing a general depletion of dust in uranian rings uranian thermosphere together with upper part of stratosphere corresponds to ionosphere of uranus observations show that ionosphere occupies altitudes from uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either saturn or neptune which may arise from low concentration of hydrocarbons in stratosphere ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar uv radiation and its density depends on solar activity auroral activity is insignificant as compared to jupiter and saturn magnetosphere thumb 300px left magnetic field of uranus as observed by voyager 2 in 1986 s and n are magnetic south and north poles before arrival of voyager 2 no measurements of uranian magnetosphere had been taken so its nature remained a mystery before 1986 scientists had expected magnetic field of uranus to be in line with solar wind because it would then align with uranus poles that lie in ecliptic voyagers observations revealed that uranus magnetic field is peculiar both because it does not originate from its geometric centre and because it is tilted at 59deg from axis of rotation in fact magnetic dipole is shifted from uranus centre towards south rotational pole by as much as one third of planetary radius this unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere where magnetic field strength on surface in southern hemisphere can be as low as 0 1 gauss 10 ut whereas in northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1 1 gauss 110 ut average field at surface is 0 23 gauss 23 ut studies of voyager 2 data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes uranus magnetosphere to connect with solar wind once a uranian day opening planet to sun s particles in comparison magnetic field of earth is roughly as strong at either pole and its magnetic equator is roughly parallel with its geographical equator dipole moment of uranus is 50 times that of earth neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants one hypothesis is that unlike magnetic fields of terrestrial and gas giants which are generated within their cores ice giants magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths for instance in water ammonia ocean another possible explanation for magnetosphere s alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in uranus interior that would deter magnetic field despite its curious alignment in other respects uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets it has a bow shock at about 23 uranian radii ahead of it a magnetopause at 18 uranian radii a fully developed magnetotail and radiation belts overall structure of uranus magnetosphere is different from jupiter s and more similar to saturn s uranus magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew uranus magnetosphere contains charged particles mainly protons and electrons with a small amount of h2 ions no heavier ions have been detected many of these particles probably derive from thermosphere ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1 2 megaelectronvolts respectively density of low energy below 1 ions in inner magnetosphere is about 2 cm 3 particle population is strongly affected by uranian moons which sweep through magnetosphere leaving noticeable gaps particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100 000 years this may be cause of uniformly dark colouration of uranian satellites and rings uranus has relatively well developed aurorae which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles unlike jupiter s uranus aurorae seem to be insignificant for energy balance of planetary thermosphere climate thumb uranus southern hemisphere in approximate natural colour left and in shorter wavelengths right showing its faint cloud bands and atmospheric hood as seen by voyager 2 at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths uranus atmosphere is bland in comparison to other giant planets even to neptune which it otherwise closely resembles when voyager 2 flew by uranus in 1986 it observed a total of ten cloud features across entire planet one proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that uranus internal heat appears markedly lower than that of other giant planets lowest temperature recorded in uranus tropopause is making uranus coldest planet in solar system banded structure winds and clouds in 1986 voyager 2 found that visible southern hemisphere of uranus can be subdivided into two regions a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands their boundary is located at about 45deg of latitude a narrow band straddling latitudinal range from 45 to 50deg is brightest large feature on its visible surface it is called a southern collar cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within pressure range of 1 3 to 2 bar see above besides large scale banded structure voyager 2 observed ten small bright clouds most lying several degrees to north from collar in all other respects uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986 voyager 2 arrived during height of uranus southern summer and could not observe northern hemisphere at beginning of 21st century when northern polar region came into view hubble space telescope hst and keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in northern hemisphere so uranus appeared to be asymmetric bright near south pole and uniformly dark in region north of southern collar in 2007 when uranus passed its equinox southern collar almost disappeared and a faint northern collar emerged near 45deg of latitude thumb first dark spot observed on uranus image obtained by hst acs in 2006 in 1990s number of observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high resolution imaging techniques became available most were found in northern hemisphere as it started to become visible an early explanation that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part whereas in southern hemisphere bright collar masks them was shown to be incorrect nevertheless there are differences between clouds of each hemisphere northern clouds are smaller sharper and brighter they appear to lie at a higher altitude lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude some small clouds live for hours at least one southern cloud may have persisted since voyager 2 flyby recent observation also discovered that cloud features on uranus have a lot in common with those on neptune for example dark spots common on neptune had never been observed on uranus before 2006 when first such feature dubbed uranus dark spot was imaged speculation is that uranus is becoming more neptune like during its equinoctial season tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in upper troposphere of uranus at equator winds are retrograde which means that they blow in reverse direction to planetary rotation their speeds are from wind speeds increase with distance from equator reaching zero values near 20deg latitude where troposphere s temperature minimum is located closer to poles winds shift to a prograde direction flowing with uranus rotation wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at 60deg latitude before falling to zero at poles wind speeds at 40deg latitude range from because collar obscures all clouds below that parallel speeds between it and southern pole are impossible to measure in contrast in northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as are observed near 50deg latitude seasonal variation thumb upright uranus in 2005 rings southern collar and a bright cloud in northern hemisphere are visible hst acs image for a short period from march to may 2004 large clouds appeared in uranian atmosphere giving it a neptune like appearance observations included record breaking wind speeds of and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as fourth of july fireworks on 23 august 2006 researchers at space science institute boulder colorado and university of wisconsin observed a dark spot on uranus surface giving scientists more insight into uranus atmospheric activity why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known but it appears that uranus extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather determining nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on uranus atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years or one full uranian year photometry over course of half a uranian year beginning in 1950s has shown regular variation in brightness in two spectral bands with maxima occurring at solstices and minima occurring at equinoxes a similar periodic variation with maxima at solstices has been noted in microwave measurements of deep troposphere begun in 1960s stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in 1970s also showed maximum values near 1986 solstice majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in viewing geometry there are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in uranus although uranus is known to have a bright south polar region north pole is fairly dim which is incompatible with model of seasonal change outlined above during its previous northern solstice in 1944 uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness which suggests that north pole was not always so dim this information implies that visible pole brightens some time before solstice and darkens after equinox detailed analysis of visible and microwave data revealed that periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around solstices which also indicates a change in meridional albedo patterns in 1990s as uranus moved away from its solstice hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that south polar cap darkened noticeably except southern collar which remained bright whereas northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity such as cloud formations and stronger winds bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon this indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox a faint northern polar collar arose and southern collar became nearly invisible although zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear near summer and winter solstices uranus hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of sun s rays or facing deep space brightening of sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from local thickening of methane clouds and haze layers located in troposphere bright collar at 45deg latitude is also connected with methane clouds other changes in southern polar region can be explained by changes in lower cloud layers variation of microwave emission from uranus is probably caused by changes in deep tropospheric circulation because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection now that spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on uranus dynamics are changing and convection can occur again formation many argue that differences between ice giants and gas giants extend to their formation solar system is hypothesised to have formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as presolar nebula much of nebula s gas primarily hydrogen and helium formed sun and dust grains collected together to form first protoplanets as planets grew some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to nebula s leftover gas more gas they held onto larger they became larger they became more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached and their size began to increase exponentially ice giants with only a few earth masses of nebular gas never reached that critical point recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to sun than their present positions and moved outwards after formation nice model moons thumb left major moons of uranus in order of increasing distance left to right at their proper relative sizes and albedos collage of voyager 2 photographs thumb right uranus system naco vlt image uranus has 27 known natural satellites names of these satellites are chosen from characters in works of shakespeare and alexander pope five main satellites are miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon uranian satellite system is least massive among those of giant planets combined mass of five major satellites would be less than half that of triton largest moon of neptune alone largest of uranus satellites titania has a radius of only or less than half that of moon but slightly more than rhea second largest satellite of saturn making titania eighth largest moon in solar system uranus satellites have relatively low albedos ranging from 0 20 for umbriel to 0 35 for ariel in green light they are ice rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50 ice and 50 rock ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide among uranian satellites ariel appears to have youngest surface with fewest impact craters and umbriel s oldest miranda has fault canyons deep terraced layers and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features miranda s past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently probably as a result of a former 3 1 orbital resonance with umbriel extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely origin of miranda s racetrack like coronae ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4 1 resonance with titania uranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying sun uranus lagrangian point a gravitationally unstable region at 180deg in its orbit crantor crantor moves inside uranus co orbital region on a complex temporary horseshoe orbit is also a promising uranus horseshoe candidate planetary rings uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre thirteen distinct rings are presently known brightest being e ring all except two rings of uranus are extremely narrow they are usually a few kilometres wide rings are probably quite young dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with uranus matter in rings may once have been part of a moon or moons that was shattered by high speed impacts from numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts only a few particles survived in stable zones corresponding to locations of present rings william herschel described a possible ring around uranus in 1789 this sighting is generally considered doubtful because rings are quite faint and in two following centuries none were noted by other observers still herschel made an accurate description of epsilon ring s size its angle relative to earth its red colour and its apparent changes as uranus travelled around sun ring system was definitively discovered on 10 march 1977 by james l elliot edward w dunham and jessica mink using kuiper airborne observatory discovery was serendipitous they planned to use occultation of star sao 158687 also known as hd by uranus to study its atmosphere when their observations were analysed they found that star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind uranus they concluded that there must be a ring system around uranus later they detected four additional rings rings were directly imaged when voyager 2 passed uranus in 1986 voyager 2 also discovered two additional faint rings bringing total number to eleven in december 2005 hubble space telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings largest is located twice as far from uranus as previously known rings these new rings are so far from uranus that they are called outer ring system hubble also spotted two small satellites one of which mab shares its orbit with outermost newly discovered ring new rings bring total number of uranian rings to 13 in april 2006 images of new rings from keck observatory yielded colours of outer rings outermost is blue and other one red one hypothesis concerning outer ring s
