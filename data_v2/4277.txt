thumb upright 1 35 time space diagram of rule 90 with random initial conditions each row of pixels is a configuration of automaton time progresses vertically from top to bottom in mathematical study of cellular automata rule 90 is an elementary cellular automaton based on exclusive or function it consists of a one dimensional array of cells each of which can hold either a 0 or a 1 value in each time step all values are simultaneously replaced by exclusive or of their two neighboring values call it simplest non trivial cellular automaton and it is described extensively in stephen wolfram s 2002 book a new kind of science book s index lists over 50 distinct for rule 90 when started from a single live cell rule 90 has a time space diagram in form of a sierpinski triangle behavior of any other configuration can be explained as a superposition of copies of this pattern combined using exclusive or function any configuration with only finitely many nonzero cells becomes a replicator that eventually fills array with copies of itself when rule 90 is started from a random initial configuration its configuration remains random at each time step its time space diagram forms many triangular windows of different sizes patterns that form when a consecutive row of cells becomes simultaneously zero and then cells with value 1 gradually move into this row from both ends some of earliest studies of rule 90 were made in connection with an unsolved problem in number theory gilbreath s conjecture on differences of consecutive prime numbers this rule is also connected to number theory in a different way via gould s sequence this sequence counts number of nonzero cells in each time step after starting rule 90 with a single live cell its values are powers of two with exponents equal to number of nonzero digits in binary representation of step number other applications of rule 90 have included design of tapestries every configuration of rule 90 has exactly four predecessors other configurations that form given configuration after a single step therefore in contrast to many other cellular automata such as conway s game of life rule 90 has no garden of eden a configuration with no predecessors it provides an example of a cellular automaton that is surjective each configuration has a predecessor but not injective it has sets of more than one configuration with same successor showing that converse of garden of eden theorem is not true description rules thumb in rule 90 each cell s value is computed as exclusive or of two neighboring values in previous time step rule 90 is an elementary cellular automaton that means that it consists of a one dimensional array of cells each of which holds a single binary value either 0 or 1 an assignment of values to all of cells is called a configuration automaton is given an initial configuration and then progresses through other configurations in a sequence of discrete time steps at each step all cells are updated simultaneously a pre specified rule determines new value of each cell as a function of its previous value and of values in its two neighboring cells all cells obey same rule which may be given either as a formula or as a rule table that specifies new value for each possible combination of neighboring values in case of rule 90 each cell s new value is exclusive or of two neighboring values equivalently next state of this particular automaton is governed by following rule table current pattern 111 110 101 100 011 010 001 000 new state for center cell 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 naming name of rule 90 comes from stephen wolfram s binary decimal notation for one dimensional cellular automaton rules to calculate notation for rule concatenate new states in rule table into a single binary number and convert number into decimal 9010 rule 90 has also been called sierpinski automaton due to characteristic sierpinski triangle shape it generates and martin wolfram cellular automaton after early research of on this automaton properties additivity superposition and decomposition a configuration in rule 90 can be partitioned into two subsets of cells that do not interact with each other one of these two subsets consists of cells in even positions at even time steps and cells in odd positions in odd time steps other subset consists of cells in even positions at odd time steps and cells in odd positions at even time steps each of these two subsets can be viewed as a cellular automaton with only its half of cells rule for automaton within each of these subsets is equivalent except for a shift by half a cell per time step to another elementary cellular automaton rule 102 in which new state of each cell is exclusive or of its old state and its right neighbor that is behavior of rule 90 is essentially same as behavior of two interleaved copies of rule 102 except for trivial cas other four linear elementary cas rule 60 rule 90 rule 102 and rule 150 are either essentially equivalent to rule 90 or rule 150 rule 90 and rule 102 are called additive cellular automata this means that if two initial states are combined by computing exclusive or of each their states then their subsequent configurations will be combined in same way more generally one can partition any configuration of rule 90 into two subsets with disjoint nonzero cells evolve two subsets separately and compute each successive configuration of original automaton as exclusive or of configurations on same time steps of two subsets stunted trees and triangular clearings thumb upright 1 35 a forest of stunted trees this is a time space diagram but with time running upwards not downwards rule 90 automaton in its equivalent form on one of two independent subsets of alternating cells was investigated in early 1970s in an attempt to gain additional insight into gilbreath s conjecture on differences of consecutive prime numbers in triangle of numbers generated from primes by repeatedly applying forward difference operator it appears that most values are either 0 or 2 in particular gilbreath s conjecture asserts that leftmost values in each row of this triangle are all 0 or 2 when a contiguous subsequence of values in one row of triangle are all 0 or 2 then rule 90 can be used to determine corresponding subsequence in next row explained rule by a metaphor of tree growth in a forest entitling his paper on subject periodic forests of stunted trees in this metaphor a tree begins growing at each position of initial configuration whose value is 1 and this forest of trees then grows simultaneously to a new height above ground at each time step each nonzero cell at each time step represents a position that is occupied by a growing tree branch at each successive time step a branch can grow into one of two cells above it to its left and right only when there is no other branch competing for same cell a forest of trees growing according to these rules has exactly same behavior as rule 90 from any initial configuration of rule 90 one may form a mathematical forest a directed acyclic graph in which every vertex has at most one outgoing edge whose trees are same as trees in miller s metaphor forest has a vertex for each pair such that cell is nonzero at time vertices at time 0 have no outgoing edges each one forms root of a tree in forest for each vertex with nonzero its outgoing edge goes to unique nonzero neighbor of in time step miller observed that these forests develop triangular clearings regions of time space diagram with no nonzero cells bounded by a flat bottom edge and diagonal sides such a clearing is formed when a consecutive sequence of cells becomes zero simultaneously in one time step and then in tree metaphor branches grow inwards eventually re covering cells of sequence for random initial conditions boundaries between trees formed in this way themselves shift in a seemingly random pattern and trees frequently die out altogether but by means of theory of shift registers he and others were able to find initial conditions in which trees all remain alive forever pattern of growth repeats periodically and all of clearings can be guaranteed to remain bounded in size a similar analysis of periodic configurations in rule 90 also appears in p 954 miller used these repeating patterns to form designs of tapestries some of miller s tapestries depict physical trees others visualize rule 90 automaton using abstract patterns of triangles sierpinski triangle thumb upright 1 5 sierpinski triangle generated by rule 90 time space diagram of rule 90 is a plot in which th row records configuration of automaton at step when initial state has a single nonzero cell this diagram has appearance of sierpinski triangle a fractal formed by combining triangles into larger triangles rules 18 22 26 82 146 154 210 and 218 also generate sierpinski triangles from a single cell however not all of these are created completely identically one way to explain this structure uses fact that in rule 90 each cell is exclusive or of its two neighbors because this is equivalent to modulo 2 addition this generates modulo 2 version of pascal s triangle diagram has a 1 wherever pascal s triangle has an odd number and a 0 wherever pascal s triangle has an even number this is a discrete version of sierpinski triangle pp 25 26 270 271 870 number of live cells in each row of this pattern is a power of two in th row it equals where is number of nonzero digits in binary representation of number sequence of these numbers of live cells 1 2 2 4 2 4 4 8 2 4 4 8 4 8 8 16 2 4 4 8 4 8 8 16 4 8 8 16 8 16 16 32 is known as gould s sequence single live cell of starting configuration is a sawtooth pattern this means that in some time steps numbers of live cells grow arbitrarily large while in others they return to only two live cells infinitely often growth rate of this pattern has a characteristic growing sawtooth wave shape that can be used to recognize physical processes that behave similarly to rule 90 sierpinski triangle also occurs in a more subtle way in evolution of any configuration in rule 90 at any time step in rule s evolution state of any cell can be calculated as exclusive or of a subset of cells in initial configuration that subset has same shape as th row of sierpinski triangle replication in sierpinski triangle for any integer rows numbered by multiples of have nonzero cells spaced at least units apart therefore because of additive property of rule 90 if an initial configuration consists of a finite pattern of nonzero cells with width less than then in steps that are multiples of configuration will consist of copies of spaced at least units from start to start this spacing is wide enough to prevent copies from interfering with each other number of copies is same as number of nonzero cells in corresponding row of sierpinski triangle thus in this rule every pattern is a replicator it generates multiple copies of itself that spread out across configuration eventually filling whole array other rules including von neumann universal constructor codd s cellular automaton and langton s loops also have replicators that work by carrying and copying a sequence of instructions for building themselves in contrast replication in rule 90 is trivial and automatic fig 33 and surrounding text also mentions same property and as well as citing waksman amoroso and cooper he credits its observation to unpublished work by edward fredkin in 1981 predecessors and gardens of eden in rule 90 on an infinite one dimensional lattice every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations this is because in a predecessor any two consecutive cells may have any combination of states but once those two cells states are chosen there is only one consistent choice for states of remaining cells therefore there is no garden of eden in rule 90 a configuration with no predecessors rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell with all other cells zero has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros however this configuration is not a garden of eden because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros fact that every configuration has a predecessor may be summarized by saying that rule 90 is surjective function that maps each configuration to its successor is mathematically a surjective function rule 90 is also not injective in an injective rule every two different configurations have different successors but rule 90 has pairs of configurations with same successor rule 90 provides an example of a cellular automaton that is surjective but not injective garden of eden theorem of moore and myhill implies that every injective cellular automaton must be surjective but this example shows that converse is not true pp 959 960 provide a similar analysis of predecessors of same rule for finite sets of cells with periodic boundary conditions because each configuration has only a bounded number of predecessors evolution of rule 90 preserves entropy of any configuration in particular if an infinite initial configuration is selected by choosing state of each cell independently at random with each of two states being equally likely to be selected then each subsequent configuration can be described by exactly same probability distribution emulation by other systems thumb bowtie pasta replicator in highlife one dimensional arrays of which can be used to emulate rule 90 many other cellular automata and other computational systems are capable of emulating behavior of rule 90 for instance a configuration in rule 90 may be translated into a configuration into different elementary cellular automaton rule 22 translation replaces each rule 90 cell by three consecutive rule 22 cells these cells are all zero if rule 90 cell is itself zero a nonzero rule 90 cell is translated into a one followed by two zeros with this transformation every six steps of rule 22 automaton simulate a single step of rule 90 automaton similar direct simulations of rule 90 are also possible for elementary cellular automata rule 45 and rule 126 for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems and in some two dimensional cellular automata including rule 90 can also simulate itself in same way if each cell of a rule 90 configuration is replaced by a pair of consecutive cells first containing original cell s value and second containing zero then this doubled configuration has same behavior as original configuration at half speed pp 269 270 666 667 701 702 1117 various other cellular automata are known to support replicators patterns that make copies of themselves and most share same behavior as in tree growth model for rule 90 a new copy is placed to either side of replicator pattern as long as space there is empty however if two replicators both attempt to copy themselves into same position then space remains blank in either case replicators themselves vanish leaving their copies to carry on replication a standard example of this behavior is bowtie pasta pattern in two dimensional highlife rule this rule behaves in many ways like conway s game of life but such a small replicator does not exist in life whenever an automaton supports replicators with same growth pattern one dimensional arrays of replicators can be used to simulate rule 90 rule 90 on finite rows of cells can also be simulated by block oscillators of two dimensional cellular automaton also called 2x2 and behavior of rule 90 can be used to characterize possible periods of these oscillators see also other elementary cellular automata rule 30 rule 110 and rule 184 references external links rule 90 in wolfram s atlas of cellular automata category cellular automaton rules
