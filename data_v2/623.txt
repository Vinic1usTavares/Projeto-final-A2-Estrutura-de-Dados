alchon huns also known as alchono alkhon alkhan and were a nomadic people who established states in central asia and south asia during 4th and 6th centuries ce they were first mentioned as being located in and later expanded south east into punjab and central india as far as eran and kausambi alchon invasion of indian subcontinent eradicated huns who had preceded them by about a century and contributed to fall of gupta empire in a sense bringing an end to classical india alchon huns established themselves as overlords of northwestern india and directly contributed to downfall of guptas in invasion of india by huna peoples follows invasions of subcontinent in preceding centuries by indo greeks saka indo scythians indo parthians and kushana yuezhi alchon empire was third of four major huna states established in central and south asia alchon were preceded by kidarites and hephthalites and succeeded by nezak huns names of alchon kings are known from their extensive coinage buddhist accounts and a number of commemorative inscriptions throughout indian subcontinent alchons have long been considered as a part or a sub division of hephthalites or as their eastern branch but now tend to be considered as a separate entity note 8 it is now clear that were not part of those huns who conquered land south of hindu kush and sind as well in early 6th century in fact this latter hunnic group was one commonly known as alkhon because of inscriptions on their coins 2008 in name to contemporaneous observers in india alchon were one of huna peoples or hunas whose origins are controversial a seal from kausambi associated with toramana bears title hunaraja huna king toramana is also described as a huna huna in inscription thumb left upright 1 2 word alchono alkhonno in greco bactrian cursive script on a coin of khingila cng coins hunas appear to have been peoples known in contemporaneous iranian sources as and similar names which were later romanised as xionites or chionites hunas are often linked to huns that invaded europe from central asia during same period consequently word hun has three slightly different meanings depending on context in which it is used 1 huns of europe 2 groups associated with huna people who invaded northern india 3 a vague term for hun like people alchon have also been labelled huns with essentially second meaning as well as elements of third name alchon generally given to them comes from bactrian legend of their early coinage where they simply imitated sassanian coins to which they added name alchono alkhono also alkhonno in bactrian script a slight adaptation of greek script and tamgha symbol of their clan for one of these with word alchono in bactrian script alkhono and tamgha symbol on his coins cng coins several original coins such as those of khingila also bear mention alchono together with tamgha symbol philologically alchono alkhono may be a combination of al for aryan and xono for huns although this remains hypothetical another etymology could be al turkish for scarlet and xono for huns meaning red huns red being a symbol of south among steppe nomads history invasion of bactria 370 ce during reign of shapur ii sasanian empire and sasanians gradually lost control of bactria to these invaders from central asia first kidarites from around 335 ce then hephthalites and alchon huns from 370 ce who would follow up with invasion of india early confrontations between sasanian empire of shapur ii with nomadic hordes from central asia called chionites were described by ammianus marcellinus he reports that in 356 ce shapur ii was taking his winter quarters on his eastern borders repelling hostilities of bordering tribes of chionites and euseni euseni is usually amended to meaning kushans

victories of xionites during their campaigns in eastern caspian lands were also witnesses and described by ammianus marcellinus history of civilizations of central asia ahmad hasan dani b a unesco p 38 sq alchon huns occupied bactria circa 370 ce where they started minting coins in style of shapur ii but bearing their name alchono and emerged in around 380 taking over kabulistan from sassanian persians at same time kidarites red huns still ruled in alchon huns are said to have taken control of kabul in 388 alchon huns initially issued anonymous coins based on sasanian designs several types of these coins are known usually minted in bactria using sasanian coinage designs with busts imitating sasanian kings shapur ii r 309 to 379 ce and shapur iii r 383 to 388 ce adding alchon tamgha and name alchono alkhonno in bactrian script a slight adaptation of greek script which had been introduced in region by greco bactrians in 3rd century bce on obverse and with attendants to a fire altar a standard sasanian design on reverse cng coins it is thought alchons took over sasanian mints in kabulistan after 385 ce reusing dies of shapur ii and shapur iii to which they added name alchono gandhara 460 ce around 430 king khingila most notable alchon ruler and first one to be named and represented on his coins with legend in bactrian emerged and took control of routes across hindu kush from kidarites he seems to have been a contemporary of sassanian ruler bahram v as alchons took control diplomatic missions were established in 457 with china khingila under name was called king of india in shahnameh of ferdowsi alchon ruler mehama r 461 493 was elevated to position of governor for sasanian emperor peroz i r 459 484 and described himself as king of people of and governor of famous and prosperous king of kings peroz in a 462 463 letter he allied with peroz i in his victory over kidarites in 466 ce and may also have helped him take throne against his brother hormizd iii but he was later able to wrestle autonomy or even independence between 460 and 470 ce alchons took over gandhara and punjab which also had remained under control of kidarites while gupta empire remained further east they apparently undertook mass destruction of buddhist monasteries and stupas at taxila a high center of learning which never recovered from destruction virtually all of alchon coins found in area of taxila were found in ruins of burned down monasteries where apparently some of invaders died alongside local defenders during wave of destructions it is thought that kanishka stupa one of most famous and tallest buildings in antiquity was destroyed by them during their invasion of area in ce rest of 5th century marks a period of territorial expansion and eponymous kings several of which appear to have overlapped and ruled jointly here for first time names of hepthalite alchon kings are given some of them otherwise known only from coins another important fact is that it dates all these kings in same time from alchon huns invaded parts of northwestern india from second half of 5th century according to pillar inscription gupta ruler skandagupta already confronted and defeated an unnamed huna ruler circa 456 457 ce sindh thumb uncertain hunnic chieftain sindh 5th century from circa 480 ce there are also suggestion of hunnic occupation of sindh between multan and mouth of indus river as local sasanian coinage of sindh starts to incorporate sun symbols or a hunnic tamgha to design these little known coins are usually described as result of invasions of hephthalites quality of coins also becomes very much degraded by that time and actual gold content becomes quite low compared to previous sasanian style coinage contributions hunas were precisely ruling area of malwa at doorstep of western deccan at time famous ajanta caves were made by ruler of vakataka empire through their control of vast areas of northwestern india huns may actually have

abundant folds first hunnic war central india thumb right monastery of ghoshitarama in kausambi was probably destroyed by alchon huns under toramana in first hunnic war 496 515 alchon reached their maximum territorial extent with king toramana pushing deep into indian territory reaching gujarat and madhya pradesh in central india and ultimately contributing to downfall of gupta empire to south inscriptions indicate that toramana penetrated at least as far as northern gujarat and possibly to port of to east far into central india city of kausambi where seals with toramana s name were found was probably sacked by in 497 500 before they moved to occupy malwa in particular it is thought that monastery of ghoshitarama in kausambi was destroyed by toramana as several of his seals were found there one of them bearing name toramana impressed over official seal of monastery and other bearing title hunaraja together with debris and arrowheads another seal this time by mihirakula is reported from kausambi these territories may have been taken from gupta emperor alternatively they may have been captured during rule of his successor narasimhagupta first battle of eran 510 ce a decisive battle occurred in malwa where a local gupta ruler probably a governor named bhanugupta was in charge in bhanugupta eran inscription this local ruler reports that his army participated in a great battle in 510 ce at eran where it suffered severe casualties bhanugupta was probably vanquished by toramana at this battle so that western gupta province of malwa fell into hands of hunas thumb left

malwa to shudra toramana who continued his conquest to magadha forcing narasimhagupta baladitya to make a retreat to bengal toramana possessed of great prowess and armies then conquered city of tirtha in gauda country modern bengal after successful conclusion of eran episode conquering hunas ultimately burst out of eastern malwa and swooped down upon very heart of gupta empire eastern countries were overrun and city of was occupied gives a scintillating account of this phase of toramana s conquest it says that after bhanugupta s defeat and discomfiture toramana led hunas against magadha and obliged baladitya narasimha gupta baladitya reigning gupta monarch to retire to bengal this great monarch toramana by caste and possessed of great prowess and armies took hold of that position bank of

sanskrit in brahmi script first line of inscription in which toramana is introduced as great king of kings reads on his gold coins minted in india in style of gupta emperors toramana presented himself confidently as fact that alchon huns issued gold coins such as toramana issue in addition to their silver and copper coins suggest that their empire in india was quite rich and powerful this makes it quite clear that alchon huns in india must have had a substantial and rich empire with capacity to issue a relatively large volume of gold coins in full article defeat 515 ce toramana was finally defeated by local indian rulers local ruler bhanugupta is sometimes credited with vanquishing toramana as his 510 ce inscription in eran recording his participation in a great battle is vague enough to allow for such an interpretation great battle in which participated is not detailed and it is impossible to know what it was or which way it ended and interpretations vary and others consider in view of inscription as well as manjusri mula kalpa that bhanugupta was on contrary vanquished by toramana at 510 ce eran battle so that western gupta province of malwa fell into hands of hunas at that point so that toramana could be mentioned in eran boar inscription as ruler of region toramana was finally vanquished with certainty by an indian ruler of aulikara dynasty of malwa after nearly 20 years in india according to stone slab inscription discovered in 1983 king defeated toramana in 515 ce first hunnic war thus ended with a hunnic defeat and hunnic troops apparently retreated to area

of magadha named baladitya who could be gupta ruler narasimhagupta baladitya took refuge but that was finally captured by indian king he later spared mihirakula s life on intercession of his mother as

persecutor of their religion in gandhara in northern pakistan during his reign over one thousand buddhist monasteries throughout gandhara are said to have been destroyed in particular writings of chinese monk xuanzang from 630 ce explained that mihirakula ordered destruction of buddhism and expulsion of monks indeed buddhist art of gandhara in particular greco buddhist art becomes essentially extinct around that period when xuanzang visited northwestern india in ce he reported that buddhism had drastically declined and that most of monasteries were deserted and left in ruins although guptas were traditionally a brahmanical dynasty around period of invasions of alchon gupta rulers had apparently been favouring buddhism according to contemporary writer mihirakula s supposed nemesis narasimhagupta baladitya was brought up under influence of philosopher he built a sangharama at nalanda and a high vihara with a buddha statue within which according to xuanzang resembled great vihara built under bodhi tree according to c 800 ce king became a buddhist monk and left world through meditation dhyana xuanzang also noted that narasimhagupta baladitya s son vajra who also commissioned a sangharama possessed a heart firm in faith 12th century kashmiri historian kalhana also painted a dreary picture of mihirakula s cruelty as well as his persecution of buddhist faith and sun cult alchons are generally described as sun worshipers a traditional cult of steppe nomads this stems from appearance of sun symbols on some of their coins combined with probable influence they received from cult of surya in india mihirakula is also said to have been an ardent worshiper of shiva although he may have been selectively attracted to destructive powers of indian deity mihirakula is said

numerous smaller indian powers emerging after crumbling of guptas huna invasions are said to have seriously damaged india s trade with europe and central asia particularly indo roman trade relations which gupta empire had greatly benefited from guptas had been exporting numerous luxury products such as silk leather goods fur iron products ivory pearl and pepper from centers such as nasik paithan pataliputra and benares huna invasion probably disrupted these trade relations and tax revenues that came with them furthermore indian urban culture was left in decline and buddhism gravely weakened by destruction of monasteries and killing of monks started to collapse great centers of learning were destroyed such as city of taxila bringing cultural regression during their rule of 60 years alchons are said to have altered hierarchy of ruling families and indian caste system for example hunas are often said to have become precursors of rajputs on artistic side however alchon huns may have played a role just like western satraps centuries before them in helping spread art of gandhara to western deccan region coinage legacy 6th 12th century ce as they invaded northern and central india circa 500 ce alchon huns issued several types of coinage on model of sasanian empire with ruler in profile on obverse and sacred fire with attendants on reverse it is thought that in process of minting coins in occupied lands they transmitted sasanian coin designs to northern and western india this created a major type of indian coinage called indo sasanian coinage which lasted in degraded form until 12th century ce as far as gangetic region sources ancient sources refer to alchons and associated groups ambiguously with various names such as huna in indian texts and xionites in greek texts xuanzang chronicled some of later history of alchons modern archeology has provided valuable insights into history of alchons most significant cataloguing of alchon dynasty came in 1967 with
