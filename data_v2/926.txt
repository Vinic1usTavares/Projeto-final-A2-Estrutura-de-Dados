london and wales use class 800s standard journey time to bristol temple meads is 13 minutes and to cardiff central is 45 minutes history thumb a boulder marks site of original station patchway railway station first opened on 8 september 1863 when services began on bristol and south wales union railway bswur which ran from to north of bristol on banks of river severn at new passage passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross severn to continue on into wales line engineered by isambard kingdom brunel was built as single track broad gauge patchway was from temple meads adjacent to bristol to gloucester road what is now a38 gloucester road station was only a small structure and very little is known about it there were initially six trains per day on weekdays in each direction with three trains per day on sundays bswur was amalgamated with great western railway gwr which had from beginning operated all bswur services in 1868 and in 1873 line was converted to standard gauge although line made travel from bristol to wales easier change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient and so a tunnel was built under severn to cope with anticipated increase in demand it was decided that line should be increased to twin track however gradient between and patchway 1 in 68 was considered undesirably steep for trains heading up hill towards bristol particularly for heavy coal trains and so a three mile deviation was built with a 1 in 100 gradient between pilning and a point south of patchway trains uphill towards bristol would use new line while trains downhill towards wales would continue to use steeper original track deviation left two tracks at patchway at significantly different levels and so made original site impractical for a station station was rebuilt south along line at its present site from bristol temple meads a boulder and information board marks site of original station thumb original patchway railway station was west of current site it was abandoned when a new less steep track left was built for trains from wales towards bristol new station opened on 10 august 1885 and was originally known as patchway stoke gifford but reverted to patchway from 27 october 1908 station was on a north south alignment and had two platforms separated by two running lines with a third line a goods loop behind western platform there was a goods yard to south of station on eastern side with an adjacent signal box as now eastern platform was for trains towards bristol western platform for trains towards wales station buildings were of a standard 1880s gwr design with tall chimneys and fretted wooden canopies main building was on eastern platform containing booking office toilets and waiting rooms a matching brick shelter with canopy was built on western platform eastern platform also had a bicycle house at northern end a large covered and glazed footbridge linked two platforms goods yard included two sidings a short south facing one adjacent to a loading dock and a longer north facing one there was also a weigh bridge and a coal office at north end of station was a south facing siding and an oil store station did not have a dedicated approach road as it was adjacent to a road connecting gloucester road to west and gypsy patch lane to south this road subsequently became known as station road at time of construction station was mostly surrounded by fields with bristol conurbation almost away in 1900 almost all trains from london to wales travelled via bath and bristol with some still routed via however final to bristol were relatively slow and congested so a new route was built further north gwr s badminton line now part of south wales main line running from wootton bassett junction to a junction just south of patchway new line opened in 1903 and allowed faster services to wales there was a new triangular junction between patchway and filton with new line coming in from east as part of work station signal box was closed replaced by a larger one closer to junction on 19 october 1902 new signal box would later become one of only a few to be double glazed due to noise from jet engine testing from bristol siddeley aero engines factory now rolls royce factory opposite box henbury loop line opened in 1910 connecting to main lines south of patchway from 1928 some trains from bristol would travel in loops via patchway and thumb a passenger train passes west through patchway in 1958 in background on right a freight train can be seen using goods loop when railways were nationalised in 1948 patchway came under aegis of western region of british railways in 1949 there were 11 trains towards south wales and 13 towards bristol each weekday with three trains per day in each direction on sundays however by 1965 this had reduced to eight trains on weekdays towards south wales and six towards bristol with no sunday service traffic levels fell station was closed to goods traffic on 5 july 1965 and subsequently had all staff withdrawn on 14 october 1968 goods loop was taken up and station buildings demolished replaced by small brick shelters structure of footbridge remained but roof was removed goods yard was repurposed as vehicle storage in 1974 when local government act 1972 came into effect southern part of gloucestershire including district of patchway became part of new county of avon avon was disbanded in 1996 with region now governed by south gloucestershire council thumb south of patchway is patchway junction where lines from london bristol and avonmouth converge british rail was split into business led sectors in 1980s at which time operations at patchway passed to regional railways when railway was privatised in 1997 local services were franchised to wales west which was succeeded by wessex trains an arm of national express in 2001 wessex franchise was amalgamated with great western franchise into greater western franchise from 2006 and responsibility passed to first great western a subsidiary company of firstgroup and rebranded as great western railway in 2015 from december 2006 virgin crosscountry began operating a single daily service newcastle to cardiff central via bristol temple meads and patchway this service was taken over by arriva crosscountry when crosscountry franchise changed hands in 2007 and then replaced by a daily service each direction between cardiff central and since mid 2000s severnside community rail partnership have been working to enhance patchway station one of first acts was installing new community notice boards a local working group was formed to adopt station and group negotiated with rolls royce to use their cctv system to cover station a successful bid was made to department for transport s access for all scheme which provided for improved signage lighting and seats a station garden was created in partnership with nearby patchway community college and two decorative mosaics were installed disused railway land adjacent to station was cleared through a community payback scheme future first great western declined a contractual option to continue greater western passenger franchise beyond 2013 citing a desire for a longer term contract due to impending upgrade to great western main line franchise was put out to tender but process was halted and later scrapped due to fallout from collapse of intercity west coast franchise competition a two year franchise extension until september 2015 was agreed in october 2013 and subsequently extended until march 2019 crosscountry franchise is also due to expire in 2019 south wales main line from london to cardiff is due to be electrified by 2017 as is line to bristol temple meads however lines to weston super mare and southampton will not be electrified in near future so services at patchway will still be provided by diesel trains with sprinter units to be replaced by and turbo units group friends of suburban bristol railways supports electrification continuing to weston as does mp for weston super mare john penrose station footbridge is expected to be replaced with a higher bridge to allow installation of overhead electrification and it is hoped that adjacent railway land could be used to expand car park there are also calls for station to be made accessible to disabled users see also rail services in bristol metrowest notes references
