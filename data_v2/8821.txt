freespace 2 is a 1999 space combat simulation computer game developed by volition as sequel to descent freespace great war it was completed ahead of schedule in less than a year and released to very positive reviews however game became a commercial failure and was described by certain critics as one of 1999 s most unfairly overlooked titles game continues on story from descent freespace once again thrusting player into role of a pilot fighting against mysterious aliens shivans while defending human race and its alien vasudan allies player also gets involved in putting down a rebellion game features large numbers of fighters alongside gigantic capital ships in a battlefield fraught with beams shells and missiles in detailed star systems and nebulae free multiplayer games were available via parallax online which also ranked players by their statistics a persistent galaxy was also available as squadwar for players to fight with each other over territories in 2002 volition released source code for game engine under a non commercial license this code became core of freespace 2 source code project which continuously improves it and enables new features in cooperation with freespace upgrade project game s graphics are kept up to date improved game engine is also used by various mod projects for example babylon project and diaspora which are based on science fiction series babylon 5 and battlestar galactica respectively gameplay thumb 200px left a corvette and a destroyer attacking each other with beam 2s gameplay involves player piloting a starfighter using mounted weapons to destroy enemy starfighters performing reconnaissance behind enemy lines or escorting other starships its flight model is based on a looser interpretation of space physics instead of realistic newtonian physics hence ships are weightless and feel more responsive though they require constant application of engine power to move result is that game plays more like a wwii dogfight simulator unaffected by gravity although joysticks are recommended controller for this game mouse is a viable alternative single player mode is executed in form of a campaign which follows a story as a linear sequence of missions are executed pre mission briefing stage is where player gets information on background and objectives and selects ship and weapons choices of ships and weapons increase as player proceeds further along campaign certain missions however will dictate certain ships and weapons to be used weapons can be classified into primary weapons and secondary weapons primary weapons are kinetic and energy weapons while missiles and torpedoes are classified as secondary weapons each weapon has its own specifications such as its rate of fire they also inflict different damages on hulls body of ships or shields protective energy fields surrounding ships or possess special effects such as shutting down specific electronic systems or propulsion player flies around in a fighter with a first person in cockpit view with a fully customizable fixed head up display hud as visual interface hud displays video communications and relevant data on ship s status and performance weapons objectives and targets it can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships while hull damage is unrecoverable shields recharge over time with game supporting force feedback technology joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage afterburners or collide with objects similarly certain events such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons will shake screen as a form of visual feedback freespace 2 has many helpful features available player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them power can be shunted between shields engines and weapons thereby allowing faster recharge of shields afterburners and weapons at expense of other subsystems these features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay mission parameters are not rigidly fixed as there is an allowance for failures of some primary objectives when mission is concluded a post mission briefing will be conducted to discuss mission and performance of player before next mission can be taken on freespace 2 allows multiplayer games to be played across a local area network lan or over internet via free services provided by parallax online pxo player can communicate with other network players vocally through freespace 2s own voice chat capability lan play allows players to play standard player versus player modes such as deathmatch or cooperate to complete multiplayer missions they can even join in games which are already underway same can be done over pxo but with added incentive of having players statistics of kills and deaths being tracked on a ladder ranking system players can also form up or join squadrons in squadwar an online persistent galaxy hosted by volition on pxo where squadrons fight each other for territories plot and setting freespace 2 takes place entirely in outer space playing area is vast when compared to small starfighters piloted by player and effective range they have this space is populated with interstellar bodies such as stars planets asteroids etc implementation of nebulae as an interactive environment is one of most distinctive and crowning aspects of freespace 2 flying through a nebula involves impaired vision and occasional disruptions to flight electronics nebulae have become known as an eerie and suspenseful arena of play journeys between star systems are achieved by jumping through jump nodes and traveling through subspace while shorter intra system distances are done by hopping into subspace at any time all ships in a mission either jump or hop to make their entries and exits game s starship designs are clearly distinguishable between three races terran starships tend to be plain and practical vasudans starships are artistic with sleek lines and curves and enemies ships shivans are sharp pointy and asymmetrical in insidious black and red colors freespace 2 also features humongous capital ships hundreds of times larger than fighters and armed to teeth with beam weapons and flak guns these ships are commonly scripted to seek each other out and engage in massive duels freespace 2s story is brought out via narrative pre rendered cutscenes pre and post mission briefings as well as in game chatter between non player characters and scripted mission events structure for story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out story story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through campaign however players are given option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row this gives those who are interested in story but less skilled chance to continue on with story without frustration characters player takes role of a pilot in ranks of galactic terran vasudan alliance gtva while appearance and name of pilot can be customized by player player never gets to personally interact with other characters in game pilot is also never shown in game s cinematics or any other media just like player s pilot most of other characters are low key non player character admiral aken bosch however plays a crucial part in moving story as a prominent antagonist from start he sparks off a rebellion which escalates scale of action and brings in other antagonist force shivans into story storytelling took on a character driven approach with expositions taking form of cutscenes in which bosch gives out monologues revealing purpose and driving forces behind his actions a few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to voices in game academy award nominee robert loggia voiced player s commanding officer admiral petrarch and admiral bosch was voiced by ronny cox kurtwood smith and stephen baldwin participated in bit roles as well story game begins 32 years after events in descent freespace following end of great war both gta and pve cemented their alliance by combining together to form galactic terran vasudan alliance gtva a single entity formed to cement alliance between terran and vasudan races after destruction of prime by lucifer and subsequent collapse of all subspace nodes to sol system as a result of s destruction inside sol delta serpentis jump node despite this alliance however opposition still exists to this union in form of a faction of terrans led by great war veteran admiral aken bosch who leads rebel group under banner of neo terran front ntf ntf s rebellion led to faction gaining control over sirius polaris and regulus star systems while engaging gtva for 18 months before launching attacks on vasudan systems of deneb and alpha centauri seeking to stop ntf from securing deneb gtva launch a campaign in star system though they are shocked to find bosch within an effort to stop him fails badly and so gtva focus on securing star system with great success just as further engagements against ntf are about to commence an incident in gamma draconis system leads to 3rd fleet of gtva being reassigned to star system where they learn that shivans have returned along with discovery of an artificial jump gate that leads to shivan space after securing device and passing through it gtva discover a nebula along with more shivans and a cruiser of ntf trinity despite efforts to secure and recover cruiser trinity is destroyed and gtva fleet focus on dealing with shivans before returning to gamma draconis for reassignment ntf rebellion soon becomes focus of attention once again after attacks intensify eventually leading gtva to quell an attack on a space station with their latest ship enormous capital ship gtva colossus dwarfing all other capital ships this juggernaut class ship s power proves more than a match to many ntf ships defeating a major officer in rebellion seeking to capitalize on this gtvi galactic terran vasudan intelligence organise an operation with their soc special operation command to investigate and uncover information on bosch s etak project which is nearly wrecked when a vasudan admiral attempts to hit bosch s flagship iceni following latest campaign against ntf gtva forces re engage shivan forces in nebula while testing out new weapon and technology prototypes such as an awacs cruiser that enables better vision in nebula a tag missile that enables friendly capital ships to instantly lock on to tagged enemy ship and pegasus class stealth fighter with aid of these new technologies alliance destroys a shivan ravana class destroyer 3rd fleet soon return to gtva space where bosch launches an assault to get ntf to jump gate while ntf loses many ships iceni escapes with bosch on board thanks to sabotage preventing gtva colossus from firing on it while pursuing bosch into nebula gtva attack shivan nebular gas mining operations only for shivans to retaliate with a juggernaut class warship of their own dubbed sathanas sathanas enters terran vasudan space despite an effort to destroy jump gate linking nebula to gamma draconis node between two system had stabilised at some point with shivans encroaching on gtva space sathanas is engaged by colossus as it enters densely populated capella system and thanks to player s efforts in disabling its beam turrets is destroyed in engagement vasudan commander at hours gtva colossus destroyed shivan juggernaut sathanas near gamma draconis jump node in capella this victory proves without a doubt our technological superiority over our great war nemesis for second time alliance defeated a species which has annihilated entire civilizations across this galaxy with colossus we will have nothing more to fear alliance fleet soon resumes its efforts to track down bosch and discover that bosch had built a device that enables him to communicate with shivans which was purpose of etak alliance realise jump gate was activated by bosch who had been stealing artefacts from archaeological sites looking into ancients and had been hoping to meet and contact shivans shivans respond to his transmission and in turn board his command frigate iceni and capture him and fifteen other crewmen before attempting to destroy it gtva manage to save surviving crew of iceni and etak device but as they try to intercept shivan transport carrying bosch they discover a second jump gate in nebula which alliance destroyer attempts to secure however it is destroyed by another sathanas juggernaut shortly afterwards forcing gtva to pull out during this time gtvi and soc launch a secret operation within nebula at great risk to recover an operative and check other side of gate discovering threat posed to gtva by shivans is much greater than they had thought admiral petrarch nine sathanas juggernauts have now entered capella system and intelligence has sighted even more in nebula converging on jump node to terran vasudan space we are on threshold of a new apocalypse though juggernauts have not engaged our warships they have set course for capella star we can only speculate about their intentions but this development cannot bode well for alliance alliance devises a plan to halt shivan invasion while evacuating civilians and others from capella star system by collapsing two jump nodes from capella to rest of gtva space alliance plans to recreate same conditions that collapsed sol jump nodes namely a sufficiently powerful meson explosion using a number of great war era destroyers including bastion which gtva send out to collapse capella epsilon pegasi node by detonating its payload while it is within node admiral petrarch preparations are now underway to collapse epsilon pegasi jump node a great war era destroyer gtd bastion will contain multiple meson warheads that will detonate inside node scientists believe an explosion of sufficient magnitude will cause this node to collapse as evidenced by destruction of lucifer 32 years ago detonation of reactors sealed off sol jump node in delta serpentis and severed all contact with earth plan works but it is pyrrhic victory as gtva loses colossus their only match for shivan juggernauts in a diversionary engagement at other end of capella system with not much left to do but escort remaining evacuation convoys to capella vega jump node while a second payload is sent to jump node gtva soon begins to detect activity from system s star which is being bombarded with an intense subspace field by numerous sathanas class ships this causes star to goes supernova destroying fighting gtva and shivans in system player can choose to flee scene when warning is given or stay and die defending remaining ships which affects ending slightly terran commander we are detecting a massive shockwave emanating from capella sun all units proceed to vega node you are advised to leave system immediately in ending cutscene player s commanding officer admiral petrarch delivers a speech about everything alliance has lost speculating on nature of shivans and why they destroyed capella star and if player decides to stay a small tribute is paid to player s heroic actions as petrarch informs his wingmen of his sacrifice admiral concludes by saying that alliance now has means to recreate ancient subspace gate implying that there s a chance node to earth can be restored and that this conflict didn t bring only sorrow before signing off development news of freespace 2 being in development was confirmed in a chat on november 6 1998 freespace 2 was developed in less than one year volition team revealed they had written up a story and will be targeting high end hardware with dogfights for a greater number of ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships team set themselves goals of setting new standards for both single player and multiplayer space combat simulations and started to modify freespace game engine for freespace 2 this team was same team which had worked on descent freespace plus several new members in order to flesh out story volition hired jason scott as a full time writer before work even started linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help immersion factor of story greatly as relations between terrans and vasudans dominated first game it was decided to scale focus down to a personal level with admiral bosch and his decisions to rebel scott s close work with designers and co ordination of voice recording process helped to tightly integrate story into missions giving a more sophisticated feel to story due to time constraints a lot of initial ideas were dropped from final version of game such as atmospheric battles and new weapons types like a subspace missile artillery strike team made major improvements to same freespace engine from first game by revamping core of graphical engine and adding 32 bit support they sped up interface screens and graphic processing hardware acceleration for graphics was also decided to be a requirement to target high end machines of 1999 this allowed for a greater number of ships visibly active on battlefield satisfying team s penchant of having great numbers of fighters and capitals ships duking it out in a big battlefield instead of multiple small ass battles shifting of their target focus to higher end machines also fulfilled their top priority of having capital ships many times larger than fighter crafts team also followed real world concepts for some of their designs pegasus stealth fighter was modeled on stealth technology of 1990s for people to relate to it easily game was restrained from becoming too realistic by team s recognition that most gamers only want believable worlds to have a blast flying around in and blowing things up compared to graphical changes artificial intelligence ai of computer controlled characters was only slightly changed justification given was that team felt ai worked very well for first game all they had to do was to tweak it a little and fix some bugs there was however a lot of work done in improving multiplayer portion of game for freespace 2 player s personal computer was assigned a greater role in predicting possible consequences for other players actions this reduced amount of data needed to be transferred between computers which would result in a smoother playing experience beta testers were recruited to stress test and troubleshoot multiplayer mode as well squadwar was implemented as an attempt to establish a sense of continuity among players in form of a persistent online territorial fight along with pilot statistics and ladder rankings volition hoped this concept would help to establish a strong online community and build up game s lifespan process of fixing bugs detected was even publicly published on game s official website as bug fix of day feature freespace 2 was released on september 30 1999 one month ahead of schedule however team had to quickly come up with and release a patch version 1 01 for a software bug which prevented recognition of a cd during installation process three months later they released next and final patch version 1 20 to fix several other bugs release of freespace 2 was considerably muted compared to its predecessor descent freespace its publisher interplay did not organize contests for it nor did they generate pre release hype up with same drive as before they also posted incorrect system requirements for game on their site freespace 2 was also placed on less visible shelves than descent 3 however when gamespot awarded freespace 2 sci fi simulation of year award interplay pushed out sci fi sim of year edition to capitalize on it despite volition s interest and desire to develop add ons and expansions for freespace 2 interplay told them to stop volition was then acquired by thq in 2000 as interplay owns rights to freespace series as well as descent series and volition s owners thq is only interested in pursuing development on what they own volition was unable to continue developing freespace franchise faced with source code which became practically useless to them volition released source code for only game engines to public under a noncommercial license on april 25 2002 mike kulas president of volition said this was to give those outside game industry a chance to look at code of a commercial software product a desire he and matt had when they were not yet in industry in years since no sequels to freespace 2 have been made and interplay has only published a limited re release of it on february 2 2004 to commemorate company s 20th anniversary interplay by that time was in financial trouble failing to pay rent and wages to its workers seeking investors to inject it with funds interplay changed business strategies instead of developing and publishing single player games it sold licenses to those games and looked towards developing massive multi player online games derek smart creator of battlecruiser had casually mentioned his interest in freespace license but nothing significant came out of this in 2013 interplay acquired remaining rights to freespace franchise for 7 500 after thq went to bankruptcy court interplay buys freespace rights for a cool 7 500 reception reviews and awards thumb 200px left game s backdrops have received high praise from 2 has garnered high praise from most established reviewers freespace 2 received numerous game of year awards for 1999 and was nominated for computer simulation game of year in 3rd annual interactive achievement awards 2000 every review praised freespace 2s graphics from ships to backgrounds reviewers were pleased with details volition had paid attention to such as thematic differences in ship designs between races textures and clarity of backdrops and even realism of explosions though firingsquad pointed out explosions from torpedo strikes were lower in quality nebulae feature was also praised for its rendered atmosphere which reviewers described as tense and paranoia inducing as they keep expecting enemy ships to appear out of gases in a deadly ambush even though a couple of reviewers wrote that nebulae made them dizzy they still liked feature combatsim even claimed freespace 2 was unrivaled among its space combat peers in graphics department graphical standards were such that when reviewed anniversary edition in 2004 found graphics to stand up quite well to recent games then gamespot felt story was both deeper and darker than either wing commander and x wing series establishing invincible foes who never lost their stature despite player learning of plausible ways to defeat them game revolution felt story was first rate for being able to build several different conflicts into an unforgettable climax nicely presented by emphasis of story telling by means of in game events while eurogamer supported story as intriguing it also marked down its rating of game for way story was told reviewer felt just a cog in machine story telling approach left him apathetic towards non player characters and missions in game firingsquad however said it created a very believable military atmosphere which helped to show how things revolve around big events instead of just around a single person combatsim com offered another angle reynolds said gameplay elements of freespace 2 are light years beyond competition and more than offsets loss of being personally immersed in game s universe freespace 2s key attraction is its dogfights cnn com said close ranged dogfights make for engrossing and exciting skirmishes firingsquad described it as a total thrill to be among 20 fighters flying in between opposing capital ships with beams missiles and flak all around and warnings going off as they try to seek out and destroy their opposite numbers a view which gamespot agreed with game s ai was judged adequate to provide for such fights being cunning enough to trick others to crash into walls of narrow openings and good enough to detect and warn their wingmen of enemies coming up directly behind them there are those who expressed minor disappointments with ai tending to collide too often with other objects while dynamic mission objectives were celebrated for coming up with twists and turns to spice up story there were a few who found these in game red herrings overused instead sharky extreme praised freespace 2 for having enormous capital ships as this burst trapped in a bubble trend in wing commander and x wing type games instead of action simply coming to player it flows all around and player is one who has to go and seek it scenes of these giant ships duking it out with many gnat like fighters swarming around in their little dances of death have led reviewers to feel a sense of comparable to reliving battles in science fiction series like babylon 5 and star wars similarly pc gamer praised scaling of ships and battles and said that they came as close to creating feeling of a world war ii naval battle in space as any game has ever come and that that s what fighter combat in space or on earth should be all about opinions were generally favorable towards freespace 2s multiplayer implementation squadwar received favorable responses from reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking while required registration with pxo was considered a troublesome process by a few gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all other reviewers experiences with lag were different reynolds of combatsim com said internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places but lan gaming was smooth sailing gamespy s reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players firingsquad s reviewer s experience was similar but he said lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of multiplayer action blake fischer reviewed pc version of game for next generation rating it five stars out of five and stated that no self respecting space combat junkie should live without it gamespot in electing freespace 2 as one of greatest games of all time pointed out that while most of game s features could be found in its predecessor or peers its sheer quality of presentation and gameplay was key reason for their choice computer and video games has acknowledged it as offering best dogfighting among space combat classics ars technica also posed freespace 2 as last significant stage in evolution of space combat genre fans of freespace series have created modifications mods of freespace 2 first mods were just custom campaigns with series of missions created through mission editor freely packaged with freespace 2 one such mod which gained notability was inferno which sets its story decades after conclusion of freespace 2 released in july 2003 mod was hosted on established sites such as gamespot and cnet as part of their freespace 2 contents sales despite glowing reviews freespace 2 was a commercial disappointment in united states it totaled sales of 26 983 copies by end of 1999 according to pc data writing for daily radar andrew s bub remarked that game horrifically underperformed and was one of most unfairly overlooked titles of year freespace 2 was a runner up for gamespot s 1999 best game no one played award which ultimately went to disciples sacred lands freespace 2s sales were acknowledged as disappointing and described as awful by kulas he however stated that as team had stayed within budget by sticking to schedule volition should at least be breaking even with estimated final sales of game in nowgamer s interview with jim boone a producer at volition he stated that this could have been due to joysticks being sold poorly because they were going out of fashion because more modern first person shooters such as quake were very much about mouse and keyboard he went further on to state before that when we did descent for example it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks we sold a lot of copies of descent it was around that time when more modern fps with mouse and keyboard came out as opposed to just keyboard like wolfenstein 3d or something source code project with release of game engine s source code possibilities of changing game greatly opened up and fan community made use of code to update game using recent technology led by edward gardner and ian warfield freespace 2 source code project was formed to standardize changes and maintain a core engine for others to take advantage of using new fan updated engine projects such as beyond red line based on new battlestar galactica and babylon project based on babylon 5 have become possible pxo free internet gaming service handling squadwar was initially acquired by thq in their 2002 acquisition of outrage entertainment renamed as outrage games service was continued until july 2003 when outrage games was dissolved and pxo terminated components of its website were however later handed over to freespace 2 source code project to help them
