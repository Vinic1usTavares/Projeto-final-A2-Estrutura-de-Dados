delivered jazz standards with same devastating power demonstrated on past blues performances staff wrote that james combined jazz and blues elements successfully creating sense of loneliness and desperation in which james has always excelled in expressing popmatters review was positive overall claiming james rough voice made her appear to be in tune with woeful nature of songs though it insisted that her cover of only women bleed was a miscalculation of major proportions allmusic s stephen thomas erlewine called james one of best blues performers of twentieth century and wrote in his review of album that she still possesses an exceptionally strong voice robust and filled with passion however erlewine also wrote that heart of a woman never has emotional impact james intended it to have music critic robert christgau s review simply reads torching cocktail cool and recommended tracks my old flame and i only have eyes for you advocate andrew velez felt that i got it bad and that ain t good was album s best track steve knopper of chicago tribune thought arrangements were tinkly and meandering with james sounding as through she s learning a foreign language knopper considered only women bleed to be album s most soulful track track listing thumb right etta james performing in 2000 you don t know what love is gene de paul don raye 5 28 good morning heartache ervin drake dan
