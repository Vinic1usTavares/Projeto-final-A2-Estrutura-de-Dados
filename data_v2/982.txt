to break barrier to allow u boats freer access to mediterranean and allied shipping an allied force composed of ships from three navies responded to raid and in ensuing battle heavily damaged austro

his actions during battle halpern 1995 p 163 there were 47 drifters in barrage on night of 14 may austro hungarians managed to sink 14 drifters and damage four more lack of sufficient allied escorts forced withdrawal of remaining blockading ships although only for a short time tucker p 1357 battle by this time allied naval forces in area were aware of raid and were in a position to block austro hungarian retreat rear admiral alfredo acton commanding officer of italian scouting division ordered group southward at 04 35 while he embarked on british light cruiser by 06 45 cruisers dartmouth and along with italian destroyers pilo acerbi and aquila were sailing north in an attempt to cut off austro hungarian cruisers italian light cruiser flotilla leader and destroyers and were readying to sail in support as well mirabello group engaged austro hungarian cruisers at 07 00 but were heavily outgunned and instead attempted to shadow fleeing cruisers at 07 45 rear admiral acton s ships encountered destroyers csepel and balaton after 20 minutes italian destroyers were able to close distance to austro hungarian ships two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from csepel struck aquila and disabled ship s boilers by this time austro hungarian destroyers were under cover of coastal batteries at durazzo and were able to make good their escape at 09 00 bristols lookouts spotted smoke from austro hungarian cruisers to south of her position allied ships turned to engage austro hungarian ships british ships had a superiority both in numbers and in firepower dartmouth was armed with eight guns and bristol had two 6 inch and ten compared to nine guns on each of austro hungarian ships halpern 1995 pp 163 164 unfortunately for allies their numerical superiority was quickly lost as their destroyers were either occupied with mechanical problems or protecting those destroyers suffering from breakdowns support forces of both sides sankt georg group for austro hungarians and marsala group for allies were quickly dispatched to battle italian fba seaplanes from seaplane carrier europa shadowed austro hungarian cruisers and eventually dropped bombs on helgoland only scoring a near miss that dislodged some rivets in her rudder halpern 2004 p 75 thumbnail right horthy seriously wounded commanded austro hungarian fleet until falling unconscious dartmouth faster than bristol closed to effective engagement range with austro hungarian ships and opened fire a shell from dartmouth struck novara at which point austro hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close distance dartmouth was struck several times and by 11 00 acton ordered ship to reduce speed to allow bristol to catch up halpern 1995 p 164 novara was hit several more times and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged which caused ship to begin losing speed at 11 05 acton turned away in an attempt to separate saida from novara and helgoland at this point sankt georg was approaching scene which prompted acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces this break in action was enough time for austro hungarians to save crippled novara saida took ship under tow while helgoland covered them unaware that novara had been disabled and fearing that his ships would be drawn too close to austrian naval base at cattaro acton broke off pursuit destroyer acerbi misread signal and attempted to launch a torpedo attack but was driven off by combined fire of novara saida and helgoland at 12 05 acton realized dire situation novara was in but by this time sankt georg group was too close halpern 1995 p 165 sankt georg group rendezvoused with novara saida and helgoland and csepel and balaton reached scene as well entire group returned to cattaro together at 13 30 submarine uc 25 torpedoed dartmouth causing serious damage escorting destroyers forced uc 25 from area but dartmouth had to be abandoned for a period of time before it could be towed back to port french destroyer attempted to pursue german submarine but struck a mine laid by uc 25 that morning and sank rapidly aftermath thumb monument for heroes of otranto battle on prevlaka in today croatia as a result of raid it was decided by british naval command that unless sufficient destroyers were available to protect barrage drifters would have to be withdrawn at night drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day and would have to leave their positions by 15 00 every day despite damage received by austro hungarian cruisers during pursuit by dartmouth and bristol austro hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on allied blockade in addition to sunk and damaged drifters cruiser dartmouth was nearly sunk by german submarine uc 25 french destroyer was mined and sunk and a munitions convoy to valona was interdicted halpern 1995 pp 165 166 however in a strategic sense battle had little effect on war barrage was never particularly effective at preventing u boat operations of germany and austria hungary in first place drifters could cover approximately apiece of wide strait only slightly more than half was covered raid risked some of most advanced units of austro hungarian fleet on an operation that offered minimal strategic returns halpern 1995 p 166 footnotes references further reading it carlo stasi otranto e l
