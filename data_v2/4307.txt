saratoga campaign in 1777 was an attempt by british high command for north america to gain military control of strategically important hudson river valley during american revolutionary war it ended in surrender of british army which historian edmund morgan argues was a great turning point of war because it won for americans foreign assistance which was last element needed for victory edmund morgan birth of republic 1763 1789 1956 pp 82 83 primary thrust of campaign was planned and initiated by general john burgoyne commanding a main force of some 8 000 men he moved south in june from quebec up lake champlain to middle new york then marched over divide and down hudson valley to saratoga he initially skirmished there with patriot defenders with mixed results then after losses in battles of saratoga in september and october his deteriorating position and ever increasing size of american army forced him to surrender his forces to american general horatio gates on october 17 in this critical british loss on field of battle coordinated movements that had been drawn up in far away london did not materialize colonel barry st leger had been assigned to move east through mohawk river valley on albany new york but was forced to retreat during siege of fort stanwix after losing his indian allies major expedition planned from south was not launched due to miscommunication with london when general william howe sent his army to take philadelphia rather than sending it up hudson river to link up with burgoyne a last minute effort to reinforce burgoyne from new york city was made in early october but it was too little too late american victory was an enormous morale boost to fledgling nation more importantly it convinced france to enter war in alliance with united states openly providing money soldiers and munitions as well as fighting a naval war worldwide against britain british strategy toward end of 1776 it was apparent to many in england that pacification of new england was very difficult due to high concentration of patriots london decided to isolate new england and concentrate on central and southern regions where loyalists supposedly could be rallied in december 1776 general john burgoyne met with lord germain british secretary of state for colonies and government official responsible for managing war to set strategy for 1777 there were two main armies in north america to work with general guy carleton s army in quebec and general william howe s army which had driven george washington s army from new york city in new york campaign ketchum 1997 pp 42 51 65 howe s plan to attack philadelphia on november 30 1776 howe british commander in chief in north america wrote to germain outlining an ambitious plan for 1777 campaign howe said that if germain sent him substantial reinforcements he could launch multiple offensives including sending 10 000 men up hudson river to take albany new york then in autumn howe could move south and capture u s capital of philadelphia nickerson 1967 p 78 howe soon changed his mind after writing this letter reinforcements might not arrive and retreat of continental army over winter of 1776 77 made philadelphia an increasingly vulnerable target therefore howe decided that he would make capture of philadelphia primary object of 1777 campaign howe sent germain this revised plan which germain received on february 23 1777 black 1991 p 127 burgoyne s plan to capture albany burgoyne seeking to command a major force proposed to isolate new england by an invasion from quebec into new york this had already been attempted by general carleton in 1776 although he had stopped short of a full scale invasion due to lateness of season carleton was heavily criticized in london for not taking advantage of american retreat from quebec and he was also intensely disliked by germain this combined with rival henry clinton s failed attempt to capture charleston south carolina placed burgoyne in a good position to get command of 1777 northern campaign ketchum 1997 pp 19 77 82 thumb right general john burgoyne portrait by joshua reynolds burgoyne presented a written plan to lord germain on february 28 1777 germain approved it and gave burgoyne command of main expedition ketchum 1997 pp 79 84 burgoyne s invasion plan from quebec had two components he would lead main force of about 8 000 men south from montreal along lake champlain and hudson river valley while a second column of about 2 000 men which barry st leger was chosen to lead would move from lake ontario east down mohawk river valley in a strategic diversion both expeditions would converge upon albany where they would link up with troops from howe s army proceeding up hudson control of lake champlain lake george hudson river route from canada to new york city would cut off new england from rest of american colonies ketchum 1997 p 84 last part of burgoyne s proposal advance by howe up hudson from new york city proved to be most controversial part of campaign germain approved burgoyne s plan after having received howe s letter detailing his proposed offensive against philadelphia whether germain told burgoyne who was still in london at that time about howe s revised plans is unclear while some sources claim he did others state that burgoyne was not notified of changes until campaign was well underway samuel b griffith war for american independence from 1760 to surrender at yorktown in 1781 historian robert ketchum believes that burgoyne would probably have been aware of problems that lay ahead had he been notified of philadelphia plan whether germain howe and burgoyne had same expectations about degree to which howe was supposed to support invasion from quebec is also unclear what is clear is that germain either left his generals with too much latitude or without a clearly defined overall strategy black p 126 in march 1777 germain had approved of howe s philadelphia expedition and did not include any express orders for howe to go to albany yet germain also sent howe a copy of his instructions to carleton which plainly stated that northern army was to make a junction with howe s army at albany fisher sydney george struggle for american independence vol ii 1908 pp 73 74 in a letter from germain to howe dated may 18 1777 he made clear that philadelphia expedition should be executed in time for you to co operate with army ordered to proceed from canada and put itself under your command this last letter however was not received by howe until after he had departed new york for chesapeake ketchum 1997 p 104 to attack philadelphia howe could either have moved overland through new jersey or by sea via delaware bay both options would have kept him a position to aid burgoyne if necessary final route he took through chesapeake bay was immensely time consuming and left him wholly unable to assist burgoyne as germain had envisioned decision was so difficult to understand that howe s more hostile critics accused him of deliberate treachery adams charles francis campaign of 1777 proceedings of massachusetts historical society volume 44 1910 11 pp 25 26 burgoyne returned to quebec on may 6 1777 bearing a letter from lord germain which introduced plan but lacked some details ketchum 1997 pp 87 88 this produced another of conflicts of command that plagued british throughout war lieutenant general burgoyne technically outranked major general carleton but carleton was still governor of quebec germain s instructions to burgoyne and carleton had specifically limited carleton s role to operations in quebec this slight against carleton combined with carleton s failure to get command of expedition led to his resignation later in 1777 and to his refusal to supply troops from quebec regiments to garrison forts at crown point and ticonderoga after they were captured nickerson 1967 pp 188 189 american strategy george washington whose army was encamped at morristown new jersey and american military command did not have a good picture of british plans for 1777 principal question on minds of washington and his generals horatio gates and philip schuyler who both were at turns responsible for continental army s northern department and its defense of hudson river was of movements of howe s army in new york they had no significant knowledge of what was being planned for british forces in quebec in spite of burgoyne s complaints that everyone in montreal knew what he was planning nickerson 1967 p 137 three generals disagreed on what burgoyne s most likely movement was and congress also rendered opinion that burgoyne s army was likely to move to new york by sea nickerson 1967 p 138 partly as a result of this indecision and fact that it would be isolated from its supply lines if howe moved north garrisons at fort ticonderoga and elsewhere in mohawk and hudson valleys were not significantly increased schuyler took measure in april 1777 of sending a large regiment under colonel peter gansevoort to rehabilitate fort stanwix in upper mohawk valley as a step in defending against british movements in that area pancake 1977 p 139 washington also ordered four regiments to be held at peekskill new york that could be directed either to north or south in response to british movements nickerson 1967 p 139 american troops were allocated throughout new york theater in june 1777 about 1 500 troops including those of colonel gansevoort were in outposts along mohawk river about 3 000 troops were in hudson river highlands under command of general israel

de vergennes then foreign minister outlined a series of proposals that led to secret french and also spanish support of congress and some preparations for possibility of war including expansion of their navies vergennes did not think open participation in war was diplomatically or politically feasible until washington s army demonstrated its strength and ability to gain military victories without significant assistance nickerson 1967 p 65 66 to further aim of french participation in war vergennes closely monitored news from north america and london and worked to remove impediments to spanish participation in war vergennes went so far as to propose war to king louis xvi in august 1776 but news of howe s capture of new york city scuttled that plan nickerson 1967 pp 55 75 campaign begins most of burgoyne s army had arrived in quebec in spring of 1776 and participated in routing of continental army troops from province in addition to british regulars troops in quebec included

of these regular forces 200 british regulars and 300 to 400 germans were assigned to st leger s mohawk valley expedition and about 3 500 men remained in quebec to protect province remaining forces

companies nickerson 1967 pp 106 107 burgoyne had also expected as many as 1 000 indians to support expedition about 500 joined between montreal and crown point ketchum 1997 p 111 burgoyne s army was beset by transport difficulties before it left quebec something that apparently neither burgoyne nor carleton anticipated as expedition expected to travel mainly over water there were few wagons horses and other draft animals available to move large amount of equipment and supplies on land portions of route only in early june did carleton issue orders to procure carts sufficient to move army consequently carts were poorly constructed of green wood and teams were driven by civilians who were at a higher risk of desertion ketchum 1997 p 107 on june 13 1777 burgoyne and carleton reviewed assembled forces at st john s on richelieu river just north of lake champlain and burgoyne was ceremonially given command nickerson 1967 p 104 in addition to five sailing ships built previous year a sixth had been built and three had been captured after battle of valcour island these provided some transport as well as military cover for large fleet of transport boats that moved army south on lake

caught up with elements of retreating americans at least three times general fraser and elements of baron riedesel s troops faced determined resistance in battle of hubbardton on july 7 and a skirmish that same day between vanguard of main army met pierse long s retreating companies in a skirmish at skenesboro these were followed by another standoff in battle of fort anne on july 8 in which a forward company of british army was nearly decimated these actions cost americans about 50 more casualties than those incurred by british and they demonstrated to british officers present that americans were capable of putting up stiff resistance burgoyne s army was reduced by about 1 500 men as a result of ticonderoga actions he left 400 men to garrison magazine at crown point and another 900 to defend ticonderoga and battles that followed resulted in about 200 casualties nickerson 1967 pp 146 157 438 bulk of st clair s army retreated through new hampshire grants present day vermont st

considered his next steps he penned letters describing british victory intended for public consumption when this news reached capitals of europe king george was happy and comte de vergennes was not as news effectively scuttled an early proposal for french entry into war british diplomats increased pressure on french and spanish demanding that they close their ports to american shipping while this demand was refused it markedly increased tensions between powers news was also harshly received by congress and american public including slanders that st clair and schuyler had been bribed nickerson 1967 pp 161 62 on july 10 burgoyne issued orders for next series of movements most of army was to take rough road from skenesboro to fort edward via fort anne while heavy artillery was to be transported down lake george to fort edward riedesel s troops were sent back up road toward castleton primarily as a diversion intended to suggest that he might be aiming for connecticut river nickerson 1967 p 160 61 burgoyne s decision to move army overland via fort anne was a curious one for it contradicted his own earlier commentaries on planning expedition in which he presciently observed that defenders could easily block route his decision appears to have been motivated by two factors first being perception that moving army over water via lake george would require a retrograde movement that could be perceived as a retreat and second being influence of philip skene whose property would benefit by improved road burgoyne would have to build ketchum 1997 p 240 general schuyler at albany when he received word of ticonderoga s fall immediately rode to fort edward where there was a garrison of about 700 regulars and 1 400 militia nickerson 1967 p 173 he decided to make burgoyne s passage as difficult as possible using axe as a weapon as it was much easier to fell large trees in enemy s path than to remove them after they were down this brought burgoyne s advance to a crawl tiring his troops and forcing them to use up supplies on july 11 burgoyne wrote to lord germain complaining that americans were systematically felling trees destroying bridges and damming streams along road to fort edward ketchum 1997 p 244 schuyler also employed scorched earth tactics to deny british access to local provisions in spite of burgoyne s lack of movement his scouts were active some of schuyler s work crews were attacked ketchum 1997 p 249 schuyler s tactics required burgoyne to build a road through wilderness for his guns and troops a task that took about two weeks they moved out of skenesboro on july 24 and reached fort edward on july 29 finding that schuyler had already abandoned it in a retreat that ended at stillwater new york nickerson 1967 pp 179 180 before he left skenesboro burgoyne was joined by about 500 indians mostly but also fox mississauga chippewa and ojibwe as well as members of iroquois from great lakes region under leadership of st luc de la corne and charles michel de langlade nickerson 1967 p 1997 pp 265 268 st leger s expedition lieutenant colonel st leger sailed up st lawrence and crossed lake ontario

brant sayenqueraghta and cornplanter leaving oswego on july 25 they marched to fort stanwix on mohawk river and began besieging it on august 2 about 800 members of tryon county militia and their indian allies marched to relieve siege but some of st leger s british and indians ambushed them on august 6 at bloody battle of oriskany while americans held field of battle they retreated because of heavy casualties they suffered including mortal wounding of their leader general nicholas herkimer warriors from iroquois nations fought on both sides of battle marking beginning of a civil war within six nations during oriskany action besieged americans staged a sortie from fort stanwix and raided nearly empty indian camp combined with significant indian casualties at oriskany this was a significant blow to indian morale nickerson 1967 pp 195 211 thumb 350px burgoyne s march on albany june october 1777 on august 10 benedict arnold left stillwater new york for fort stanwix with 800 men of continental army from schuyler s northern department he expected to recruit members of tryon county militia when he arrived at fort dayton on august 21 arnold could only raise about 100 militia as most of militia men that had been at oriskany were not interested in joining so he instead resorted to subterfuge he staged escape of a loyalist captive who convinced st leger that arnold was coming with a much larger force than he actually had on this news joseph brant and rest of st leger s indians withdrew nickerson 1967 pp 271 275 they took most of his remaining supplies with them and st leger was forced to raise siege and head back through oswego to quebec arnold sent a detachment a short way after them and turned rest of his force east to rejoin american forces at saratoga st leger

growing american forces around him nickerson 1967 pp 354 355 mounting difficulties advance of burgoyne s army to fort edward was as with approach to ticonderoga preceded by a wave of indians which chased away small contingent of troops left there by schuyler ketchum 1997 p 273 these allies became impatient and began indiscriminate raids on frontier families and settlements which had effect of increasing rather than reducing local support to american rebels nickerson 1967 p 183 in particular death at indian hands of attractive young loyalist settler jane mccrea was widely publicized and served as a catalyst for rebel support as burgoyne s decision to not punish perpetrators was seen as unwillingness or inability to keep indians under control ketchum 1997 pp 275 278 left thumb upright general john stark hero of bennington even though bulk of his army made trip from skenesboro to fort edward in just five days army s lack of adequate transport served to delay army again as supply

succeeded in making their way through american lines to burgoyne s camp at fort edward numerous attempts by british generals to communicate were frustrated by capture and hanging of their messengers by americans messengers did not bring good news on july 17 howe wrote that he was preparing to depart by sea with his army to capture philadelphia and that general clinton responsible for new york city s defense would act as occurrences may direct ketchum 1997 p 283 burgoyne refused to divulge contents of this dispatch to his staff realizing that he now had a serious supply problem burgoyne decided to act on a suggestion that baron riedesel had made to him in july riedesel whose forces burgoyne had stationed at castleton for a time while he was at skenesboro had observed that area was rich in draft animals and horses which might be seized for army s benefit including mounting of riedesel s currently unmounted dragoons nickerson 1967 p 233 pursuing this idea burgoyne sent colonel friedrich baum s regiment toward western massachusetts and new hampshire grants on august 9 along with some brunswick dragoons nickerson 1967 p 240 most of baum s detachment never returned from august 16 battle of bennington and reinforcements he had sent after them came back after they were ravaged in same battle which deprived burgoyne of nearly 1 000 men and much needed supplies what burgoyne had been unaware of was that st clair s calls for militia support following withdrawal from ticonderoga had been answered and general john stark had placed 2 000 men at bennington stark s force enveloped baum s at bennington killing him and capturing much of his detachment ketchum 1997 pp 285 323 death of jane mccrea and battle of bennington besides acting as rallying cries for americans had another important effect burgoyne blamed his indian and canadian allies for mccrea s death and even after indians had lost 80 of their number at bennington burgoyne showed them no gratitude ketchum

germain sided with la corne american change of fortune while tactic of delay worked well in field result in continental congress was a different matter general horatio gates was in philadelphia when congress discussed its shock at fall of ticonderoga and gates was more than willing to help assign blame to reluctant generals some in congress had already been impatient with general george washington wanting a large direct confrontation that might eliminate occupation forces but which washington feared would probably lose war john adams head of war committee praised gates and remarked that we shall never hold a post until we shoot a general over objections of new york delegation congress sent gates to take command of northern department on august 10 it also ordered states from pennsylvania to massachusetts to call out their militias ketchum 1997 p 335 on august 19 gates arrived at albany to take charge he was cold and arrogant in manner and pointedly excluded schuyler from his first war council schuyler left for philadelphia shortly after depriving gates of his intimate knowledge of area ketchum 1997 p 337 throughout month of august and continuing into september militia companies arrived at continental army camps on hudson these were augmented by troops washington ordered north from hudson highlands as part of general arnold s operation to relieve stanwix those

small army at bennington which was reduced in size by disease and departure of some of its companies but was also augmented by several hundred troops raised by general benjamin lincoln who was assigned to make attacks against burgoyne s supply and communications nickerson 1967 p 268 saratoga thumb right upright general horatio gates portrait by gilbert stuart battle of saratoga is often depicted as a single event but it was actually a month long series of maneuvers punctuated by two battles at beginning of september 1777 burgoyne s army now just over 7 000 strong was located on east bank of hudson luzader 2008 p 230 he had learned of st leger s failure at stanwix on august 28 and even earlier that howe would not be giving him substantial support from new york city faced with need to reach defensible winter quarters which would require either retreat back to ticonderoga or advance to albany he decided on latter subsequent to this decision he made two further crucial decisions he decided to deliberately cut communications to north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and ticonderoga and he decided to cross hudson river while he was in a relatively strong position nickerson 1967 pp 290 295 he therefore ordered riedesel whose forces were in rear to abandon outposts from skenesboro south and ordered army to cross river just north of saratoga which it did between september 13 and 15 nickerson 1967 p 296 moving cautiously since departure of his indian support had deprived him of reliable scouting burgoyne advanced to south nickerson 1967 p 299 on september 18 vanguard of his army had reached a position just north of saratoga about from american defensive line and skirmishes occurred between leading elements of armies nickerson 1967 p 300 when gates took over schuyler s army much of it was located near mouth of mohawk river south of stillwater on september 8 he ordered army then about 10 000 men of whom about 8 500 were effective combat troops to stillwater with idea of setting up defenses there polish engineer tadeusz kosciuszko found area inadequate for proper defensive works so a new location was found about three miles further north and about south of saratoga at this location kosciusko laid out defensive lines stretching from river to bluffs called bemis heights ketchum 1997 pp 346 2008 p 210 right side of these defenses was nominally given to general lincoln but as he was leading troops intended for a diversion against ticonderoga gates assumed command of that portion of line himself gates put general arnold with whom he had previously had a good relationship in command of army s left western defenses on bemis heights relationship between two soured when arnold chose

gates for permission to move his forces out to freeman s farm to anticipate that maneuver gates refused to carry out a general movement since he wanted to wait behind his defenses for expected frontal attack ketchum 1997 p 355 but he did permit arnold to send daniel morgan s riflemen and some light infantry out for a reconnaissance in force these forces precipitated battle of freeman s farm when

which had been technically independent but operated under arnold s command in battle to his direct command arnold and gates had a noisy argument in gates quarters in which gates said that general lincoln would be replacing him following argument arnold drafted a letter to gates outlining his grievances and requesting a transfer to washington s command ketchum 1997 pp 386 387 gates gave arnold a pass to leave and continued to inflict petty indignities on arnold ketchum 1997 p 388 a commonly referenced reason why arnold chose to remain is that a petition signed by all of line officers except gates and lincoln convinced him to stay while proposals for such a document were considered there is no contemporary evidence of one actually being drafted and signed luzader 2008 p 271 burgoyne considered renewing attack next day but called it off when fraser noted that many men were fatigued from previous day s exertions luzader 2008 p 248 he therefore dug his army in and waited for news that he would receive some assistance from south as a letter he received from general clinton in new york on september 21 suggested that a movement up hudson would draw off some of gates army ketchum 1997 p 375 although he was aware of persistent desertions that were reducing size of his army and that army was running short of food and other critical supplies ketchum 1997 p 381 he did not know
