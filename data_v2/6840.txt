1519 1522 1527 and 1536 notable amongst these are second edition 1519 used by martin luther for his translation of new testament into german so called september testament and third edition 1522 which

majority of modern translations of new testament in 16 19th centuries first edition in 1512 erasmus had been in negotiation with badius of paris to publish vulgate of jerome and a new edition of adagia it did not happen and erasmus did not continue contacts with badius at that time erasmus did not think about a greek new testament it is uncertain when erasmus decided to prepare his edition of greek new testament but on a visit to basel in august 1514 he contacted johann froben many scholars believe that froben had heard about forthcoming spanish polyglot bible and tried to overtake project of alcala e g s p tregelles it appears that froben printer of basel wished to anticipate edition of greek testament which was as he heard in preparation in spain see s p tregelles printed text of

manuscripts except last book book of revelation unfortunately this manuscript was not complete it lacked final leaf which contained last six verses of book instead of delaying publication on account

simul et fidem postremo ad et praecipue una cum annotationibus quae quid qua ratione mutatum sit this title especially words novum instrumentum recognitum et emendatum means new testament revised and improved this title must refer to latin text of vulgate not to any greek text because at that time there was not a printed edition of greek new testament in circulation in his dedication to pope leo x erasmus says i perceived that that teaching which is our salvation was to be had in a much purer and more lively form if sought at fountain head and drawn from actual sources than from pools and runnels and so i have revised whole new testament as they call it against standard of greek original i have added annotations of my own in order in first place to show reader what changes i have made

stunica answered that latin manuscripts are more reliable than greek in 1520 edward lee accused erasmus of encouraging arianism edward lee epistolae aliquot eruditorum virorum basel 1520 erasmus replied that he had not found any greek manuscript that contained these words he answered that this was a case not of omission but simply of non addition he showed that even some latin manuscripts did not contain these words s p tregelles an account of printed text of greek new testament london 1854 p 22 another attack was made in 1521 by paulus prefect of vatican library because in greek text erasmus departed from common readings of vulgate he informed erasmus that in vatican library is held an extremely ancient copy of scriptures i e codex vaticanus he sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 john 4 1 3 and 1 john 5 7 11 it did not include comma second edition became basis for luther s german translation third edition with third edition of erasmus s greek text 1522 comma johanneum was included an often repeated story is that erasmus included it because he felt bound by a promise to include it if a manuscript was found that contained it when a single 16th century greek manuscript subsequently had been found to contain it codex montfortianus erasmus included it though he expressed doubt as to authenticity of passage in his annotations erasmus annotations on new testament galatians to apocalypse edited by anne reeve and m a screech brill 1993 p 770 henk jan de jonge a specialist in erasmian studies stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by erasmus real reason to include comma by erasmus was his care for his good name and for success of his novum testamentum henk jan de
