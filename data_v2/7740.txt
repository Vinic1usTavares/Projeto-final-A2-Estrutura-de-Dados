a chinese scientist and statesman excelling in a variety of fields he was accomplished in mathematics astronomy cartography geography horology pharmacology mineralogy metallurgy zoology botany mechanical engineering hydraulic engineering civil engineering architecture invention art poetry philosophy antiquities and statesmanship during song dynasty 960 1279 su song was engineer for a hydro mechanical astronomical clock tower in medieval kaifeng which employed use of an early escapement mechanism needham volume 4 part 2 445 needham volume 4 part 2 448 bodde 140 fry 10 escapement mechanism of su s clock tower had been invented by buddhist monk yi xing and government official liang lingzan in 725 ad to operate a water powered armillary sphere although su s armillary sphere was first to be provided with a mechanical clock drive needham volume 3 351 su s clock tower also featured oldest known endless power transmitting chain drive called tian ti or celestial ladder as depicted in his horological treatise needham volume 4 part 2 111 clock tower had 133 different clock jacks to indicate and sound hours needham volume 4 part 2 165 su song s treatise about clock tower xinyi xiangfayao has survived since its written form in 1092 and official printed publication in 1094 book has been analyzed by many historians such as joseph needham clock itself however was dismantled by invading jurchen army in 1127 ad and although attempts were made to reassemble it tower was never successfully reinstated xinyi xiangfayao was su s best known treatise but polymath compiled other works as well he completed a large celestial atlas of several star maps several terrestrial maps as well as a treatise on pharmacology latter discussed related subjects on mineralogy zoology botany and metallurgy european jesuit visitors to china like matteo ricci and nicolas trigault briefly wrote about chinese clocks with wheel drives needham volume 4 part 2 438 but others mistakenly believed that chinese had never advanced beyond stage of clepsydra incense clock and sundial they thought that advanced mechanical clockworks were new to china and that these mechanisms were something valuable that europeans could offer to chinese needham volume 4 part 2 435 440 although not as prominent as in song period contemporary chinese texts of ming dynasty 1368 1644 described a relatively unbroken history of mechanical clocks in china from 13th century to 16th however su song s clock tower still relied on use of a waterwheel to power it and was thus not fully mechanical like late medieval european clocks life and works thumb left 220px a scale model of su song s astronomical clock tower career as a scholar official su song was of hokkien ancestry who was born in modern day fujian near medieval quanzhou like his contemporary shen kuo 1031 1095 su song was a polymath a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different fields of study it was written by his junior colleague and hanlin scholar ye 1077 1148 liu 593 that in su s youth he mastered provincial exams and rose to top of examination list for writing best article on general principles and structure of chinese calendar from an early age his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat in his spare time he was fond of writing poetry which he used to praise works of artists such as painter li gonglin 1049 1106 edwards 175 176 harrist 269 he was also an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties in matters of administrative government he had attained rank of ambassador and president of ministry of personnel at capital of kaifeng and was known also as an expert in administration and finance needham volume 4 part 2 32 after serving in ministry of personnel he became a minister of justice in 1086 he was appointed as a distinguished editor for academy of scholarly worthies where in 1063 he edited redacted commented on and added a preface for classic work huainanzi of han dynasty 202 bc 220 ad roth 224 226 eventually su rose to post of vice president of chancellery secretariat among many honorable positions and titles conferred upon him su song was also one of deputy tutors of heir apparent at court he chose to distance himself from political rivalries of conservatives led by prime minister sima guang 1019 1086 and reformists led by prime minister wang anshi 1021 1086 although many of his associates were of conservative faction in 1077 he was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to liao dynasty of khitan people to north needham volume 4 part 2 446 447 sharing ideas about calendrical science as liao state had created its own calendar in 994 ad bowman 105 in a finding that reportedly embarrassed court su song acknowledged to emperor that calendar of khitan people was in fact a bit more accurate than their own resulting in fining and punishment of officials in bureau of astronomy and calendar needham volume 4 part 2 447 su was supposed to travel north to liao and arrive promptly for a birthday celebration and feast on a day which coincided with winter solstice of song calendar but was actually a day behind liao calendar wittfogel feng 599 historian liu heping states that emperor zhezong of song sponsored su song s clocktower in 1086 in order to compete with liao for scientific and national superiority liu 577 in 1081 court instructed su song to compile into a book diplomatic history of song liao relations an elaborate task that once complete filled 200 volumes breslin 14 with his extensive knowledge of cartography su song was able to settle a heated border dispute between song and liao dynasties wright 213 astronomy thumb right 230px a star map with equidistant cylindrical projection from su song s xinyi xiangfayao volume 3 208 su song also created a celestial atlas in five separate maps which had hour circles between xiu lunar mansions forming astronomical meridians with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection on each side of equator miyajima kazuhiko 1997 projection methods in chinese korean and japanese star maps from highlights of astronomy vol 11b p 714 ed j andersen kluwer academic publishers and thus was in accordance to their north polar distances needham volume 4 part 3 569 furthermore su song must have taken advantage of astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer shen kuo needham volume 3 278 this is so because su song s fourth star map places position of pole star halfway between tian shu 350 degrees and current polaris this was more accurate calculation by 3 degrees that shen kuo had made when he observed pole star over a period of three months with his width improved sighting tube there were many star maps written before song s book but greatest significance of these star maps by su song is that they represent oldest extant star maps in printed form sivin iii 32 pharmacology botany zoology and mineralogy thumb right 200px su categorized and accurately described attributes of many minerals including red pitted surface of realgar seen above in 1070 su song and a team of scholars compiled and edited bencao illustrated pharmacopoeia original source material from 1058 1061 which was a groundbreaking treatise on pharmaceutical botany zoology and mineralogy wu 5 in compiling information for pharmaceutical knowledge su song worked with such notable scholars as zhang lin yi zhang dong and many others unschuld 60 this treatise documented a wide range of pharmaceutical practices including use of ephedrine as a drug needham volume 4 part 2 446 it includes valuable information on metallurgy and steel and iron industries during 11th century china he created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions such as all variously known forms of mica that could be used to cure ills through digestion needham volume 3 648 he wrote of fracture of native cinnabar signs of ore beds and provided description on crystal form needham volume 3 649 similar to ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by later german scientist georgius agricola su song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate as did earlier bencao of 970 with copper sulphate su s book was also first pharmaceutical treatise written in china to describe flax urtica and tomentosa crenata plants needham volume 6 part 1 174 175 according to edward h schafer su accurately described translucent quality of fine realgar its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red almost purple color and that mineral varied in sizes ranging from size of a pea to a walnut schafer 81 citing evidence from an ancient work by zheng xuan 127 200 su believed that physicians of ancient zhou dynasty 1046 256 bc used realgar as a remedy for ulcers schafer 83 as believed in su s day five poisons used by zhou era physicians for this purpose were thought to be cinnabar realgar alum and magnetite su made systematic descriptions of animals and environmental regions they could be found such as different species of freshwater marine and shore crabs west 606 for example he noted that freshwater crab species sinensis could be found in huai river running through anhui in waterways near capital city as well as reservoirs and marshes of hebei su s book was preserved and copied into bencao gangmu of ming dynasty 1368 1644 physician and pharmacologist li shizhen 1518 1593 west 605 horology and mechanical engineering thumb left armillary sphere on roof su song compiled one of greatest chinese horological treatises of middle ages surrounding himself with an entourage of notable engineers and astronomers to assist in various projects xinyi xiangfayao lit essentials of a new method for rotation of an armillary sphere and a celestial globe written in 1092 was final product of his life s achievements in horology and clockwork book included 47 different illustrations of great detail of mechanical workings for his astronomical clock tower ceccarelli 58 su song s greatest project was 40 foot tall water powered astronomical clock tower constructed in kaifeng wooden pilot model completed in 1088 bronze components cast by 1090 while wholly finished work was completed by 1094 during reign of emperor zhezong of song fry 9 needham volume 4 part 2 495 emperor had previously commissioned han acting secretary of ministry of personnel to head project but leadership position was instead handed down to su song emperor ordered in 1086 for su to reconstruct hun yi or armillary clock for a new clock tower in capital city su worked with aid of han gong lian who applied his extensive knowledge of mathematics to construction of clock tower needham volume 4 part 2 39 a small scale wooden model was first crafted by su song testing its intricate parts before applying it to an actual full scale clock tower needham volume 4 part 2 465 in end clock tower had many impressive features such as hydro mechanical rotating armillary sphere crowning top level and weighing some 10 to 20 tons a bronze celestial globe located in middle that was 4 5 feet in diameter mechanically timed and rotating mannequins dressed in miniature chinese clothes that exited miniature opening doors to announce time of day by presenting designated reading plaques ringing bells and gongs or beating drums needham volume 4 part 2 455 a sophisticated use of oblique gears and an escapement mechanism needham volume 4 part 2 456 as well as an exterior facade of a fanciful chinese pagoda upon its completion tower was called shui yun yi xiang tai or tower for water powered sphere and globe joseph needham writes thumb right 200px star map of south polar projection for su s celestial globe xinyi xiangfayao 1092 years after su s death capital city of kaifeng was besieged and captured in 1127 by jurchens of manchuria based jin dynasty during jin song wars wright 96 clock tower was dismantled piece by piece by jurchens who carted its components back to their own capital in modern day beijing however due to complexity of tower they were unable to piece it back together new emperor gaozong of song instructed su s son su xie to construct a new astronomical clock tower in its place and su xie set to work studying his father s texts with a team of other experts however they were also unsuccessful in creating another clock tower and su xie was convinced that su song had purposefully left out essential components in his written work and diagrams so that others would not steal his ideas as sinologist historian derk bodde points out su song s astronomical clock did not lead to a new generation of mass produced clockworks throughout china since his work was largely a government sponsored endeavor for use of astronomers and astrologers in imperial court bodde 362 yet mechanical legacy of su song did not end with his work in about 1150 writer xue noted that there were four types of clocks in his day basic waterclock incense clock sundial and clock with revolving and snapping springs gun tan needham volume 4 part 2 462 rulers of continuing yuan dynasty 1279 1368 ad had a vested interest in advancement of mechanical clockworks fry 12 astronomer guo shoujing helped restore beijing ancient observatory beginning in 1276 where he crafted a water powered armillary sphere and clock with clock jacks being fully implemented and sounding hours needham volume 4 part 2 504 505 complex gearing for uniquely chinese clockworks were continued in ming dynasty 1368 1644 with new designs driven by power of falling sand instead of water to provide motive power to wheel drive and some ming clocks perhaps featured reduction gearing rather than earlier escapement of su song needham volume 4 part 2 509 512 earliest such design of a sand clock was made by zhan xiyuan around 1370 which featured not only scoop wheel of su song device but also a new addition of a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated much like new european clocks of same period needham volume 4 part 2 511 su song s escapement mechanism thumb 200px oldest known illustration of an endless power transmitting chain drive from su s book of 1092 it was called celestial ladder and was used for coupling main driving shaft of his clock tower to armillary sphere gear box which was mounted at top of tower in su song s waterwheel device action of escapement s arrest and release was achieved by gravity exerted periodically as continuous flow of liquid filled containers of a limited size in a single line of evolution su song s clock therefore united concept of clepsydra and mechanical clock into one device run by mechanics and hydraulics in his memorial su song wrote about this concept in his writing su song credited as predecessor of his working clock hydraulic powered armillary sphere of zhang heng 78 139 ad an earlier chinese scientist needham volume 4 part 2 466 su song was also strongly influenced by earlier armillary sphere created by zhang sixun 976 ad who also employed escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead of water in waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time needham volume 4 part 2 469 471 however su song stated in his writing that after zhang s death no one was able to replicate his device much like his own needham volume 4 part 2 470 mechanical clockworks for su song s astronomical tower featured a great driving wheel that was 11 feet in diameter carrying 36 scoops into each of which water poured at a uniform rate from constant level tank needham fig 653 main driving shaft of iron with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent shaped bearings ended in a pinion which engaged

featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine which did not transmit continuous power influential source for su song s chain drive is most likely continuously driven chain pump known in china since han dynasty 202 bc 220 ad from his horological treatise su song states in addition motion gear rings and upper drive wheel both had 600 teeth which by su s mathematical precision carefully calculated measured units of day in a division of 1 600 fry 11 these gears having 600 teeth thus ensured division of day into measurements of 2 minutes and 24 seconds each su song s armillary sphere thumb right

to that of 13th century monarch alfonso x of castile in islamic era spain chief difference was that alfonso s instrument featured an arrangement for making measurements of azimuth and altitude which

work was published and widely printed in north see woodblock printing and movable type of bi sheng in south printing and circulation of his work was not widely distributed until shi of jiangsu had it printed there in 1172 when presenting his clocktower design to emperor zhezong su song equated constant flow of water with continuous movements of heavens latter of which symbolized unceasing power of emperor liu 578 585 this appealed to emperor who featured artwork representing clocktower on vehicles of major imperial processions as illustrated in illustration of imperial grand carriage procession of 1053 liu 578 later ming dynasty qing dynasty scholar qian zeng 1629 1699 held an old volume of su s work which he faithfully reproduced in a newly printed edition he took special care in avoiding any or inconsistencies with original text as well again it was later reprinted by zhang xizu 1799 1844 su song s treatise on astronomical clockwork was not only one made in china during his day as song shi compiled in 1345 records written treatise of wade giles shui yun hun thien chi yao lit essentials of technique of making astronomical apparatus revolve by water power written by juan taifa however this treatise no longer survives needham volume 4 part 2 450 in realm of modern research late british biochemist and historian of chinese science joseph needham 1900 1995 known as li in china did extensive research and analysis of su song s texts and various achievements in his science and civilization in china book series joseph needham also related many detailed passages from su s contemporary medieval chinese sources on life of su and his achievements known in his day in 1956 john christiansen reconstructed a model of su song s clocktower in a famous drawing which garnered attention in west towards 11th century chinese engineering liu 577 579 a miniature model of su song s clock was reconstructed by john cambridge and is now on display at national science museum at
