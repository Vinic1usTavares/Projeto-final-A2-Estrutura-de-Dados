eardwulf fl 790 c 830 was king of northumbria from 796 to 806 when he was deposed and went into exile he may have had a second reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830 northumbria in last years of eighth century was scene of dynastic strife between several noble families in 790 then king aethelred i attempted to have eardwulf assassinated eardwulf s survival may have been viewed as a sign of divine favour a group of nobles conspired to assassinate aethelred in april 796 and he was succeeded by osbald osbald s reign lasted only twenty seven days before he was deposed and eardwulf became king on 14 may 796 little is recorded of eardwulf s family though his father also named eardwulf is known to have been a nobleman eardwulf was married by time he became king though his wife s name is not recorded it is possible he later wed an illegitimate daughter of charlemagne in 798 early in his reign eardwulf fought a battle at billington moor against a nobleman named wada who had been one of those who killed king aethelred wada was defeated and driven into exile in 801 eardwulf led an army against coenwulf of mercia perhaps because of coenwulf s support for other claimants to northumbrian throne eardwulf was deposed in 806 and according to a frankish record returned to his kingdom in 808 no record has survived of his death or end of his reign dates from 811 to 830 have been suggested he was possibly buried at mercian royal monastery of breedon on hill which carries a dedication to saint mary and saint hardulph with whom eardwulf is identified by several historians background thumb kingdoms of britain in around 800 during latter half of eighth century northumbrian succession included a long series of murdered and deposed kings as several royal lines contended for throne main lines were those of eadberht aethelwald moll and alhred in eight years before eardwulf s accession all three of these dynastic lines were involved in struggle for kingship on 23 september 788 king aelfwald i grandson of eadberht was murdered by patricius near hexham and aelfwald s cousin osred became king osred who was of alhred s line was deposed after a year and aethelred son of aethelwald moll who had been deposed in 778 at a young age was restored to kingship resuming title aethelred i yorke kings and kingdoms p 90 table 11 some anglo saxon kings are known to have been killed by their households or in open warfare against rivals but overall record is very sparse evidence as regards deposition of kings is equally limited only two eighth century depositions offer any context those of aethelwald moll in northumbria and sigeberht of wessex in both cases decision is presented as that of some form of council wormald patrick age of offa and alcuin in campbell anglo saxons pp 114 115 this record of disputed succession was by no means unique to northumbria and kingdoms of mercia and wessex experienced similar troubles during eighth and ninth centuries in wessex from death of in 685 to egbert s seizure of power in 802 relationships between successive kings are far from clear and few kings are known to have been close kinsmen of their predecessors or successors same may be true of mercia from death of ceolred in 716 until disappearance of mercian kingdom in late ninth century kings did not rule alone but rather governed together with leading churchmen and nobles while northumbria lacks body of charters which shed light on institutions of southern anglo saxon kingdoms sufficient evidence survives for historians to reconstruct some aspects of northumbrian political life evidence for northumbria survives largely in latin documents and these use words dux and patricius to describe leading noblemen of kingdom word dux is usually translated by old english word ealdorman historian alan thacker estimates that there were about eight men holding title of dux in late northumbria yorke kings and kingdoms pp 92 93 title patricius is usually translated as patrician which ultimately means noble but in latter days of roman empire represented a high ranking position second only to emperor meaning of title in northumbria is unclear but it appears that there was only one patricius while it may be simply an alternative to dux it might represent a position approximating to that of mayor of palace in late merovingian francia campbell anglo saxons pp 90 92 church in northumbria was one of major landowners perhaps second only to king higham kingdom of northumbria pp 147 149 at head of northumbrian church was archbishop of york an office held by eanbald i to 796 eanbald ii until some time after 808 and then by to around 830 after prosopography of anglo saxon england immediately below archbishop were three bishops bishop of lindisfarne bishop of hexham and bishop of whithorn typically long term of office of senior clerics meant that kings often had to work with men appointed by their predecessors with whom their relations might be difficult higham

christian west appears to have taken an active interest in northumbrian affairs charlemagne initially ruled francia and parts of italy but by 796 had become master of an empire which stretched from atlantic ocean to great hungarian plain he was a staunch defender of papacy and in popes and church hierarchy he had allies whose influence extended to northumbria and beyond events in southern britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between offa and charlemagne but disparity in their power was enormous and offa and then coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison

offa ruling everything to south wormald age of offa and alcuin p 101 frankish support for northumbria thus appears to have been driven by a desire to counter mercian influence in southern britain an

billington moor near whalley lancashire wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in mercia he may have hoped to restore osbald to throne evidence for osbald s continued ambition is a letter that alcuin wrote to him probably in 798 in which alcuin attempted to dissuade osbald from further interventions in northumbrian affairs alcuin s arguments appear to have succeeded since osbald is

it certainly does not sound as if coenwulf had walkover which some modern estimates of northumbrian and mercian power might have led one to expect this settlement ended open warfare but eardwulf was deposed in 806 in unknown circumstances letters between charlemagne and pope leo iii suggest that coenwulf had a hand in eardwulf s removal according to thirteenth century chronicler roger of wendover eardwulf was replaced by king aelfwald ii about whom nothing else is known from written sources although coins issued in his reign have survived kirby earliest english kings p 157 as case of aelfwald shows while written sources for later northumbria are few and often written down centuries after events they describe archaeological evidence from coinage is independent of surviving annals anglo saxon coins usually named king on whose orders they were issued and sometimes named mint where they were struck northumbrian coinage names york as place of issue and moneyer who produced them their weight and silver content can be compared with other reigns providing a hint of prevailing economic conditions and style and size may also throw light on cultural influences when coins are compared

kingdom of northumbria pp 166 172 from 740s until end of northumbrian kingdom coins were issued by most kings although in variable quantities until recently no coins from eardwulf s reign were known
