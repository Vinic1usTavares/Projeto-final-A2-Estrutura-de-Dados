man capcom primarily made arcade games and their console releases were mostly ports of these titles in mid 1980s capcom made plans to develop mega man specifically for japanese home console market they decided to bring in fresh young talent for small team including artist keiji inafune a recent college graduate who started on street fighter team inafune recalled that mega man development team worked extremely hard to complete final product with a project supervisor and lead designer who sought perfection in every possible aspect of game development team for mega man consisted of only six people inafune credited as designed and illustrated nearly all of game s characters and enemies as well as japanese rockman logo box art and instruction manual he was also responsible for rendering these designs into graphical sprite form we didn t have a lot of people so after drawing character designs i was actually doing dotting pixelation for nintendo inafune stated back then people weren t specialized and we had to do a lot of different things because there was so few people so i really ended up doing all characters inafune was influenced by eponymous protagonist of osamu tezuka s manga astro boy in his mega man designs mega man is colored blue due to nes console s technical limitations color has most shades in console s limited 56 color palette and expanded selection was used to enhance mega man s detail although he is often credited for designing character inafune insists that he only did half of job in creating him as his mentor developed basic character concept before inafune s arrival basic sprites for roll and dr light were created before inafune joined project and designs for cut man ice man fire man and guts man were in process aside from normal enemies inafune s first character was elec man inspired by american comic book characters artist has commented that elec man has always been his favorite design designs for dr light and dr wily were based on santa claus and albert einstein respectively latter character was meant to represent an archetypal mad scientist team had initially considered names such as mighty kid knuckle kid and rainbow man before settling on their final decisions name rainbow name was considered because character could change into seven colors based on weapon selected production team chose a music motif when naming main characters in mega man protagonist s original name is rock and his sister s name is roll a play on term rock and roll this type of naming would later extended to many characters throughout series one of original storylines considered by team but not used in final game was for game was to have roll be kidnapped and rock had to rescue her another idea had included a boss fight against a giant roll near end of game team decided to incorporate anime elements for game s animation inafune explained mega man s hand transforms into a gun and you can actually see it come out of his arm we wanted to make sure that animation and motion was realistic and actually made sense so with mega man we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas gameplay for mega man was inspired by game rock paper scissors project supervisor wanted a simple system that offered deep gameplay each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific robot master others have little to no effect against them and there is no single weapon that dominates all others mega man was originally able to crouch but team decided against it since it made players ability to determine height of onscreen projectiles more difficult naoya tomita credited as tom pon began work on mega man s scenic backgrounds immediately after his capcom training tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming challenges of console s limited power through maximizing use of background elements mega man was scored by manami matsumae credited as manami who composed music created sound effects and programmed data in three months using a sound driver programmed by yoshihiro sakaguchi credited as s papa musical notes were translated one by one into computer language matsumae was challenged by creative limits of three notes available at any one time and when she was unable to write songs she created sound effects when game was localized for distribution in america capcom changed title of game from rockman to mega man this moniker was created by capcom s then senior vice president joseph marici who claimed it was changed merely because he did not like original name that title was horrible marici said so i came up with mega man and they liked it enough to keep using it for u s games 1up com s nadia oxford attributed this change to capcom s belief that american children would be more interested
