vanajan autotehdas oy vat was a producer of heavy vehicles based in hameenlinna finland company was founded as yhteissisu oy in 1943 by finnish government and a number of major finnish companies with aim of producing lorries and buses for finnish defence forces world war ii was over before company could start series production it was renamed vanajan autotehdas and marque became vanaja subsequently production consisted of outdated lorry models partly built from military surplus materials after overcoming initial difficulties company modernised its products became profitable and grew until mid 1950s many major components including engines were imported diesel engines became widely available in 1955 and in 1959 vat introduced its most significant innovation full load lifting tandem axle mechanism which improved off road capability significantly system is now used in sisu vehicles company started producing bus chassis in 1950 and superstructures were built by a number of finnish coach builders last models were appreciated by a number of bus operators and missed after production was stopped all vanaja bus chassis were fitted with air brakes by 1958 after failure of hydraulic brakes on a vanaja bus had led to one of worst traffic accidents ever to have happened in finland vat fell into financial difficulties by end of 1960s this led to a merger with other finnish heavy vehicle

crane chassis factory now belongs to produces patria amv armoured personnel heavy vehicle axle producer sisu axles vanajan autotehdas was always a small company employing about 400 people in 1968 and in 1960s its market share was barely 5 in finland almost all vanajas were sold for domestic market only a few units were exported vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of customisation number of vanaja bus chassis and lorries totalled 7 140 units this consists of 260 lorry and 66 bus chassis models for 116 lorry models only one or two units were produced vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts foundation during winter of 1942 43 finnish defence forces estimated there was no immediate prospect of a quick end to continuation war but there was an immediate need for new vehicles in longer term army was expected to need at least 7 000 lorries and buses neutral countries such as sweden and switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies as finland did not have sufficient currency reserves only option was to develop domestic vehicle production blomberg autojen p 14 at that time only finnish heavy vehicle producer oy suomen autoteollisuus ab sat was building a new factory in karis a location considered less likely than helsinki to come under attack from soviet air raids company general director tor nessling suggested factory should be larger than originally planned as another option nessling with extreme reservation considered building a new factory elsewhere in finland sat was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited heavy vehicle importers and some

blomberg ja pp 55 61 economy improved in 1959 blomberg ja pp 62 65 criticism in 1950 finnish government was criticised for ignoring other options and buying only vanajas which were said to be overpriced state had ordered 650 vehicles spread over several years and this tied state s hands in equipment buying for a long period both vat and sat were criticised in 1954 by heavy vehicle importers because two companies had access to a large share of limited foreign currency reserves for component supply importers representatives said neither sisu nor vanaja were very domestic products and vehicles importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in finland according to association of vehicle importers domestic vehicles cost between 30 and 80 more compared to imported ones following year government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign currency expenditure vat and sat expressed doubts about viability of such production in 1957 government ended restrictions on import of heavy vehicle chassis eventually prices of imported vehicles approached those of sisu and vanaja vehicles

stroke diesel engines but only one such vehicle was built import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales in some cases customers provided their own example volvo or mercedes benz which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on assembly line in 1955 vat bought two batches of 6 cylinder 90 hp leyland 0 350 diesel engines these proved to be too

capabilities in even deep snow one of vanajas was destroyed in an accident domestic vehicles performed well in test in some cases rear wheel driven sisus and vanajas outperformed 4x4 driven foreign

conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings but forward control types left factory without any body parts after being painted vehicles left assembly hall finally every vehicle was tested on a long test run on different roads and with various loads bus chassis were tested in a similar way because there was no body drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against weather conditions vehicles were handed over to customers after final adjustments construction work on a new subassembly shop began in 1955 and building was ready in 1957 new facilities were
