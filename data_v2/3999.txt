edward ii 25 april 1284 21 september 1327 also called edward of carnarvon was king of england from 1307 until he was deposed in january 1327 fourth son of edward i edward became heir apparent to throne following death of his elder brother alphonso beginning in 1300 edward accompanied his father on campaigns to pacify scotland and in 1306 was knighted in a grand ceremony at westminster abbey following his father s death edward succeeded to throne in 1307 he married isabella daughter of powerful king philip iv of france in 1308 as part of a long running effort to resolve tensions between english and french crowns edward had a close and controversial relationship with piers gaveston who had joined his household in 1300 precise nature of his and gaveston s relationship is uncertain they may have been friends lovers or sworn brothers edward s relationship with gaveston inspired christopher marlowe s 1592 play edward ii along with other plays films novels and media many of these have focused on possible sexual relationship between two men gaveston s power as edward s favourite provoked discontent among both barons and french royal family and edward was forced to exile him on gaveston s return barons pressured king into agreeing to wide ranging reforms called ordinances of 1311 newly empowered barons banished gaveston to which edward responded by revoking reforms and recalling his favourite led by edward s cousin earl of lancaster a group of barons seized and executed gaveston in 1312 beginning several years of armed confrontation english forces were pushed back in scotland where edward was decisively defeated by robert bruce at battle of bannockburn in 1314 widespread famine followed and criticism of king s reign mounted despenser family in particular hugh despenser younger became close friends and advisers to edward but lancaster and many of barons seized despensers lands in 1321 and forced king to exile them in response edward led a short military campaign capturing and executing lancaster edward and despensers strengthened their grip on power formally revoking 1311 reforms executing their enemies and confiscating estates unable to make progress in scotland edward finally signed a truce with robert opposition to regime grew and when isabella was sent to france to negotiate a peace treaty in 1325 she turned against edward and refused to return instead she allied herself with exiled roger mortimer and invaded england with a small army in 1326 edward s regime collapsed and he fled to wales where he was captured in november king was forced to relinquish his crown in january 1327 in favour of his 14 year old son edward iii and he died in berkeley castle on 21 september probably murdered on orders of new regime edward s contemporaries criticised his performance as king noting his failures in scotland and oppressive regime of his later years although 19th century academics later argued that growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for england over longer term debate over his perceived failures has continued into 21st century background edward ii was fourth son of edward i and his first wife eleanor of castile his father was king of england and had also inherited gascony in south western france which he held as feudal vassal of king of france and lordship of ireland his mother was from castilian royal family and held county of ponthieu in northern france edward i proved a successful military leader leading suppression of baronial revolts in 1260s and joining ninth crusade during 1280s he conquered north wales removing native welsh princes from power and in 1290s he intervened in scotland s civil war claiming suzerainty over country he was considered an extremely successful ruler by his contemporaries largely able to control powerful earls that formed senior ranks of english nobility historian michael prestwich describes edward i as a king to inspire fear and respect while john gillingham characterises him as an efficient bully despite edward i s successes when he died in 1307 he left a range of challenges for his son to resolve one of most critical was problem of english rule in scotland where edward s long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died edward s control of gascony created tension with french kings they insisted that english kings give homage to them for lands english kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour and issue remained unresolved edward i also faced increasing opposition from his barons over taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars and left his son debts of around ps200 000 on his death early life 1284 1307 birth thumb alt photograph of caernarfon castle caernarfon castle edward s birthplace edward ii was born in caernarfon castle in north wales on 25 april 1284 less than a year after edward i had conquered region and as a result is sometimes called edward of caernarfon king probably chose castle deliberately as location for edward s birth as it was an important symbolic location for native welsh associated with roman imperial history and it formed centre of new royal administration of north wales edward s birth brought predictions of greatness from contemporary prophets who believed that last days of world were imminent declaring him a new king arthur who would lead england to glory david a 16th century clergyman suggested that baby was offered to welsh as a prince that was borne in wales and could speake never a word of english but there is no evidence to support this account edward s name was english in origin linking him to anglo saxon saint edward confessor and was chosen by his father instead of more traditional norman and castilian names selected for edward s brothers edward had three elder brothers john and henry who had died before edward was born and alphonso who died in august 1284 leaving edward as heir to throne although edward was a relatively healthy child there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir after his birth edward was looked after by a wet nurse called or mary for a few months until she fell ill when alice de became his foster mother he would have barely known his natural mother eleanor who was in gascony with his father during his earliest years an official household complete with staff was created for new baby under direction of a clerk giles of oudenarde childhood personality and appearance thumb upright alt painting of edward portrait in westminster abbey thought to be of edward s father edward i spending increased on edward s personal household as he grew older and in 1293 william of took over as its administrator edward was probably given a religious education by dominican friars whom his mother invited into his household in 1290 he was assigned one of his grandmother s followers guy ferre as his magister who was responsible for his discipline training him in riding and military skills it is uncertain how well educated edward was there is little evidence for his ability to read and write although his mother was keen that her other children were well educated and ferre was himself a relatively learned man for period edward likely mainly spoke anglo norman french in his daily life in addition to some english and possibly latin edward had a normal upbringing for a member of a royal family prince was interested in horses and and became a good rider he also liked dogs in particular greyhounds in his letters he shows a quirky sense of humour joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends such as horses who disliked carrying their riders or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits he was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry both popular activities in 14th century he enjoyed music including welsh music and newly invented instrument as well as musical organs he did not take part in jousting either because he lacked aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety but he was certainly supportive of sport edward grew up to be tall and muscular and was considered good looking by standards of period he had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to household staff unusually he enjoyed rowing as well as hedging and ditching and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower class workers this behaviour was not considered normal for nobility of period and attracted criticism from contemporaries in 1290 edward s father had confirmed treaty of in which he promised to marry his six year old son to young margaret of norway who had a potential claim to crown of scotland margaret died later that year bringing an end to plan edward s mother eleanor died shortly afterwards followed by his grandmother eleanor of provence edward i was distraught at his wife s death and held a huge funeral for her his son inherited county of ponthieu from eleanor next a french marriage was considered for young edward to help secure a lasting peace with france but war broke out in 1294 idea was replaced with proposal of a marriage to a daughter of count of flanders but this too failed after it was blocked by king philip iv of france early campaigns in scotland thumb upright alt medieval painting early 14th century depiction of edward i left declaring his son edward right prince of wales between 1297 and 1298 edward was left as regent in charge of england while king campaigned in flanders against philip iv who had occupied part of english king s lands in gascony on his return edward i signed a peace treaty under which he took philip s sister margaret as his wife and agreed that prince edward would in due course marry philip s daughter isabella who was then only two years old in theory this marriage would mean that disputed duchy of gascony would be inherited by a descendant of both edward and philip providing a possible end to long running tensions young edward seems to have got on well with his new stepmother who gave birth to edward s two half brothers thomas of brotherton and edmund of woodstock in 1300 and 1301 as king edward later provided his brothers with financial support and titles edward i returned to scotland once again in 1300 and this time took his son with him making him commander of rearguard at siege of caerlaverock in spring of 1301 king declared edward prince of wales granting him earldom of chester and lands across north wales he seems to have hoped that this would help pacify region and that it would give his son some financial independence edward received homage from his welsh subjects and then joined his father for 1301 scottish campaign he took an army of around 300 soldiers north with him and captured turnberry castle prince edward also took part in 1303 campaign during which he besieged brechin castle deploying his own siege engine in operation in spring of 1304 edward conducted negotiations with rebel scottish leaders on king s behalf and when these failed he joined his father for siege of stirling castle in 1305 edward and his father quarrelled probably over issue of money prince had an altercation with bishop walter langton who served as royal treasurer apparently over amount of financial support edward received from crown edward i defended his treasurer and banished his son and his companions from his court cutting off their financial support after some negotiations involving family members and friends two men were reconciled scottish conflict flared up once again in 1306 when robert bruce killed his rival john comyn and declared himself king of scots edward i mobilised a fresh army but decided that this time his son would be formally in charge of expedition prince edward was made duke of aquitaine and then along with many other young men he was knighted in a lavish ceremony at westminster abbey called feast of swans amid a huge feast in neighbouring hall reminiscent of arthurian legends and crusading events assembly took a collective oath to defeat bruce it is unclear what role prince edward s forces played in campaign that summer which under orders of edward i saw a punitive brutal retaliation against bruce s faction in scotland edward returned

had himself joined prince edward s household in 1300 possibly on edward i s instruction two got on well gaveston became a squire and was soon being referred to as a close companion of edward before being knighted by king during feast of swans in 1306 king then exiled gaveston to gascony in 1307 for reasons that remain unclear according to one chronicler edward had asked his father to allow him to give gaveston county of ponthieu and king responded furiously pulling his son s hair out in great handfuls before exiling gaveston official court records however show gaveston being only temporarily exiled supported by a comfortable stipend no reason is given for order suggesting that it may have been an act aimed at punishing prince in some way possibility that edward had a sexual relationship with gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians complicated by paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain details of their relationships homosexuality was fiercely condemned by church in 14th century england which equated it with heresy but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual s personal identity in same way that it might in 21st century edward and gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives who bore them children edward also had an illegitimate son and may also have had an affair with his niece eleanor de clare contemporary evidence supporting their homosexual relationship comes primarily from an anonymous chronicler in 1320s who described how edward felt such love for gaveston that he entered into a covenant of constancy and bound himself with him before all other mortals with a bond of indissoluble love firmly drawn up and fastened with a knot first specific suggestion that edward engaged in sex with men was recorded in 1334 when adam orleton bishop of winchester was accused of having stated in 1326 that edward was a sodomite although orleton defended himself by arguing that he had meant that edward s advisor hugh despenser younger was a sodomite rather than late king meaux chronicle from 1390s simply notes that edward gave himself too much to vice of sodomy alternatively edward and gaveston may have simply been friends with a close working relationship contemporary chronicler comments are vaguely worded orleton s allegations were at least in part politically motivated and are very similar to highly politicised sodomy allegations made against pope boniface viii and knights templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively later accounts by chroniclers of edward s activities may trace back to orleton s original allegations and were certainly adversely coloured by events at end of edward s reign such historians as michael prestwich and seymour phillips have argued that public nature of english royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet neither contemporary church edward s father nor his father in law appear to have made any adverse comments about edward s sexual behaviour a more recent theory proposed by historian pierre chaplais suggests that edward and gaveston entered into a bond of adoptive brotherhood compacts of adoptive brotherhood in which participants pledged to support each other in a form of brotherhood in arms were not unknown between close male friends in middle ages many chroniclers described edward and gaveston s relationship as one of brotherhood and one explicitly noted that edward had taken gaveston as his adopted brother chaplais argues that pair may have made a formal compact in either 1300 or 1301 and that they would have seen any later promises they made to separate or to leave each other as having been made under duress and therefore invalid early reign 1307 1311 coronation and marriage thumb alt picture of edward ii being crowned edward ii shown receiving english crown in a contemporary illustration edward i mobilised another army for scottish campaign in 1307 which prince edward was due to join that summer but elderly king had been increasingly unwell and died on 7 july at burgh by sands edward travelled from london immediately after news reached him and on 20 july he was proclaimed king he continued north into scotland and on 4 august received homage from his scottish supporters at dumfries before abandoning campaign and returning south edward promptly recalled piers gaveston who was then in exile and made him earl of cornwall before arranging his marriage to wealthy margaret de clare edward also arrested his old adversary bishop langton and dismissed him from his post as treasurer edward i s body was kept at waltham abbey for several months before being taken for burial to westminster where edward erected a simple marble tomb for his father in 1308 edward s marriage to isabella of france proceeded edward crossed english channel to france in january leaving gaveston as his custos regni in charge of kingdom in his absence this arrangement was unusual and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to gaveston backed by a specially engraved great seal edward probably hoped that marriage would strengthen his position in gascony and bring him much needed funds final negotiations however proved challenging edward and philip iv did not like each other and french king drove a hard bargain over size of isabella s dower and details of administration of edward s lands in france as part of agreement edward gave homage to philip for duchy of aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete implementation of 1303 treaty of paris pair were married in boulogne on 25 january edward gave isabella a psalter as a wedding gift and her father gave her gifts worth over 21 000 livres and a fragment of true cross pair returned to england in february where edward had ordered westminster palace to be lavishly restored in readiness for their coronation and wedding feast complete with marble tables forty ovens and a fountain that produced wine and pimento a spiced medieval drink after some delays ceremony went ahead on 25 february at westminster abbey under guidance of henry woodlock bishop of winchester as part of coronation edward swore to uphold rightful laws and customs which community of realm shall have chosen it is uncertain what this meant it might have been intended to force edward to accept future legislation it may have been inserted to prevent him from overturning any future vows he might take or it may have been an attempt by king to ingratiate himself with barons event was marred by large crowds of eager spectators who surged into palace knocking down a wall and forcing edward to flee by back door isabella was only 12 years old at time of her wedding young by standards of period and edward probably had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together during this time edward fathered an illegitimate son adam who was born possibly as early as 1307 edward and isabella s first son future edward iii was born in 1312 amid great celebrations and three more children followed john in 1316 eleanor in 1318 and joan in 1321 tensions over gaveston thumb alt painting of philip v and family isabella of france third from left with her father philip iv of france centre gaveston s return from exile in 1307 was initially accepted by barons but opposition quickly grew he appeared to have an excessive influence on royal policy leading to complaints from one chronicler that there were two kings reigning in one kingdom one in name and other in deed accusations probably untrue were levelled at gaveston that he had stolen royal funds and had purloined isabella s wedding presents gaveston had played a key role at edward s coronation provoking fury from both english and french contingents about earl s ceremonial precedence and magnificent clothes and about edward s apparent preference for gaveston s company over that of isabella at feast parliament met in february 1308 in a heated atmosphere edward was eager to discuss potential for governmental reform but barons were unwilling to begin any such debate until problem of gaveston had been resolved violence seemed likely but situation was resolved through mediation of moderate henry de lacy earl of lincoln who convinced barons to back down a fresh parliament was held in april where barons once again criticised gaveston demanding his exile this time supported by isabella and french monarchy edward resisted but finally acquiesced agreeing to send gaveston to aquitaine under threat of excommunication by archbishop of canterbury should he return at last moment edward changed his mind and instead sent gaveston to dublin appointing him as lieutenant of ireland edward called for a fresh military campaign for scotland but this idea was quietly abandoned and instead king and barons met in august 1308 to discuss reform behind scenes edward started negotiations to convince both pope clement v and philip iv to allow gaveston to return to england offering in exchange to suppress knights templar in england and to release bishop langton from prison edward called a new meeting of members of church and key barons in january 1309 and leading earls then gathered in march and april possibly under leadership of thomas earl of lancaster another parliament followed which refused to allow gaveston to return to england but offered to grant edward additional taxes if he agreed to a programme of reform edward sent assurances to pope that conflict surrounding gaveston s role was at an end on basis of these promises and procedural concerns about how original decision had been taken pope agreed to annul archbishop s threat to excommunicate gaveston thus opening possibility of gaveston s return gaveston arrived back in england in june where he was met by edward at parliament next month edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to gaveston including agreeing to limit powers of royal steward and marshal of royal household to regulate crown s unpopular powers of and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation in return parliament agreed to fresh taxes for war in scotland temporarily at least edward and barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise ordinances of 1311 following his return gaveston s relationship with major barons became increasingly difficult he was considered arrogant and he took to referring to earls by offensive names including calling one of their more powerful members dog of warwick earl of lancaster and gaveston s enemies refused to attend parliament in 1310 because gaveston would be present edward was facing increasing financial problems owing ps22 000 to his frescobaldi italian bankers and facing protests about how he was using his right of prises to acquire supplies for war in scotland his attempts to raise an army for scotland collapsed and earls suspended collection of new taxes king and parliament met again in february 1310 and proposed discussions of scottish policy were replaced by debate of domestic problems edward was petitioned to abandon gaveston as his counsellor and instead adopt advice of 21 elected barons termed ordainers who would carry out a widespread reform of both government and royal household under huge pressure edward agreed to proposal and ordainers were elected broadly evenly split between reformers and conservatives while ordainers began their plans for reform edward and gaveston took a new army of around 4 700 men to scotland where military situation had continued to deteriorate robert bruce declined to give battle and campaign progressed ineffectually over winter until supplies and money ran out in 1311 forcing edward to return south by now ordainers had drawn up their ordinances for reform and edward had little political choice but to give way and accept them in october ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting king s right to go to war or to grant land without parliament s approval giving parliament control over royal administration abolishing system of prises excluding frescobaldi bankers and introducing a system to monitor adherence to ordinances in addition ordinances exiled gaveston once again this time with instructions that he should not be allowed to live anywhere within edward s lands including gascony and ireland and that he should be stripped of his titles edward retreated to his estates at windsor and kings langley gaveston left england possibly for northern france or flanders mid reign 1311 1321 death of gaveston tensions between edward and barons remained high and earls opposed to king kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311 by now edward had become estranged from his cousin earl of lancaster who held earldoms of lancaster leicester lincoln salisbury and derby with an income of around ps11 000 a year from his lands almost double that of next wealthiest baron backed by earls of arundel gloucester hereford pembroke and warwick lancaster led a powerful faction in england but he was not personally interested in practical administration nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician edward responded to baronial threat by revoking ordinances and recalling gaveston to england being reunited with him at york in january 1312 barons were furious and met in london where gaveston was excommunicated by archbishop of canterbury and plans were put in place to capture gaveston and prevent him from fleeing to scotland edward isabella and gaveston left for newcastle pursued by lancaster and his followers abandoning many of their belongings royal party fled by ship and landed at scarborough where gaveston stayed while edward and isabella returned to york after a short siege gaveston surrendered to earls of pembroke and surrey on promise that he would not be harmed he had with him a huge collection of gold silver and gems probably part of royal treasury which he was later accused of having stolen from edward on way back from north pembroke stopped in village of in midlands putting gaveston under guard there while he went to visit his wife earl of warwick took this opportunity to seize gaveston taking him to warwick castle where lancaster and rest of his faction assembled on 18 june at a brief trial gaveston was declared guilty of being a traitor under terms of ordinances he was executed on hill following day under authority of earl of lancaster gaveston s body was not buried until 1315 when his funeral was held in king s langley priory tensions with lancaster and france thumb alt painting of edward at a knighting ceremony edward left and philip iv at knighting ceremony of notre dame 1312 reactions to death of gaveston varied considerably edward was furious and deeply upset over what he saw as murder of gaveston he made provisions for gaveston s family and intended to take revenge on barons involved earls of pembroke and surrey were embarrassed and angry about warwick s actions and shifted their support to edward in aftermath to lancaster and his core of supporters execution had been both legal and necessary to preserve stability of kingdom civil war again appeared likely but in december earl of pembroke negotiated a potential peace treaty between two sides which would pardon opposition barons for killing of gaveston in exchange for their support for a fresh campaign in scotland lancaster and warwick however did not give treaty their immediate approval and further negotiations continued through most of 1313 meanwhile earl of pembroke had been negotiating with france to resolve long standing disagreements over administration of gascony and as part of this edward and isabella agreed to travel to paris in june 1313 to meet with philip iv edward probably hoped both to resolve problems in south of france and to win philip s support in dispute with barons for philip it was an opportunity to impress his son in law with his power and wealth it proved a spectacular visit including a grand ceremony in which two kings knighted philip s sons and 200 other men in notre dame large banquets along river seine and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to levant philip gave lenient terms for settling problems in gascony and event was spoiled only by a serious fire in edward s quarters on his return from france edward found his political position greatly strengthened after intense negotiation earls including lancaster and warwick came to a compromise in october 1313 fundamentally very similar to draft agreement of previous december edward s finances improved thanks to parliament agreeing to raising of taxes a loan of 160 000 florins ps25 000 from pope ps33 000 that he borrowed from philip and further loans organised by edward s new italian banker antonio pessagno for first time in his reign edward s government was well funded battle of bannockburn thumb upright alt sketch of battle of depiction of battle of bannockburn in 1314 from holkham bible by 1314 robert bruce had recaptured most of castles in scotland once held by edward pushing raiding parties into northern england as far as carlisle in response edward planned a major military campaign with support of lancaster and barons mustering a large army between 15 000 and 20 000 strong meanwhile robert had besieged stirling castle a key fortification in scotland its english commander had stated that unless edward arrived by 24 june he would surrender news of this reached king in late may and he decided to speed up his march north from berwick to relieve castle robert with between 5 500 and 6 500 troops predominantly spearmen prepared to prevent edward s forces from reaching stirling battle began on 23 june as english army attempted to force its way across high ground of bannock burn which was surrounded by marshland skirmishing between two sides broke out resulting in death of sir henry de bohun whom robert killed in personal combat edward continued his advance following day and encountered bulk of scottish army as they emerged from woods of new park edward appears not to have expected scots to give battle here and as a result had kept his forces in marching rather than battle order with archers who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations at back of his army rather than front his cavalry found it hard to operate in cramped terrain and were crushed by robert s spearmen english army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control edward stayed behind to fight but it became obvious to earl of pembroke that battle was lost and he dragged king away from battlefield hotly pursued by scottish forces edward only just escaped heavy fighting making a vow to found a carmelite religious house at oxford if he survived historian roy haines describes defeat as a calamity of stunning proportions for english whose losses in battle were huge in aftermath of defeat edward retreated to dunbar then travelled by ship to berwick and then back to york in his absence stirling castle quickly fell famine and criticism after fiasco of bannockburn earls of lancaster and warwick saw their political influence increase and they pressured edward to re implement ordinances of 1311 lancaster became head of royal council in 1316 promising to take forward ordinances through a new reform commission but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards partially because of disagreements with other barons and possibly because of ill health lancaster refused to meet with edward in parliament for next two years bringing effective governance to a standstill this stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into scotland and raised fears of civil war after much negotiation once again involving earl of pembroke edward and lancaster finally agreed to treaty of leake in august 1318 which pardoned lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council temporarily averting conflict edward s difficulties were exacerbated by prolonged problems in english agriculture part of a wider phenomenon in northern europe known as great famine it began with torrential rains in late 1314 followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains following spring that killed many sheep and cattle bad weather continued almost unabated into 1321 resulting in a string of bad harvests revenues from exports of wool plummeted and price of food rose despite attempts by edward ii s government to control prices edward called for hoarders to release food and tried to encourage both internal trade and importation of grain but with little success requisitioning of provisions for royal court during famine years only added to tensions meanwhile robert bruce exploited his victory at bannockburn to raid northern england initially attacking carlisle and berwick and then reaching further south into lancashire and yorkshire even threatening york itself edward undertook an expensive but unsuccessful campaign to stem advance in 1319 but famine made it increasingly difficult to keep his garrisons supplied with food meanwhile a scottish expedition led by robert s brother successfully invaded ireland in 1315 where edward bruce declared himself king of ireland he was finally defeated in 1318 by edward ii s irish justiciar edmund butler at battle of and edward bruce s severed head was sent back to king revolts also broke out in lancashire and bristol in 1315 and in glamorgan in wales in 1316 but were suppressed famine and scottish policy were felt to be a punishment from god and complaints about edward multiplied one contemporary poem describing evil times of edward ii many criticised edward s improper and ignoble interest in rural pursuits in 1318 a mentally ill man named john of powderham appeared in oxford claiming that he was real edward ii and that edward was a changeling swapped at birth john was duly executed but his claims resonated with those criticising edward for his lack of regal behaviour and steady leadership opposition also grew around edward s treatment of his royal favourites he had managed to retain some of his previous advisers despite attempts by ordainers to remove them and divided extensive de clare inheritance among two of his new favourites former household knights hugh audley and roger damory instantly making them extremely rich many of moderates who had helped deliver peaceful compromise in 1318 now began to turn against edward making violence ever more likely later reign 1321 1326 despenser war long threatened civil war finally broke out in england in 1321 triggered by tension between many of barons and royal favourites despenser family hugh despenser elder had served both edward and his father while hugh despenser younger had married into wealthy de clare family became king s chamberlain and acquired glamorgan in welsh marches in 1317 hugh younger subsequently expanded his holdings and power across wales mainly at expense of other marcher lords earl of lancaster and despensers were fierce enemies and lancaster s antipathy was shared by most of despensers neighbours including earl of hereford mortimer family and recently elevated hugh audley and roger damory edward however increasingly relied on despensers for advice and support and he was particularly close to hugh younger whom one chronicler noted he loved dearly with all his heart and mind in early 1321 lancaster mobilised a coalition of despensers enemies across marcher territories edward and hugh younger became aware of these plans in march and headed west hoping that negotiations led by moderate earl of pembroke would defuse crisis this time pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene and war broke out in may despensers lands were quickly seized by a coalition of marcher lords and local gentry and lancaster held a high level gathering of barons and clergy in june which condemned despensers for having broken ordinances edward attempted reconciliation but in july opposition occupied london and called for permanent removal of despensers fearing that he might be deposed if he refused edward agreed to exile despensers and pardoned marcher lords for their actions edward began to plan his revenge with help of pembroke king formed a small coalition of his half brothers a few of earls and some of senior clergy and prepared for war edward started with bartholomew of badlesmere and isabella was sent to bartholomew s stronghold leeds castle to deliberately create a casus belli bartholomew s wife margaret took bait and her men killed several of isabella s retinue giving edward an excuse to intervene lancaster refused to help bartholomew who was his personal enemy and edward quickly regained control of south east england alarmed lancaster now mobilised his own army in north of england and edward mustered his own forces in south west despensers returned from exile and were pardoned by royal council in december edward led his army across river severn and advanced into welsh marches where opposition forces had gathered coalition of marcher lords crumbled and mortimers surrendered to king but damory audley and earl of hereford marched north in january to join lancaster who had laid siege king s castle at tickhill bolstered by fresh reinforcements from marcher lords edward pursued them meeting lancaster s army on 10 march at burton on trent lancaster outnumbered retreated without a fight fleeing north andrew harclay cornered lancaster at battle of boroughbridge and captured earl edward and hugh younger met lancaster at pontefract where after a summary trial earl was found guilty of treason and beheaded edward and despensers thumb alt painting of edward hunting edward third from left hunting with philip iv edward punished lancaster s supporters through a system of special courts across country with judges instructed in advance how to sentence accused who were not allowed to speak in their own defence many of these so called were simply executed and others were imprisoned or fined with their lands seized and their surviving relatives detained earl of pembroke whom edward now mistrusted was arrested and only released after pledging all of his possessions as collateral for his own loyalty edward was able to reward his loyal supporters especially despenser family with confiscated estates and new titles fines and confiscations made edward rich almost ps15 000 was brought in during first few months and by 1326 edward s treasury contained ps62 000 a parliament was held at york in march 1322 at which ordinances were formally revoked through statute of york and fresh taxes agreed for a new campaign against scots english campaign against scotland was planned on a massive scale with a force of around 23 350 men edward advanced through lothian towards edinburgh but robert bruce declined to meet him in battle drawing edward further into scotland plans to resupply campaign by sea failed and large army rapidly ran out of food edward was forced to retreat south of border pursued by scottish raiding parties edward s illegitimate son adam died during campaign and raiding parties almost captured isabella who was staying at tynemouth and was forced

previous year and recently made earl of carlisle independently negotiated a peace treaty with robert bruce proposing that edward would recognise robert as king of scotland and that in return robert would cease to interfere in england edward was furious and immediately executed harclay but agreed to a thirteen year truce with robert hugh despenser younger lived and ruled in grand style playing a leading role in edward s government and executing policy through a wide network of family retainers supported by robert baldock and walter stapledon edward s chancellor and lord treasurer despensers accumulated land and wealth using their position in government to provide superficial cover for what historian seymour phillips describes as reality of fraud threats of violence and abuse of legal procedure meanwhile edward faced growing opposition miracles were reported around late earl of lancaster s tomb and at gallows used to execute members of opposition in bristol law and order began to break down encouraged by chaos caused by seizure of lands old opposition consisting of marcher lords associates attempted to free prisoners edward held in wallingford castle and roger mortimer one of most prominent of imprisoned marcher lords escaped from tower of london and fled to france war with france disagreements between edward and french crown over duchy of gascony led to war of saint sardos in 1324 charles edward s brother in law had become king of france in 1322 and was more aggressive than his predecessors in 1323 he insisted that edward come to paris to give homage for gascony and demanded that edward s administrators in gascony allow french officials there to carry out orders given in paris matters came to a head in october when a group of edward s soldiers hanged a french sergeant for attempting to build a new fortified town in agenais a contested section of gascon border edward denied any responsibility for this incident but relations between edward and charles soured in 1324 edward dispatched earl of pembroke to paris to broker a solution but earl died suddenly of an illness along way charles mobilised his army and ordered invasion of gascony edward s forces in gascony were around 4 400 strong but french army commanded by charles of valois numbered 7 000 valois took agenais and then advanced further and cut off main city of bordeaux in response edward ordered arrest of any french persons in england and seized isabella s lands on basis that she was of french origin in november 1324 he met with earls and english church who recommended that edward should lead a force of 11 000 men to gascony edward decided not to go personally sending instead earl of surrey meanwhile edward opened up fresh negotiations with french king charles advanced various proposals most tempting of which was suggestion that if isabella and prince edward were to travel to paris and prince was to give homage to french king for gascony he would terminate war and return

give homage in person to charles for gascony concerned about consequences of war breaking out once again edward agreed to treaty but decided to give gascony to his son edward and sent prince to give homage in paris young prince edward crossed english channel and completed bargain in september edward now expected isabella and their son to return to england but instead she remained in france and showed no intention of making her way back until 1322 edward and isabella s marriage appears to have been successful but by time queen left for france in 1325 it had deteriorated isabella appears to have disliked hugh despenser younger intensely not least because of his abuse of high status women isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from scottish armies three times during her marriage to edward and she blamed hugh for final occurrence in 1322 when edward had negotiated recent truce with robert bruce he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in scotland including beaumonts close friends of isabella s she was also angry about arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324 finally edward had taken away her children and given custody of them to hugh despenser s wife by february 1326 it was clear that isabella was involved in a relationship with exiled marcher lord roger mortimer it is unclear when isabella first met mortimer or when their relationship began but they both wanted to see edward and despensers removed from power king appealed for his son to return and for charles to intervene on his behalf but this had no effect edward s opponents began to gather around isabella and mortimer in paris and edward became increasingly anxious about possibility that mortimer might invade england isabella and mortimer turned to william count of hainaut and proposed a marriage between prince edward and william s daughter philippa in return for advantageous alliance with english heir to throne and a sizeable dower for bride william offered 132 transport vessels and 8 warships to assist in invasion of england prince edward and philippa were betrothed on 27 august and isabella and mortimer prepared for their campaign invasion

along coasts of england to protect against possibility of an invasion either by france or by roger mortimer fleets were gathered at ports of portsmouth in south and orwell on east coast and a raiding force of 1 600 men was sent across english channel into normandy as a diversionary attack edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend kingdom but with little impact regime s hold on power at local level was fragile despensers were widely disliked and many of those edward entrusted with defence of kingdom proved incompetent or promptly turned against regime some 2 000 men were ordered to gather at orwell to repel any invasion but only 55 appear to have actually arrived roger mortimer isabella and thirteen year old prince edward accompanied by king edward s half brother edmund of woodstock landed in orwell on 24 september with a small force of men and met with no resistance instead enemies of despensers moved rapidly to join them including edward s other half brother

attempted to garner support from within capital city of london rose against his government and on 2 october king left london taking despensers with him london descended into anarchy as mobs attacked

reaching gloucester between 9 and 12 october he hoped to reach wales and from there mobilise an army against invaders mortimer and isabella were not far behind proclamations condemned despensers

to receive refuge and raise a fresh army bad weather drove them back though and they landed at cardiff edward retreated to caerphilly castle and attempted to rally his remaining forces edward s authority collapsed in england where in king s absence isabella s faction took over administration with support of church her forces surrounded bristol where hugh despenser elder had taken shelter he surrendered and was promptly executed edward and hugh younger fled their castle around 2 november leaving behind jewellery considerable supplies and at least ps13 000 in cash possibly once again hoping to reach ireland but on 16 november they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of caerphilly edward was escorted first to monmouth castle and from there back into england where he was held at henry of lancaster s fortress at kenilworth king s final remaining forces by now besieged in caerphilly castle surrendered after five months in april 1327 abdication thumb upright alt

edward s position however was problematic he was still married to isabella and in principle he remained king but most of new administration had a lot to lose were he to be released and potentially regain power there was no established procedure for removing an english king adam orleton bishop of hereford made a series of public allegations about edward s conduct as king and in january 1327 a parliament convened at westminster at which question of edward s future was raised edward refused to attend gathering parliament initially ambivalent responded to london crowds that called for prince edward to take throne on 12 january leading barons and clergy agreed that edward ii should be removed and replaced by his son following day it was presented to an assembly of barons where it was argued that edward s weak leadership and personal faults had led kingdom into disaster and that he was incompetent to lead country shortly after this a representative delegation of barons clergy and knights was sent to kenilworth to speak to king on 20 january 1327 henry of lancaster and bishops of winchester and lincoln met privately with edward in castle they informed edward that if he were to resign as monarch his son prince edward would succeed him but if he failed to do so his son might be disinherited as well and crown given to an alternative candidate in tears edward agreed to abdicate and on 21 january sir william trussell representing kingdom as a whole withdrew his homage and formally ended edward s reign a proclamation was sent to london announcing that edward now known just as

alt photograph of walkway in berkeley castle covered walkway leading to a cell within berkeley castle by tradition associated with edward s imprisonment those opposed to new government began to make plans to free edward and roger mortimer decided to move edward to more secure location of berkeley castle in gloucestershire where former king arrived around 5 april 1327 once at castle edward was kept in custody of mortimer s son in law thomas berkeley and john maltravers who were given ps5 a day for edward s maintenance it is unclear how well cared for edward was records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated a poem lament of edward ii was once thought to have been written by edward during his imprisonment although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this concerns continued to be raised over fresh plots to liberate edward some involving dominican order and former household knights and one such attempt got at least as far as breaking into prison within castle as a result of these threats edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period before returning to permanent custody at castle in late summer of 1327 political situation remained unstable and new plots appear to have been formed to free him on 23 september edward iii was informed that his father had died at berkeley castle during night of 21 september most historians agree that edward ii did die at berkeley on that date although there is a minority view described below that he died much later edward s death was as mark ormrod notes suspiciously timely as it simplified mortimer s political problems considerably and most historians believe that edward probably was murdered on orders of new regime although it is impossible to be certain several of individuals suspected of involvement in death including sir thomas gurney maltravers and later fled if edward died from natural causes his death may have been hastened by depression following his imprisonment rule of isabella and mortimer did not last long after announcement of edward s death they made peace with scots in treaty of northampton but this move was highly unpopular isabella and mortimer both amassed and spent great wealth and criticism of them mounted relations between mortimer and young edward iii became strained and in 1330 king conducted a coup d etat at nottingham castle he arrested mortimer and then executed him on fourteen charges of treason including murder of edward ii edward iii s government sought to blame mortimer for all of recent problems effectively politically rehabilitating late king king spared isabella giving her a generous allowance and she soon returned to public life burial and cult thumb alt photograph of edward s tomb edward ii s tomb at gloucester cathedral edward s body was embalmed at berkeley castle where it was viewed by local leaders from bristol and gloucester it was then taken to gloucester abbey on 21 october and on 20 december edward was buried by high altar funeral having probably been delayed to allow edward iii to attend in person gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take king s body and because it was close to berkeley funeral was a grand affair and cost in total complete with gilt lions standards painted with gold leaf and oak barriers to manage anticipated crowds edward iii s government probably hoped to put a veneer of normality over recent political events increasing legitimacy of young king s own reign a temporary wooden effigy with a copper crown was made for funeral this is first known use of a funeral effigy in england and was probably necessary because of condition of king s body which had been dead for three months edward s heart was removed placed in a silver container and later buried with isabella at newgate church in london his tomb includes a very early example of an english alabaster effigy with a tomb chest and a canopy made of oolite and purbeck stone edward was buried in shirt coif and gloves from his coronation and his effigy depicts him as king holding a sceptre and orb and wearing a strawberry leaf crown effigy features a pronounced lower lip and may be a close likeness of edward king s tomb rapidly became a popular site for visitors probably encouraged by local monks who lacked an existing pilgrimage attraction visitors donated extensively to abbey allowing monks to rebuild much of surrounding church in 1330s miracles reportedly took place at tomb and modifications had to be made to enable visitors to walk around it in larger numbers chronicler geoffrey de baker depicted edward as a saintly tortured martyr and richard ii gave royal support for an unsuccessful bid to have edward canonised in 1395 tomb was opened by officials in 1855 uncovering a wooden coffin still in good condition and a sealed lead coffin inside it tomb remains in what is now gloucester cathedral and was extensively restored between 2007 and 2008 at a cost of over ps100 000 controversies controversy rapidly surrounded edward s death with mortimer s execution in 1330 rumours began to circulate that edward had been murdered at berkeley castle accounts that he had been killed by insertion of a red hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to circulate possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda chroniclers in mid 1330s and 1340s spread this account further supported in later years by geoffrey le baker s colourful account of killing it became incorporated into most later histories of edward typically being linked to his possible homosexuality most historians now dismiss this account of edward s death querying logic in edward s captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion another set of theories surround possibility that edward did not really die in 1327 these theories typically involve fieschi letter sent to edward iii by an italian priest called manuel fieschi who claimed that edward escaped berkeley castle in 1327 with help of a servant and ultimately retired to become a hermit in holy roman empire body buried at gloucester cathedral was said to be that of porter of berkeley castle killed by assassins and presented by them to isabella as edward s corpse to avoid punishment letter is often linked to an account of edward iii meeting with a man called william welshman in antwerp in 1338 who claimed to be edward ii some parts of letter s content are considered broadly accurate by historians although other aspects of its account have been criticised as implausible a few historians have supported versions of its narrative paul doherty questions veracity of letter and identity of william welshman but nonetheless has suspicions that edward may have survived his imprisonment popular historian alison weir believes events in letter to be essentially true using letter to argue that isabella was innocent of murdering edward historian ian mortimer suggests that story in fieschi s letter is broadly accurate but argues that it was in fact mortimer and isabella who had edward secretly released and who then faked his death a fiction later maintained by edward iii when he came to power ian mortimer s account was criticised by most scholars when it was first published in particular by historian david carpenter edward as king kingship government and law edward was ultimately a failure as a king historian michael prestwich observes that he was lazy and incompetent liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues yet indecisive when it came to major issues echoed by roy haines description of edward as incompetent and vicious and as no man of business edward did not just delegate routine government to his subordinates but also higher level decision making and pierre chaplais argues that he was not so much an incompetent king as a reluctant one preferring to rule through a powerful deputy such as piers gaveston or hugh despenser younger edward s willingness to promote his favourites had serious political consequences although he also attempted to buy loyalty of a wider grouping of nobles through grants of money and fees edward could take a keen interest in minutiae of administration however and on occasion engaged in details of a wide range of issues across england and his wider domains one of edward s persistent challenges through most of his reign was a shortage of money of debts he inherited from his father around ps60 000 was still owing in 1320s king worked his way through many treasurers and other financial officials few of whom stayed long raising revenues through often unpopular taxes and requisitioning goods using his right of prise he also took out many loans first through frescobaldi family and then through his banker antonio pessagno edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards end of his reign distrusting his own officials and directly cutting back on expenses of his own household edward was responsible for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials it is uncertain to what extent edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice but he appears to have involved himself to some degree during first part of his reign and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322 edward made extensive use of roman civil law during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning established principles of english common law edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing despensers to exploit royal justice system for their own ends despensers certainly appear to have abused system although just how widely they did so is unclear amid political turbulence armed gangs and violence spread across england under edward s reign destabilising position of many of local gentry much of ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy under edward s rule parliament s importance grew as a means of making political decisions and answering petitions although as historian claire valente notes gatherings were still as much an event as an institution after 1311 parliament began to include in addition to barons representatives of knights and burgesses who in later years would constitute commons although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes active opposition to edward came largely from barons rather than parliament itself although barons did seek to use parliamentary meetings as a way of giving legitimacy to their long standing political demands after resisting it for many years edward began intervening in parliament in second half of his reign to achieve his own political aims it remains unclear whether edward was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of political classes alongside an existing parliament court thumb upright alt detail of 1575 map 1575 map showing king s hall top left founded by edward edward s royal court was itinerant travelling around country with king when housed in westminster palace court occupied a complex of two halls seven chambers and three chapels along with other smaller rooms but due to scottish conflict court spent much of its time in yorkshire and northumbria at heart of court was edward s royal household in turn divided into hall and chamber size of household varied over time but in 1317 was around 500 strong including household knights squires kitchen and transport staff household was surrounded by a wider group of courtiers and appears to have also attracted a circle of prostitutes and criminal elements music and minstrels were very popular at edward s court but hunting appears to have been a much less important activity and there was little emphasis on chivalric events edward was interested in buildings and paintings but less so in literary works which were not extensively sponsored at court there was an extensive use of gold and silver plates jewels and enamelling at court which would have been richly decorated edward kept a camel as a pet and as a young man took a

was normal for period and historian michael prestwich describes him as a man of wholly conventional religious attitudes there were daily chapel services and alms giving at his court and edward blessed sick although he did this less often than his predecessors edward remained close to dominican order who had helped to educate him and followed their advice in asking for papal permission to be anointed with holy oil of st thomas of canterbury in 1319 this request was refused causing king some embarrassment edward supported expansion of universities during his reign establishing king s hall in cambridge to promote training in religious and civil law oriel college in oxford and a short lived university in dublin edward enjoyed a good relationship with pope clement v despite king s repeated intervention in operation of english church including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed with clement s support edward attempted to gain financial support of english church for his military campaigns in scotland including taxation and borrowing money against funds gathered for crusades english church did relatively little to influence or moderate edward s behaviour during his reign possibly because of bishops self interest and concern for their own protection pope john xxii elected in 1316 sought edward s support for a new crusade and was also inclined to support him politically in 1317 in exchange for papal support in his war with scotland edward agreed to recommence paying annual papal tribute which had been first agreed to by king john in 1213 edward soon ceased payments however and king never offered his homage another part of 1213 agreement in 1325 edward asked pope john to instruct irish church to openly preach in favour of his right to rule island and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices legacy historiography thumb alt photograph of medieval charter oriel college s 1326 charter from edward no chronicler for this period is entirely trustworthy or unbiased often because their accounts were written to support a particular cause but it is clear that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of edward polychronicon vita edwardi secundi vita et mors edwardi secundi and gesta edwardi de carnarvon for example all condemned king s personality habits and choice of companions other records from his reign show criticism of edward by his contemporaries including church and members of his own household political songs were written about him complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government later in 14th century some chroniclers such as geoffrey le baker and thomas rehabilitated edward presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint although this tradition died out in later years historians in 16th and 17th centuries focused on edward s relationship with gaveston drawing comparisons between edward s reign and events surrounding relationship of duc d and henry iii of france and between duke of buckingham and charles i in first half of 19th century popular historians such as charles dickens and charles knight popularised edward s life with victorian public focusing on king s relationship with his favourites and increasingly alluding to his possible homosexuality from 1870s onwards however open academic discussion of edward s sexuality was circumscribed by changing english values by start of 20th century english schools were being advised by government to avoid overt discussion of edward s personal relationships in history lessons views on edward s sexuality have continued to develop over years by end of 19th century more administrative records from period had become available to historians such as william stubbs thomas tout and j c davies who focused on development of english constitutional and governmental system during his reign although critical of what they regarded as edward s inadequacies as a king they also emphasised growth of role of parliament and reduction in personal royal authority under edward ii which they perceived as positive developments during 1970s historiography of edward s reign shifted away from this model supported by further publishing of records from period in last quarter of 20th century work of jeffrey denton jeffrey hamilton john maddicott and seymour phillips re focused attention on role of individual leaders in conflicts with exceptions of hilda johnstone s work on edward s early years and natalie fryde s study of edward s final years focus of major historical studies for several years was on leading magnates rather than edward himself until substantial biographies of king were published by roy haines and seymour phillips in 2003 and 2011 cultural references thumb upright alt photograph of first page of edward ii play title page of earliest published text of edward ii 1594 several plays have shaped edward s contemporary image christopher marlowe s play edward ii was first performed around 1592 and focuses on edward s relationship with piers gaveston reflecting 16th century concerns about relationships between monarchs and their favourites marlowe presents edward s death as a murder drawing parallels between killing and martyrdom although marlowe does not describe actual nature of edward s murder in script it has usually been performed following tradition that edward was killed with a red hot poker character of edward in play who has been likened to marlowe s contemporaries james vi of scotland and henry iii of france may have influenced william shakespeare s portrayal of richard ii in 17th century playwright ben jonson picked up same theme for his unfinished work mortimer his fall filmmaker derek jarman adapted marlowe play into a film in 1991 creating a postmodern pastiche of original depicting edward as a strong explicitly homosexual leader ultimately overcome by powerful enemies in jarman s version edward finally escapes captivity following tradition in fieschi letter edward s current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in mel gibson s 1995 film braveheart where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup shunning company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with scots film received extensive criticism both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality edward s life has also been used in a wide variety of other media in victorian era painting edward ii and piers gaveston by marcus stone strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between pair while avoiding making this aspect explicit it was initially shown at royal academy in 1872 but was marginalised in later decades as issue of homosexuality became more sensitive more
