marked end of zanzibar sultanate as a sovereign state and start of a period of heavy british influence background thumb 250px islands of zanzibar and african mainland zanzibar was an island country in indian ocean off coast of tanganyika today it forms part of tanzania main island unguja or zanzibar island had been under nominal control of sultans of oman since 1698 when they expelled portuguese settlers who had claimed it in 1499 sultan majid bin said declared island independent of oman in 1858 which was recognised by great britain and split sultanate from that of oman barghash bin said second sultan and khalid s father had been forced by british ultimatum and a threat of blockade to abolish slave trade in june 1873 though it was later discovered that instructions from london would have prohibited aggressive action being taken immediately if that ultimatum had been rejected christopher lloyd navy and slave trade suppression of african slave trade in nineteenth century 1968 pp 264 268 subsequent sultans established their capital and seat of government at zanzibar town where a palace complex was built on sea front by 1896 this consisted of palace itself beit al an attached harem and beit al or house of wonders a ceremonial palace said to be first building in east africa to be provided with electricity complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure all three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height britain had recognised zanzibar s sovereignty and its sultanate in 1886 after a long period of friendly interaction and generally maintained good relations with country and its sultans however germany was also interested in east africa and two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in area throughout late 19th century sultan khalifah had granted rights to land of kenya to britain and that of tanganyika to germany a process resulting in prohibition of slavery in those lands many of arab ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade which resulted in some unrest in addition german authorities in tanganyika refused to fly flag of zanzibar sultanate which led to armed clashes between german troops and local population one such conflict in tanga claimed lives of 20 arabs sultan khalifah sent zanzibari troops led by brigadier general lloyd mathews a former lieutenant of royal navy to restore order in tanganyika operation was largely successful but anti german feeling among zanzibari people remained strong further conflicts erupted at bagamoyo where 150 natives were killed by german military forces and at where german officials and their servants were murdered khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to imperial british east africa company who with german assistance ran a naval blockade to halt continuing domestic slave trade upon khalifah s death in 1890 ali bin said ascended to sultanate sultan ali banned domestic slave trade but not slave ownership declared zanzibar a british protectorate and appointed lloyd mathews as first minister to lead his cabinet british were also guaranteed a veto over future appointment of sultans year of ali s ascension also saw signing of heligoland zanzibar treaty between britain and germany this treaty officially demarcated spheres of interest in east africa and ceded germany s rights in zanzibar to united kingdom this granted british government more influence in zanzibar which they intended to use to eradicate slavery there an objective they had held as early as 1804 sultan ali s successor was hamad bin thuwaini who became sultan in 1893 hamad maintained a close relationship with british but there was dissent among his subjects over increasing british control over country british led army and abolition of valuable slave trade in order to control this dissent british authorities authorised sultan to raise a zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1 000 men but these troops were soon involved in clashes with british led police complaints about bodyguards activities were also received from european residents in zanzibar town 25 august sultan hamad died suddenly at 11 40 eat 08 40 utc on 25 august 1896 his 29 year old nephew khalid bin who was suspected by some of his assassination moved into palace complex at zanzibar town without british approval in contravention of treaty agreed with ali british government preferred an alternative candidate hamud bin muhammed who was more favourably disposed towards them khalid was warned by consul and diplomatic agent to zanzibar basil cave and general mathews to think carefully about his actions this course of action had proved successful three years earlier when khalid had tried to claim sultanate after death of ali and british consul general rennell rodd had persuaded him of dangers of such an action khalid ignored cave s warning and his forces began mustering in palace square under command of captain saleh of palace bodyguard by end of day they numbered 2 800 men armed with rifles and muskets majority were civilians but force included 700 zanzibari askari soldiers who had sided with khalid sultan s artillery which consisted of several maxim machine guns a gatling gun a 17th century bronze cannon and two 12 pounder field guns was aimed at british ships in harbour 12 pounders had been presented to sultan by wilhelm ii german emperor sultan s troops also took possession of zanzibari navy which consisted of one wooden sloop hhs glasgow built as a royal yacht for sultan in 1878 based on british frigate glasgow mathews and cave also began to muster their forces already commanding 900 zanzibari askaris under lieutenant arthur edward harington raikes of wiltshire regiment who was seconded to zanzibar army and held rank of brigadier general 150 sailors and marines were landed from pearl class protected cruiser philomel and gunboat thrush which were anchored in harbour naval contingent under command of captain o callaghan came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by general population a smaller contingent of sailors under lieutenant watson of thrush were put ashore to guard british consulate where british citizens were requested to gather for protection hms sparrow another gunboat entered harbour and was anchored opposite palace next to thrush some concerns were raised among british diplomats as to reliability of raikes askaris but they proved to be steady and professional troops hardened by military drill and several expeditions to east africa they would later become only land troops to be fired upon by defenders raikes troops were armed with two maxim guns and a nine pounder cannon and were stationed at nearby customs house sultan attempted to have us consul richard dorsey mohun recognise his accession but messenger was told that as his accession had not been verified by her majesty s government it is impossible to reply cave continued to send messages to khalid requesting that he stand down his troops leave palace and return home but these were ignored and khalid replied that he would proclaim himself sultan at 15 00 cave stated that this would constitute an act of rebellion and that khalid s would not be recognised by british government at 14 30 sultan hamad was buried and exactly 30 minutes later a royal salute from palace guns proclaimed khalid s succession cave could not open hostilities without government approval and telegraphed following message to foreign office of lord salisbury s administration in london are we authorised in event of all attempts at a peaceful solution proving useless to fire on palace from men of war meanwhile cave informed all other foreign consuls that all flags were to remain at half mast in honour of late hamad only one that did not was a large red flag flying from khalid s palace cave also informed consuls not to recognise khalid as sultan to which they agreed 26 august at 10 00 on 26 august archer class protected cruiser racoon arrived at zanzibar town and was anchored in line with thrush and sparrow at 14 00 edgar class protected cruiser st george flagship of cape and east africa station steamed into harbour on board were rear admiral harry rawson and further british marines and sailors at around same time lord salisbury s reply arrived authorising cave and rawson to use resources at their disposal to remove khalid from power telegraph read you are authorised to adopt whatever measures you may consider necessary and will be supported in your action by her majesty s government do not however attempt to take any action which you are not certain of being able to accomplish successfully cave attempted further negotiations with khalid but these failed and rawson sent an ultimatum requiring him to haul down his flag and leave palace by 09 00 on 27 august or he would open fire during afternoon all merchant vessels were cleared from harbour and british women and children removed to st george and a british india steam navigation company vessel for their safety that night consul mohun noted that silence which hung over zanzibar was appalling usually drums were beating or babies cried but that night there was absolutely not a sound war 27 august at 08 00 on morning of 27 august after a messenger sent by khalid requested parley from cave consul replied that he would only have salvation if he agreed to terms of ultimatum at 08 30 a further messenger from khalid declared that we have no intention of hauling down our flag and we do not believe you would open fire on us cave replied that we do not want to open fire but unless you do as you are told we shall certainly do so at 08 55 having received no further word from palace aboard st george rawson hoisted signal prepare for action at exactly 09 00 general lloyd mathews ordered british ships to commence bombardment at 09 02 her majesty s ships racoon thrush and sparrow opened fire at palace simultaneously thrush s first shot immediately dismounted an arab 12 pounder cannon three thousand defenders servants and slaves were present in largely wooden palace and even with barricades of crates bales and rubber there were many casualties from high explosive shells despite initial reports that he had been captured and was to be exiled to india sultan khalid escaped from palace a reuters news correspondent reported that sultan had fled at first shot with all leading arabs who left their slaves and followers to carry on fighting but other sources state that he remained in palace for longer shelling ceased at around 09 40 by which time palace and attached harem had caught fire sultan s artillery had been silenced and his flag cut down during bombardment a small naval engagement occurred when at 09 05 obsolete glasgow fired upon st george using her armament of 7 nine pounder guns and a gatling gun which had been a present from queen victoria to sultan return fire caused glasgow to sink though shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of water glasgows crew hoisted a british flag as a token of their surrender and they were all rescued by british sailors in launches thrush also sank two steam launches whose zanzibari crews shot at her with rifles some land fighting occurred when khalid s men fired on raikes askaris with little effect as they approached palace fighting ceased with end of shelling british controlled town and palace and by afternoon hamud bin muhammed an arab favourable to british had been installed as sultan with much reduced powers british ships and crews had fired around 500 shells 4 100 machine gun rounds and 1 000 rifle rounds during engagement aftermath thumb bombing of stone town in an 1896 british newspaper approximately 500 zanzibari men and women were killed or wounded during bombardment most of dead a result of fire that engulfed palace it is unknown how many of these casualties were combatants but khalid s gun crews were said to have been decimated british casualties amounted to one petty officer severely wounded aboard thrush who later recovered although majority of zanzibari townspeople sided with british town s indian quarter suffered from opportunistic looting and around twenty inhabitants lost their lives in chaos to restore order 150 british sikh troops were transferred from mombasa to patrol streets sailors from st george and philomel were landed to form a fire brigade to contain fire which had spread from palace to nearby customs sheds there was some concern about fire at customs sheds as they contained a sizeable store of explosives but no explosion occurred sultan khalid captain saleh and around forty followers sought refuge in german consulate following their flight from palace where they were guarded by ten armed german sailors and marines while mathews stationed men outside to arrest them if they tried to leave despite extradition requests german consul refused to surrender khalid to british as his country s extradition treaty with britain specifically excluded political prisoners instead german consul promised to remove khalid to german east africa without him setting foot on soil of zanzibar at 10 00 on 2 october sms seeadler of german navy arrived in port at high tide one of seeadler s boats made it up to consulate s garden gate and khalid stepped directly from consular grounds to a german war vessel and hence was free from arrest he was transferred from boat onto seeadler and was then taken to dar es salaam in german east africa khalid was captured by british forces in 1916 during east african campaign of world war i and exiled to seychelles and saint helena before being allowed to return to east africa where he died at mombasa in 1927 british punished khalid s supporters by forcing them to pay reparations to cover cost of shells fired against them and for damages caused by looting which amounted to 300 000 rupees sultan hamud was loyal to british and acted as a figurehead for an essentially british run government sultanate only being retained to avoid costs involved with running zanzibar directly as a crown colony several months after war hamud with british prompting abolished slavery in all its forms emancipation of slaves required them to present themselves to a government office and proved a slow process within ten years only 17 293 slaves had been freed from an estimated population of 60 000 in 1891 badly damaged palace complex was completely changed by war harem lighthouse and palace were demolished as bombardment had left them unsafe palace site became an area of gardens while a new palace was erected on site of harem house of wonders was almost undamaged and would later become main secretariat for british governing authorities during renovation work on house of wonders in 1897 a clocktower was added to its frontage to replace lighthouse lost to shelling wreck of glasgow remained in harbour in front of palace where shallow waters ensured that her masts would remain visible for several years to come it was eventually broken up for scrap in 1912 british protagonists were highly regarded by governments in london and zanzibar for their actions leading up to and during war and many were rewarded with appointments and honours general raikes leader of askaris was appointed a first class second grade member of order of brilliant star of zanzibar on 24 september 1896 a first class member of zanzibari order of hamondieh on 25 august 1897 and later promoted to commander of zanzibar armies general mathews zanzibari army commander was appointed a member of grand order of hamondieh on 25 august 1897 and became first minister and treasurer to zanzibari government basil cave consul was appointed a companion of order of bath on 1 january 1897 and promoted to consul general on 9 july 1903 harry rawson was appointed a knight commander of order of bath for his work in zanzibar and would later be governor of new south wales in australia and receive promotion to admiral rawson was also appointed a first class member of order of brilliant star of zanzibar on 8 february 1897 and order of hamondieh on 18 june 1898 perhaps due to effectiveness shown by royal navy during bombardment there were no further rebellions against british influence during remaining 67 years of protectorate center 700px thumb masts of sunken glasgow can be seen in this panorama of zanzibar town harbour taken in 1902 looking

buildings are to right duration war lasting less than three quarters of an hour is considered shortest in recorded history several durations are given by sources including 38 40 and 45 minutes but 38 minute duration is most often quoted variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes start and end of a war some sources take start of war as order to open fire at 09 00 and some with start of actual firing at 09 02 end of war is usually put at 09 40 when last shots were fired and palace flag struck but some sources place it at 09 45 logbooks of british ships also suffer from this with st george indicating that cease fire was called and khalid entered german consulate at 09 35 thrush at 09 40 racoon at 09 41 and philomel and sparrow at 09 45 references bibliography further
