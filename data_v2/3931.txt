calypso was a modest success billboard review of album said although calypso addicts will question authenticity of this package miss angelou has enough sell in her voice to offer dealers a promising set selections include such oldies as run joe stone cold dead in market and calypso blues all of which are handled with finesse singer s name value is a rising commodity via her dates and should increase some as a result of this wax unterberger wrote that 1995 reissue of album was probably motivated by exotica space age pop revival he called album s music more or less straight ahead pop calypso that was not that strange or cheesy he complimented angelou s performance saying that she sung with respectable and compared album to harry belafonte s calypso recordings of same era variety

notes stef variety reviewer called angelou s act sizzling and a unique creation in jazz world when everything progressive is expected to be on cool side he called song polymon bongo recitative and complimented its conversational nature with drums he commented on intimacy and sharpness in angelou s performance of heat is on a song she wrote but one that does not appear on album he called calypso blues written by nat king cole and don george an artfully simple welding of idioms and another song she composed scandal in family standard trinidad calypso stuff and reported that her performance of it rocked house spector also in album s 1957 liner notes reported on another of angelou s concerts in beverly hills nightclub keyboard when she performed many of songs on miss calypso specter erroneously reported on some of angelou s biography stating that she was born in cuba that her father was a tall native african that her mother was short and that she had been lead in porgy and bess

striking appearance spector stated she had captured audience swiftly and effectively with her calm and affectionate manner and promised that she would do same for listeners of album he also predicted

delicate jazz foster in album s liner notes its 1995 reissue called music fresh as day it was recorded and entirely captivating but that it followed tradition of calypso of its era he described album s genre as having jazz afro cuban rhythms odetta style folk with gospel and blues voicings and belafonte influenced caribbean flavors foster considered tommy tedesco s guitar and al bello s percussion as having a beat era spiritual sound he thought that angelou brought out best in calypso standards peas and rice and run joe but that she reached her peak with scandal in family all of which he found as authentic as songs she wrote he stated that two of songs angelou wrote mambo in africa and neighbor neighbor effectively combined her skills as a poet and composer he compared her music with other calypso artists of same era but considered hers more uptown and more like music of modern artists such as tracy chapman foster also compared angelou s music in miss calypso with her later writing and called both hot and spicy peppered with a roots flavoring jessica letkemann of billboard stated that angelou s tuneful and distinctive voice would serve her so well in later years as a spoken word
