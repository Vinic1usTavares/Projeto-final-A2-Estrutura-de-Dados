park recalling an experience he had trying to find sculpture riva by jacob epstein in park he welcomed fact that sculpture would be next to a public path and would have seating nearby to allow contemplation and compared gardens favourably with setting for hubert le sueur s equestrian statue of charles i at charing cross which in order to look at closely and appreciate in detail you have to risk your life in crossing a maze of traffic siting of sculpture was disliked by some with neil marten mp asking parliament why this lovely part of westminster should be littered with something that
