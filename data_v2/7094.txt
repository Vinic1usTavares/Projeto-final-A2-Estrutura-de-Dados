thumb upright subspecies manilensis in north sulawesi indonesia showing long toes purple heron ardea purpurea is a wide ranging species of wading bird in heron family ardeidae scientific name comes from latin ardea heron and purpureus coloured purple it breeds in africa central and southern europe and southern and eastern asia western palearctic populations migrate between breeding and wintering habitats whereas african and tropical asian populations are primarily sedentary except for occasional dispersive movements it is similar in appearance to more common grey heron but is slightly smaller more slender and has darker plumage it is also a more evasive bird favouring densely vegetated habitats near water particularly reed beds it hunts for a range of prey including fish rodents frogs and insects either stalking them or standing waiting in ambush purple herons are colonial breeders and build a bulky nest out of dead reeds or sticks close to water edge among reeds or in dense vegetation about five bluish green eggs are laid and are incubated by both birds young hatch about four weeks later and fledge six weeks after that international union for conservation of nature notes that global population trend is downwards largely because of drainage of wetlands but assesses purple heron s conservation status as being of least concern description thumb left adult with chicks at lake great rift valley kenya purple heron is a large bird in length with a standing height from and a wingspan however it is slender for its size weighing only it is somewhat smaller than grey heron from which it can be distinguished by its darker reddish brown plumage and in adults its darker grey back adults have forehead and crown of head black with a dark stripe down back of neck that terminates in a slender dangling crest this is shorter than crest of grey heron and does not exceed sides of head and neck are buffish chestnut with dark streaks and lines down either side of whole neck mantle is oily brown and upper scapular feathers are elongated but not lower ones rest of upper parts and tail are brownish grey front of neck is paler than sides and there are some elongated feathers at base of neck which are streaked with white chestnut and black breast is chestnut brown with some blackening at side and belly and under tail coverts are black brownish yellow beak is long straight and powerful and is brighter in colour in breeding adults iris is yellow and legs are brown at front and yellowish behind call is a harsh but is quieter and more high pitched than that of grey heron it is generally a less noisy bird though similar guttural sounds are heard emanating from it is also less robust and appears somewhat hollow chested its head and neck are more slender and snake like than grey heron and its toes much longer unlike that bird it often adopts a posture with its neck extending obliquely and even nestlings tend to use this stance taxonomy there are three or four subspecies a p purpurea linnaeus 1766 nominate found in africa europe north to netherlands and southwestern asia east to kazakhstan a p bournei de 1966 bourne s heron found in cape verde islands included in purpurea by some authors but treated as a distinct species ardea bournei by some others a p madagascariensis van oort 1910 found in madagascar a p manilensis meyen 1834 found in asia from indian subcontinent east to philippines and indonesia and north to primorsky krai russia distribution and habitat thumb upright purple heron in haryana india thumb upright grey heron is paler in colour and bulkier purple heron has a mostly palaearctic distribution and breeds in europe asia and africa range of western race extends from southern spain and north africa eastwards across southern and eastern europe as far as lake balkhash in kazakhstan in africa bird breeds in senegal down east coast of africa and in madagascar eastern race extends from indian subcontinent eastwards to eastern china and philippines and northwards to basins of amur river and ussuri river at about southern race is restricted to madagascar and a small population of purple herons on cape verde islands is regarded as a separate race by some authorities between august and october birds of western population migrate southwards to tropical africa returning northwards in march purple herons often overshoot their normal range on their return and are vagrants to northern europe including britain eastern population is largely resident though some birds from northern part of range fly southwards to korea thailand and malaysia african birds are resident purple heron inhabits marshes lagoons and lakes surrounded by dense vegetation it may frequent mangrove swamps on coast but it usually chooses freshwater habitats particularly locations with reed beds phragmites it also visits mudflats river banks ditches and canals in cape verde islands it is more likely to be seen in open on arid slopes behaviour flight is slow with neck retracted and legs extending a long way behind tail this is characteristic of herons and bitterns and distinguishes them from storks cranes and spoonbills which extend their necks in flight it is a secretive bird spending less time out in open than grey heron and tending to skulk in reed beds its long toes mean it can walk on floating vegetation and it sometimes walks over bushes in same way not making any attempt to grip branches it seldom perches in trees preferring more terrestrial sites to rest it is most active at dawn and dusk roosting with other birds in middle of day and at night but increasing its diurnal activity while rearing young it feeds in shallow water grabbing its prey with its powerful beak it will often wait motionless for prey or slowly stalk its victim diet consists mainly of fish small mammals and amphibians but nestling birds snakes lizards crustaceans water snails insects and spiders are also eaten terrestrial beetles are commonest insect prey followed by water beetles and aquatic larvae with grasshoppers dragonflies bees and flies also being consumed thumb egg collection museum wiesbaden purple heron usually breeds in colonies but sometimes nests are solitary it sometimes associates with other species such as goliath heron ardea goliath or grey heron at multi species nesting colonies site chosen is generally in reed beds or low bushes close to large lakes or other extensive wetlands it builds a bulky nest of dead reeds sticks or whatever is available carelessly pulling material together eggs are bluish green averaging clutch is usually four or five eggs with occasionally seven or eight eggs being laid though these large clutches may have resulted from two females laying in same nest eggs are laid at intervals of three days and incubation may begin with first egg or start when clutch is complete both parents share incubation which lasts between 24 and 28 days and care of young when an adult brings food its beak is dragged down by chicks and it regurgitates food from crop onto nest or young may take food directly from beak young fledge at about six weeks and become independent at two months they then disperse widely status there are estimated to be a total of between 270 000 and 570 000 purple herons in world and population is probably decreasing slowly international union for conservation of nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern because rate of decline is insufficient to justify rating it in a more threatened category chief threat bird faces is drainage and disturbance of its wetland habitats particularly destruction of reed beds purple heron is one of species to which agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa applies
