any uruk a nastier orc general antagonists of game that player comes into contact with while there are generic uruk for player to fight en masse and will be as cannon fodder as part of sauron s armies

leaders will help to weaken sauron s army and these leaders will drop a rune which player can install on talion s weapons to provide additional buffs in battle alternatively being killed by a leader will cause current mission to be cancelled and player returned to a safe point to continue exploring and leader will gain additional power making him more difficult to defeat in next encounter if procedurally generated orcs survive an encounter with talion they will also be promoted further such deaths are tracked through online servers and player s friends on various network services will be notified of this death and be offered chance to accept a vendetta mission and exact revenge on uruk if mission is successful game will give rewards to both original player and victorious friend leader uruk will have a range of strengths and weaknesses latter that can be exploited in combat to quickly weaken and defeat leader player can gain knowledge of these through finding intelligence mostly by draining and interrogating marked uruks for this being able to exploit such weaknesses in defeating leader will gain a better quality rune and more experience points in this manner once player gains ability to brand uruks they can brand these leaders and convert portions of sauron s army to their side at this point player can use nemesis system to trigger infighting within uruk forces which they can then directly participate in helping to weaken army further uruks that survive their encounter with talion will remember this when talion combats them again for example an uruk who was thrown into a fire by talion might want revenge on him for being disfigured synopsis setting game takes place in 60 year gap between events of tolkien s hobbit and lord of rings family of talion voiced and motion

in late 2011 game s lead developer was monolith productions who had experience on a middle earth game with guardians of middle earth a multiplayer online battle arena game released in 2012 according to design director michael de plater shadow of mordor was developed in parallel with guardians of middle earth but handled by a separate team it was published by warner bros who had published batman arkham game series game was designed by de plater who had worked with creative assembly on rome total war and ubisoft on tom clancy s and tom clancy s ghost recon future soldier shadow of mordor was monolith s first third person open world video game for eighth generation consoles playstation 4 and xbox one and de plater considered its development an educational experience for studio in monolith s introduction to genre many core mechanics were built from scratch and studio were inspired by successful video games such as batman arkham series created by rocksteady studios those games inspired shadow of mordor stealth and free flow combat mechanics studio considered rocksteady s games good examples of how to handle a licensed title game s signature feature is its nemesis system monolith team considered themselves experts in artificial intelligence and wanted to push its boundaries allowing players to choose their story a sandbox game pillar and leverage new generation hardware through innovation team wanted to create a system allowing non playable characters to respond to player actions this later became nemesis system system s idea was three months after development began and to best present it everyone in studio was involved developers hoped that with system orcs could be memorable for players it was made more complex during game s early development incorporating personal relationships among orcs but was later pared down when studio considered it too complicated nemesis system was also inspired by pen and paper role playing games although most orcs are similar some were designed with distinctive behavior patterns these orcs have dialogue written by dan abnett and team hoped special orcs would surprise players team also hoped that system would provide tension and competition similar to a multiplayer game studio was inspired by sports games where narrative continues when players lose a match this can prevent immersion and narrative from breaking when players die in game according to rob roberts system is designed so players can emotionally attach to protagonist through gameplay drama they also hoped that through system players can create their own villain leading to an organic story shadow of mordor bridges gap between hobbit and lord of rings with team wanting to show iconic elements of universe in an original way team had to draw notes on tolkien s notes and appendices to ensure that their vision for game would not change franchise s timeline although game s environment is inspired by books and films several places such as udun and sea of nurnen were re imagined art director phil straub considered consistency with lore and presenting something visually new and realistic most important elements of creating game and team did not incorporate many fantasy elements in its world to depict volcanic activity studio sent a team to eastern washington and columbia river plateau to photograph a volcano to create other parts of game environment they studied photos of iceland and new zealand and yellow stone found worldwide since shadow of mordor is set before lord of rings its landscape is less post apocalyptic environments also vary by weather lighting and atmosphere game has a standalone plot early in development team consulted peter jackson director of lord of rings and hobbit film trilogies who advised them against a film tie in according to de plater story is character driven to be authentic relative to tolkien s themes game was written by christian cantamessa who was lead writer and lead designer for rockstar san diego s red dead redemption according to roberts story is designed for accessibility by all players regardless of their familiarity with franchise by creating natural interactions and believable relationships among characters its protagonist is talion a half human half wraith inspired by boromir although torvin was originally proposed as a playable character idea was scrapped as team wanted game to have a single protagonist like hobbit and lord of rings wraith is later revealed as celebrimbor creator of rings of power development team picked celebrimbor because they considered his backstory sufficiently interesting to expand canon s authenticity allowing team to write a story around power a major theme of game another important component was mordor tone team created a dark atmosphere with humor reflected in dialogue and voice acting this was handled by dan abnett who previously worked on books related to warhammer dark and gritty universe team hired david salo a linguist who worked on tolkien s languages for lord of rings film trilogy to develop orcs black speech game s narrative was also inspired by bioshock which according to de plater has successfully incorporated systemic stories with players choices to prevent inaccuracies monolith consulted several tolkien scholars from warner bros and collaborated with weta workshop jackson s design company on game s special effects and scenery to depict well known characters company partnered with middle earth enterprises franchise rights holder to prevent misuse and contradiction between game s story and tolkien s monolith focused on developing game s playstation 4 and xbox one versions with development of playstation 3 and xbox 360 versions outsourced to behaviour interactive although game s core gameplay mechanics story and narrative are unchanged in playstation 3 and xbox 360 ports some features such as nemesis system are less complex than playstation 4 and xbox one versions according to game s developer nemesis system was too large for older consoles music for middle earth shadow of mordor was composed by garry and nathan grigg and a soundtrack album was released digitally by watertower music on september 30 2014 in designing game s music team used a number of sonic tools which synchronize with other aspects of game such as player actions and enemy movements combat music included and spring drums release in august 2013 an artist mentioned that monolith productions was working on a aaa title separate from guardians of middle earth and on november 12 its title was

fans excitement playstation 3 and xbox 360 versions were released on november 18 in north america and november 21 in europe on december 16 2014 downloadable content dlc lord of hunt was released its

of 100 based on 17 reviews playstation 4 version scored 84 out of 100 based on 85 reviews and xbox one version scored 87 out of 100 based on 12 reviews game s core feature its nemesis system was praised according to lucas sullivan of gamesradar system elevated shadow of mordor to excellence by making its villains memorable and adding personality to its protagonist brad shoemaker of giant bomb agreed writing that system created many distinctive characters and its side content extended game s longevity joystiq s alexander sliwinski said that system made each playthrough unique and made game stand out from other action games chris carter of destructoid found system gimmicky since it failed to create unique villains it added different appearances and weaknesses to villains without adding personality shadow of mordor combat was considered excellent by most critics shoemaker and sliwinski compared it to rhythm based combat system of batman arkham game series both found it engaging and fluid shoemaker praised game s combat variety combination of combat and nemesis systems created a specific kind of chaotic emergent nonsense desirable in an open world game according to sliwinski and shoemaker even without nemesis system combat system would make game compelling although matt miller of game informer found game s focus on killing made it repetitive failing to capture charm of its inspirations assassin s creed and batman arkham kevin vanord of gamespot called shadow of mordor combat an improvement of assassin s creed formula reception of game s storyline was mixed although shoemaker and sliwinski praised its dark tone shoemaker found some story elements such as gollum s introduction forced and designed to appeal to a particular audience according to game informer matt miller shadow of mordor fails to successfully tie together all of its various plot threads in game s conclusion kevin vanord of gamespot also found storyline erratic dragged down by anti climactic fights and scenes dan stapleton of ign wrote that story introduced memorable characters but would not make sense to fans of series and his interest in game waned towards its end destructoid chris carter was disappointed in a plot he considered generic go here kill this draw out this big bad then kill him for your family game failed to add anything new to universe and its side missions were more interesting than main campaign other aspects of shadow of mordor were praised sullivan enjoyed its lord of rings lore and found number of collectibles in game staggering miller also admired monolith s extensive use of lore in game and praised its soundtrack and voice acting stapleton agreed particularly about voice acting elements of game were criticized sullivan found some side missions repetitive and sliwinski was disappointed with some of boss battles miller wrote that some shadow of mordor features are too complex and inaccessible for new players or those unwilling to use strategy critics disagreed about nemesis system miller wrote that system fell flat in game s final hours according to vanord system was unappealing until game s second half carter found cutscenes after a player died annoying unlike shadow of mordor current generation versions playstation 3 and xbox 360 versions received mixed to negative reviews and many technical problems were noted according to thomas morgan of eurogamer its frame rate was substandard and yannick lejacq of kotaku cited many technical hiccups and glitches morgan believed that game developers spent little effort on port and lejacq questioned need to release game for playstation 3 and xbox 360 at all shadow of mordor was well received by bioshock series creator ken levine who called it first open world game with a non linear story and narrative and said he would bring some of its elements to his upcoming science fiction project sales shadow of mordor release was most successful for a lord of rings based game game debuted at number two in uk retail software sales chart in its first week behind fifa 15 and was ninth bestselling game in united states in october 2014 controversy when shadow of mordor was introduced monolith was accused by former ubisoft employee charles randall of using assets such as protagonist animation code from assassin s creed ii monolith responded that all their project s assets were developed from scratch they had confidence in their originality and game was based upon nemesis system in october 2014 after usual video game review outlets were unable to obtain early access to shadow of mordor john bain known as said that youtube video creators had been offered early access in exchange for agreeing to a contract requiring them to describe it positively jim sterling of escapist obtained a copy of one of contracts and analyzed it in detail federal trade commission began an investigation and announced in july 2016 that warner brothers home entertainment
