imaginos is eleventh studio album by american hard rock band blue oyster cult commonly shortened as boc it was released in 1988 and was their last recording with their original record label cbs columbia records album took nearly eight years to complete and was originally intended to be first in a trilogy of solo albums by blue oyster cult drummer and songwriter albert bouchard bouchard was fired in august 1981 and cbs rejected album in 1984 but a re worked version was eventually published as a product of band many musicians contributed to project over this eight year span including joe satriani aldo nova and doors guitarist robby krieger but some band members were barely involved in recording process thus imaginos is often considered more as a project of producer and lyricist sandy pearlman than as a true album of band imaginos weaves scripts and poems by pearlman dating from second half of 1960s into a concept album and rock opera about an alien conspiracy that is brought to fruition during late 19th and early 20th century through actions of imaginos an agent of evil tale combines elements of gothic literature and science fiction and is strongly inspired by work of h p lovecraft subtitled a bedtime story for children of damned pearlman liner notes it has an intricate storyline whose often obscure lyrics contain many historical references and is still an object of speculation by fans and critics it is often considered one of heaviest albums released by blue oyster cult its music more akin to heavy metal than melodic and commercial hard rock of their two previous works poor sales of those albums resulted in record label pressure on band that led to their disbandment in 1986 a subsequent comeback featured only three members of classic line up album received some critical acclaim but achieved no commercial success and columbia records ended their contract with blue oyster cult at completion of imaginos tour albert bouchard excluded from recording progress of imaginos after initial rejection from columbia records then took legal action against band and label to protect his rights as author and producer on album blue oyster cult continued to perform and remained a live attraction but ten years passed before they released an album of new songs background sandy pearlman and soft doctrines of imaginos concept and character of imaginos were originally created by young sandy pearlman for a collection of poems and scripts called soft doctrines of imaginos sometimes reported as 4 5 what is story behind recording of album imaginos written in mid 1960s during his formative years as a student of anthropology and sociology at universities of stony brook brandeis and new school pearlman combined cultural references learned in his studies with elements of gothic literature and science fiction and created a secret history about origin of two world wars popoff p 26 sandy pearlman pearlman himself declared his predilection for american weird fiction author h p lovecraft and other writers of that ilk as well as for books on modern warfare and conspiracies popoff p 26 joe bouchard established by 1967 as a critic for seminal us music magazine crawdaddy pearlman was also mentor manager and producer for band soft white underbelly which after various changes of name became blue oyster cult a term taken from imaginos script popoff p 22 joe bouchard adapted and amended rhymes of pearlman along with his friend and colleague richard meltzer s arcane writings were used as lyrics for most of band s early songs musician and writer lenny kaye recalls in his introduction to re mastered edition of their first album that band kept a folder full of meltzer s and pearlman s word associations in their rehearsal room and would leaf through it setting fragments to music fragments of imaginos script are scattered out of context throughout songs of first four albums where original meanings are lost to listeners unaware of larger picture popoff pp 223 224 resulting mystery feeds fan fascination for music of blue oyster cult and is responsible for their reputation as world s brainiest heavy metal band much fan speculation centers around lyrics relationship to imaginos storyline baker bryce in swartz 4 6 what is story told by album imaginos while pearlman s deliberate reticence and misleading in revealing his sources only augments obscurity of matter during band s first period of activity theme of alien conspiracy became more defined and predominant in mind of its author popoff pp 227 228 eric bloom to point that notes on cover of their 1974 album secret treaties referred to secret history conceived by pearlman popoff pp 51 52 while its songs astronomy and subhuman contained lyrics fully dedicated to imaginos plot popoff p 53 band sought to separate creatively from pearlman in late 1970s they avoided his lyrics and concepts and refused to record an album entirely dedicated to imaginos popoff p 228 sandy pearlman but eventually returned to his material for lyrics of shadow of california from revolution by night of 1983 popoff p 204 and when war comes from club ninja of 1985 popoff p 218 pearlman and albert bouchard hoped to record such an album and as far back as 1972 had begun to write songs directly inspired by imaginos story nonetheless with exception of extracts used for song lyrics text of soft doctrines of imaginos remains to this day largely unknown and unpublished blue oyster cult in 1988 thumb right 230px line up of blue oyster cult in 1988 allen lanier jon rogers buck dharma ron riddle eric bloom commercial success of single don t fear reaper in 1976 and a series of platinum and gold discs in following years placed pressure on band as their label columbia records expected them to repeat these successes popoff p 213 joe bouchard despite good sales of album fire of unknown origin and single burnin for you in august 1981 conflicts and stress accumulated in more than ten years of cohabitation led to firing of drummer albert bouchard a founding member and an important contributor to songwriting and sound of group allegedly for unstable behavior popoff p 189 sandy p 190 allen lanier eric bloom relationship between former band mates remained tense in following years old feuds resurfaced during a short reunion tour with original line up in 1985 popoff p 186 sandy pearlman with result that no one in band accepted albert bouchard back in blue oyster cult popoff p 210 however a bouchard still hoped to be reinstated in band through his work done for imaginos kerrang issue p 221 albert bouchard s departure started a rotation of personnel in formerly stable band roster kerrang issue 206 which left by 1986 only eric bloom and donald buck dharma roeser as original members allen lanier left in 1985 during recording sessions for club ninja unsatisfied by p 210 allen lanier and annoyed at presence of tommy zvoncheck as his replacement popoff p 211 212 joe bouchard while joe bouchard quit soon after that album s release to pursue different career opportunities play other musical genres and settle in his family life popoff p 222 release of two expensive studio albums in 1983 and 1985 which received generally bad critical response and sold poorly ruined relationship with their demanding record label and left band with little support and very few ideas on how to go on with their careers as a result in summer of 1986 band semi officially broke up bloom explained in an interview to british music magazine kerrang in 1988 final line up of 1986 included bloom roeser tommy zvoncheck on keyboards jon rogers on bass and jimmy willcox on drums popoff p 214 pearlman s and steve schenk s managerial efforts were rewarded when blue oyster cult were hired for some gigs in greece in july 1987 after a nine month layoff band returned to activity and allen lanier re joined popoff p 221 allen lanier european shows were a success and reformed line up of bloom roeser lanier jon rogers and drummer ron riddle worked very well together on stage blue oyster cult returned to road in 1987 and 1988 with renewed enthusiasm but without a new album to promote until release of imaginos concept and storyline imaginos was envisioned as a rock opera to be published as a trilogy of double albums with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history from beginning of 19th century to end of 20th this album represents an abbreviated version of first volume of that planned trilogy but with songs arranged out of order rendering story harder to comprehend even when song lyrics are analyzed in chronological order that was devised by p 231 and is followed in this section narrative progression is scarce and content often difficult to decipher for casual reader however thanks to various comments in interviews by pearlman and bouchard and extensive sleeve notes by pearlman that were issued with original release it is possible to reconstruct story to a great extent thumb left 180px star sirius a and its companion sirius b possible home of les invisibles although often referred to as a dream popoff p 231 bolle concept behind imaginos is what pearlman described as an interpretation of history an explanation for onset of world war i or a revelation of occult origins of it which he crafted on elements of mythology sociology alchemy science and occultism this combination of horror story and fairy tale cites historical facts and characters and is filled with literate references to ancient civilizations in a conspiracy theory of epic proportions subject of which is manipulation of course of human history central to this story are les invisibles invisible ones a group of seven beings worshipped by natives of mexico and haiti prior to arrival of spanish colonists in 16th century identified by some fans as loa of voodoo religion popoff p 232 nature of les invisibles is left unclear though it is hinted that they may be extraterrestrials or beings akin to great old ones in works of h p lovecraft an interpretation of lyrics of song astronomy by some fans suggests that star sirius is of particular astrological significance to les invisibles with clues identifying it as their place of origin it is during so called dog days of august when sirius is in conjunction with sun that their influence over mankind is at its apex by subtly influencing minds of men beings are said to be playing with our history as if it s a game affecting events in world history over course of centuries for three centuries after european discovery of new world this game plays out as desire for gold is used to transform spain into dominant power in europe only to be usurped by england in 17th century and later through technology by other nations les invisibles principal story begins in august 1804 with birth of a modified child called imaginos in american state of new hampshire because of astrological significance of place and time of his birth imaginos is of particular interest to les invisibles who begin investing him with superhuman abilities while he is young unaware of his true destiny or nature young imaginos finds out that he is apparently able to change his appearance at will and to see future imaginos as child becomes an adult he finds himself affected by wanderlust and billing himself as an adventurer sets out to explore texas and western frontier arriving in new orleans in 1829 it is there that he has a vision imploring him to travel to mexico in search of an artifact lost last and luminous scored to sky yet never found imaginos joins crew of a ship traveling to yucatan peninsula but while passing through gulf of mexico ship encounters a freak storm of which his visions failed to warn him del rio s song ship sinks with most of its crew and imaginos half dead washes ashore and is left for dead by other survivors as he lies dying on a shore where oyster beds seem plush as down imaginos is addressed by a symphony of voices who identify themselves as les invisibles imaginos true nature is revealed to him and he is informed that circumstances of his entire life have been manipulated to bring him to that specific moment in time having explained themselves to him they offer him a choice die as a human or live as their servant blue oyster cult imaginos accepts their offer and is resurrected from dead by blue oyster cult servants of les invisibles he is inducted into cult and given a new name desdinova eternal light he realizes that his descent and origin of his powers comes from stars where his masters live and becomes aware of his role in making of history astronomy thumb right 120px english mathematician john dee 1527 1608 another pawn of evil alien forces like imaginos imaginos desdinova becomes from this point on an instrument of les invisibles manipulation of human history for next sixty three years he insinuates himself into world of european

elizabethan england s rise as a superpower coincided with john dee s acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from mexico which serves as a bridge between les invisibles alien world and ours and means to spread their influence on earth some fans see les invisibles actions in favour of england against spain as a sort of vengeance for extermination by conquistadores of their worshippers in central america while others view their intervention as only part of mysterious scheme carried on by alien entities through centuries in presence of another world this revelation in mind imaginos decides that time has come to reattempt his aborted mission to mexico on august 1 1892 he sets sail aboard a charmed ship which despite storms on land and storms at sea delivers him faithfully to mexico after several months exploring jungles of yucatan he finds an undiscovered mayan pyramid following a long passage into interior of pyramid he discovers a chamber carved from solid jade in which he finds

revolution by night and imaginos albert bouchard began writing music for imaginos following release of band s first album in 1972 there were plans as early as 1975 to release a concept album dedicated to pearlman s scripts but material was not ready popoff p 135 albert bouchard all of songs had been written by 1977 with participation of various band members and at least four of them astronomy in presence of another world i am one you warned me of imaginos were completed and demoed during recording sessions for album spectres demos of other tracks were recorded by a bouchard and remained in various stages of development during following years with band uninterested in pursuing imaginos project that albert bouchard and sandy pearlman had been insistently proposing after a bouchard s 1981 dismissal from blue oyster cult he and pearlman worked on material having secured an advance from columbia records on strength of demos partially sung by eric bloom initial concept of a trilogy of double albums largely based on music written during band s many years of p 224 albert bouchard and on adapted and rewritten pearlman lyrics linked by imaginos storyline popoff p 225 albert bouchard is reflected in working titles act i imaginos act ii germany minus zero and counting also known as bombs over germany and half life time and act iii mutant reformation these were intended as albert bouchard solo albums a spin off of blue oyster cult main discography although some fan opinion holds that columbia records had intended all along that recordings would result in a new blue oyster cult album bouchard and pearlman set up recording of basic tracks for first album of trilogy in june 1982 with sound engineers corky stasiak and paul mandl at kingdom sound studios in long island new york and at boogie hotel popoff p 197 albert bouchard a studio owned by boogie rock band foghat and located in a large victorian mansion in port jefferson new york at same time and in same facilities blue

and guitar parts by aldo nova and late kevin carlson guitarist of aldo nova band should also be ascribed to these recording sessions according to bouchard jeff corky stasiak helen wheels glen bell peggy atkins and casper mccloud were among uncredited background vocalists which participated to these sessions allen lanier joe bouchard and donald roeser contributed instrumental parts and backing vocals to tracks as guests these remain lanier s and j bouchard s only contributions to imaginos columbia records complaints about albert bouchard s lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try outs of singers including jon rogers and joey cerisano whose performances on some songs were used for final mix of album in 1988 new recordings overdubs by other uncredited musicians and mixing lasted until 1984 musicians involved in this second phase of recording included future boc keyboard player tommy zvoncheck popoff p 211 joe bouchard who had already played with clarence clemons public image ltd and dream syndicate an almost finished product that comprised more than ninety minutes of music and whose thirteen tracks included re arranged versions of astronomy and subhuman retitled blue oyster cult gil blanco county ballad girl that love made blind and a couple of chorales was presented to columbia records executives in 1984 they rejected album and decided to shelve it officially because of albert bouchard s vocals and lack of commercial perspectives blue oyster cult album despite firm intention of sandy pearlman and albert bouchard to salvage project recordings remained unfinished and untouched for more than two years due to lack of funding while struggling with long complex and expensive production of blue oyster cult s album club ninja pearlman associated himself with daniel j levitin a r director of local punk label 415 records with whom he shared academic interests in neuroscience in 1986 pearlman leased studio c of san francisco s hyde street recording studios and dubbed it alpha omega studios pearlman and levitin produced various bands there and pearlman sub leased studio to other producers in september 1986 when poor sales of club ninja resulted in a commercial p 209 and group disbanded lack of new material from band for foreseeable future prompted pearlman to propose imaginos to columbia records as a new blue oyster cult album he obtained a small budget from record label to remix album and to add vocals of roeser and bloom singers of all hits produced by blue oyster cult with imaginos again a work in progress at end of 1986 band manager steve schenk contacted albert bouchard to get original recordings he still owned pearlman with help of engineers paul mandl and steve brown spent his time cleaning up re arranging and remixing original recordings using state of art technology and collaborations of studio musicians virtuoso guitarist joe satriani financed recording of his second album surfing with alien through his work on imaginos similarly thrash metal guitarist marc biedermann whose band blind illusion was recording at hyde street studios mixed album sane asylum at pearlman s studio in exchange for his collaboration biedermann declared in a 2008 interview that he played more lead guitar on that album than buck dharma roeser went to california in early 1987 to record his lead vocals and some guitar parts while tommy zvoncheck still a member of blue oyster cult re recorded most of keyboards on album last parts recorded were lead vocals by eric bloom who was in studio in early 1988 donald roeser later summed up his and bloom s late involvement in making of album by saying imaginos was our parting of ways that was something that eric and i agreed to do sort of out of respect for sandy and his effort that he made with imaginos popoff p 241 donald roeser as imagined album and as released album bear little relation to each other final version of imaginos is almost forty minutes shorter than first version of 1984 and has two fewer songs but as pearlman explained we ran out of money and couldn t do whole thing rhythm section of original recording was kept mostly intact but many guitars and most of keyboards and lead vocals were re recorded or remixed song order was scrambled out of fixed chronology possibly because of label executives intervention to have a more commercially attractive product sleeve notes definition of album as a random access myth where everything happens all at once appears to many as a posthumous justification for mixed up song order imaginos does not contain ballads or an immediately recognizable commercial single and its music is often considered heaviest produced by blue oyster cult best attempt by band to produce a heavy metal album popoff p 225 critics and fans point to elements of progressive rock also present in music which create a dark and ominous atmosphere that fits obscure content of song lyrics packaging thumb right 200px original photo of cliff house used for album cover artist greg scott who had supplied cover art for blue oyster cult albums fire of unknown origin extraterrestrial live and revolution by night worked with sandy pearlman for several months in 1984 to prepare paintings inspired by imaginos saga for gatefold cover of expected double album popoff p 230 greg scott and none of that was ever seen because it was shelved scott remarked in an interview with canadian journalist martin popoff art direction for 1988 release was instead put in hands of cbs records art director arnold levine and his staff they based cover art on a fin de siecle image of cliff house a restaurant perched on cliffs just north of ocean beach on western side of san francisco california built with architectural style of a victorian chateau and destroyed by fire in 1907 back cover is a maritime landscape modified to appear as continuation of picture on front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors inner sleeve besides credits and sandy pearlman s lengthy notes on imaginos story sports a large black and white photo by landscape british photographer simon marsden of castle in argyllshire scotland credits printed on sleeve of first release were largely incomplete and made no distinction between recording sessions of 1982 84 and those of 1987 88 apparently validating false assumption that original line up of blue oyster cult had reunited for making of album popoff p 229 aside from list of band members credits reported only some session musicians and other members of so called guitar orchestra of state of imaginos and omitted other personnel who had contributed to imaginos release imaginos was mastered at precision lacquer in los angeles by stephen marcussen and finally released as lp and cd on july 1988 almost eight years after work on it had begun and twenty three years after concept of imaginos was created a limited edition of album was also released in blue vinyl first single extracted from album was an edited version of astronomy which was released as a 7 as a 12 and as a cd single american author stephen king recorded spoken introduction to radio edit of song a reading of lines written on back cover of lp popoff p 240 12 contains various mixes of astronomy including one sung by albert bouchard single received sufficient radio airplay to reach no 12 in billboard hot mainstream rock tracks chart in september 1988 but it did not enter us singles chart cd single in presence of another world was issued later only for promotional purposes but received no attention from fm radio stations album was largely neglected by record label which did little to no promotion in us popoff p 241 pearlman stated that there was actually no intention on part of columbia records at all to promote it basically people wanted to work it and they were told not to work it roeser commented later that he did not think sony s ever really known how to sell us from beginning and columbia never felt that they knew how to market us popoff p 252 donald roeser imaginos fared better with cbs international which distributed album abroad and produced a music video for astronomy in uk which aired in coincidence with european tour dates of 1989 popoff p 242 eric bloom video clip does not feature members of band but begins with spoken introduction by stephen king and focuses on storyline narrated in album albert bouchard had been completely excluded from retooling of album for contractual reasons but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co producer and to be paid accordingly after disbandment of blue oyster cult he contacted other band members in an attempt to organize a 1987 reunion tour with original line up to promote imaginos his economic and membership requests were both rejected due to resistances within label and within band so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against management of blue oyster cult and columbia records to receive payment for his work lawsuit was settled out of court but his resentment towards sandy pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased eliminating any chance of future collaborations for completion of imaginos saga one of final mixes of 1984 titled albert bouchard s imaginos surfaced on internet in 2003 as a free download album contains music recorded during sessions from 1982 to 1984 and permits a comparison of arrangements vocals and sound with version published in 1988 imaginos was re issued only once through sony bmg sub label american beat records in december 2007 2007 reissue was remastered to adjust volume levels and included a cd sleeve with corrected but not complete credits a new remastered version of imaginos is included in columbia albums collection boxed set issued by sony legacy in november 2012 tour blue oyster cult interrupted their schedule of us shows only just before album release in june 1988 to familiarize band members with new material 1987 formation with bloom roeser lanier rogers and riddle remained closest available to a full reunion given j bouchard s unwillingness to participate and opposition to a bouchard imaginos tour began in east coast of us in july and continued on to most of states set lists were based mainly on old material and included only two or three songs from imaginos usually i am one you warned me of in presence of another world and new version of astronomy blue oyster cult visited canada in january 1989 france in february united kingdom in march and concluded their european tour in germany in april during following us tour new management of columbia records which had been sold to sony music in 1988 terminated columbia s almost 20 year relationship with blue oyster cult because of their low sales this left them without a recording contract for next ten years eric bloom stated that in general cbs was straight with us when we had fans working inside company but after 3 4 different presidents of company came and went commercial appeal of blue oyster cult had disappeared for new management a review of their performance at ritz in new york on january 6 1989 highlights good shape and musicianship of band but remarks that new songs were played with considerably less enthusiasm than rest of show although band continued to tour regularly songs from imaginos had already disappeared from their shows by end of 1989 never to be performed live again critical and commercial reception imaginos received mixed reviews both from professional critics and fans david fricke in his review for magazine rolling stone considers imaginos best black plastic blitz to bear cult s trademark cross and claw since 1974 s secret treaties but remarks that lengthy gestation of album and many musicians involved makes it a bit of a cheat for cult purists and that is only an illusionary re creation of way boc used to be william ruhlmann of allmusic wrote that imaginos is album that comes closest to defining blue oyster cult and their creative swan song and perhaps boc s most consistent album certainly its most uncompromising and also closest thing to a real heavy metal statement from a band that never quite fit that description for don kaye of kerrang album is best boc slab since erectus and harks back in style and attitude towards brilliance of masterpieces like secret treaties and spectres a contrary evaluation comes from blue oyster cult biographer martin popoff who has come to dismiss it as somewhat of a sell out despite it being band s heaviest fulfilling many a fan s wish for sustained metal popoff finds whole thing perched on edge of parody too dressy and fantastical lyrically in a painfully self conscious way a laborious exercise in expected weird ultimately a baffling yet anticlimactic punctuation to band s perplexed career a reviewer from italian music criticism site storia della musica points out that album is now a cult item for its rarity its content and scarce love shown by band for this work he writes that it could have been tommy or dark side of moon of boc but despite profound influences it evokes its mutilated and sabotaged form and disinterest of musicians involved makes imaginos only a wasted opportunity reviews posted by blue oyster cult s fans and by buyers of album on customer review site and on online collaborative metadata database rate your music are in general quite positive praising imaginos as a creative masterpiece but underlining that work is not a group effort but brain child of original drummer albert bouchard and longtime producer and lyricist sandy pearlman a professional italian reviewer describes blue oyster cult name on cover as only a commercial decoy for an albert bouchard solo album album entered billboard 200 album chart on august 19 1988 peaked at no 122 and exited charts on october 8 it sold about 50 000 copies in us and was a commercial failure for columbia records and a financial failure for band which was forced through legal action to pay back money used for both recording of albert bouchard s solo album and for re recording of imaginos influence manga battle angel alita by yukito kishiro contains references to imaginos
