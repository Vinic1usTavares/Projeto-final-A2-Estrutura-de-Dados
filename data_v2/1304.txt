silver is a chemical element with symbol ag from latin derived from proto indo european h2erg shiny or white and atomic number 47 a soft white lustrous transition metal it exhibits highest electrical conductivity thermal conductivity and reflectivity of any metal metal is found in earth s crust in pure free elemental form native silver as an alloy with gold and other metals and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper gold lead and zinc refining silver has long been valued as a precious metal silver metal is used in many bullion coins sometimes alongside gold while it is more abundant than gold it is much less abundant as a native metal its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis a 94 pure alloy is described as 0 940 fine as one of seven metals of antiquity silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures other than in currency and as an investment medium coins and bullion silver is used in solar panels water filtration jewellery ornaments high value tableware and utensils hence term silverware in electrical contacts and conductors in specialized mirrors window coatings in catalysis of chemical reactions as a colorant in stained glass and in specialised confectionery its compounds are used in photographic and x ray film dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and oligodynamic effect added to bandages and wound dressings catheters and other medical instruments characteristics thumb left upright silver is extremely ductile and can be drawn into a wire one atom wide silver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of periodic table copper and gold its 47 electrons are arranged in configuration kr similarly to copper ar and gold xe group 11 is one of few groups in d block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations this distinctive electron configuration with a single electron in highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell accounts for many of singular properties of metallic silver silver is an extremely soft ductile and malleable transition metal though it is slightly less malleable than gold silver crystallizes in a face centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12 where only single 5s electron is delocalized similarly to copper and gold greenwood and earnshaw p 1178 unlike metals with incomplete d shells metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak this observation explains low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver silver has a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high polish and which is so characteristic that name of metal itself has become a colour name greenwood and earnshaw p 1177 unlike copper and gold energy required to excite an electron from filled d band to s p conduction band in silver is large enough around 385 kj mol that it no longer corresponds to absorption in visible region of spectrum but rather in ultraviolet hence silver is not a coloured metal protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than 450 nm at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm silver s reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310 nm very high electrical and thermal conductivity is common to elements in group 11 because their single s electron is free and does not interact with filled d subshell as such interactions which occur in preceding transition metals lower electron mobility russell am lee kl 2005 https books google com books id gc printsec frontcover structure property relations in nonferrous metals wiley new york p 302 electrical conductivity of silver is greatest of all metals greater even than copper but it is not widely used for this property because of higher cost an exception is in radio frequency engineering particularly at vhf and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those currents tend to flow on surface of conductors rather than through interior during world war ii in us tons of silver were used in electromagnets for enriching uranium mainly because of wartime shortage of copper pure silver has highest thermal conductivity of any metal although conductivity of carbon in diamond allotrope and superfluid helium 4 are even higher silver also has lowest contact resistance of any metal silver readily forms alloys with copper and gold as well as zinc zinc silver alloys with low zinc concentration may be considered as face centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver as structure of silver is largely unchanged while electron concentration rises as more zinc is added increasing electron concentration further leads to body centred cubic electron concentration 1 5 complex cubic 1 615 and hexagonal close packed phases 1 75 isotopes naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes 107ag and with 107ag being slightly more abundant 51 839 natural abundance this almost equal abundance is rare in periodic table atomic weight is 107 2 u this value is very important because of importance of silver compounds particularly halides in gravimetric analysis both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via s process slow neutron capture as well as in supernovas via r process rapid neutron capture twenty eight radioisotopes have been characterized most stable being with a half life of 41 29 days with a half life of 7 45 days and with a half life of 3 13 hours silver has numerous nuclear isomers most stable being t1 2 418 years t1 2 249 79 days and t1 2 8 28 days all of remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than an hour and majority of these have half lives of less than three minutes isotopes of silver range in relative atomic mass from 92 950 u to 129 950 u primary decay mode before most abundant stable isotope 107ag is electron capture and primary mode after is beta decay primary decay products before 107ag are palladium element 46 isotopes and primary products after are cadmium element 48 isotopes palladium isotope 107pd decays by beta emission to 107ag with a half life of 6 5 million years iron meteorites are only objects with a high enough palladium to silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107ag

of 5s orbital but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold showing stability of 4d orbitals so that chemistry of silver is predominantly that of 1 oxidation state reflecting increasingly limited range of oxidation states along transition series as d orbitals fill and stabilize greenwood and earnshaw p 1180 unlike copper for which larger hydration energy of as compared to cu is reason why former is more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking stable filled d subshell of latter with silver this effect is swamped by its larger second ionisation energy hence ag is stable species in aqueous solution and solids with ag2 being much less stable as it oxidizes water most silver compounds have significant covalent character due to small size and high first ionization energy 730 8 kj mol of silver furthermore silver s pauling electronegativity of 1 93 is higher than that of lead 1 87 and its electron affinity of 125 6 kj mol is much higher

stable even in absence of p acceptor ligands silver does not react with air even at red heat and thus was considered by alchemists as a noble metal along with gold its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper which forms copper i oxide when heated in air to red heat and gold like copper silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds in their presence silver tarnishes in air to form black silver sulfide copper forms green sulfate instead while gold does not react unlike copper silver will not react with halogens with exception of fluorine gas with which it forms difluoride while silver is not attacked by non oxidizing acids metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid in presence of air and especially in presence of hydrogen peroxide silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide greenwood and earnshaw p 1179 three main forms of deterioration in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing formation of silver chloride due to long term immersion in salt water as well as reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen fresh silver chloride is pale yellow becoming purplish on exposure to light it projects slightly from surface of artifact or coin precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys silver artifacts in corrosion artifacts resource center silver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as potassium permanganate and potassium dichromate and in presence of potassium bromide these compounds are used in photography to bleach silver images converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with thiosulfate or redeveloped to intensify original image silver forms cyanide complexes silver cyanide that are soluble in water in presence of an excess of cyanide ions silver cyanide solutions are used in electroplating of silver common oxidation states of silver are in order of commonness 1 most stable state for example silver nitrate agno3 2 highly oxidising for example silver ii fluoride agf2 and even very rarely 3 extreme oxidising for example potassium iii 1 state is by far most common followed by easily reducible 2 state 3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate and some silver iii compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass greenwood and earnshaw p 1188 indeed silver iii fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with strongest known oxidizing agent krypton difluoride greenwood and earnshaw p 903 compounds oxides and chalcogenides thumb right silver i sulfide silver and gold have rather low chemical affinities for oxygen lower than copper and it is therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable soluble silver i salts precipitate dark brown silver i oxide upon addition of alkali hydroxide exists only in solution otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to oxide silver i oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160 degc greenwood and earnshaw pp 1181 82 this and other silver i compounds may be oxidized by strong oxidizing agent peroxodisulfate to black ago a mixed silver i iii oxide of formula some other mixed oxides with silver in non integral oxidation states namely and are also known as is which behaves as a metallic conductor silver i sulfide ag2s is very readily formed from its constituent elements and is cause of black tarnish on some old silver objects it may also be formed from reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous ag ions many non stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known in particular 3 is a low temperature superconductor halides thumb right three common silver halide precipitates from left to right silver iodide silver bromide and silver chloride only known of silver is difluoride agf2 which can be obtained from elements under heat a strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent silver ii fluoride is often used to synthesize greenwood and earnshaw pp 1183 85 in stark contrast to this all four silver i halides are known fluoride chloride and bromide have sodium chloride structure but iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures that at room temperature is cubic zinc blende structure they can all be obtained by direct reaction of their respective elements as halogen group is descended silver halide gains more and more covalent character solubility decreases and color changes from white chloride to yellow iodide as energy required for ligand metal charge transfer x ag xag decreases fluoride is anomalous as fluoride ion is so small that it has a considerable energy and hence is highly water soluble and forms di and other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods all four are photosensitive though monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light especially bromide and iodide which to silver metal and thus were used in traditional photography reaction involved is greenwood and earnshaw pp 1185 87 x hn x e excitation of halide ion which gives up its extra electron into conduction band ag e ag liberation of a silver ion which gains an electron to become a silver atom process is not reversible because silver atom liberated is typically found at a crystal defect or an impurity site so that electron s energy is lowered enough that it is trapped other inorganic compounds thumb left upright 0 45 crystals of silver nitrate white silver nitrate agno3 is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds especially halides and is much less sensitive to light it was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by ancient alchemists who believed that silver was associated with moon it is often used for gravimetric analysis exploiting insolubility of heavier silver halides which it is a common precursor to silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis e g for deprotection and oxidations ag binds alkenes reversibly and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release free alkene yellow silver carbonate ag2co3 can be easily prepared by reacting aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate with a deficiency of silver nitrate its principal use is for production of silver powder for use in microelectronics it is reduced with formaldehyde producing

carbonate is also used as a reagent in organic synthesis such as knorr reaction in oxidation silver carbonate on acts as an oxidising agent to form lactones from diols it is also employed to convert alkyl bromides into alcohols silver fulminate a powerful touch sensitive explosive used in percussion caps is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in presence of ethanol other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide and silver acetylide formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution in its most characteristic reaction silver azide decomposes explosively releasing nitrogen gas given photosensitivity of silver salts this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals 2 s 3 g 2 ag s coordination compounds thumb right structure of i complex ag nh3 2 silver complexes tend to be similar to those of its lighter homologue copper silver iii complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to more stable lower oxidation states though they are slightly more stable than those of copper iii for instance square planar ag 2 5 and ag oh 2 2 5 complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver i with alkaline peroxodisulfate yellow diamagnetic agf4 is much less stable fuming in moist air and reacting with glass silver ii complexes are more common like valence isoelectronic copper ii complexes they are usually square planar and paramagnetic which is increased by greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons aqueous ag2 produced by oxidation of ag by ozone is a very strong oxidising agent even in acidic solutions it is stabilized in phosphoric acid due to complex formation peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines such as ag py 4 2 and ag 2 2 these are stable provided cannot reduce silver back to 1 oxidation state agf4 2 is also known in its violet barium salt as are some silver ii complexes with n or o donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates greenwood and earnshaw p 1189 by far most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is 1 ag cation is diamagnetic like its homologues cu and au as all three have closed shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons its complexes are colourless provided ligands are not too easily polarized such as i ag forms salts with most anions but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water exceptions are nitrate perchlorate and fluoride tetrahedral aqueous ion ag h2o 4 is known but characteristic geometry for ag cation is 2 coordinate linear for example silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form ag nh3 2 silver salts are dissolved in photography due to formation of thiosulfate complex ag 2 3 and cyanide extraction for silver and gold works by formation of complex ag cn 2 silver cyanide forms linear polymer ag cn ag cn silver thiocyanate has a similar structure but forms a zigzag instead because of sp3 hybridized sulfur atom chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver i complexes with them tend to form polymers a few exceptions exist such as near tetrahedral and complexes ag l l 2 greenwood and earnshaw pp 1195 96 organometallic under standard conditions silver does not form simple carbonyls due to weakness of ag c bond a few are known at very low temperatures around 6 15 k such as green planar paramagnetic ag co 3 which at 25 30 k probably by forming ag ag bonds additionally silver carbonyl ag co b 4 is known polymeric complexes with alkenes and alkynes are known but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of platinum complexes though they are formed more readily than those of analogous gold complexes they are also quite unsymmetrical showing weak p bonding in group 11 ag c s bonds may also be formed by silver i like copper i and gold i but simple alkyls and aryls of silver i are even less stable than those of copper i which tend to explode under ambient conditions for example poor thermal stability is reflected in relative decomposition temperatures of 50 degc and 15 degc as well as those of 74 degc and 100 degc greenwood and earnshaw pp 1199 200 c ag bond is stabilized by ligands for example in 2 compounds are also more stable than their counterparts silver nhc

poorly miscible elements in groups 10 14 except boron and carbon have very complex ag m phase diagrams and form most commercially important alloys and remaining elements on periodic table have no consistency in their ag m phase diagrams by far most important such alloys are those with copper most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver copper alloy and eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids their importance in industry comes from fact that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than eutectic mixture 71 9 silver and 28 1 copper by weight and 60 1 silver and 28 1 copper by atom

are usually silver tin mercury alloys silver copper gold alloys are very important in jewellery usually on gold rich side and have a vast range of and colours silver copper zinc alloys are useful as low melting brazing alloys and silver cadmium indium involving three adjacent elements on periodic table is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross section good conduction of heat mechanical stability and resistance to corrosion in hot water etymology word silver appears in anglo saxon in various spellings such as and a similar form is seen throughout germanic languages compare old high german and chemical symbol ag is from latin word for silver compare ancient greek argyros from proto indo european root h2erg formerly reconstructed as arg meaning white or shining this was usual proto indo european word for metal whose reflexes are missing in germanic and balto slavic balto slavic words for silver are quite similar to germanic ones e g russian serebro serebro polish lithuanian and they may have a common origin although this is uncertain some scholars have suggested akkadian refined silver as this origin related to word to refine or smelt history thumb silver plate from 4th century silver was one of seven metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose discovery is thus lost to history weeks p 4 in particular three metals of group 11 copper silver and gold occur in elemental form in nature and were probably used as first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering greenwood and earnshaw pp 1173 74 however unlike copper silver did not lead to growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength and was more often used ornamentally or as money since silver is more reactive than gold supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold for example silver was more expensive than gold in egypt until around fifteenth century bc weeks pp 14 19 egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating metals with salt and then reducing silver chloride produced to metal situation changed with discovery of cupellation a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores while slag heaps found in asia minor and on islands of aegean sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as 4th millennium bc and one of earliest silver extraction centres in europe was sardinia in early chalcolithic period these techniques did not spread widely until later when it spread throughout region and beyond origins of silver production in india china and japan were almost certainly equally ancient but are not well documented due to their great age thumb upright silver mining and processing in kutna hora bohemia 1490s when phoenicians first came to what is now spain they obtained so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead by time of greek and roman civilizations silver coins were a staple of economy greeks were already extracting silver from galena by 7th century bc and rise of athens was partly made possible by nearby silver mines at from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300 bc stability of roman currency relied to a high degree on supply of silver bullion mostly from spain which roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before discovery of new world reaching a peak production of 200 tonnes per year an estimated silver stock of 10000 tonnes circulated in roman economy in middle of second century ad five to ten times larger than combined amount of silver available to medieval europe and abbasid caliphate around ad 800 romans also recorded extraction of silver in central and northern europe in same time period this production came to a nearly complete halt with fall of roman empire not to resume until time of charlemagne by then tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted ullmann pp 16 19 central europe became centre of silver production during middle ages as mediterranean deposits exploited by ancient civilisations had been exhausted silver mines were opened in bohemia saxony alsace lahn region silesia hungary norway steiermark salzburg and southern black forest most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from remaining rock and then smelted some deposits of native silver were also encountered many of these mines were soon exhausted but a few of them remained active until industrial revolution before which world production of silver was around a meagre 50 tonnes per year in americas high temperature silver lead cupellation technology was developed by pre inca civilizations as early as ad 60 120 silver deposits in india china japan and pre columbian america continued to be mined during this time with discovery of america and plundering of silver by spanish conquistadors central and south america became dominant producers of silver until around beginning of 18th century particularly peru bolivia chile and argentina last of these countries later took its name from that of metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth silver trade gave way to a global network of exchange as one historian put it silver went round world and made world go round much of this silver ended up in hands of chinese a portuguese merchant in 1621 noted that silver wanders throughout all world before flocking to china where it remains as if at its natural center still much of it went to spain allowing spanish rulers to pursue military and political ambitions in both europe and americas new world mines concluded several historians supported spanish empire in 19th century primary production of silver moved to north america particularly canada mexico and nevada in united states some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in europe and deposits in siberia and russian far east as well as in australia were mined poland emerged as an important producer during 1970s after discovery of copper deposits that were rich in silver before centre of production returned to americas following decade today peru and mexico are still among primary silver producers but distribution of silver production around world is quite balanced and about one fifth of silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production symbolic role thumb upright 16th century fresco painting of judas being paid thirty pieces of silver for his betrayal of jesus silver plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore greek poet hesiod s works and days lines 109 201 lists different ages of man named after metals like gold silver bronze and iron to

figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results as in widely discussed software engineering paper no silver bullet other powers attributed to silver include detection of poison and facilitation of passage into mythical realm of fairies silver production has also inspired figurative language clear references to cupellation occur throughout

purified out for example in copper production purified copper is electrolytically deposited on cathode while less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under anode as so called anode slime this is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute sulfuric acid and heating with lime or silica flux before silver is purified to over 99 9 purity via

fact most silverware is only silver plated rather than made out of pure silver silver is normally put in place by electroplating silver plated glass as opposed to metal is used for mirrors vacuum flasks and christmas tree decorations because pure silver is very soft most silver used for these purposes is alloyed with copper with of 925 1000 835 1000 and 800 1000 being common one drawback is easy tarnishing of silver in presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives including precious metals such as palladium platinum and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly base metals like zinc cadmium silicon and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect lustre and colour of alloy electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing usual solutions for restoring lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce silver sulfide surface to metallic silver and cleaning off layer of tarnish with a paste latter approach also has welcome side effect of polishing silver concurrently a simple chemical approach to removal of sulfide tarnish is to bring silver items into contact with aluminium foil whilst immersed in water containing a conducting salt such as sodium chloride medicine in medicine silver is incorporated into wound dressings and used as an antibiotic coating in medical devices wound

devices circuits and their components for example silver is used in high quality connectors for rf vhf and higher frequencies particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6 printed circuits and rfid antennas are made with silver paints powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes ceramic capacitors and other ceramic components ullmann pp 71 78 brazing alloys silver containing brazing alloys are used for brazing metallic materials mostly cobalt nickel and copper based alloys tool steels and precious metals basic components are silver and copper with other elements selected according to specific application desired examples include zinc tin cadmium palladium manganese and phosphorus silver provides increased and corrosion resistance during usage ullmann pp 78 81 chemical equipment silver is useful in manufacture of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity high thermal conductivity and being easily workable silver crucibles alloyed with 0 15 nickel to avoid of metal at red heat are used for carrying out alkaline fusion copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver plated silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment ullmann pp 81 82 catalysis silver metal is a good catalyst for oxidation reactions in fact it is somewhat too good for most purposes as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water and hence coarser grained silver tends to be used instead for instance 15 silver supported on a al2o3 or silicates is a catalyst for oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230 270 degc dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600 720 degc over silver gauze or crystals as catalyst as is dehydrogenation of to acetone in gas phase glycol yields and ethanol yields acetaldehyde while organic amines are dehydrated to photography photosensitivity of silver halides allowed for their use in traditional photography although digital photography which does not use silver is now dominant photosensitive emulsion used in black and white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity developing and tuning colour photography requires addition of special dye components and so that initial black and white silver image couples with a different dye component original silver images are bleached off and silver is then recovered and recycled silver nitrate is starting material in all cases ullmann p 82 use of silver nitrate and silver halides in photography has rapidly declined with advent of digital technology from peak global demand for photographic silver in 1999 267 000 000 troy ounces or 8304 6 metric tonnes market contracted almost 70 by 2013 nanoparticles nanosilver particles between 10 and 100 nanometres in size are used in many applications they are used in conductive inks for printed electronics and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of size they are also used medicinally in and antifungals in much same way as larger silver particles in addition according to european union observatory for nanomaterials silver nanoparticles are used both in pigments as well as cosmetics miscellanea thumb a tray of south asian sweets with some pieces covered with shiny silver vark pure silver metal is used as a food colouring it has designation and is approved in european union traditional pakistani and indian dishes sometimes include decorative silver foil known as vark and in various other cultures silver are used to decorate cakes cookies and other dessert items lenses include silver halides so that ultraviolet light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver darkening lenses silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities colourless silver chloride films are used in radiation detectors zeolite incorporating ag ions are used to seawater during rescues using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation but application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools while it has advantage of not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain ullmann pp 83 84 precautions silver compounds have low toxicity compared to those of most other heavy metals as they are poorly absorbed by human body when digested and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein however silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage resulting in gastroenteritis diarrhoea falling blood pressure cramps paralysis and respiratory arrest animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia slowed growth necrosis of liver and fatty degeneration of liver and kidneys rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning ullmann pp 88 91 some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts and those of other precious metals in most situations however silver does not pose serious environmental hazards in large doses silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues leading to argyria which results in a blue grayish pigmentation of skin eyes and mucous membranes argyria is rare and so far as is known does not otherwise harm a person s health though it is disfiguring and usually permanent mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis metallic silver like copper is an antibacterial agent which was known to ancients and first scientifically investigated and named oligodynamic effect by carl nageli silver ions damage metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0 01 0 1 milligrams per litre metallic silver has a similar effect due to formation of silver oxide this effect is lost in presence of sulfur due to extreme insolubility of silver sulfide some silver compounds are very explosive such as nitrogen compounds silver azide silver amide and silver fulminate as well as silver acetylide silver oxalate and silver ii oxide they can explode on heating force drying illumination or sometimes spontaneously to avoid formation of such compounds ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised such as organic compounds sulfur and soot see also silver coin silver medal free silver list of
