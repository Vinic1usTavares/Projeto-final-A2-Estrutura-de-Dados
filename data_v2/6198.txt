coastline bolivia still has a navy which was founded in 1963 and bolivians annually celebrate day of sea bolivian president evo morales made bolivia s access to ocean a key issue for his administration he also used it to bolster his reelection efforts when pope francis visited bolivia in 2015 he called for dialogue between two nations saying dialogue is indispensable instead of raising walls we need to be building bridges case and arguments in 2013 bolivia suspended ongoing negotiations and brought a petition against chile before international court of justice icj in petition bolivia asked that icj find that chile was obligated to negotiate with bolivia towards granting bolivia sovereign access to sea in 2014 chile raised preliminary objections to court s jurisdiction citing article vi of pact of bogota which prohibited icj proceedings on matters agreed upon prior to its agreement in 1948 chile argued that 1904 treaty of peace and friendship settled all issues regarding border and that while bolivia had a right to non sovereign access through chilean territory it had no right to sovereign access bolivia contended that issue was an obligation independent of treaty chile countered that issue was one of territorial sovereignty according to zach kleiman ruling on preliminary objection would be determined by definition of case s subject matter on 24 september 2015 court found that it did have jurisdiction to hear case rejecting chile s preliminary objection and finding that case was in respect of an obligation separate from treaty of peace and friendship court also reframed complaint limiting it solely to an obligation to negotiate without specifying goal judge gaja voted against majority opinion s findings and in a separate declaration proposed that matters that had been settled could become unsettled through subsequent conduct obligation to negotiate access to pacific ocean bolivia v chile preliminary objection judgment i c j reports 2015 p 592 obligation to negotiate access to pacific ocean bolivia v chile preliminary objection declaration of judge gaja he stated that a determination on this issue would not be appropriate at preliminary stage bolivia argued that both nations were obligated to negotiate by their prior statements basing parts of its argument on icj precedents including aegean sea continental shelf greece v turkey and case concerning maritime delimitation and territorial questions between qatar and bahrain qatar v bahrain bolivia also argued that it had a right to coastal access because of harmful economic effects of being landlocked zach kleiman says that trade to and from bolivia is much slower and more expensive than equivalent trade in chile and logistical costs are 31 higher than average in region he also observed that in previous cases such as temple of preah cambodia v thailand and nuclear tests case new zealand v france court found that obligations were created through unilateral conduct of officials outcome and results on sunday preceding decision catholic bishops in both countries asked congregants to accept court s decision in expectation of decision bolivians gathered in public spaces across country to watch decision be read out on large screens erected for this purpose on 1 october 2018 a twelve judge majority ruled that chile did not have an obligation to negotiate with bolivia towards an access to pacific ocean rejecting bolivia s complaint and all eight of its arguments however court did not rule on which nation rightfully controlled disputed territory court found that in none of statements or actions of either country did two countries show an intent to be legally bound alonso suggests that court ruled against bolivia to avoid possible precedent it would set if passage of time in longstanding stalemated disputes can change way in which certain traditional terms are read he further suggested that bolivia could also have brought complaints about chile s violations of treaty of peace and friendship which it has previously raised at latin american integration association and raised possibility of bolivia negotiating with peru which has previously agreed to treaties expanding bolivia s rights to trade at peruvian coast while court ruled against bolivia yusuf president of court said that ruling should not be understood as precluding parties from continuing their dialogue and exchanges in a spirit of good neighborliness to address issues relating to landlocked situation of bolivia solution to which they have both recognized to be a matter of mutual interest evo morales interpreted this as a call to continue with dialogue and promised that bolivia will never give up its pursuit of access to pacific ocean in response to decision sebastian pinera president of chile said that morales made us waste five years which could have been spent building a healthy relationship between two countries he also praised court s decision saying court has done justice and has put things in their place establishing clearly and categorically that chile has never had any obligation to negotiate an exit to sea after decision morales continued efforts to begin negotiations with chile however bolivia also plans to decrease its dependence on chilean ports by transitioning trade to peruvian ports references category 2018 in case law category
