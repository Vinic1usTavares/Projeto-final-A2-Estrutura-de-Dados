as water falls over them they remember happier memories they had together at beginning of their relationship which has now become strained due to their experiences and feelings during time spent apart cast production development drake doremus was inspired to make like crazy by end of his eight year long distance relationship with desiree who lived in london while doremus lived in los angeles many elements of film resemble their real life relationship such as frequent travelling between los angeles and london trouble with american immigration laws a brief marriage a trip to santa catalina island where jacob takes anna in early stages of their relationship and gift of a bracelet in film a bracelet is given to anna by jacob story was co written by ben york jones who had also been involved in long distance relationships together they assembled a 50 page outline of film which read more like a short story than a traditional screenplay outline included backstory plot points specific scene objectives themes and emotional moments but had minimal dialogue anton yelchin was doremus s first choice to play jacob based on yelchin s previous work and was cast almost immediately after meeting doremus to discuss role after auditioning a number of actresses from los angeles and london to play anna doremus talked to english actress felicity jones over phone and asked her to tape rough versions of two scenes from film he was so impressed with her rendition of film s final scene in which anna and jacob stand silently in a shower that he decided to cast her after jones arrived in los angeles she and yelchin began an intensive week long rehearsal before filming began yelchin and jones met in a mexican restaurant to get to know one another and during week prior to shooting spent all day and often all night discussing anna and jacob s relationship with each other and doremus filming like crazy was filmed over four weeks first three in los angeles and last in london production budget was 250 000 which included cost of airfares for cast and crew film was shot on a canon eos 7d still camera with cinema lenses mounted on a rig constructed by cinematographer john guleserian he chose 7d for its portability and ease it provided for shooting improvised scenes where he found other cameras too cumbersome guleserian said that many of film s scenes were shot really far away from our characters followed by really tight close ups due to technological limitations of camera but he noted that this added to tone of film only a small number of crew members were employed to maintain sense of intimacy that doremus wanted on set at its largest crew consisted of around 20 people while some scenes were shot with as few as three crew members such as a scene on a santa monica beach where only doremus guleserian and a boom operator were present in addition to actors doremus would often ask members of crew to leave when filming intimate scenes between jones and yelchin so that two actors would feel more comfortable these scenes would be shot in improvised takes of up to 30 minutes in length with doremus providing only occasional direction film s dialogue was almost entirely improvised by actors whose lines doremus believed would come about by virtue of being fully involved in character and moment music film s original score was composed by pianist dustin o halloran other music used in film included songs by paul simon m83 stars mary and figurine doremus listened to several of these artists as he developed story he said that their songs became fabric of film he assembled a similar set of songs on a cd which he gave to cast and crew to listen to throughout production an official soundtrack titled like crazy music from motion picture was released on

somewhat unrealistic indiewire s eric kohn gave film a b grade and felt that while plot developed slowly yelchin and jones shared an indelible and entirely realistic chemistry variety film critic andrew barker who described film as an exquisite beautifully acted gem gave particular praise to film s dexterous editing given that it contains nary an extraneous detail while still managing to luxuriate in tender and awkward silences of young love a negative review of film came from manohla dargis of new york times who found it a conventional wan affair despite its art cinema flourishes and thought that anna s decision to overstay her visa was a contrived plot point that conflicted with doremus s attempt at creating realism globe and mail rick groen also found like crazy unrealistic
