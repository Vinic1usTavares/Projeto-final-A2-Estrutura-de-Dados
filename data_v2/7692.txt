asthma is a common long term inflammatory disease of airways of lungs it is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms reversible airflow obstruction and easily triggered symptoms include episodes of wheezing coughing chest tightness and shortness of breath these may occur a few times a day or a few times per week depending on person asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers diagnosis is usually based on pattern of symptoms response to therapy over time and spirometry lung function testing asthma is classified according to frequency of symptoms forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 and peak expiratory flow rate it may also be classified as atopic or non atopic where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction there is no cure for asthma symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers such as allergens and irritants and by use of inhaled corticosteroids long acting beta agonists laba or agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short acting beta 2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth in very severe cases intravenous corticosteroids magnesium sulfate and hospitalization may be required in 2015 358 million people globally had asthma up from 183 million in 1990 it caused about 397 100 deaths in 2015 most of which occurred in developing world asthma often begins in childhood and rates have increased significantly since 1960s asthma was recognized as early as ancient egypt word asthma is from greek asthma which means panting signs and symptoms asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing shortness of breath chest tightness and coughing sputum may be produced from lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up during recovery from an asthma attack exacerbation it may appear pus like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils symptoms are usually worse at night and in early morning or in response to exercise or cold air some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms usually in response to triggers whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms associated conditions a number of other health conditions occur more frequently in people with asthma including gastro esophageal reflux disease gerd and obstructive sleep apnea psychological disorders are also more common with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16 52 and mood disorders in 14 41 it is not known whether asthma causes psychological problems or psychological problems lead to asthma those with asthma especially if it is poorly controlled are at increased risk for radiocontrast reactions causes asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions these influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment it is believed that recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics heritable factors other than those related to dna sequence and a changing living environment asthma that starts before age of 12 years old is more likely due to genetic influence while onset after age 12 is more likely due to environmental influence environmental many environmental factors have been associated with asthma s development and exacerbation including allergens air pollution and other environmental chemicals smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma like symptoms low air quality from environmental factors such as traffic pollution or high ozone levels has been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity over half of cases in children in united states occur in areas when air quality is below epa standards low air quality is more common in low income and minority communities exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma formaldehyde exposure for example has a positive association in certain types of pvc are associated with asthma in both children and adults while exposure to pesticides is linked to development of asthma a cause and effect relationship has yet to be established majority of evidence does not support a causal role between acetaminophen paracetamol or antibiotic use and asthma a 2014 systematic review found that association between acetaminophen use and asthma disappeared when respiratory infections were taken into account acetaminophen use by a mother during pregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of child developing asthma maternal psychological stress during pregnancy is a risk factor for child to develop asthma asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens common indoor allergens include dust mites cockroaches animal dander fragments of fur or feathers and mold efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective on symptoms in sensitized subjects weak evidence suggests that efforts to decrease mold by repairing buildings may help improve asthma symptoms in adults certain viral respiratory infections such as respiratory virus and rhinovirus may increase risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children certain other infections however may decrease risk hygiene hypothesis hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure during childhood to non pathogenic bacteria and viruses it has been proposed that reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due in part to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent development of asthma but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction evidence supporting hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to development of asthma also delivery via caesarean section is associated with an increased risk estimated at 20 80 of asthma this increased risk is attributed to lack of healthy bacterial colonization that newborn would have acquired from passage through birth canal there is a link between asthma and degree of affluence which may be related to hygiene hypothesis as less affluent individuals often have more exposure to bacteria and viruses genetic cd14 endotoxin interaction based on cd14 snp c endotoxin levels cc genotype tt genotype high exposure low risk high risk low risk low risk family history is a risk factor for asthma with many different genes being implicated if one identical twin is affected probability of other having disease is approximately 25 by end of 2005 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations including 4 and among others many of these genes are related to immune system or modulating inflammation even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies results have not been consistent among all populations tested in 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone more continue to be found some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures an example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in cd14 region and exposure to endotoxin a bacterial product endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke dogs and farms risk for asthma then is determined by both a person s genetics and level of endotoxin exposure medical conditions a triad of atopic eczema allergic rhinitis and asthma is called atopy strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever asthma has been associated with eosinophilic with formerly known as strauss syndrome an autoimmune disease and individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma there is a correlation between obesity and risk of asthma with both having increased in recent years several factors may be at play including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of fat and fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro inflammatory state beta blocker medications such as propranolol can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible beta blockers however appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aspirin and nsaids use of acid suppressing medication proton pump inhibitors and h2 blockers during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in child exacerbation some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma different individuals react to various factors in different ways most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust animal dander especially cat and dog hair cockroach allergens and mold perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children both viral and bacterial infections of upper respiratory tract can worsen disease psychological stress may worsen symptoms it is thought that stress alters immune system and thus increases airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants asthma exacerbations in school aged children peak in autumn shortly after children return to school this might reflect a combination of factors including poor treatment adherence increased allergen and viral exposure and altered immune tolerance there is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations but while costly seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations pathophysiology asthma is result of chronic inflammation of conducting zone of airways most especially bronchi and which subsequently results in increased of surrounding smooth muscles this among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of airway and classic symptoms of wheezing narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment occasionally airways themselves change typical changes in airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of lamina chronically airways smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in numbers of mucous glands other cell types involved include t lymphocytes macrophages and neutrophils there may also be involvement of other components of immune system including cytokines chemokines histamine and leukotrienes among others diagnosis while asthma is a well recognized condition there is not one universal agreed upon definition it is defined by global initiative for asthma as a chronic inflammatory disorder of airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing breathlessness chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in early morning these episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment there is currently no precise test for diagnosis which is typically based on pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time a diagnosis of asthma should be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise viral infections allergens or air pollution spirometry is then used to confirm diagnosis in children under age of six diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry spirometry spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management it is single best test for asthma if fev1 measured by this technique improves more than 12 and increases by at least 200 milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol this is supportive of diagnosis it however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma not currently acting up as caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with results single breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from copd it is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person s asthma is controlled others challenge involves inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed if negative it means that a person does not have asthma if positive however it is not specific for disease other supportive evidence includes a 20 difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks a 20 improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone or a 20 decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry however and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis it may be useful for daily self monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking effectiveness of new medications it may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations classification clinical classification 12 years old severity symptom frequency night time symptoms fev1 of predicted fev1 variability saba use intermittent 2 week 2 month 80 20 2 days

classified according to frequency of symptoms forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 and peak expiratory flow rate asthma may also be classified as atopic extrinsic or non atopic intrinsic based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens atopic or not non atopic while asthma is classified based on severity at moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as and emphysema unlike these diseases airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible however if left untreated chronic inflammation from asthma can lead lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling in

chest tightness wheezing is most often when breathing out while these are primary symptoms of asthma some people present primarily with coughing and in severe cases air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard in children chest pain is often present signs occurring during an asthma attack include use of accessory muscles of respiration sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of neck there may be a paradoxical pulse a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation and over inflation of chest a blue color of skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen in a mild exacerbation peak expiratory flow rate is 200 l min or 50 of predicted best moderate is defined as between 80 and 200 l min or 25 and 50 of predicted best while severe is defined as 80 l min or 25 of predicted best acute severe asthma previously known as status is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen air pollution or insufficient or inappropriate medication use brittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent severe attacks type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability despite intense medication type 2 brittle asthma is background well controlled asthma with sudden severe exacerbations exercise induced exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction both in people with or without asthma it occurs in most people with asthma and up to 20 of people without asthma exercise induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes highest rates are among cyclists up to 45 swimmers and cross country skiers while it may occur with any weather conditions it is more common when it is dry and cold inhaled beta2 agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma however oral doses may improve endurance and strength occupational asthma as a result of or worsened by workplace exposures is a commonly reported occupational disease many cases however are not reported or recognized as such it is estimated that 5 25 of asthma cases in adults are work related a few hundred different agents have been implicated with most common being grain and wood dust soldering flux latex animals and aldehydes employment associated with highest risk of problems include those who spray paint bakers and those who process food nurses chemical workers those who work with animals welders hairdressers and timber workers aspirin induced asthma aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease aerd also known as aspirin induced asthma affects up to 9 of asthmatics aerd consists of asthma nasal polyps sinus disease and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other nsaid medications such as ibuprofen and people often also develop loss of smell and most experience respiratory reactions to alcohol alcohol induced asthma alcohol may worsen asthmatic symptoms in up to a third of people this may be even more common in some ethnic groups such as japanese and those with aspirin induced asthma other studies have found improvement in asthmatic symptoms from alcohol non atopic asthma non atopic asthma also known as intrinsic or non allergic makes up between 10 and 33 of cases there is negative skin test to common inhalant allergens and normal serum concentrations of ige often it starts later in life and women are more commonly affected than men usual treatments may not work as well differential diagnosis many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma in children other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis should be considered as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration tracheal stenosis vascular rings enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses and other viral infections may also produce wheezing in adults copd congestive heart failure airway masses as well as drug induced coughing due to ace inhibitors should be considered in both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma after age of 65 most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and copd in this setting copd can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils abnormally increased wall thickness and increased smooth muscle in bronchi however this level of investigation is not performed due to copd and asthma sharing similar principles of management corticosteroids long acting beta agonists and smoking cessation it closely resembles asthma in symptoms is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke an older age less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy prevention evidence for effectiveness of measures to prevent development of asthma is weak world health organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke air pollution chemical irritants including perfume and number of lower respiratory infections other efforts that show promise include limiting smoke exposure in utero breastfeeding and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication early pet exposure may be useful results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from work place may be effective it is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects risk of exacerbations immunization however is recommended by world health organization smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma management while there is no cure for asthma symptoms can typically be improved a specific customized plan for proactively monitoring and managing symptoms should be created this plan should include reduction of exposure to allergens testing to assess severity of symptoms and usage of and adjustments to medications treatment plan should be written down and advise adjustments to treatment according to changes in symptoms most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers such as cigarette smoke pets or aspirin and eliminating exposure to them if trigger avoidance is insufficient use of medication is recommended pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on among other things severity of illness and frequency of symptoms specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast acting and long acting categories bronchodilators are recommended for short term relief of symptoms in those with occasional attacks no other medication is needed if mild persistent disease is present more than two attacks a week low dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended for those who have daily attacks a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used in a moderate or severe exacerbation corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments people with asthma have higher rates of anxiety psychological stress and depression this is associated with poorer asthma control cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life asthma control and anxiety levels in people with asthma improving people s knowledge about asthma and using a written action plan has been identified as an important component of managing asthma providing educational sessions that include information specific to a person s culture is likely effective more research is necessary to determine if increasing preparedness and knowledge of asthma among school staff and families using home based and school interventions results in long term improvements in safety for children with asthma school based asthma self management interventions which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma its triggers and importance of regular practitioner review may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits these interventions may also reduce number of days children experience asthma symptoms and may lead to small improvements in asthma related quality of life more research is necessary to determine if shared decision making is helpful for managing adults with asthma or if a personalized asthma action plan is effective and necessary some people with asthma use pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack however there is no evidence regarding use in these instances lifestyle modification avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks most common triggers include allergens smoke from tobacco or other sources air pollution non selective beta blockers and containing foods cigarette smoking and second hand smoke passive smoke may reduce effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids laws that limit smoking decrease number of people hospitalized for asthma dust mite control measures including air filtration chemicals to kill mites mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms there is insufficient evidence to suggest that dehumidifiers are helpful for controlling asthma overall exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma more research is necessary to determine how effective weight loss is on improving quality of life usage of health care services and adverse effects for people of all ages with asthma medications medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes quick relief medications used to treat acute symptoms and long term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms or for treating asthma at any time fast acting thumb alt a round canister above a blue plastic holder salbutamol metered dose inhaler commonly used to treat asthma attacks short acting beta2 adrenoceptor agonists saba such as salbutamol usan are first line treatment for asthma symptoms they are recommended before exercise in those with exercise induced symptoms anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium provide additional benefit when used in combination with saba in those with moderate or severe symptoms and may prevent hospitalizations anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a saba if a child requires admission to hospital additional ipratropium does not appear to help over a saba for children over 2 years old with acute asthma symptoms inhaled anticholinergic medications taken alone is safe but is not as effective as inhaled saba or saba combined with inhaled anticholinergic medication adults who receive combined inhaled medications that includes short acting and saba may be at risk for increased adverse effects such as experiencing a tremor agitation and heart beat palpitations compared to people who are treated with saba by itself older less selective adrenergic agonists such as inhaled epinephrine have similar efficacy to sabas they are however not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation a short course of corticosteroids after an acute asthma exacerbation may help prevent relapses and reduce hospitalizations for adults and children who are in hospital due to acute asthma systematic iv corticosteroids improve symptoms long term control thumb alt a round canister above an orange plastic holder propionate metered dose inhaler commonly used for long term control corticosteroids are generally considered most effective treatment available for long term control inhaled forms such as beclomethasone are usually used except in case of severe persistent disease in which oral corticosteroids may be needed it is usually recommended that inhaled formulations be used once or twice daily depending on severity of symptoms long acting beta adrenoceptor agonists laba such as and can improve asthma control at least in adults when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in children this benefit is uncertain when used without steroids they increase risk of severe side effects and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase risk evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma a treatment regime that includes laba added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce amount of serious exacerbations children who require laba as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to hospital more frequently leukotriene receptor antagonists anti leukotriene agents such as montelukast and may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids typically also in conjunction with a laba evidence is insufficient to support use in acute exacerbations for adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well addition of anti leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations anti leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti leukotriene receptor alone in those under five years of age anti leukotriene agents were preferred add on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids by british thoracic society in 2009 a 2013 cochrane systematic review concluded that anti leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children a similar class of drugs 5 lox inhibitors may be used as an alternative in chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults as of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as intravenous administration of drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta 2 agonist treatment aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta 2 agonist treatment mast cell stabilizers such as sodium are another non preferred alternative to corticosteroids for children with asthma which is well controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids ics and long acting beta2 agonists laba benefits and harms of stopping laba and stepping down to ics only therapy are uncertain in adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of laba and inhaled corticosteroids ics stopping laba may increase risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth stopping laba probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma related quality of life whether or not stopping laba increases risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults there is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth steroid sparing due to adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms delivery methods medications are typically provided as metered dose inhalers in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes medication with air making it easier to receive a full dose of drug a may also be used and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms however insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease for delivering short acting beta agonists in acute asthma in children spacers may have advantages compared to but children with life threatening asthma have not been studied there is no strong evidence for use of intravenous laba for adults or children who have acute asthma there is insufficient evidence to directly compare effectiveness of a metered dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma adverse effects long term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects risks include thrush development of cataracts and a slightly slowed rate of growth higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density others inflammation in lungs can be estimated by level of exhaled nitric oxide use of exhaled nitric oxide levels to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children when asthma is unresponsive to usual medications other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of additional options include oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if fall below 92 corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being same 2 days of dexamethasone one review recommended a seven day course of steroids magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks in adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled nebulised magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults overall high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma heliox a mixture of helium and oxygen may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases such as theophylline were once widely used but do not add significantly to effects of inhaled beta agonists their use in acute exacerbations is controversial dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest however there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this for those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and bronchial may be an option it involves delivery of controlled thermal energy to airway wall during a series of while it may increase exacerbation frequency in first few months it appears to decrease subsequent rate effects beyond one year are unknown monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma however as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost effectiveness monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 5 il 5 or its receptor il 5r including mepolizumab or benralizumab in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing rate of asthma exacerbations there is limited evidence for improved health related quality of life and lung function evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes it is unclear if non invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied alternative medicine many people with asthma like those with other chronic disorders use alternative treatments surveys show that roughly 50 use some form of unconventional therapy there is little data to support effectiveness of most of these therapies evidence is insufficient to support usage of vitamin c or vitamin e for controlling asthma there is tentative support for use of vitamin c in exercise induced bronchospasm fish oil dietary supplements marine n 3 fatty acids and reducing dietary sodium do not appear to help improve asthma control in people with mild to moderate asthma treatment with vitamin d supplementation may reduce risk of asthma exacerbations however it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin d levels to begin with low baseline vitamin d there is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin d supplements improve day to day asthma symptoms or a person s lung function there is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate msg there have not been enough high quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains msg acupuncture is not recommended for treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use air show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators manual therapies including osteopathic chiropractic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use however technique does not have any effect on lung function thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use there is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma
