giving several bundles of euros to pirates pirates are initially shocked but begin to respect cartman unimpressed by their lack of pirate traits he in turn leads them in raiding ships via a traditional sea shanty called somalian pirates we and starts fashioning them into a stereotypical pirate crew meanwhile french crew is rescued by an oil tanker and u s navy is deployed by nato and united nations after getting word from cargo ship captain that pirates now have advanced weaponry which was really just kevin s toy lightsaber that french crew thought was real kyle arrives in mogadishu but is immediately taken captive by pirates and held hostage he pleads with cartman to let him and his brother leave but cartman refuses believing that kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life meanwhile an english speaking pirate named guleed asks butters and ike why they decided to become pirates when they say that they left because they were tired of things like school chores homework and being yelled at by adults guleed responds by telling them that he dreamed of going to school and his mother was suffering from aids that could not be treated while his father was killed attempting to find food for his family and guleed had only entered piracy because he needed to support his family but hated pirate lifestyle butters and ike end up realizing how close minded and complacent they ve been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be they then tell cartman that they want to return home but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens boys with death by calling real pirates to hold them at gunpoint however cartman s vision is quickly disrupted when a u s navy ship hired by nato appears off coast carrying snipers who kill all of somali pirates within seconds this leaves cartman dumbfounded and annoyed production thumb right episode alludes to golden age of piracy its title is a reference to notorious english pirate blackbeard depicted here fatbeard was written and directed by series co creator trey parker it originally aired on comedy central in united states on april 22 2009 and was mid season finale marking final south park episode until october 2009 fatbeard is based on real life piracy in indian ocean which began receiving increasing international media attention in 2008 until its demise in 2012 2013 episode began production two weeks before its airdate with intention to broadcast it on april 15 2009 writing team had developed idea for cartman mistaking somali piracy for classic piracy amid pirate hijacking of mv maersk alabama at time captain richard phillips was taken hostage in event and parker and stone decided to hold episode indefinitely although animation had begun realizing severity of situation if phillips were killed and south park episode seemed to mock situation they decided to resume work on episode pinewood derby which had been in production for a while as creators had no idea to where to go with its story when phillips was rescued over weekend they wanted to resume work on fatbeard but as animation work on episode proved difficult including new sets depicting somalia it was decided it would be unfeasible episode s ending was unusual as many episodes of south park tend to resolve episode s events in fatbeard main characters don t return home and are shown at end still in somalia an alternate ending made it to animatic stage in which cartman in a self referential manner congratulates show on conclusion of season and invites season s celebrity parodies among those jonas brothers and kanye west ending which parker likened to that of a variety show was something he felt was funny in writing but didn t succeed visually while most south park episodes feature parker and stone providing almost all voice acting fatbeard included several french speaking actors providing lines of cruise ship crew outside voice actors were also brought in for role of somali pirates including abdi fatah adawe ali abdullahi prime and julien week after its original broadcast in response to requests by fans full 90 second version of episode s sea shanty song somalian pirates we was made available for download on south park studios official south park website shortly after fatbeard was originally broadcast site also featured six different types of t shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on episode themes ending in which pirates are each shot to death by american snipers reflects resolution of pirate hijacking of mv maersk alabama in april 2009 where u s navy seals rescued captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each they are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during ending travis fickett of ign said it s one of those moments where south park feels need to give voice to a side media is ignoring and points out that things aren t quite as cut and dry as we might like episode has also been described as a commentary on way in which americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted a u s navy seal ordering another to not hit white ones has also been described as an indictment of american approach to foreign policy cultural references ike indicates he will vomit my balls out through my mouth if he has to hear anything more about susan boyle scottish amateur singer who gained worldwide attention around time of episode s airing for her performance of song i dreamed a dream from les miserables on show britain s got talent boyle reference in particular received a great deal of media attention week fatbeard first aired cartman says that jewish people mexicans and ginger haired people are not allowed to be pirates french schooner crew members are portrayed as pretentious cowards a stereotype of french based on government s surrender during world war ii schooner itself strongly resembles french luxury yacht le which was seized by somali pirates in april 2008 cartman refers to blackbeard famous english pirate from 17th and 18th centuries from whom episode derives its name much of decor and music in episode is influenced by pirates of caribbean theme park ride and associated film franchise kevin wields a toy lightsaber jedi weapon from star wars films this is also a reference to sixth season episode return of fellowship of ring to two towers in which he dresses as an imperial stormtrooper while rest of boys are in lord of rings attire reception in its original american broadcast fatbeard was watched by 2 59 million overall households according to nielsen ratings making it most watched comedy central production of week episode received generally positive reviews carlos delgado of if magazine who gave episode an a grade particularly praised cartman and ike characters and called ending perfect delgado said of show s creators these guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through news desk and because south park can be made in like a week and i m talking start to finish from concept to finished product they end up being most socially conscious and timely show on television today ken tucker of entertainment weekly praised episode and somali pirate song and complimented show for presenting pirates as sympathetic human beings sean o neal of a v club said portrayal of somali pirates was a predictable storyline but said he enjoyed episode because of pacing rather than a cobbled together collection of gags everything progressed very organically ign writer travis fickett said episode was amusing but not exceptional fickett enjoyed takeover of french vessel and extent to which cartman s delusion about pirates takes him but he said pirate plot isn t entirely in good taste and it never really gathers a full head of steam thumb right crew of arleigh burke class destroyer uss bainbridge pictured contacted south park staff to
