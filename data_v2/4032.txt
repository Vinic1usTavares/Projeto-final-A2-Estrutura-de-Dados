milland s character leaves an apartment with wrong hat it is much too large for milland and sinks down around his head and ears matheson sold rights to universal on condition that he write screenplay it was matheson s first screenplay a writing format he felt he adapted to quickly matheson s initial script followed scott carey already shrunken and battling a spider in his basement his rewrite is told in flashback form interspersed with scenes of carey and spider while telling story of carey s gradual loss in height film was already into its second month of production before novel was published in may 1956 by gold medal books producer albert zugsmith added word incredible to matheson s title and passed script to richard alan simmons who removed script s flashback structure matheson later discussed working with universal finding that producer had a very commercial mind which make script weaker in terms of character in an interview in cinefantastique magazine matheson stated he protested sharing a screen credit with simmons screen credits list matheson as writer while shooting script lists both matheson and simmons pre production was originally set to begin on april 20 1956 but it started officially on april 24 cast consisted of mostly unknown actors director jack arnold phoned randy stuart who was a personal friend asking if she would be interested in doing film zugsmith initially wanted dan o herlihy to play role of scott carey o herlihy had just been nominated for an academy award for his role in robinson crusoe after reading script he refused to play another isolated character not wanting to be typecast in that kind of role grant williams was cast because universal had him pegged to become a star on april 4 1956 williams and randy stuart were screen tested and deemed acceptable for roles of scott and louise carey filming on first day of production may 31 universal s operating committee decided that because of type of special photography involved in making of film publicity department would co operate by publicizing a closed door policy on set on set photography would not be allowed while film was shot to stimulate public and trade interest shooting took either five or six weeks including special effects sequences budget ranged between 700 000 and 800 000 film critic kim newman said budget was not expensive with most of it used for special effects some special effects shots were earliest taken for picture for example shots with randy stewart were taken against a black velvet backdrop and then composited with shots of williams on an enlarged living room set their movements were synchronized using negatives from first exposed scene in camera gate with opposite done for other scene sound production began on may 31 an oversized dollhouse was built for williams on stage 28 it had previously been used for phantom of opera and dracula arnold said he filmed scenes with cat in a normal studio with an animal trainer who had about 40 identical cats to coax cat to approach dollhouse arnold hid food in it so cat would find a way into house later he timed cat s reactions and directed williams accordingly to react to cat arnold s first attempted to follow novel and use a black widow spider after preliminary tests he found black widows were too small to use properly in film in an interview with tom weaver randy stuart said spiders presented problems overhead lamps on set had to be turned up high leading to deaths of two dozen tarantulas they were directed with little puffs of air a technique which had been used previously in arnold s film tarantula despite sources suggesting otherwise both films did not use same tarantulas many of basement scenes were shot on stage 12 of universal studios which according to tom weaver was one of largest sound stages in world at time while trying a way to film a scene involving giant raindrops landing arnold recalled when he was a child finding condoms in his father s drawer not knowing what they were he filled them with water and dropped them arnold ordered about 100 condoms and placed them on a treadmill so they would drop in sequence flood scene was shot on july 2 and 3 there was a 20 minute delay in filming because of a bad camera cable there was a further delay from 11 05 am to 11 25 am to allow water to drain so a crane could be used properly these scenes involved nine hour workdays when actors were not filming they were sent to have publicity shots taken film was originally shot in standard 4 3 aspect ratio but midway through filming on june 22 it was decided that remaining footage would be shot in 1 75 1 belief was this would give film a better look as a narrower frame would allow production department to scale down height of certain props for special effects during this period grant williams suffered first of many injuries on set on june 22 he reported to studio hospital with a scratched leg on june 29 he had to leave set to be treated for an eye condition and on july 2 he had to be driven to hospital for further treatment for his eyes on same day he was sent to studio hospital for blisters and scratches from injuries sustained while climbing sets due to williams injuries and some special effects shots being too bright film was four days behind schedule and was 25 000 over budget post production special effects shots using black velvet trick photography took three weeks of post production and were scheduled after film completed production on july 13 1956 warren described special effects as hard to assign correctly clifford stine whose field was process work and rear screen projection is credited with special photography boat scene at beginning of film was shot on universal s process stage which allowed for rear screen projection shots of scott in certain scenes such as his encounter with mist were shot with him against a black velvet black drop film s score is not an organic score by an individual composer as it draws from different sources film s main theme is composed by irving gertz and performed by big band leader ray anthony other music used in film such as scene where doctor is first examining scott s x rays is drawn from studio s library music under supervision of music supervisor joseph gershenson according to randy stuart film s ending had williams return to his original size which matheson felt was wrong ending for story arnold argued with universal over ending studio wanted a happy ending while he wanted original ending that had been shot to decide on which ending to use a test screening was held to judge audience s reaction lucas said audience review cards from a december 7 preview screening in california reacting to ending included comments such as should ve had a different ending should ve grown again and what happened at end on overall quality of film comments included can t you do any better this is pretty sad you scared my son to death and this is an insult to brain power of my two year old son film was released with arnold s original ending intact release incredible shrinking man opened in new york on february 22 1957 this was followed by a screening in los angeles on march 27 1957 and a wider release in april mel danner manager of circle theater in waynoka oklahoma noted audiences reaction who felt it was a good film but felt that carey should have returned to original size at end film was reissued theatrically in 1964 variety reported that by end of year film had grossed 1 43 million actress randy stuart recalled film was either second or third i think third after ten commandments in terms of how much money it made against what it cost it was among highest grossing science fiction films of decade in comparison other 1950s science fiction films grossed more 20 000 leagues under sea grossed 8 million journey to center of earth grossed 4 8 million while thing and invasion of body snatchers grossed 1 95 million and 1 2 million respectively film

on vhs in 1992 it was released on dvd as part of a box set containing a collection of universal international s science fiction films arrow video released film on blu ray in 2017 reception incredible shrinking man s initial reception was described by arnold s biographer dana m as a routine to above average film its reception has steadily grown ever since philip k scheuer of los angeles times called film a fascinating exercise in imagination as terrifying as it is funny science fiction admirers who are accustomed to finding food for thought as well as vicarious thrills in such flights of fancy will not be disappointed either monthly film bulletin praised film and declared it a horrifying story that grips imagination throughout a straightforward macabre and as startlingly original as a vintage ray bradbury short story for all its peaceful and resigned conclusion opens new vistas of cosmic terror bosley crowther of new york times panned film writing that unless a viewer is addicted to freakish ironies unlikely spectacle of mr williams losing an inch of height each week while his wife randy stuart looks on helplessly will become tiresome before universal has emptied its lab of science fiction cliches brog of variety commented that film was not thoroughly satisfactory but had enough good qualities specifically declaring is inclined to slow down on occasion resulting in flagging interest here and there review noted special effects and cinematography were visually effective but that portions of background score are overworked which distracted from plot film was first winner of hugo award for best dramatic presentation in 1958 martin rubin discussed film in a 1974 issue of film comment and compared it to its contemporaries in genre he found it did not have schoolboy cynicism and moralizing of a roger corman film nor any of hysteria common to red scare science of fifties he felt story was well suited to jack arnold noting a director would have overinflated this film and compromised its sense of ordinary with shadows and angles while a more accomplished stylist of almost any other order would have softened it too much such attitudes are better off in horror film rubin also compared it other science fiction films arnold made in 1950s creature from black lagoon it came from outer space tarantula revenge of creature and space children finding them competitively interesting in patches but lacking in comparison to unity and clarity of incredible shrinking man which totally fulfills its central metaphor without being unduly constricted by it ian nathan of empire referred to film as a classic of 1950s science fiction films and noted how that everyday objects found at home are transformed into a terrifying vertiginous world fraught with peril a confrontation with a giant spider impressively realised as are all effects for its day has become one of iconic image of entire era tim lucas declared film remains one of perfectly realized science fiction films noting it was less about science then a masterful example of what if branch of speculative human drama aftermath jack arnold commented on science films made after incredible shrinking man saying that since his films were financially successful american international pictures and japanese studios developed similar productions which he felt lacked in both atmosphere and or morals and were just stories about monsters these included amazing colossal man and attack of 50 foot woman arnold was unable to sell a science fiction story after these films began appearing and went to england to create mouse that roared which he felt was a fantasy film that still had a deeper meaning to it arnold later declared mouse as his favourite picture and that he thought almost as much of incredible shrinking man arnold spoke about film later in life watching a revival screening of it saying he was happy that audiences enjoyed film and that they got all nuances that i put in it was a joy to me just to watch their reaction to film matheson discussed film in an interview in john s horror people where he declared he only enjoyed film after his son pointed out films story structure specifically that it didn t have usual story line usual happy ending actually it had no particular story line it was very picaresque it just wandered on matheson re iterated his enjoyment of film in cinefantastique finding himself able to appreciate film with subsequent watches finding visuals as truly remarkable and that arnold created quite a mood in film film was selected for preservation by in national film registry in 2009 proposed sequels and remakes thumb alt photographic head shot of richard matheson richard matheson wrote a follow up to film and was developing a new adaption of his book in 2013 matheson scripted a sequel to incredible shrinking man titled fantastic little girl film has louise carey certain that scott is still alive she returns home and finds herself shrinking and is injected with a new cure script also featured scott in his microscopic world where he encounters strange eel like creatures script was 43 pages long and described as inferior by author bill warren compared to original film matheson said that despite original film making a lot of money he was unsure why sequel was not developed past script stage script in its entirety was published in book unrealized dreams in 2005 reluctance to re release film for home video was because universal intended to develop a pseudo sequel to film this included john landis developing writing and directing incredible shrinking woman which was cancelled by universal after project s budget was found to be too high film was revived by jane wagner jack arnold said he hated incredible shrinking woman declaring special effects weak and adding there was no point of view major fault is that it s not a comedy even though they tried so hard to make it funny universal were
