to premiere s introduction type tone he also praised prison experiment subplot writing that it introduced a who s who of recognizable guest stars all of whom could clearly rerun on a show that loves to build a large cast of periphery characters price peterson writing for tv com gave a positive review writing anytime veronica goes undercover as her polar opposite is just a good time you know and as much as stanford experiment thing was low stakes and standalone i enjoyed its unpredictable twists and reveals perfect early season plotline alan sepinwall wrote that prison experiment plotline never getting out of hand made it feel like a wasted opportunity while writing that enrico colantoni really sold keith s despair at resolution of his plotline writing for a v club rowan kaiser gave a more mixed review stating that show and veronica were both still discovering their place at show s new setting show is still tense still powerful still amusing but it doesn t know how to apply those things in its new setting however kaiser concluded that veronica mars is a mess right now but it s an extremely ambitious mess i d watch rather ambitious and difficult than boring and my big fat greek rush week was anything but boring television without pity gave episode a b references external links my big fat greek rush week at mars investigations category 2006 american television episodes
