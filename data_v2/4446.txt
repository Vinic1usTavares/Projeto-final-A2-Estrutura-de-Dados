269 works of western association of writers most notably those of riley and wallace helped create midwest s cultural identity and rival literary community to established eastern literati for this reason and publicity riley s work created he was commonly known as hoosier poet van allen p p 255 critical reception and style riley was among most popular writers of late nineteenth and early twentieth century known for his uncomplicated sentimental and humorous writing often writing his verses in dialect his poetry caused readers to recall a nostalgic and simpler time in earlier american history this gave his poetry a unique appeal during a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization in united states riley was a prolific writer who achieved mass appeal partly due to his canny sense of marketing and publicity he published more than fifty books mostly of poetry and humorous short stories and sold millions of copies he is often remembered for his most famous poems including raggedy man and little orphant annie many of his poems used events and people from his childhood as an inspiration for subject their matter his poems often contain morals and warnings for children with messages telling children to care for less fortunate of society david galens and van allen both see these messages as riley s subtle response to turbulent economic times of gilded age and growing progressive movement van allen p 235 riley believed that urbanization robbed children of their innocence and sincerity and in his poems he attempted to introduce and idolize characters who had not lost those qualities van allen p 234 his children s poems are exuberant performative and often display riley s penchant for using humorous characterization repetition and dialect to make his poetry accessible to a wide ranging audience greasley p 434 although hinted at indirectly in some poems riley wrote very little on serious subjects and mocked attempts at serious poetry only a few of his sentimental poems concern serious subjects little mandy s christmas tree absence of little wesley and happy little cripple are about poverty death of a child and disabilities like his children s poems they also contain morals suggesting society should pity downtrodden and be charitable riley wrote gentle and romantic poems that were not in dialect they generally consist of sonnets and are strongly influenced by works of john greenleaf whittier henry wadsworth longfellow and alfred lord tennyson his standard english poetry was never as popular as his hoosier dialect poems still less popular were poems riley wrote in his later years most were to commemorate important events in american history or to eulogize dead riley s contemporaries acclaimed him america s best loved poet in 1920 henry beers lauded works of riley as natural and unaffected with none of discontent and deep thought of cultured song samuel clemens william dean howells and hamlin garland each praised riley s work and idealism he expressed in his poetry only a few critics of period found fault with riley s works ambrose bierce criticized riley for his frequent use of dialect he accused riley of using dialect to cover up faulty construction of his poems edgar lee masters found riley s work to be superficial claiming it lacked irony and that he had only a narrow emotional range by 1930s popular critical opinion towards riley s works began to shift in favor of negative reviews in 1951 james t farrell said riley s works were cliched galens wrote modern critics consider riley to be a minor poet whose work provincial sentimental and superficial though it may have been nevertheless struck a chord with a mass audience in a time of enormous cultural change thomas c johnson wrote that what most interests modern critics was riley s ability to market his work saying he had a unique understanding of how to commodify his own image and nostalgic dreams of an anxious nation among earliest widespread criticisms of riley were opinions that his dialect writing did not actually represent true dialect of central indiana in 1970 peter revell wrote riley s dialect was more like poor speech of a child rather than dialect of his region he made extensive comparisons to historical texts and riley s dialect usage philip greasley wrote that while some critics have dismissed him as sub literary insincere and an artificial entertainer his defenders reply that an author so popular with millions of people in different walks of life must contribute something of value and that his faults if any
