1955 atlantic hurricane season was at time costliest season ever recorded hurricane season officially began on june 15 1955 and ended on november 15 1955 it was slightly above average with 13 recorded tropical cyclones first storm alice had persisted since december 30 1954 alice caused relatively minor impact as it tracked through lesser antilles and eastern caribbean sea in early january tropical storm brenda caused two deaths and minor damage along gulf coast of united states in early august quick succession of hurricanes connie and diane caused significant flooding in northeastern united states with nearly 1 billion 1955 usd in losses and at least 232 fatalities next three storms hurricanes edith and flora and tropical storm five caused very minor or no impact in early august hurricane gladys caused severe localized flooding in mexico primarily in mexico city additionally an offshoot of gladys inflicted minor impact in texas hurricane hilda struck greater antilles and then mexico it was attributed to at least 304 deaths and 120 million in losses in mid september hurricane ione struck eastern north carolina and contributed flooding from connie and diane resulting in seven fatalities and 88 million in damage later that month hurricane janet which peaked as a category 5 hurricane lashed several countries adjacent to caribbean sea as well as mexico and british honduras janet resulted in 53 8 million in damage and at least 716 deaths an unnamed tropical storm in month of october did not impact land hurricane katie final storm caused minor damage in a sparsely populated area of hispaniola totaling to at least 200 000 7 fatalities were also reported collectively storms caused 1518 deaths and 1 2 billion in losses making it costliest season at time a record number of names four were retired following season which was later tied by 1995 2004 and 2017 seasons trailing only 2005 season when five names were retired season summary on april 11 1955 which was prior to start of season gordon dunn was promoted to chief meteorologist of miami hurricane warning office dunn was replacing grady norton who died from a stroke while forecasting hurricane hazel of previous season in early june hurricane hunters received new reconnaissance aircraft which contained latest radar and electronic equipment at time later that month shortly before start of 1955 season a bill was proposed in united states senate to provide funding for 55 new radar stations along east coast of united states after united states house of representatives passed a bill allotting 5 million senate disputed about possibly increasing funding two fold to 10 million eventually radars were installed starting in july 1955 after devastating storms of season particularly connie and diane a united states government organization with purpose of monitoring tropical cyclones was established in 1956 with 500 000 in funding it later became modern day national hurricane center atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 15 1955 it was an above average season in which 13 tropical cyclones formed in a typical season about nine tropical storms develop of which five strengthen to hurricane strength all thirteen depressions attained tropical storm status and eleven of these attained hurricane status six hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes season was above average most likely because of a strong ongoing la nina hurricane alice developed in late december 1954 but persisted into january 1955 and was operationally analysed to have developed in latter within official hurricane season bounds tropical cyclogenesis did not occur until july 31 with development of tropical storm brenda however during month of august four tropical cyclones formed including connie diane edith and an unnamed tropical storm five additional tropical cyclones flora gladys hilda ione and janet all developed in september tropical cyclogenesis briefly halted until an unnamed tropical storm formed on october 10 final storm of season katie dissipated on october 19 almost a month before official end of hurricane season on november 15 eight hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during season and caused 1 603 deaths and 1 1 billion in damage season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 199 which was above 1950 2000 average of 96 1 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems tropical storm brenda tropical storm brenda developed in north central gulf of mexico at 0600 utc on july 31 during next 24 hours storm strengthened rapidly and attained its maximum sustain wind speed of 70 mph 110 km h early on august 1 although it is possible it briefly reached hurricane intensity later that day brenda made landfall east of new orleans louisiana at same intensity storm steadily weakened inland and by august 2 it was downgraded to a tropical depression early on august 3 brenda dissipated while located over eastern texas between pensacola florida and lake charles louisiana rainfall totals were generally about flooding if any was insignificant tropical storm force winds were reported peaking at at shell beach louisiana on south shore of lake at same location tides between above normal were measured four people were rescued by united states coast guard after their tugboat sank in lake pontchartrain while three others swam to shore additionally two fatalities occurred in vicinity of mobile alabama hurricane connie a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression east of cape verde on august 3 after six hours it strengthened into tropical storm connie by august 4 connie began to rapidly strengthen becoming first major hurricane of season later that day initially it posed a threat to lesser antilles although it passed about 50 miles 80 km north outer rainbands produced hurricane force wind gusts and intense precipitation reaching 8 65 inches 220 mm in puerto rico in united states virgin islands three people died due to hurricane and a few homes were destroyed in puerto rico connie destroyed 60 homes and caused crop damage after affecting puerto rico connie turned to northwest reaching peak winds of 140 mph 220 km h hurricane weakened while slowing and turning to north and struck north carolina on august 12 as a category 2 hurricane connie produced strong winds high tides and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore causing heavy crop damage and 27 deaths in state of north carolina connie made a second landfall in virginia and it progressed inland until dissipating on august 15 near sault ste marie michigan four people were killed in washington d c due to a traffic accident in chesapeake bay connie capsized a boat killing 14 people and prompting a change in coast guard regulation there were six deaths each in pennsylvania and new jersey and eleven deaths in new york where record rainfall flooded homes and subways at least 225 000 people lost power during storm damage in united states totaled around 86 million although rains from connie was a prelude to flooding by hurricane diane remnants of connie destroyed a few houses and boats in ontario and killed three people in ontario hurricane diane a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression between lesser antilles and cape verde on august 7 it slowly strengthened and became tropical storm diane on august 9 after a fujiwhara interaction with hurricane connie diane curved northward or north northeastward and quickly deepened by early on august 8 storm was upgraded to a hurricane only several hours later diane peaked as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph 165 km h storm resumed its west northwestward motion on august 13 colder air in region caused diane to weaken while approaching east coast of united states a recently installed radar in north carolina noted an eye feature albeit poorly defined early on august 17 diane made landfall near wilmington north carolina as a strong tropical storm storm then moved in a parabolic motion across north carolina and mid atlantic before re emerging into atlantic ocean on august 19 diane headed east northeastward until becoming extratropical on august 20 despite landfall in north carolina impact in state was minor limited to moderate rainfall abnormally high tides and relatively strong winds further north catastrophic flooding occurred in pennsylvania new jersey new york and new england of 287 stream gauges in region 129 reported record levels after flooding from tropical storm diane many streams reported discharge rates that were more than twice of previous record most of flooding occurred along small river basins that rapidly rose within hours to flood stage largely occurring in populated areas region in which floods occurred had about 30 million people and 813 houses overall were destroyed floods severely damaged homes highways power lines and railroads and affected several summer camps overall utility damage was estimated at 79 million flooding in mountainous areas caused landslides and destroyed crop fields agriculture losses was estimated at 7 million hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed accounting for 82 million in damage overall diane caused 754 7 million in damage of which 600 million was in new england overall there were at least 184 deaths hurricane edith an easterly tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on august 21 in tropical atlantic moving towards west northwest disturbance slowly intensified reaching tropical storm strength at 1200 utc on august 23 and as such was named edith by weather bureau afterwards edith began to curve towards northwest as it gradually intensified attaining hurricane strength on august 25 hurricane continued to intensify as it recurved and accelerated to northeast reaching its peak intensity on august 28 as a category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph 160 km h at same time a reconnaissance aircraft reported a minimum barometric pressure of 991 mbar hpa 29 27 inhg in storm s eye as edith made its closest pass to bermuda hurricane began to gradually weaken after it passed east of island before becoming extratropical on august 31 cyclone would later make a clockwise loop before dissipating completely late on september 3 although edith remained at sea it was suspected that hurricane may have caused loss of pleasure yacht connemara iv after it separated from its moorings tropical storm five a weak disturbance was first observed near grand cayman on august 23 gaining tropical storm strength by 0600 utc that day moving towards north northwest storm passed over western cuba on august 24 without much change in intensity once in gulf of mexico tropical storm marginally intensified reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained wind speeds of 45 mph 75 km h by 1200 utc on august 26 nearing gulf coast of united states system curved towards west storm maintained its intensity up until landfall in louisiana near new orleans on august 27 moving inland it slowly weakened while crossing central united states degenerating to tropical depression strength by august 29 and later dissipating over missouri following day strong waves generated by storm caused tides above average slightly damaging coastal resorts weather offices advised small craft offshore to remain in port due to strong waves rough seas battered schooner princess friday but ship was able to ride out storm storm produced squalls further inland causing heavy rains a weather station reported a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar hpa 29 53 inhg lowest in association with tropical storm despite strong waves and heavy rains only minor damage was reported hurricane flora a tropical wave moved along intertropical convergence zone itcz and passed through cape verde between august 30 and august 31 although panair do brasil headquarters in recife brazil reported a closed circulation on august 30 tropical storm flora did not develop until 0600 utc on september 2 while located about of cape verde storm strengthened at a steady pace for following 48 hours and reached hurricane status late on september 3 flora headed on a parabolic track initially moving west northwestward and then northwesterly by september 4 it continued to intensify and by september 6 storm curved northward around time a minimum barometric pressure of was reported however it may have been lower as storm did not attain its maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph 165 km h until september 7 flora maintained this intensity while curving to northeast but became extratropical at 0000 utc on september 9 while located about midway between flores island in azores and sable island nova scotia hurricane gladys a tropical depression developed in southern gulf of mexico at 1200 utc on september 4 six hours later it strengthened into tropical storm gladys storm quickly intensified and reached hurricane status on september 5 roughly 24 hours after developing around that time gladys peaked as a category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph 120 km h later on september 5 an offshoot of gladys with cyclonic turning formed in northern gulf of mexico and struck texas on september 6 it may have been a separate tropical cyclone initially gladys headed north northwestward but then re curved south southwestward while approaching gulf coast of mexico early on september 6 it made landfall near tampico tamaulipas as a weakening tropical storm system rapidly dissipated inland gladys dropped up to in tampico tamaulipas worst of flooding from gladys occurred in mexico city roughly 5 000 residents were isolated and required rescue police estimated that 2 300 homes were inundated with of water about 30 000 families were impacted by storm two children drowned and five additional people were listed as missing in texas highest sustained wind speed was 45 mph 75 km h in corpus christi port o connor area with gusts between offshore precipitation peaked at in flour bluff a neighborhood of corpus christi flooding in area forced scores of people to evacuate their homes damage estimates reached 500 000 hurricane ione a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression early on september 10 while located about midway between cape verde and lesser antilles after six hours depression strengthened into tropical storm ione eventually it turned to northwest at 0000 utc on september 15 ione reached hurricane intensity while situated north of leeward islands ione continued to deep while moving northwest storm reached category 4 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph 220 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of early on september 18 around midday on following day it made landfall near wilmington north carolina as a category 2 hurricane shortly after moving inland over eastern north carolina ione weakened to a tropical storm late on september 19 ione re emerged into atlantic near norfolk virginia storm quickly re strengthened early on september 20 but transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 21 strong winds heavy rainfall and abnormally high tides lashed some areas along east coast of united states especially north carolina in cherry point sustained winds reached 75 mph 121 km h with gusts up to 107 mph 172 km h overall damage was slightly more than 88 million mostly to crops and agriculture rainfall in state peaked at in maysville storm surge in north carolina peaked at in wrightsville beach as a result several coastal roadways were flooded including a portion of highway 94 and route 264 seven deaths were reported in north carolina remnants of ione brought gusty winds to atlantic canada which broken poles uprooted trees interrupted telephone service damaged chimneys and caused power outages especially in st john s newfoundland and labrador hurricane hilda a tropical wave located near lesser antilles spawned a tropical depression on september 12 it is estimated that depression strengthened into tropical storm hilda early on following day hilda quickly intensified while moving westward into a small hurricane by september 12 although storm passed just north of hispaniola on september 13 damage is unknown if any later that day hilda made landfall near southeastern tip of cuba on september 13 there it dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds that destroyed 80 of coffee crop in oriente province in eastern cuban city of hilda severely damaged oldest church in country damage totaled 2 million in cuba and there were four deaths later hurricane moved across caribbean sea causing light damage in sparsely populated region of eastern yucatan peninsula after reaching gulf of mexico hilda strengthened to reach peak winds of 120 mph 195 km h late on september 18 before hurricane moved ashore there was residual flooding in tampico from earlier hurricane gladys hilda struck city early on september 19 with gusts estimated at 150 mph 240 km h storm dropped heavy rainfall that flooded 90 of tampico while its strong winds damaged half of homes leaving 15 000 homeless throughout mexico 11 432 people were directly affected by hilda overall storm killed 300 people and caused over 120 million additionally outer bands of hilda caused minor flooding in southern texas particularly in raymondville hurricane janet hurricane janet was most powerful tropical cyclone of season and one of strongest atlantic hurricanes on record hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of lesser antilles on september 21 moving toward west across caribbean sea janet fluctuated in intensity but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a category 5 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale with winds of 175 mph 280 km h intense hurricane made landfall at that intensity near chetumal mexico on september 28 janet s landfall as a category 5 hurricane on yucatan peninsula marked first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in atlantic basin made on a continental mainland with all previous storms making landfall as category 5 hurricanes on islands after weakening over yucatan peninsula it moved into bay of campeche where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near veracruz on september 29 janet quickly weakened over mexico s mountainous terrain before dissipating on september 30 in its developmental stages near lesser antilles janet caused significant damage to island chain resulting in 189 deaths and 7 8 million in damages in grenadines and barbados while janet was in central caribbean sea a reconnaissance aircraft flew into storm and was lost with all eleven crew members believed perished this was only such loss which has occurred in association with an atlantic hurricane a category 5 upon landfall on yucatan peninsula janet caused severe devastation in areas on quintana roo and british honduras only five buildings in chetumal mexico remained intact after storm an estimated 500 deaths occurred in mexican state of quintana roo at janet s second landfall near veracruz significant river flooding ensued worsening effects caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in month floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326 people in tampico area flood damage would lead to largest mexican relief operation ever executed by united states at least 1 023 deaths were attributed to hurricane janet as well as 65 8 million in damages tropical storm eleven a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on september 18 and continued west northwestward it is possible that system developed into a tropical depression next day although lack of data prevented such classification until september 23 when a nearby ship reported winds of 35 mph 55 km h an approaching cold front turned system to north on september 24 structure gradually became better organized and after turning to northeast on september 26 depression intensified into a tropical storm this was based on a ship report of 45 mph 75 km h winds which was also estimated as system s peak intensity on september 27 system became extratropical and accelerated its forward motion dissipating within a larger extratropical storm south of iceland on next day tropical storm twelve a tropical wave was reported to have passed through cape verde on october 4 system slowly developed a vertex as it curved in a generally northward direction by early on october 10 two ships reported that a tropical depression formed almost halfway between azores and leeward islands after six hours depression strengthened into a tropical storm while re curving to northeast storm attained its maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h lowest atmospheric pressure recorded in relation to storm was but time of measurement is unknown although no significant weakening occurred it eventually merged with an extratropical cyclone on october 14 while still well southwest of azores during its extratropical stage a ship in area reported an atmospheric pressure as low as hurricane katie a disturbance in itcz developed into a tropical depression north of panama on october 14 early on following day depression strengthened into tropical storm katie system moved generally northeast due to presence of a strong low pressure area along east coast of united states later that day hurricane hunters observed a rapidly intensifying hurricane encountering winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a pressure of several hours before peak intensity early on october 17 katie made landfall in extreme eastern sud est haiti as a strong category 2 hurricane although it may have been stronger about half of homes in town of anse a were destroyed across border in pedernales dominican republic 68 houses were damaged overall losses were at least 200 000 and 7 fatalities were reported while crossing mountainous terrain of hispaniola katie became very disorganized and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm early on october 17 within a few hours after moving inland later that day storm emerged into atlantic ocean just east of puerto plata dominican republic katie began accelerating to northeast on october 18 during that time storm re intensified and briefly approached hurricane intensity although it failed to strengthen further due to interaction with a cold front after passing just east of bermuda on october 19 storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone remnants of katie were last observed following day storm names following names were used for tropical cyclones that reached at least tropical storm intensity in north atlantic in 1955 however two of such storms went unnamed storms were named brenda connie diane edith flora gladys hilda ione janet and katie for first and only in case of connie diane ione and janet time names not assigned are marked in gray alice brenda connie diane edith flora gladys hilda katie retirement connie diane ione and janet would later be retired 1955 season is tied with 1995 2004 and 2017 seasons for second most storm names retired after a single season in atlantic basin only surpassed by 2005 which had five names retired season effects this is a table of all storms that have formed in 1955 atlantic hurricane season besides hurricane alice it includes their duration names landfall s denoted in parentheses damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals while storm was extratropical a tropical wave or a low and all damage
