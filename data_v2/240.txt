maya stelae singular stela are monuments that were fashioned by maya civilization of ancient mesoamerica they consist of tall sculpted stone shafts and are often associated with low circular stones referred to as altars although their actual function is uncertain many stelae were sculpted in low relief although plain monuments are found throughout maya region sculpting of these monuments spread throughout maya area during classic period 250 900 ad and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of classic maya civilization earliest dated stela to have been found in situ in maya lowlands was recovered from great city of tikal in guatemala during classic period almost every maya kingdom in southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre stelae became closely associated with concept of divine kingship and declined at same time as this institution production of stelae by maya had its origin around 400 bc and continued through to end of classic period around 900 although some monuments were reused in postclassic c 900 1521 major city of calakmul in mexico raised greatest number of stelae known from any maya city at least 166 although they are very poorly preserved hundreds of stelae have been recorded in maya region displaying a wide stylistic variation many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text stelae in a few sites display a much more three dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits such as at copan and tonina plain stelae do not appear to have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration but most maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red yellow black blue and other colours stelae were essentially stone banners raised to glorify king and record his deeds although earliest examples depict mythological scenes imagery developed throughout classic period with early classic stelae c 250 600 displaying non maya characteristics from 4th century onwards with introduction of imagery linked to central mexican metropolis of teotihuacan this influence receded in 5th century although some minor teotihuacan references continued to be used in late 5th century maya kings began to use stelae to mark end of calendrical cycles in late classic c 600 900 imagery linked to mesoamerican ballgame was introduced once again displaying influence from central mexico by terminal classic institution of divine kingship declined and maya kings began to be depicted with their subordinate lords as classic period came to an end stelae ceased to be erected with last known examples being raised in 909 910 upright 1 7 thumb detail of stela b a high relief sculpture from copan

interlocking designs function function of maya stela was central to ideology of maya kingship from very beginning of classic period through to very end of terminal classic 800 900 hieroglyphic inscriptions on stelae of classic period site of piedras negras played a key part in decipherment of script with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart life of a particular individual with key dates being celebrated such as birth marriage and military victories from these stelae epigrapher tatiana proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised thumb left upright detail of a stela from arroyo de piedra later reused at dos pilas alt relief sculpture of an elaborately dressed figure facing right wearing an intricate headdress and cradling a staff in one arm epigrapher david stuart first proposed that maya regarded their stelae as te tun stone trees although he later revised his reading to meaning banner stone from lakam meaning banner in several mayan languages and tun meaning stone according to stuart this may refer to stelae as stone versions of vertical standards that once stood in prominent places in maya city centres as depicted in ancient maya graffiti name of modern lacandon maya is likely to be a colonial corruption of this word maya stelae were often arranged to impress viewer forming lines or other arrangements within ceremonial centre of city maya cities with a history of stonecarving that extended back into early classic preferred to pair their stelae with a circular altar which may have represented a cut tree trunk and have been used to perform human sacrifice given prevalence of sacrificial imagery on such monuments an alternative interpretation of these altars is that they were in fact thrones that were used by rulers during ceremonial events archaeologists believe that they probably also served as ritual pedestals for incense burners ceremonial fires and other offerings core purpose of a stela was to glorify king many maya stelae depict only king of city and describe his actions with hieroglyphic script even when individual depicted is not king himself text or scene usually relates subject to king openly declaring importance and power of king to community stela portrayed his wealth prestige and ancestry and depicted him wielding symbols of military and divine power stelae were raised to commemorate important events especially at end of a k atun 20 year cycle of maya calendar or to mark a quarter or a half k atun stela did not just mark off a period of time it has been argued that it physically embodied that period of time hieroglyphic texts on stelae describe how some of calendrical ceremonies required king to perform ritual dance and bloodletting at tikal twin pyramid groups were built to celebrate k atun ending and reflected maya cosmology these groups possessed pyramids on east and west sides that represented birth and death of sun on south side a nine building was situated in order to represent underworld on north side was a walled enclosure that represented celestial region it was left open to sky it was in this celestial enclosure that a stela altar pair was placed altar being a fitting throne for divine king calakmul practised a tradition that was unusual in maya area that of raising twin stelae depicting both king and his wife iconography of stelae remained reasonably stable during classic period since effectiveness of propaganda message of monument relied upon its symbolism being clearly recognisable to viewer however at times a shift in sociopolitical climate induced a change in iconography stelae were an ideal format for public propaganda since unlike earlier architectural sculpture they were personalised to a specific king could be arranged in public spaces and were portable allowing them to be moved and reset in a new location an important feature of stelae was that they were able to survive different phases of architectural construction unlike architectural sculpture itself with ability to portray an identifiable ruler bearing elite goods accompanied by hieroglyphic text and carrying out actions in service of kingdom stelae became one of most effective ways of delivering public propaganda in maya lowlands in 7th century copan king chan imix k awiil raised a series of seven stelae that marked boundary of most fertile land in copan valley an area of approximately as well as marking boundary they defined sacred geometry of city and referred to important seats of deities in ceremonial centre of copan ritual significance stelae were considered to be invested with holiness and perhaps even to contain a divine soul like essence that almost made them living beings some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and were considered to be participants in rituals conducted at their location such rituals in classic period appear to have included a k altun binding ritual in which stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth this ritual was closely tied to k atun ending calendrical ceremony a k altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at copan scene shows two nobles flanking a stela altar pair where stela seems to have been bound with cloth act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across mesoamerica and is well attested among maya right up to present day precise meaning of act is not clear but may be to protect bound object or to contain its sacred essence binding of stelae may be linked to modern k iche maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle a stela was not just considered a neutral portrait it was considered to be owned by subject whether that subject was a person or a god stela 3 from el zapote in guatemala is a small monument dating from early classic period front of stela bears a portrait of rain god yaxhal chaak clear water chaak accompanying text describes how deity yaxhal chaak himself was dedicated not just his image on stela this could be taken to imply that stela was seen as embodiment of deity and is also true of those stelae bearing royal portraits which were seen to be supernatural embodiment of ruler they represented stela combined with any accompanying altar was a perpetual enactment of royal ceremony in stone david stuart has stated that stelae do not simply commemorate past events and royal ceremonies but serve to perpetuate ritual act into eternity thus ascribing a magical effectiveness to stela depictions in same vein stelae bearing royal portraits may have been magically loaded extensions of royal person uba his self extremely powerful confirmations of political and religious authority stelae bearing images of multiple people for instance of several nobles performing a ritual or of a king with his war captives were likely to be exceptions to this idea of stela as sacred embodiment of subject at times when a new king came to power old stelae would be respectfully buried and replaced with new ones or they might be broken when a maya city was invaded by a rival it was pillaged by victors one of most striking archaeological markers of such an invasion is destruction of defeated city s stelae which were broken and cast down at end of preclassic around 150 ad this fate appears to have befallen important city of el mirador where most of stelae were found smashed manufacture thumb upright a typical stela altar pairing from takalik abaj both of them being plain monuments alt a tall plain standing stone behind a cog shaped flat stone in a grassy area with a jungle covered mound rising behind royal artisans were sometimes responsible for sculpting stelae in some cases these sculptors were actually sons of kings in other cases it is likely that captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for victors as evidenced by sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat this appears to have been case in piedras negras where stela 12 depicting war captives submitting to victorious king is carved in style of pomona defeated city archaeologists believe that this may also have been case with quirigua after its surprise defeat of its overlord copan stelae were usually crafted from quarried limestone although in southern maya area other types of stone were preferred volcanic tuff was used at copan to craft their stelae in three dimensions both limestone and tuff were easily worked when first quarried and hardened with exposure to elements at quirigua a hard red sandstone was used that was unable to reproduce three dimensionality of copan but was of sufficient strength that kings of city were able to raise tallest free standing stone monuments in americas maya lacked beasts of burden and did not employ wheel therefore freshly quarried blocks of stone had to be transported on rollers along maya causeways evidence of this has been found on causeways themselves where rollers have been recovered blocks were sculpted to their final form while still soft and they then hardened naturally with time stone was usually quarried locally but was occasionally transported over great distances calakmul in mexico was one of two powerful cities that shaped political landscape of classic period other being tikal it imported black slate for one stela from maya mountains more than away although calakmul raised greatest number of stelae known from any maya city they were sculpted from poor quality limestone and have suffered severe erosion rendering most of them illegible stelae could be of substantial size quirigua stela e measures from base to top including buried portion holding it in place this particular monument has a claim to being largest free standing stone monument in new world and weighs about stela 1 at ixkun is one of tallest monuments in peten basin measuring high not including buried portion and is roughly wide and thick maya stelae were worked with stone chisels and probably with wooden mallets were fashioned from flint and basalt and were used for shaping softer rocks used to make stelae while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels originally most were probably brightly painted in red yellow black blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments at copan and some other maya cities some traces of these pigments were found upon monuments generally all sides of a stela were sculpted with human figures and hieroglyphic text with each side forming a part of a single composition undecorated stelae in form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found throughout maya region these appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated with overlaid stucco sculpture dimensions of selected stelae site name location monument height

wooden monuments however tradition of raising stelae had its origin elsewhere in mesoamerica among olmecs of gulf coast of mexico in late preclassic it then spread into isthmus of tehuantepec and southwards along pacific coast to sites such as de corzo izapa and takalik abaj where mesoamerican long count calendar dates began to be carved onto stelae although at izapa stelae depicted mythological scenes at takalik abaj they began to show rulers in early classic maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts it was also at takalik abaj and izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars by approximately 400 bc near end of middle preclassic period early maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule at el porton in salama valley of highland guatemala a carved schist stela monument 1 was erected badly eroded hieroglyphs appear to be a very early form of maya writing and may even be earliest known example of maya script it was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela altar pairing that would become common across maya area stela 11 from kaminaljuyu a major preclassic highland city dates to middle preclassic and is earliest stela to depict a standing ruler sculpted preclassic stelae from kaminaljuyu and other cities in region such as chalchuapa in el salvador and chocola in pacific lowlands tend to depict political succession sacrifice and warfare these early stelae depicted rulers as warriors or wearing masks and headdresses of maya deities accompanied by texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns as well as recording their relationships with their ancestors stelae came to be displayed in large ceremonial plazas designed to display these monuments to maximum effect raising of stelae spread from pacific coast and adjacent highlands throughout maya area development of maya stelae coincides with development of divine kingship among classic maya in southern maya area late preclassic stelae impressed upon viewer achievements of king and his right to rule thus reinforcing both his political and religious power thumb right 400px location of olmec heartland relative to southern maya area alt map showing locations of olmec heartland to northwest and southern maya area southeast of it landmass is located in central america and bordered by pacific ocean to southwest gulf of mexico to northwest and atlantic ocean to east at middle preclassic city of nakbe in central lowlands maya sculptors were producing some of earliest lowland maya stelae depicting richly dressed individuals nakbe stela 1 has been dated to around 400 bc it was broken into pieces but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other and perhaps represents transference of power from one ruler to his successor however it also has features that recall myth of maya hero twins and would be earliest known presentation of them around 200 bc enormous nearby city of el mirador had started to erect stela like monuments bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable stela dating to late preclassic period are also known from sites of el tintal and san bartolo in guatemala and and pech in belize on pacific coast el stela 1 features a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to 36 ad it depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear with a double column of hieroglyphic text before him at takalik abaj are two stelae stela 2 and stela 5 depicting transfer of power from one ruler to another they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing each other with a column of hieroglyphic text between them long count date on stela 2 dates it to 1st century bc at latest while stela 5 has two dates latest of which is 126 ad stela was associated with burial of a human sacrifice and other offerings stela 13 at takalik abaj also dates to late preclassic a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels was found at its base together with 33 obsidian prismatic blades and other artefacts both stela and offering were associated with a nearby late preclassic royal tomb at cuello in belize a plain stela was raised around 100 ad in an open plaza at very end of preclassic period around 100 300 ad cities in highlands and along pacific coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts this cessation in production of stelae was most dramatic symptom of a general decline in region at this time this decline has been linked to intrusion of peoples from western highlands combined with disastrous eruption of ilopango volcano that severely affected entire region early classic in central peten lowlands rise of individual rule at cities like tikal required development of new forms of public imagery preclassic imagery had involved largely anonymous impersonal sculpture as an architectural element existing preclassic peten styles of architectural sculpture were combined with features of highland and pacific coast tradition to produce early classic maya stela features formerly found on architectural sculpture such as giant masks adorning preclassic pyramids were adapted for use on stelae for example so called jester god was transferred to headdress of ruler portrayed on tikal stela 29 which bears oldest long count date yet found in maya lowlands equating to 292 ad at some maya cities first appearance of stelae corresponded with foundation of dynastic rule standard form of maya stela incorporating art calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in maya lowlands after 250 ad late 4th century saw introduction of non maya imagery linked to giant metropolis of teotihuacan in valley of mexico this foreign influence is seen at tikal uaxactun rio azul and el zapote all in peten department of guatemala at tikal this was initiated by king yax nuun ayiin i from there it spread to his vassal cities in 5th century this strongly teotihuacan linked imagery was abandoned by yax nuun ayiin i s son siyaj chan k awiil ii who reintroduced imagery associated with pacific coast and adjacent highlands minor references to teotihuacan continued for example in form of teotihuacan war emblems his stela 31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in city centre almost directly above his tomb it depicts crowning of siyaj chan k awiil ii with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional maya style on sides of stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non maya style dressed as a teotihuacan warrior bearing central mexican atlatl spear thrower not adopted by maya and carrying a shield adorned with face of mexican god tlaloc reverse of stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing history of tikal including teotihuacan invasion that established yax nuun ayiin i and his dynasty in early classic period maya kings began to dedicate a new stela or other monument to mark end of each k atun cycle representing 7 200 days just under 20 sidereal years at tikal first to do so was king kan who ruled in late 5th century stela 9 from city is first dated monument raised to mark off a period of time it was raised in 475 late classic thumb upright hieroglyphic text on side of stela e at quirigua alt side of a stela divided into square panels containing sculpted in late classic sculpted images of rulers on stelae remained much same as in early classic appearing in profile in foreground and filling almost entire available space which is delimited by a frame imagery associated with mesoamerican ballgame started to appear in maya lowlands in late classic period maya kings are depicted as warriors wearing costume from mexican highlands including elements such as foreign god tlaloc and serpent such imagery appears in late classic on stelae from naranjo piedras negras and petexbatun cities of dos pilas and aguateca at dos pilas a pair of stelae represent king of city in costume forming a jaguar and eagle pairing characteristic of mexican warrior cult stelae were being erected by maya across entire central and southern maya lowlands by 790 an area that encompassed in north coba on eastern side of yucatan peninsula raised at least 23 large stelae although badly eroded their style and texts link them to cities from peten basin at southern periphery of maya region copan developed a new high relief style of stelae and in 652 twelfth king chan imix k awiil arranged a series of these stelae to define sacred geometry of city and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors his son and successor uaxaclajuun ub aah k awiil further developed this new high relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in city s great plaza that brought carving of stelae close to full in round three dimensional sculpture both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in dynastic sequence to justify their rule possibly linked to a break in dynastic sequence with death of eleventh king of copan after quirigua defeated its overlord copan in 738 it brought massive blocks of red sandstone from quarries from city and sculpted a series of enormous stelae that were biggest monolithic monuments ever raised by maya stela e stands over high and weighs more than 60 tons these stelae were shaped into a square cross section and were decorated on all four faces these stelae usually bear two images of quirigua king on front and back in a lower relief than that found at copan they feature highly complex panels of hieroglyphic text that are among most skillfully executed of all maya inscriptions in stone stelae have weathered well and display fine precision on part of sculptors terminal classic decline in erection of stelae is linked to decline in institution of divine kingship which began in late preclassic originally stelae depicted king with symbols of power sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir by terminal classic kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords who also played a prominent role in events depicted this reflected a decentralisation of power and bargaining between high ranking nobles so that king could maintain power but led to a progressive weakening of king s rule as position of king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger latter began to erect their own stelae a function that was formerly exclusive preserve of king himself some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states but even this did not last and they also ceased to erect monuments in pasion river region of peten rulers began to be portrayed as ballplayers on stelae seibal was first site in region to depict its rulers thus seventeen stelae were erected at seibal between 849 and 889 and show a mix of maya and foreign styles including a lord wearing beaked mask of ehecatl central mexican wind god with a mexican style speech scroll emerging from mouth some of these have a stylistic affinity with painted murals at cacaxtla a non maya site in central mexican state of tlaxcala this hybrid style seems to indicate that kings of seibal were maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland maya and central mexican sources some of more foreign looking stelae even bear non maya calendrical glyphs stelae at oxkintok to north in puuc region of yucatan peninsula divided face of stela into up to three levels each of which contained a different scene usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female representation of human figure differed from formal treatment in south and were simplified coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols as classic maya collapse swept across maya region city after city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements at important city of calakmul two stelae were raised in 800 and three more in 810 but these were last and city fell into silence at oxkintok last stela was raised in 859 stela 11 dated to 869 was last monument to ever be erected at once great city of tikal last known maya stelae bearing a long count calendrical date are tonina monument 101 which was erected in 909 to mark k atun ending that year and stela 6 from dated to 910 postclassic at copan ritual offerings were deposited around city s stelae until at least 1000 which may represent offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors or may be due to highland maya still regarding city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin a small number of sculpted stelae once stood at cerro quiac in guatemalan highlands and are presumed to have been erected by mam maya in 13th or 14th century at in belize classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small postclassic platforms dating to 15th or 16th century at la milpa also in belize at around time of spanish contact in late 16th century a tiny remnant maya population started to make offerings of conquest period pottery to stelae perhaps in an effort to invoke ancestors to help resist spanish onslaught a plain stela in twin pyramid group r at tikal was removed by local inhabitants some time during postclassic its accompanying altar was also moved but abandoned some distance from its original location some plain stelae were raised at in peten lakes region of guatemala in postclassic these were perhaps covered in stucco and painted this may represent a revival of ending ceremonies that occurred in classic period and reflected ties with northern yucatan discovery one of earliest accounts of maya stelae comes from diego garcia de palacio a spanish colonial official who described six of stelae at copan in a letter to king philip ii of spain written in 1576 juan galindo governor of peten visited copan in 1834 and noted sculpted high relief stelae there five years later american diplomat john lloyd stephens and british artist frederick catherwood arrived in war torn central america and set out for copan describing fifteen stelae in stephens incidents of travel in central america chiapas and yucatan published in 1841 stephens and catherwood noticed presence of red pigment on some of copan stelae stephens unsuccessfully attempted to buy ruins of quirigua and purchased copan for us 50 in with idea of shipping stelae to new york for display in a new museum in event he was prevented from shipping monuments down copan river by discovery of impassable rapids and all stelae remained at site while stephens was engaged on business elsewhere catherwood carried out a brief investigation of stelae at quirigua but found them very difficult to draw without a camera lucida due to their great height ambrosio tut governor of peten and colonel modesto mendez chief magistrate visited ruins of tikal in 1848 accompanied by eusebio lara who drew some of monuments there in 1852 modesto mendez went on to discover stela 1 and stela 5 at ixkun english explorer alfred maudslay arrived at quirigua in 1881 and cleared vegetation from stelae then travelled on to see stelae at copan in early 20th century an expedition by carnegie institution led by american mayanist sylvanus morley discovered a stela at uaxactun this period marked a change from efforts of individual explorers to those of institutions that funded archaeological exploration excavation and restoration collections notable collections of stelae on public display include an impressive series of 8th century monuments at quirigua and 21 stelae collected in sculpture museum at tikal national park both of which are world heritage sites in guatemala calakmul in mexico is another world heritage site that also includes many stelae regarded as outstanding examples of maya art copan in honduras also a world heritage site possesses over 10 finely carved stelae in site core alone museo nacional de arqueologia y etnologia national museum of archaeology and ethnology in guatemala city displays a number of fine stelae including three 9th century stelae from machaquila an 8th century stela from naranjo and other stelae from ixtutz kaminaljuyu la amelia piedras negras seibal tikal uaxactun and ucanal museo nacional de antropologia national museum of anthropology in mexico city has a small number of maya stelae on display san diego museum of man in california contains replicas of stelae from quirigua that were made in 1915 for pacific california exhibition many maya archaeological sites have stelae on display in their original locations in guatemala these include but are not limited to aguateca dos pilas el chal ixkun nakum seibal takalik abaj uaxactun and yaxha in mexico stelae may be seen at yaxchilan and site museum at tonina looting stelae have become threatened in modern times by plundering for sale on international art market many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport including power saws chisels acid and heat when a monument is well preserved looters attempt to cut off its face for transport even when successful this results in damage to inscriptions on sides of stela at worst this method results in complete fragmentation of stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by american museums and private collectors in past when such monuments are removed from their original context their historical meaning is lost although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location after 1970 there was a sharp drop in maya stelae available on new york art market due to ratification of a treaty with mexico that guarantees return of stolen pre columbian sculpture that was removed from country after ratification date in early 1970s some museums such as that of university of pennsylvania responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history including place of origin previous owners and an export license harvard university also instituted a similar policy in early 1970s in 1972 initially well preserved stela 5 at ixkun was smashed into pieces by looters who heated it until it shattered and then stole various pieces a number of remaining fragments of monument were rescued by archaeologist ian graham and transferred to mayor s office in dolores peten where they were eventually used as construction material before once again being recovered this time by atlas arqueologico de guatemala in 1989 and moved to their archaeological laboratory at nearby site of from ixkun most of stelae were robbed before site s existence was reported to guatemalan authorities by time archaeologists visited site in 1985 only 2 stelae remained in 1974 a dealer in pre columbian artefacts by name of arranged for illegal removal of machaquila stela 2 from guatemalan jungle he and his co conspirators were prosecuted in united states under national stolen property act and they were first people to be convicted under this act with reference to national patrimony laws act states whoever transports transmits or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods of value of 5 000 or more knowing same to have been stolen converted or taken by fraud s hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years or both w hoever receives possesses conceals stores barters sells or disposes of any goods which have crossed a state or united states boundary after being stolen unlawfully converted or taken knowing same to have been stolen unlawfully converted or taken is subject to fine or imprisonment act was originally intended to discourage handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that national stolen property act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into united states from a foreign nation and is therefore applicable in case of stolen cultural property under guatemalan law maya stelae and other archaeological artefacts are property of guatemalan government and may not be removed from country without its permission in case of machaquila stela 2 monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove stela itself was cut into pieces with face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in belize where it was packed into boxes and shipped to california there it was seized by federal bureau of investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions stolen portion of stela was returned to guatemala and is now in storage at museo nacional de arqueologia y etnologia in guatemala city looting has been linked to economic and political stability of possessing nation with levels of looting increasing during times of crisis it also appears that art collectors have stelae or portions of them stolen to order by browsing archaeological books and catalogues for desirable pieces examples of this may be found at aguateca and el peru both in guatemala s peten department where only better preserved hieroglyphs and human faces were cut away see also copan altar q olmec colossal heads pascual abaj potbelly sculpture yaxchilan lintel 24 notes citations references further reading stelae maya
