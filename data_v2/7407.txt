grew out of a class topic at smithsonian regarding intellectual life in edinburgh in 18th century herman was impressed by fact that so many prominent individuals who had a significant impact on modernity had come from such a specific geographic location and time frame herman had only once been to scotland as a teenager when his father a professor spent a semester at edinburgh university though born and raised in midwestern united states his ancestry traces back to norway there are no scots in his ancestral background of whom he is aware synopsis book is divided into two parts first part epiphany consists of eight chapters and focuses on roots development and impact of scottish enlightenment on scotland and great britain roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from scottish reformation when john knox brought calvinist presbyterianism to scotland he preached that god ordained power into people and that it was for people to administer and enforce god s laws not monarchy for common people to understand god s laws they had to be able to read bible so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly creating a scottish oriented market for books and writers though they each resented one another english and scots joined in 1707 to form kingdom of great britain english wanted scots controlled and scots realized they could not match english power scots immediately benefited from a centralized government that paid little attention to it for example inexpensive imports reduced impacts of famines and allowed a scottish culture to flourish herman calls scottish enlightenment more robust and original than french enlightenment and that product of scottish school was that humans are creatures of their environment constantly evolving and trying to understand itself via social sciences defeat of 1745 jacobite rising decimated antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains this liberalized scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land and keep profits instead of giving all profits to chieftains who owned all land their literate foundation allowed scots to become economically literate and take advantage of trade edinburgh and glasgow became epicenters of intellectual thought there existed in scotland a clergy who believed that a moral and religious foundation was required for and compatible with a free and open sophisticated culture which moderated hardline conservatives herman presents biographies of francis hutcheson henry home lord kames robert adam adam smith and others to illustrate scottish development second part diaspora focuses on impacts of scots on events world and industries most scots immigrants in american colonies sympathized with british during american revolutionary war but those who did fight in militias were most capable because many were same refugee families from 1745 jacobite rising herman claims that scottish school of common sense influenced much of american declaration of independence and constitution herman 263 264 after great britain lost american colonies a second generation of scottish intellectuals saved britain from stagnation and reinforced a self confidence that allowed country to manage a world empire during victorian era scots in india like james mill led british idea of liberal imperialism that they had to take over indigenous cultures and run their society for their own good white nationalist euphemism white man s burden herman claims that sir walter scott invented historical novel giving modernity a self conscious antidote and gave literature a place as part of modern life herman 291 319 in science and industry herman states that james watt s steam engine gave capitalism its modern face which has persisted down to today herman 320 321 it permitted business to choose its location like in cities close to inexpensive labor and it was scots who rectified negative impacts industry had i e public health movement scots contribution to modern society is illustrated with biographies of scots like dugald stewart john witherspoon john mcadam thomas telford and john pringle among others style herman wrote book for an american audience which may not have been very familiar with scottish history he provides a historical overview and short biographies of most prominent scots historical approach uses great man theory that a historical narrative can be told through lives of a few prominent figures regarding this approach michael lynch of globe and mail wrote biographies reveal subtle but important links between these figures and their ideas which herman seeks to characterize with some success as a coherent body of distinctively scottish thought one reviewer noted

title and thesis that people of scotland invented modern world nearly every reviewer commented on it some calling it provocative a hyperbole absurd and pandering to prejudice in scotsman graham leicester writes that overblown rhetoric invites a sceptical reaction but i suggest we just accept this extraordinary compliment graciously it was likely influenced by thomas cahill s how irish saved civilization and result of a marketing strategy several reviewers found that herman was successful in proving that scots did have a disproportionate impact on modernity herman continued this type of theme with his next book to rule waves how british navy shaped modern world published in 2004 critics found book well written and scholarly but with an over reaching thesis reviewer for national review defended herman s use of word invented writing that it has an older meaning to discover and understand scots did not like a number of their french counterparts seek to construct a new world they instead tried to understand certain traditions and institutions that had spontaneously arisen in course of man s work but that were still misunderstood even by many intelligent observers in scotsman reviewer george wrote that herman may have successfully proven his thesis but does not satisfactorily account for why scotland irvine welsh accused herman of neglecting or down playing some of unfavourable actions by scots like highland clearances prominence in slave trade and formation of ku klux klan reviewer for national interest noted that herman s study falls short of explaining why
