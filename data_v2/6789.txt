spacewar is a space combat video game developed in 1962 by steve russell in collaboration with martin graetz and wayne wiitanen and programmed by russell with assistance from others including bob saunders and steve piner it was written for newly installed dec pdp 1 at massachusetts institute of technology after its initial creation spacewar was expanded further by other students and employees of universities in area including dan edwards and peter samson it was also spread to many of few dozen primarily academic installations of pdp 1 computer making spacewar first known video game to be played at multiple computer installations game features two spaceships needle and wedge engaged in a dogfight while maneuvering in gravity well of a star both ships are controlled by human players each ship has limited fuel for maneuvering and a limited number of torpedoes and ships follow newtonian physics remaining in motion even when player is not accelerating flying near star to provide a gravity assist was a common tactic ships are destroyed when hit by a torpedo colliding with star or colliding with each other at any time player can engage a hyperspace feature to move to a new random location on screen though each use has an increasing chance of destroying ship instead game was initially controlled with switches on pdp 1 though bob saunders built an early gamepad to reduce difficulty and awkwardness of controlling game spacewar is one of most important and influential games in early history of video games it was extremely popular in small programming community in 1960s and was widely ported to other computer systems at time it has also been recreated in more modern programming languages for pdp 1 emulators it directly inspired many other electronic games such as first commercial arcade video games galaxy game and computer space 1971 and later games such as asteroids 1979 in 2007 spacewar was named to a list of ten most important video games of all time which formed start of game canon at library of congress background thumb left steve russell designer and main programmer of initial version of spacewar in 2007 during 1950s various computer games were created in context of academic computer and programming research and for demonstrations of computing power especially after introduction later in decade of smaller and faster computers on which programs could be created and run in real time as opposed to being executed in batches a few programs however while used to showcase power of computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products these were generally created by undergraduate and graduate students and university employees such as at massachusetts institute of technology mit where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for tx 0 experimental computer these interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers many of them students and university employees affiliated with tech model railroad club tmrc led by alan kotok peter samson and bob saunders games included tic tac toe which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against computer and mouse in maze which used a light pen to set up a maze of walls for a virtual mouse to traverse in fall of 1961 a digital equipment corporation dec pdp 1 minicomputer was installed in kludge room on 2nd floor of building 26 location of mit electrical engineering department pdp 1 was to complement older tx 0 and even before its arrival a group of students and university employees had been brainstorming ideas for programs that would demonstrate new computer s capabilities in a compelling way three of them steve russell then an employee at harvard university and a former research assistant at mit martin graetz a research assistant and former student at mit and wayne wiitanen a research assistant at harvard and former employee and student at mit referring to their collaboration as hingham institute as graetz and wiitanen were living in a tenement building on hingham street in cambridge massachusetts came up with idea for spacewar we had this brand new pdp 1 steve russell told rolling stone in a 1972 interview somebody marvin minsky had built some little pattern generating programs which made interesting patterns like a kaleidoscope not a very good demonstration here was this display that could do all sorts of good things so we started talking about it figuring what would be interesting displays we decided that probably you could make a two dimensional maneuvering sort of thing and decided that naturally obvious thing to do was spaceships gameplay thumb upright recreation of spacewar in java gameplay of spacewar involves two monochrome spaceships called needle and wedge each controlled by a player attempting to shoot one another while maneuvering on a two dimensional plane in gravity well of a star set against backdrop of a starfield ships fire torpedoes which are not affected by gravitational pull of star ships have a limited number of torpedoes and a limited supply of fuel which is used when player fires his thrusters torpedoes are fired one at a time by flipping a toggle switch on computer or pressing a button on control pad and there is a cooldown period between launches ships follow newtonian physics remaining in motion even when player is not accelerating though ships can rotate at a constant rate without inertia each player controls one of ships and must attempt to shoot down other ship while avoiding a collision with star or each other flying near star can provide a gravity assist to player at risk of misjudging trajectory and falling into star if a ship moves past one edge of screen it reappears on other side in a wraparound effect a hyperspace feature or panic button can be used as a last ditch means to evade enemy torpedoes by moving player s ship to another location on screen after disappearing for a few seconds but reentry from hyperspace occurs at a random location and in some versions there is an increasing probability of ship exploding with each use player controls include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation forward thrust firing torpedoes and hyperspace initially these were controlled using front panel test switches on pdp 1 minicomputer with four switches for each player but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay as well as causing players to accidentally flip computer s control and power switches location of switches also left one player off to one side of crt display due to limited space in front of computer which left them at a disadvantage to alleviate these problems saunders created a detached control device essentially an early gamepad gamepad had a switch for turning left or right another for forward thrust or hyperspace and a torpedo launch button button was silent so that opposing player would not have a warning that player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period development thumb right upright cerf playing spacewar on computer history museum s pdp 1 at a 2007 meeting in fall of 1961 while discussing ideas for a program for pdp 1 russell had finished reading lensman series by e e doc smith and thought stories would make a good basis for program his heroes had a strong tendency to get pursued by villain across galaxy and have to invent their way out of their problem while they were being pursued that sort of action was thing that suggested spacewar he had some very glowing descriptions of spaceship encounters and space fleet maneuvers other influences cited by fellow programmer martin graetz include e e smith s skylark novels and japanese pulp fiction tokusatsu movies for first few months after its installation pdp 1 programming community at mit focused on simpler programs to work out how to create software for computer community had heard of spacewar concept however and understood that russell would spearhead development of it when members of community began to feel time was right to start work on game russell nicknamed slug because of his tendency to began providing various excuses as to why he could not start programming game one of these was lack of a trigonometric function routine needed to calculate trajectories of spacecraft this prompted alan kotok of tmrc to call dec who informed him that they had such a routine already written kotok drove to dec to pick up a tape containing code slammed it down in front of russell and asked what other excuses he had russell later explaining that i looked around and i didn t find an excuse so i had to settle down and do some figuring started writing code in december 1961 game was developed to meet three precepts russell graetz and wiitanen had developed for creating a program that functioned equally well as an entertainment experience for players and as a demonstration for spectators to use as much of computer s resources as possible to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different and to be entertaining and therefore a game it took russell with assistance from other programmers including bob saunders and steve piner but not wiitanen who had been called up by united states army reserve about 200 man hours to write first version of spacewar or around six weeks to develop basic game left thumb alt screenshot of code used to produce planetarium excerpt from expensive planetarium star charts russell had a program with a movable dot by january 1962 and an early operational game with rotatable spaceships by february two spaceships were designed to evoke curvy spaceship from buck rogers stories and pgm 11 redstone rocket that early version also contained a randomly generated background star field initially added by russell because a blank background made it difficult to tell relative motion of two spaceships at slow speeds programming community in area including hingham institute and tmrc had developed what was later termed hacker ethic whereby all programs were freely shared and modified by other programmers in a collaborative environment without concern for ownership or copyright which led to a group effort to elaborate on russell s initial spacewar game consequently since inaccuracy and lack of realism in starfield annoyed tmrc member peter samson he wrote a program based on real star charts that scrolled slowly through night sky including every star in a band between 22 5deg n and 22 5deg s down to fifth magnitude displayed at their relative brightness program was called expensive planetarium referring to high price of pdp 1 computer compared to an analog planetarium as part of series of expensive programs like piner s expensive typewriter and was quickly incorporated into game in march by russell who served as of primary version of game thumb right spacewar on computer history museum s pdp 1 in 2007 initial version of game also did not include central star gravity well or hyperspace feature they were written by mit graduate student and tmrc member dan edwards and graetz respectively to add elements of a strategy to what initially was a shooter game of pure reflexes initial version of hyperspace function was limited to three jumps but carried no risk save possibly re entering game in a dangerous position later versions removed limit but added increasing risk of destroying ship instead of moving it additionally during this development period kotok and saunders created gamepads for game game was a multiplayer only game because computer had no resources left over to handle controlling other ship similarly other proposed additions to game such as a more refined explosion display upon destruction of a spaceship and having torpedoes also be affected by gravity had to be abandoned as there were not enough computer resources to handle them while smoothly running game with added features and changes spacewar was essentially complete by late april 1962 and became exhibited at mit s room russell and other programmers shifted focus from developing game to preparing to show it off to others such as at mit science open house in may group added a time limit as well as a larger second screen for viewers at demonstration and that same month graetz presented a paper about game spacewar real time capability of pdp 1 at first meeting of digital equipment computer users society demonstration was a success and game proved very popular at mit laboratory that hosted pdp 1 soon banned play except during lunch and after working hours visitors such as frederik pohl enjoyed playing lovely game editor of galaxy science fiction wrote that mit was borrowing from science fiction magazines with players able to pretend to be skylark characters beginning in summer of 1962 and continuing over next few years members of pdp 1 programming community at mit including russell and other hingham institute members began to spread out to other schools and employers such as stanford university and dec and as they did they spread game to other universities and institutions with a pdp 1 computer as a result spacewar was perhaps first video game to be available outside a single research institute over next decade programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants including features such as allowing more ships and players at once replacing hyperspace feature with a cloaking device space mines and even a first person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot s view out of cockpit some of these spacewar installations also replicated saunders gamepad according to a second hand account heard by russell while working at dec spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by dec technicians on new pdp 1 systems before shipping because it was only available program that exercised every aspect of hardware although game was widespread for era it was still very limited in its direct reach pdp 1 was priced at us 120 000 and only 55 were ever sold most without a monitor and many of remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time which prevented original spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow academic audience though some later dec models such as pdp 6 came with spacewar pre loaded audience for game remained very limited pdp 6 for example sold only 23 units legacy thumb two users playing spacewar on a pdp 12 at vintage computer festival spacewar was extremely popular in small programming community in 1960s and was widely recreated on other minicomputer and mainframe computers of time before migrating to early microcomputer systems in 1970s early computer scientist alan kay noted in 1972 that game of spacewar blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a computer and graetz recalled in 1981 that as game initially spread it could be found on just about any research computer that had a programmable crt majority of this spread took place several years after initial development of game while there are early anecdotes of players and game variants at a handful of locations primarily near mit and stanford it was only after 1967 that computers hooked up to monitors or terminals capable of playing spacewar began to proliferate allowing game to reach a wider audience and influence later video game designers by 1971 it is estimated that there were over 1000 computers with monitors rather than a few dozen it is around this time that majority of game variants were created for various computer systems such as later pdp systems and in 1972 game was well known enough in programming community that rolling stone sponsored intergalactic spacewar olympics event was held on october 19 1972 at artificial intelligence laboratory of stanford university and was first ever video game tournament in early 1970s spacewar migrated from large computer systems to a commercial setting as it formed basis for first two coin operated video games while playing spacewar at stanford sometime between 1966 and 1969 college student hugh tuck remarked that a coin operated version of game would be very successful while high price of a minicomputer prevented such a game from being feasible then in 1971 tuck and bill pitts created a prototype coin operated computer game galaxy game with a us 20 000 pdp 11 around same time a second prototype coin operated game based on spacewar computer space was developed by nolan bushnell and ted dabney which would become first commercially sold arcade video game and first widely available video game of any kind though tuck felt that computer space was a poor imitation of spacewar and his game a superior adaptation many players believed both of games to be upgraded variants of spacewar byte magazine published an assembly language version of spacewar in 1977 that ran on altair 8800 and other intel 8080 based microcomputers using an oscilloscope as graphical display and a lookup table for orbits as well as a three dimensional variant in 1979 written in tiny basic more modern recreations of game for computers have been made as well an emulated version of original game made publicly available by martin graetz and running in a javascript pdp 1 emulator was made available to play on internet in 2012 only working pdp 1s that are known to exist are kept in computer history museum in mountain view california where demonstrations of machine are held which include playing spacewar in addition to galaxy game and computer space numerous other games have been directly inspired by spacewar these include 1974 plato network computers space wars 1977 arcade and space war 1978 atari 2600 additionally in asteroids 1979 designer ed used elements from spacewar namely hyperspace button and shape of player s ship products as late as 1990 computer game star control drew direct inspiration from spacewar russell has been quoted as saying that aspect of game that he was most pleased with was number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games without feeling restricted to using russell s own code or design on march 12 2007 new york times reported that spacewar was named to a list of ten most important video games of all time so called game canon which were proposed to be archived in library of congress library of congress took up this video game preservation proposal and began with games from this list on november 29 2018 academy of interactive arts sciences awarded pioneer award
