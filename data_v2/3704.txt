commissioned into fleet nearly three years later ships of her class were already outdated by time they entered service being inferior in size armor firepower and speed to new generation of dreadnought battleships schleswig holstein fought in both world wars during world war i she saw front line service in ii battle squadron of high seas fleet culminating in battle of jutland on 31 may 1 june 1916 schleswig holstein saw action during engagement and was hit by one large caliber shell after battle schleswig holstein was relegated to guard duty in mouth of elbe river before being decommissioned in

vizeadmiral vadmvice admiral alfred von tirpitz secured funding for construction of twenty new battleships over next seventeen years first group five s were laid down in early 1900s and shortly thereafter design work began on a follow on design which became deutschland class ships were broadly similar to braunschweigs and featured incremental improvements in armor protection they also abandoned gun turrets for secondary battery guns moving them back to traditional casemates to save weight british battleship armed with ten 12 inch 30 5 cm gunswas commissioned in december 1906 dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered obsolete every capital ship of german navy including schleswig holstein schleswig holstein had a length of a beam of and a draft of she displaced normally and up to at combat loading she was equipped with three triple expansion engines and twelve coal fired water tube boilers that produced a rated and a top speed of in addition to being fastest ship of her class schleswig holstein was second most fuel efficient at a cruising speed of she could steam for she had a standard crew of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men ship s primary armament consisted of

holstein gave commissioning speech upon completion schleswig holstein was commissioned for sea trials on 6 july 1908 her crew largely came from her sister ship on 21 september ship was assigned to ii battle squadron of high seas fleet alongside her sister ships in november fleet and unit exercises were conducted in baltic sea training regimen in which schleswig holstein participated followed a similar pattern over next five years fleet maneuvers were conducted in spring followed by a summer cruise to norway and additional fleet training in fall this included another cruise into atlantic from 7 july to 1 august 1909 starting in september 1910 friedrich took command of ship a position he held for next three years on 3 october 1911 ship was transferred back to ii squadron due to agadir crisis in july summer cruise only went into baltic in 1913 she won kaiser s schiesspreis gunnery award on 14 july 1914 annual summer cruise to norway began but threat of war in europe cut excursion short within two weeks schleswig holstein and rest of ii squadron had returned to wilhelmshaven world war i at outbreak of war in july 1914 schleswig holstein was assigned to guard duty in mouth of elbe river while rest of fleet mobilized in late october she and her sisters were sent to kiel to have improvements made to their underwater protection system to make them more resistant to torpedoes and mines after which ii battle squadron rejoined fleet squadron covered rear admiral franz von hipper s battlecruisers of i scouting group while they bombarded scarborough hartlepool and whitby on 15 16 december 1914 during operation german battle fleet of some 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six british battleships however skirmishes between rival destroyer screens convinced german commander admiral friedrich von ingenohl that he was confronted with entire grand fleet and so he broke off engagement and turned fleet for home in april 1916 ship had two of her 8 8 cm guns removed and replaced with 8 8 cm flak guns schleswig holstein then participated in a fleet advance to dogger bank on 21 22 april 1915 on 11 12 september ii reconnaissance group conducted a minelaying operation off swarte bank with ii squadron in support this was followed by another sweep by fleet on 23 24 october that ended without result ii and iii battle squadron dreadnoughts conducted an advance into north sea on 5 7 march 1916 schleswig holstein and rest of ii squadron remained in german bight ready to sail in support they then rejoined fleet during operation to bombard yarmouth and lowestoft on 24 25 april during this operation battlecruiser was damaged by a british mine and had to return to port prematurely visibility was poor so operation was quickly called off before british fleet could intervene battle of jutland thumb diagram of battle of jutland showing major movements alt german fleet sailed to north and met british fleet sailing from west both fleets conducted a series of turns and maneuvers during chaotic battle commander of high seas fleet admiral reinhard scheer immediately planned another advance into north sea but damage to seydlitz delayed operation until end of may as last ship assigned to iv division of ii battle squadron rearmost german formation schleswig holstein was last battleship in line ii battle squadron was commanded by rear admiral during run to north scheer ordered fleet to pursue retreating battleships of british 5th battle squadron at top speed schleswig holstein and her sisters were significantly slower than dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind during this period admiral scheer directed to place herself behind schleswig holstein so he would have a flagship on either end of formation by 19 30 grand fleet had arrived on scene and confronted admiral scheer with significant numerical superiority german fleet was severely hampered by presence of slower deutschland class ships if scheer had ordered an immediate turn towards germany he would have had to sacrifice slower ships to make his escape admiral scheer decided to reverse course of fleet with gefechtskehrtwendung a maneuver that required every unit in german line to turn 180deg simultaneously having fallen behind ships of ii battle squadron could not conform to new course following turn and fell to disengaged side of german line admiral mauve considered moving his ships to rear of line astern of iii battle squadron dreadnoughts but decided against it when he realized movement would interfere with maneuvering of hipper s battlecruisers instead he attempted to place his ships at head of line but by time ii squadron reached its position at head of line scheer had ordered another gefechtskehrtwendung which placed them at rear of german fleet by 21 00 scheer had turned fleet around a third time but slow speed of schleswig holstein and her squadron mates caused them to fall out of position to disengaged side of fleet later on first day of battle hipper s badly damaged battlecruisers were being engaged by their british rivals schleswig holstein and other so called five minute ships came to their aid by steaming in between opposing battlecruiser squadrons these ships were very briefly engaged owing in large part to poor visibility visibility was so bad gunners aboard schleswig holstein could not make out a target and she did not fire her main guns at 21 35 a heavy caliber shell struck ship on port side punching a hole approximately 40 cm 16 in wide before exploding against inner casemate armor it tore apart of superstructure deck and disabled one of port side casemate guns three men were killed and nine were wounded admiral mauve halted fight against much more powerful battlecruisers and ordered an 8 point turn to starboard late on 31st fleet re formed for night voyage back to germany with schleswig holstein towards rear of line ahead of hannover and battlecruisers and around 03 00 british destroyers conducted a series of attacks against fleet some of which were directed towards schleswig holstein shortly thereafter pommern was struck by at least one torpedo from destroyer hit detonated an ammunition magazine destroying ship in a tremendous explosion during attack schleswig holstein was forced to turn away to avoid destroyers torpedoes shortly after 05 00 hannover and several other ships fired repeatedly at what they falsely believed to be british submarines despite ferocity of night fighting high seas fleet punched through british destroyer forces and reached horns reef by 4 00 on 1 june german fleet reached wilhelmshaven a few hours later where undamaged dreadnoughts of and es took up defensive positions over course of battle schleswig holstein had fired only twenty 17 cm rounds later actions schleswig holstein was put into dock for repairs 10 25 june 1916 navy then decided to withdraw four remaining deutschland class ships owing to their obsolescence and vulnerability to underwater attacks as demonstrated by loss of pommern thereafter ship was used as a target for u boats except during 12 23 february 1917 when she was used as a guard ship in april schleswig holstein was sent to altenbruch at mouth of elbe here she was decommissioned on 2 may schleswig holstein was then disarmed and assigned to 5th u boat flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in bremerhaven in 1918 ship was moved to kiel where she remained for rest of war inter war years thumb schleswig holstein transiting kaiser wilhelm canal in 1932 following german defeat in world war i german navy was reorganized as reichsmarine according to treaty of versailles new navy was permitted to retain eight pre dreadnought battleships under article 181 two of which would be in reserve for coastal defense schleswig holstein was among ships that were retained along with her sisters hannover and schlesien and several of braunschweig class battleships schleswig holstein was recommissioned as new fleet flagship on 31 january 1926 following an extensive refit with new fire controls and an enlarged aft superstructure for admiral s staff secondary 17 cm guns were replaced with pieces and four 50 cm torpedo tubes were fitted in main deck casemates fore and aft replacing submerged tubes schleswig holstein and her sister hannover went on a training cruise into atlantic that lasted from 14 may to 17 june 1926 while on cruise she visited palma de mallorca in mediterranean from 22 to 30 may she stopped in barcelona with from 1 to 7 june and then proceeded to vigo from 12 to 14 june where she joined hessen elsass and hannover there chief of fleet vice admiral konrad mommsen met with king alfonso xiii schleswig holstein went on another training cruise between 30 march and 14 june 1927 into atlantic she visited a series of iberian ports including lisbon portugal where mommsen was greeted by oscar carmona president of portugal in december 1927 schleswig holstein went back into dock re emerging in january 1928 with her trunked back into second and both remaining funnels heightened as had previously been done with her sister schlesien with delivery of new panzerschiffe armored ships beginning in 1933 older battleships were gradually withdrawn from front line service in may 1935 reichsmarine was reorganized as kriegsmarine by reforms instituted by adolf hitler that created wehrmacht schleswig holstein ceased to be fleet flagship on 22 september 1935 and was refitted as a cadet training ship during january march and may july 1936 changes included removing her remaining upper deck 15 cm guns and her torpedo tubes and her two aft boiler rooms were converted to oil firing models although forward boilers remained coal fired ship s standard complement was also reduced from 35 officers and 708 enlisted men to 31 officers and 565 sailors crew was supplemented by 175 cadets who were taken on long cruises in schlesien and schleswig holstein latter sailing in october 1936 on a six month voyage to south america and caribbean following year her cruise took her around africa and 1938 39 cruise went back to south american and caribbean waters gustav kieseritzky served as ship s commander from june 1938 until april 1939 in mid 1930s hitler began pursuing an increasingly aggressive foreign policy in 1936 he re militarized rhineland and in 1938 completed anschluss of austria and annexation of czechoslovakia he then demanded german control over city of danzig which had become a free city after world war i world war ii thumb schleswig holstein

westerplatte under guise of a ceremonial visit in august around 04 47 on 1 september schleswig holstein opened fire with her main battery at polish positions on westerplatte and in doing so fired first shots of world war ii these shots were signal for ground troops to begin their assault on installation though first german ground attack in battle of westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter a second assault began later that morning again supported by schleswig holstein though it too had failed to break into installation by around noon schleswig holstein was joined on 4 september by torpedo boats t196 and von der a force of german infantry and army engineers went ashore to take fortress with heavy fire support from schleswig holstein poles managed to hold off germans until they were forced to surrender on 7 september at 10 30 following polish surrender schleswig holstein began shelling polish positions at hel and these operations lasted until 13 september between 25 and 27 september old battleship returned to hel with her sister schlesien both vessels conducted further bombardments of still manned polish positions there german military then turned its attention westward and in april 1940 invaded denmark schleswig holstein was assigned to naval component of invasion force during invasion ship was briefly grounded off danish coast following operation she was transferred back to training duties as flagship of chief of training units at end of 1943 reactivation of schleswig holstein was once again contemplated in her favor was fact that she retained some coal fired boilers given ever worsening oil supply situation thus on 1 february 1944 she was once again recommissioned at first taking up her old role as a cadet training ship then later in year docking at gotenhafen gdynia for a refit she was to be converted into a convoy escort ship with a greatly enhanced anti aircraft armament but after being hit three times by royal air force bombers on 18 december 1944 she eventually foundered in shallow water as ship was permanently disabled her crew was sent ashore to assist in defense of marienburg following soviet capture of that city remaining crew detonated scuttling charges in wreck on 21 march to further destroy ship after war ship was raised during 1945 46 by soviet navy and transferred to tallinn although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in marienburg in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long term use as a target in shallow water off island of in gulf of finland last used for target practice around 1966 remains are now submerged her bell was held in collection of military history museum of bundeswehr in dresden as of 1990 footnotes notes citations references online sources
