bramble cay melomys or bramble cay mosaic tailed rat melomys rubicola is a recently extinct species of rodent in family muridae and subfamily murinae it was an endemic species of isolated bramble cay a vegetated coral cay located at northern tip of great barrier reef in australia described by researchers as having last been seen in 2009 and declared extinct by queensland government and university of queensland researchers in 2016 it was formally declared extinct by international union for conservation of nature iucn in may 2015 and australian government in february 2019 having been only mammal endemic to reef its extinction was described as first extinction of a mammal species due to anthropogenic climate change taxonomy bramble cay melomys is an extinct member of genus melomys which contains approximately 20 species of rodents living in wet habitats of northern australia far north queensland new guinea torres strait islands and islands of indonesian archipelago genus is in subfamily murinae and family muridae bramble cay melomys was first discovered in april 1845 by charles yule commander of british ship hms bramble on bramble cay a vegetated coral cay measuring located at northern tip of great barrier reef at that time animal was so plentiful that his crew shot them with bows and arrows for fun in may 1845 while visiting bramble cay via hms fly naturalist john macgillivray and joseph jukes collected a holotype stored today in british museum of natural history from specimen oldfield thomas formally described and named species melomys rubicola in 1924 description melomys rubicola was relatively large for a mouse with a body length ranging from and a tail length between compared to other mice it had a long tail short ears and large feet its weight was recorded as between tail was prehensile at tip and covered with rough scales fur was reddish brown above and greyish brown below with black guard hairs on its back it was similar in appearance to cape york melomys to which it was closely related as with other species of melomys it was described as having a roman nose distribution and ecology thumb bramble cay melomys was endemic to a low lying cay in torres strait scientists are uncertain on how animal reached bramble cay studies have theorised that it either reached bramble cay from island of new guinea by floating on driftwood or that it reached region when it was still above water at a time when australia was connected to new guinea by a land bridge and then persisted into recent times bramble cay melomys was described in 2002 as australia s most isolated mammal cay is located in northeastern portion of torres strait approximately from mouth of fly river in papua new guinea cay is between but rodent only occupied vegetated portion of island measuring approximately vegetation of island comprises grasses and herbs generally shorter than 11 species of plants have been recorded on island common ones include oleracea cenchrus and amaranthus viridis island was also characterised by large populations of seabirds as well as ecological disturbance caused by annual green turtle breeding bramble cay melomys preferred more densely vegetated areas and avoided those parts of island that had high densities of seabirds species was observed to feed on p oleracea as well as on turtle eggs breeding season of species was lengthy and sex ratio was skewed towards females population estimates for species varied widely observers in 1845 stated there were hundreds of animal present as did a survey from 1978 a 1998 survey captured 42 animals and based on that estimated population size at approximately 90 individuals subsequent surveys in 2002 and 2004 only captured 10 and 12 individuals respectively population was variously estimated as fewer than 50 mature individuals and as fewer than 100 individuals in 2008 status and conservation thumb left bramble cay as seen from a boat during a comprehensive survey of bramble cay melomys in 2014 habitat of species was generally described as being vulnerable to severe weather and rising sea level as a result of its low elevation island does not rise further than above sea level last known sighting of species was reported by researchers in 2009 surveys in 2011 failed to find animal after a short survey in 2014 found no trace of species scientists set out to conduct a thorough search and capture any remaining creatures in order to start a captive breeding program however after taking five months to get necessary permissions when they arrived in 2015 they could not find a single melomys in june 2016 researchers from queensland s department of environment and heritage protection and university of queensland jointly reported that species had indeed become extinct adding significantly this probably represents first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change international union for conservation of nature listed species as extinct in same year based on an assessment from may 2015 however writing in australian geographic lauren smith stated authors of report do note that there is a slight chance that there s an as yet unknown population of species in papua new guinea around fly river delta area and that until that area is adequately surveyed bramble cay melomys should have tag possibly extinct added to iucn red listing australian government s department of environment and energy formally recognised extinction of bramble cay melomys on 18 february 2019 state government of queensland report stated that likely cause of extinction was inundation of island multiple times during last decade leading to habitat loss for species and possibly also direct mortality sea level had been estimated to have risen by every year between 1993 and 2010 while incidence of large increases in sea level associated with cyclonic storms also increased commentary on extinction queensland government report also stated significantly this probably represents first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change report said root cause of extinction was sea level rise as a consequence of global warming senior scientist for climate change biology with conservation international lee hannah said species could have been saved ornithologist john woinarski of charles darwin university said that extinction was foreseeable and preventable it had been known for years that its position was precarious he believed that its loss is at least partly due to under funding for conservation programs and fact that it was not an animal charismatic enough to garner much public attention in a 2016 paper woinarski and others had stated that bramble cay melomys was one of three vertebrates endemic to australia that went extinct between 2009 and 2014 and that each of three extinctions had been preventable according to sydney morning herald a 2008 recovery plan had understated risks to its survival recovery plan had stated that likely consequences of climate change including sea level rise and increase in frequency and intensity of tropical storms are unlikely to have any major impact on survival of bramble cay melomys in life of this plan first dog on moon published a cartoon tribute to bramble cay melomys entitled a moment of silence for bramble cay melomys another victim of climate
