circus company and lion circus vasan employed kamala for a month circus scenes were shot by k ramnoth kittoo reminisced about cinematographer s work in those days we had no zoom lenses and yet ramnoth did it one night while chandralekha is performing on flying trapeze she notices villain s henchman in front row she is on her perch high up and he is seated in a ringside chair shock hits her and to convey shock camera zooms fast from her to man today with a fast zoom shot it can be done very easily but there was no such lens forty years ago ramnoth did it using crane he planned it well and rehearsed shot for long he took shot 20 times and selected best take after raghavachari s departure drum dance scene he directed remained in film scene involved 400 dancers and six months of daily rehearsals it was designed by chief art director a k sekhar choreographed by and filmed with four cameras by kamal ghosh randor guy estimated that scene cost about us 105 000 in 1948 in his 2015 book madras studios narrative genre and ideology in tamil cinema swarnavel eswaran pillai estimated that scene cost entire budget of a typical tamil film of period scene included kathakali and bharatanatyam classical dances and sri lankan kandyan dance a vincent who later became an established cinematographer and director in malayalam cinema assisted ghosh in this film during post production vasan asked ramnoth his opinion of scene when hundreds of veerasimhan s warriors storm palace to rescue chandralekha from sasankan although scene s photography shots and action had been unanimously praised by others ramnoth was quiet before saying that suspense might be ruined if scene was shown uncut this sparked a discussion vasan advised editor chandru to edit in accordance with ramnoth s direction and was impressed with result c e biggs was film s audio engineer chandralekha was in production for five years 1943 1948 with changes to its story cast and filming which generated substantial time and cost overruns film ultimately cost 3 million about 600 000 in 1948 and was most expensive indian film at time vasan mortgaged all his property received financial assistance from hindu editor kasturi srinivasan and sold his jewellery to complete film adjusted for inflation chandralekha would have cost 28 million in 2010 according to historian s muthiah with free floating exchange rate in effect at time it was first film with a budget of over a million dollars made outside united states themes and influences although a period film chandralekha is not based on historical fact its plot is based on first chapter of robert macaire or french bandit in england sasankan is based on macaire and according to film historian b d garga chandralekha is probably based on a female dancer in novel whom macaire flogs when she refuses to dance film includes scene from novel garga noted that chandralekha was also influenced by other western literary and cinematic works including novel blood and sand 1908 and films mark of zorro 1920 douglas fairbanks in robin hood 1922 thief of baghdad 1924 and ben hur a tale of christ 1925 in december 1964 film historian jerzy toeplitz called film an extension and development of mythological genre characters are mortals but behave like heavenly beings and their movements and gestures like those of gods and heroes of mahabharata are impregnated with miraculous toeplitz wrote that story was a mere pretext to hold together different episodes each of which builds up like a circus turn tension mounts to a culminating point whereupon next episode immediately takes over according to roy armes 1987 book third world film making and west uday shankar s 1948 kalpana also filmed at gemini studios inspired vasan to make chandralekha in 2003 encyclopaedia of hindi cinema film is described as a ruritanian period extravaganza climactic sword fight between veerasimhan and sasankan has been compared to fight in 1894 novel prisoner of zenda in 1976 american film historian william k everson compared comedians in chandralekha to laurel and hardy although randor guy considers film s drum dance scene first of its kind in indian cinema 1947 film naam iruvar includes a scene when lead actress younger sister dances on drums to tamil poet subramania bharati s murase french film historian yves wrote that it prefigured dance that chandralekha made famous very next year according to american film critic jonathan rosenbaum film belongs to same childhood continuum as fritz lang s 1959 films tiger of and indian tomb which were set in india in his 2009 book 50 indian film classics film critic m k raghavendra wrote that chandralekha was constructed in a manner which enables its narrative to incorporate elements drawn from virtually any kind of genre according to guy setting of song naattiya kuthirai with sundari bai including her dance and costume were inspired by 1943 musical film coney island film scholar uma wrote that film reflects vasan s vision of a truly democratic nation based on equal rights for men and women by portraying a world where men and women work together to establish a rightful rule music chandralekha soundtrack was composed by s rajeswara rao with lyrics by papanasam sivan and kothamangalam subbu r vaidyanathan and b das gupta collaborated with m d parthasarathy on background music rajeswara rao recalled in a 1993 interview for hindu that it took him over a year to compose film s music with much of his time devoted to drum dance scene as dancers performed we used to rehearse and compose music it was done with incredibly few instruments we used a piano ten double bass violins and drums from africa egypt and persia which we have acquired from an african war troupe rao s salary was 1 500 music was influenced by carnatic and hindustani music latin american and portuguese folk music and strauss waltzes according to m k raghavendra chandralekha has snatches from richard wagner and nikolai rimsky korsakov being used at dramatic moments naattiya kuthirai not originally part of film was added during final production sundari bai spent over a month rehearsing song m d parthasarathy was sole singer of and co singer of naattiya kuthirai j cooling played accordion and piano in film s gypsy song circus chorus was adapted from donkey serenade in robert z leonard s 1937 film firefly vasan offered most of songs on hindi soundtrack to uma devi who later became popularly known as tun tun she initially hesitated feeling that they were beyond her capabilities but was supported by rajeswara rao who worked hard on her sanjh ki bela from hindi soundtrack is loosely based on sanjh ki bela akela from 1944 chandralekha music helped make it one of most successful indian musical films of 1940s and it created an atmosphere for a number of music directors influenced by western music in tamil cinema film was a breakthrough for uma devi despite breaching her contract with producer abdur rashid kardar who terminated her contract in retaliation however this and dwindling fortunes of film industry after india s independence from british raj eventually ended her career in playback singing in his 1997 book starlight starbright early tamil cinema randor guy said that parthasarathy and rajeswara rao created a fine blend of lilting music of many schools writing for screen in april 1998 film historian m described chandralekha songs as distinct and standing on their own with barely any background score attempting to interlink anything just periods of silence historian v sriram stated in 2018 that although film had no memorable songs sung by krishnan madhuram and sundari bai was his favourite one marketing first advertisement for chandralekha appeared on back cover of

english version of chandralekha new york times called rajakumari a buxom beauty when film was screened in new york city in 1976 william k everson said it s a colorful naive and zestful film in which overall ingenuousness quite disarms criticism of plot absurdity or such production shortcomings as too obvious studio exteriors last but far from least busby berkeley would surely have been delighted to see his influence extending to climactic drum dance jonathan rosenbaum said in august 1981 prospect of a three hour indian film in tamil with no subtitles is a little off putting i would t you
