northern rosella platycercus venustus formerly known as brown s rosella or smutty rosella is a species of parrot native to northern australia ranging from gulf of carpentaria and arnhem land to kimberley it was described by heinrich kuhl in 1820 and two subspecies are recognised species is unusually coloured for a rosella with a dark head and neck with pale cheeks predominantly white in nominate subspecies from northern territory and blue in western australian subspecies hillii northern rosella s mantle and scapulars are black with fine yellow scallops while its back rump and underparts are pale yellow with fine black scallops long tail is blue green and wings are black and blue violet sexes have similar plumage while females and younger birds are generally duller with occasional spots of red found in woodland and open savannah country northern rosella is predominantly herbivorous consuming seeds particularly of grasses and eucalypts as well as flowers and berries but it may also eat insects nesting takes place in tree hollows although uncommon northern rosella is rated as least concern on international union for conservation of nature iucn s red list of endangered species taxonomy and naming northern rosella was first described as psittacus venustus by german naturalist heinrich kuhl in 1820 description was based on an illustration by ferdinand bauer from a specimen collected by robert brown in february 1803 during matthew flinders voyage around australian coastline specific epithet is derived from latin venustus charming lovely or graceful dutch zoologist coenraad jacob temminck published name psittacus brownii in honour of brown in 1821 and irish zoologist nicholas aylward vigors transferred it as p brownii to genus platycercus in 1827 describing it as most beautiful of family but john gould wrote in his 1865 work handbook to birds of australia hitherto this bird has been known to ornithologists as platycercus brownii a specific appellation in honour of celebrated botanist but which i regret to say must give place to prior one of venustus thumb left painting by ferdinand bauer c 1811 1813 gregory mathews described subspecies p venustus hillii in 1910 collected by g f hill from napier broome bay in western australia he noted that its cheeks had more blue and less white than nominate subspecies victoria river marks border between this and nominate subspecies animal taxonomist arthur cain treated subspecies as synonymous to nominate as only difference he knew of was colour of cheeks but conceded further evidence could prove them distinct as well as differences in cheek plumage two differ in that subspecies hillii has brighter yellow feathers on breast and belly with thinner black edges and a consistently longer and wider bill a subspecies p venustus from melville island was described by mathews in 1912 noting it to have blacker plumage on its back it is now thought to be indistinguishable from nominate subspecies northern rosella has been designated official name by international ornithologists union ioc early names used include brown s rosella parrot or parakeet for its collector with brown s parakeet remaining a name used in aviculture in europe and united kingdom and smutty rosella parrot or parakeet from its dark plumage gould reported in 1848 that latter was local name used and it was most common name at end of 19th century it was changed possibly through to sooty parrot by royal australasian ornithologists union raou in 1913 and are two names from kunwinjku language of western arnhem land one of six species of rosella in genus platycercus northern rosella and related eastern p eximius and pale headed rosella p make up a white cheeked lineage a 1987 genetic study on mitochondrial dna by ovenden and colleagues found that northern rosella was earliest offshoot basal of a lineage that gave rise to other white cheeked forms but a study with nuclear dna by ashlee shipham and colleagues published in 2017 found that eastern rosella was basal to lineage that split into pale headed and northern rosellas and hence that non sister taxa were able to hybridise among rosellas description thumb right subspecies hillii western australia smaller than all rosella species except western rosella adult northern rosella weighs and is long it has broad wings with a wingspan of around and a long tail with twelve feathers sexes are almost indistinguishable though some adult females have duller plumage and are more likely to have some red feathers on head and breast adult bird has a black forehead crown lores ear coverts upper neck and nape a whitish throat and large cheek patches which are mainly white with violet lower borders in nominate subspecies and more blue with a narrow white upper segment in subspecies hillii feathers of lower neck mantle and scapulars are black narrowly fringed with yellow giving a scalloped appearance while feathers of back rump upper tail coverts and underparts are pale yellow with black borders and concealed grey bases those of breast have very dark grey bases occasionally tinged with red undertail covert feathers are red with black fringes feathers on upper leg are pale yellow tinged with blue central rectrices of long tail are dark green changing to dark blue at tips while other feathers are dark blue with two bands of pale blue and white tips undertail is pale blue with a white tip wings have a wide purplish blue shoulder patch at rest with secondary feathers edged darker blue and primaries black edged with blue beak is off white with a grey cere legs and feet are grey and iris is dark brown immature birds resemble adults but are duller overall with less well defined cheek patches black plumage in particular is more greyish and there are more likely to be scattered red feathers on head neck and underparts distribution and habitat northern rosella is found across northern australia in western australia it is found across kimberley south to 18th parallel around derby gorge national park northern king leopold ranges springvale station and with vagrants reported at halls creek and fitzroy crossing in northern territory it is found from victoria river north to tiwi islands and east into western arnhem land and across northern arnhem land through island and wessel islands to gove peninsula it is absent from central arnhem land but is found further east around western and southern coastline of gulf of carpentaria south to and across border into western queensland as far as nicholson river northern rosella lives in grassy open forests and woodlands including deciduous eucalypt savannah woodlands typical trees include species of eucalyptus such as darwin stringybark eucalyptus melaleuca callitris and acacia more specific habitats include vegetation along small creeks and gorges sandstone outcrops and escarpments as well as some forested offshore islands northern rosella is occasionally found in mangroves or public green spaces in suburban darwin it avoids dense forest behaviour not a gregarious bird northern rosella is generally found alone or in pairs although several birds perch together in same tree sometimes they are encountered in larger troops usually 6 to 8 birds but rarely up to 15 individuals it is than other rosellas and flees to upper tree canopy if disturbed it is a quieter and less vocal species than other rosellas and its call repertoire has been little studied it exhibits a sharp and short chit chut chit chut contact call in flight while perched it makes a three note whistle on ascending scale or metallic piping sounds soft chattering can be heard while feeding and sometimes when squabbling at beginning of breeding season breeding nesting occurs in tree hollows in southern hemisphere winter often in eucalypts located near water clutch is anywhere from two to five white matte or slightly glossy eggs measuring roughly 26 x 21 mm 1 x 0 8 in female incubates eggs alone over a period of 19 or 20 days newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down and are largely helpless nidicolous they may remain in nest for seven weeks after hatching and are fed by both parents fledglings remain with their parents for a year or more often feeding together in small family groups feeding northern rosella feeds on ground in grassy glades in woodlands on roadsides riverbanks as well as in canopy of trees it eats seeds particularly those of eucalypts wattles cypress callitris and grasses it eats both seeds and nectar of white gum eucalyptus alba darwin stringybark long fruited bloodwood corymbia polycarpa melaleuca nervosa and fern leaved grevillea grevillea it also eats flowers such as those of darwin eucalyptus miniata and fruit it also eats larval and adult insects predation and parasites northern rosella is a prey item of rufous owl ninox rufa bird louse forficuloecus wilsoni has been recovered from northern rosella conservation status thumb right a pair in captivity with prominent blue cheeks northern rosella is listed as being a species of least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn on account of its large range and stable population with no evidence of any significant decline despite this northern rosella is an uncommon bird grazing by livestock and frequent burning of grassy woodland may have a negative impact on northern rosella numbers like most species of parrots northern rosella is protected by convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites with its placement on appendix ii list of vulnerable species which makes import export and trade of listed wild caught animals illegal aviculture most northern rosellas in captivity in australia are nominate subspecies but there are blue cheeked specimens that are either subspecies hillii or intermediate its attractive colours make it a desirable species to keep in captivity in northern hemisphere northern rosella has been reported to breed in same calendar months as it does in its southern hemisphere native range as it breeds early in season clutches laid in cooler months of cooler australian states may fail breeders have attempted to use sprinklers in enclosures to induce pairs to breed at other times references cited text external links northern rosella
