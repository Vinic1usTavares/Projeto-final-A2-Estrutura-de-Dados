hanna and barbera jointly directed puss gets boot which was nominated for an academy award for best cartoon short subject studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio so despite success of puss gets boot barbera and hanna s supervisor fred quimby did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence surprised by success of puss gets boot barbera and hanna ignored quimby s resistance and continued developing cat and mouse theme by this time however hanna wanted to return to working for ising to whom he felt very loyal barbera and hanna met with quimby who discovered that although ising had taken sole credit for producing puss gets boot he never actually worked on it quimby who had wanted to start a new animation unit independent from ising then gave hanna and barbera permission to pursue their cat and mouse idea result was their most famous creation tom and jerry modeled after puss gets boot characters with slight differences series followed jerry pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe tom hanna said they settled on cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because we knew we needed two characters we thought we needed conflict and chase and action and a cat after a mouse seemed like a good basic thought revamped characters first appeared in 1941 s midnight snack over next 17 years barbera and hanna worked exclusively on tom and jerry directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts during world war ii they also made animated training films tom and jerry relied mostly on motion instead of dialog despite its popularity tom and jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent nonetheless series won its first academy award for 11th short yankee doodle mouse 1943 a war time adventure tom and jerry was ultimately nominated for 14 academy awards winning 7 no other character based theatrical animated series has won more awards nor has any other series featuring same characters tom

barbera and hanna onstage cartoons were also released with quimby listed as sole producer following same practice for which he had condemned ising quimby once delayed a promised raise to barbera by six months when quimby retired in late 1955 hanna and barbera were placed in charge of mgm s animation division as mgm began to lose more revenue on animated cartoons due to television studio soon realized that re releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones in 1957 mgm ordered barbera and hanna s business manager to close cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call barbera and hanna found no notice closing puzzling because tom and jerry had been so successful television barbera s first foray into television was a 1957 collaboration with robert d buchanan colonel bleep series first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television would feature some of futuristic designs and limited animation barbera would later carry over to his other television productions barbera s involvement in colonel bleep and with buchanan was apparently short lived his only known credited involvement was a creator credit in 1957 barbera reteamed with his former partner hanna to produce cartoon films for television and theatrical release as they had at mgm two brought their different skills to company barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist while hanna had a gift for timing story construction and recruiting top artists major business decisions would be made together though each year title of president alternated between them a coin toss determined that hanna would have precedence in naming of new company first called h b enterprises but soon changed to hanna barbera productions barbera and hanna s mgm colleague george sidney director of anchors aweigh became third partner and business manager in company and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with screen gems television division of columbia pictures who took part ownership of new studio first offering from new company was ruff reddy show a series which detailed friendship between a dog and cat despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture loopy de loop hanna barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series huckleberry hound show and yogi bear show a 1960 survey showed that half of viewers of huckleberry hound were adults this prompted company to create a new animated series flintstones a parody of honeymooners new show followed a typical stone age family with home appliances talking animals and celebrity guests with an audience of both children and adults flintstones became first animated prime time show to be a hit fred flintstone s signature exclamation dabba doo soon entered everyday usage and show boosted studio to top of tv cartoon field company later produced a futuristic version of flintstones known as jetsons although both shows reappeared in 1970s and 1980s flintstones was far more popular by late 1960s hanna barbera productions was most successful television animation studio in business hanna barbera studio produced over 3000 animated half hour television shows among more than 100 cartoon series they produced were quick draw mcgraw show top cat jonny quest magilla gorilla show atom ant secret squirrel show scooby doo super friends and smurfs company also produced animated specials based on alice in wonderland jack and beanstalk and cyrano de bergerac as well as feature length films charlotte s web and heidi s song as popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences they were disliked by artists television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in 1950s and 1960s putting many people in industry out of work hanna barbera was key in development of an animation technique known as limited animation which allowed television animation to be more cost effective but often reduced quality hanna and barbera had first experimented with these techniques in early days of tom and jerry to reduce cost of each episode shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation number of drawings for a seven minute cartoon decreased from 14 000 to nearly 2 000 and company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing critics criticized change from detailed animation to repetitive movements by two dimensional characters barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to television budgets or change careers new style did not limit success of their animated shows enabling hanna barbera to stay in business providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work limited animation paved way for future animated series such as simpsons spongebob squarepants and south park in december 1966 hanna barbera productions was sold to taft broadcasting renamed great american communications in 1987 for 12 million barbera and hanna remained at head of company until 1991 at that point company was sold to turner broadcasting system for an estimated 320 million turner began using hanna barbera s television catalog as material for its new cartoon network cable channel in 1992 and by mid 1990s hanna barbera was producing several original series for cartoon network among them dexter s laboratory and powerpuff girls in 1996 turner merged with time warner owners of warner bros who would eventually absorb hanna barbera into warner bros animation barbera and hanna continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new hanna barbera shows including shorts for series cartoon cartoon show and feature film versions of flintstones 1994 and scooby doo 2002 in a new tom and jerry

created by hanna barbera such as johnny bravo and carl dexter and his supercomputer powerpuff girls cow and chicken and their schoolmates flem and earl i m weasel and i r baboon and characters created by hanna barbera successor cartoon network studios such as mordecai and rigby from regular show finn and jake from adventure time steven and gems from steven universe three titular protagonists from

codename kids next door and animated versions of japanese pop rock group puffy amiyumi from hi hi puffy amiyumi these may have been a reflection of close business friendship and partnership that barbera and hanna shared for over 60 years professionally they balanced each other s strengths and weaknesses very well but barbera and hanna travelled in completely different social circles hanna s circle of personal friends primarily included other animators barbera socialized with hollywood celebrities zsa zsa gabor was a frequent visitor to his house their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since hanna was interested in outdoors and barbera liked beaches and good food and drink nevertheless in their long partnership in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters barbera and hanna rarely exchanged a cross word barbera said we understood each other perfectly and each of us had deep respect for other s work hanna once said that barbera could capture mood and expression in a quick sketch better than anyone i ve ever known barbera and hanna were also among first animators to realize enormous potential of television leonard
