bessas before 480 after 554 was an east roman byzantine general of gothic origin from thrace primarily known for his career in wars of justinian i reigned 527 565 he distinguished himself against sassanid persians in iberian war and under command of belisarius in gothic war but after belisarius departure from italy he failed to confront resurgent goths and was largely responsible for loss of rome in 546 returning east in disgrace despite his advanced age he was appointed as commander in lazic war there he redeemed himself with recapture of petra but his subsequent idleness led justinian to dismiss him and exile him to abasgia origin according to contemporary historian procopius of caesarea bessas was born in 470s and hailed from a noble gothic family long established in thrace belonging to those goths who had not followed theodoric great when he left in 488 to invade italy then held by odoacer martindale 1980 p 1997 pp 98 99 179 procopius remarks on his fluency in gothic amory 1997 p 105 but another contemporary writer jordanes claims that he hailed from settlement of castra martis comprising sarmatians and certain of huns getica 265 this evidence has been variously interpreted with most modern commentators leaning towards a gothic identity cf amory 1997 pp 364 365 nevertheless according to patrick amory it is impossible from sources at hand to draw any definite conclusion about his ethnicity amory maintains that bessas was a typical example of blurry ethnographic identity evidenced in 6th century balkan populations especially among military amory 1997 pp career in east thumb right 225px map of byzantine persian frontier area very little is known of bessas early life and career he joined imperial army in his youth and according to procopius was already experienced in war by 503 when anastasian war with sassanid persians broke out he took part in war as an officer but nothing is known of his service there on other hand he is probably to be identified with a comes of same name who was addressed in a letter of bishop jacob of d 521 if this identification is valid then bessas was a probably moderate monophysite amory 1997 p 274 bessas reappears in 531 during iberian war against persia when he was appointed dux with martyropolis as his base in this capacity bessas led 500 cavalry against persian force guarding same frontier sector comprising 700 infantry and cavalry under generals gadar and yazdgerd byzantines engaged persians in battle on banks of tigris and routed them killing gadar and taking yazdgerd captive bessas then raided province of arzanene and returned to martyropolis greatrex lieu 2002 p 94 in retaliation for this byzantine success persian shah kavadh i sent against martyropolis a large army commanded by three senior generals mihr mihroe and persians besieged city through autumn digging trenches and mines but garrison under bessas and bouzes held firm finally approach of winter arrival of large byzantine forces at nearby amida and news of death of kavadh forced persian commanders to raise siege in november or december greatrex lieu 2002 pp 95 96 soon after their withdrawal a force of sabir huns who persians had hired as mercenaries invaded roman territory and raided as far as antioch but bessas caught one of their raiding parties and destroyed it capturing 500 horses and much booty greatrex lieu 2002 p 95 actions in italy in 535 bessas was appointed as one of belisarius lieutenants along with constantine and in expedition against ostrogothic kingdom of italy martindale 1980 pp 226 1958 p 170 he accompanied belisarius in early stages of campaign from recovery of sicily to siege of naples and was present at latter s fall in november 536 bury 1958 pp 171 1980 p 227 from there byzantine army advanced on rome which it captured without a fight belisarius sent constantine and bessas to capture various outlying towns but when he learned that new gothic king was marching on rome he recalled them bessas tarried for a while near town of which controlled direct route from gothic capital ravenna over apennines to rome and there met and defeated gothic vanguard in a skirmish bury 1958 p 181 during year long siege of rome by goths bessas commanded troops at porta gate and distinguished himself in a number of skirmishes nothing is known of his role in subsequent events until 540 except that it was probably at about this time that he was raised to rank of patricius in early 538 bessas had protected belisarius when general constantine tried to kill him during a dispute bury 1958 pp 191 192 but by 540 when belisarius was preparing to enter ravenna under pretense of accepting gothic offer to become emperor of west he clearly felt that bessas could not be trusted and sent him along with other troublemaking generals such as john and narses to occupy remote locations in italy bury 1958 pp 212 213 following departure of belisarius in mid 540 bessas remained in italy justinian did not appoint an overall commander to replace belisarius and as a result various byzantine generals left in italy failed to co ordinate their actions instead of subduing last remnants of ostrogoths in northern italy they retreated to safety of various fortified cities allowing goths to gather around a new leader ildibad ildibad marched on treviso and routed a byzantine force under vitalius whereupon bessas advanced with his troops to piacenza bury 1958 pp 227 228 in late 541 after totila had become king of goths bessas and other byzantine commanders assembled in ravenna to co ordinate their efforts but imperial troops were repulsed from verona and defeated at by totila s goths goths then invaded tuscany and threatened florence held by general justin bessas along with john and cyprian marched to justin s aid goths retreated before byzantine reinforcements but as latter pursued goths fell upon them and drove them to flight after this new defeat byzantine commanders dispersed again to various cities and abandoned each other to his fate bessas withdrew with his forces to spoleto bury 1958 pp 230 231 nothing is known of his activities from then until early 545 by which time he was garrison commander of rome along with general conon he was responsible for city s defence during siege by totila in 546 bury 1958 pp 235 1980 pp 227 228 during siege he restricted himself to passive defence refusing to sally forth from walls even when belisarius who had returned from east and landed with reinforcements at nearby portus romanus ordered him to do so as a result belisarius attempts to succour beleaguered city failed bury 1958 pp 239 1980 p 228 procopius heavily criticizes bessas for his conduct during siege he neglected of civilian population of city and enriched himself by selling starving populace grain he had hoarded at exorbitant prices civilians were so exhausted by famine that when he finally allowed those who wanted to leave city to do so many simply died on wayside while others were killed by goths bury 1958 pp 238 239 finally he proved negligent in conduct of defence and allowed security measures to grow lax guards slept at their posts and patrols were discontinued this allowed four isaurian soldiers to contact totila and on 17 december 546 city was betrayed to goths bessas managed to escape with greater part of garrison but treasure that he had amassed was left behind for goths to enjoy bury 1958 p 242 following his dismal performance in italy bessas was apparently recalled to constantinople return to eastern front and command in lazica thumb 225px map of lazica and surrounding regions in late antiquity bessas re appears in 550 following failure of a large byzantine army under magister militum per armeniam dagisthaeus to capture strategic fortress of petra in ongoing war with persians over lazica western georgia to general surprise and considerable criticism in view of his advanced age and failure at rome justinian named bessas as dagisthaeus successor and entrusted him with conduct of war in lazica bury 1958 pp 113 114 bessas first sent an expeditionary force to suppress a rebellion among abasgians who neighboured lazica to north and had called upon sasanian assistance expedition under john was successful and leader was forced to flee across caucasus to sabir huns bury 1958 pp 114 116greatrex lieu 2002 p 118 in spring 551 after a long siege and thanks largely to his own perseverance and bravery byzantines and their sabir allies some 6 000 troops captured petra a few persians continued to resist from citadel but bessas ordered it torched following his victory he ordered city walls razed to ground bury 1958 p 116greatrex lieu 2002 pp 118 119 if capture of petra redeemed bessas in eyes of his contemporaries his subsequent actions tarnished it again instead of following up his success and capture mountain passes connecting lazica with persian province of iberia he retired west to roman provinces of pontica and busied himself with its administration martindale 1980 pp 228 229 this inactivity allowed persians under mihr mihroe to consolidate persian control over eastern part of lazica byzantine forces in lazica withdrew west to mouth of while lazi including their king gubazes and his family sought refuge in mountains despite enduring harsh conditions in winter of 551 552 gubazes rejected peace offers
