in any crime and lived peacefully within its walls numerous small factories and businesses thrived inside walled city and some residents formed groups to organise and improve daily life there an

settlement bordered walled city to south and west until it was cleared in 1985 and replaced with carpenter road park city s dozens of alleyways were often only wide and had poor lighting and drainage an informal network of staircases and passageways also formed on upper levels which was so extensive that one could travel north to south through entire city without ever touching solid ground construction in city went unregulated and most of roughly 350 buildings were built with poor foundations and few or no utilities because apartments were so small a typical unit was space was maximised

steadily shortly after world war ii however there is no accurate population information available for much of walled city s later existence official census numbers estimated walled city s population at 10 004 in 1971 and 14 617 in 1981 but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low informal estimates on other hand often mistakenly included neighbouring squatter village of sai tau

for residents to talk have tea or watch television and to take classes such as calligraphy old people s centre also held religious meetings for christians and others other religious institutions included tak and tin hau temples which were used for a combination of buddhist taoist and animist practices cultural memory cultural legacy left behind by walled city was one of crime and corruption administration was largely absent due to political boundaries in which city existed widespread criminal activity in city did not apply exclusively to triads alone police would also conspire with triads to profit from illicit trades happening within city both police and residents spoke of endemic corruption that was rife within city this was largely due to fact that city was left to its own devices proximity and spatial tightness allowed a very close community to form in which its own culture developed a form of anarchic urbanism formed due to circumstances in which community experienced and it through uncertainty of its existence between governance in which its identity is formed this is largely due to fact that city was isolated both physically and psychologically from hong kong itself producing a unique culture that only existed within city as kowloon walled city fades further away from relevancy cultural memory of space has become more sanitized with crime and corruption in background this allowed kowloon walled city to experience a second life in which many popular media and game outlets portray city in a more nostalgic and romanticized version kowloon walled city s second life and re emergence in public conscious can be attributed to handover in 1997 where imminence of its disappearance cause a rise in interest in hong kong culture city was also a spot that highlighted guerrilla capitalism which showed city s ability to adapt to conditions of time but it is also remembered as an era that cannot return this is inline with city s reputation from being shunned in its existence in early years to now being a point of pride for many hong kong residences alike it is only in modern era where kowloon walled city is often portrayed with a romantic dystopian identity where many forms of media borrow city s culture in their own works depictions and legacy memoirs and autobiographies a few of people who spent time in kowloon walled city have
