they paddled furiously using current and dense foliage along far side of river to their advantage and trying to out distance soldiers however when they rounded a bend in river nva fired on them with a heavy caliber machine gun they pulled sampan to bank and turned it over to provide some cover icke in bilk 11 overhead called in air support and five u s navy a 4 skyhawks led by lt denny sapp from carrier hancock killed a number of north vietnamese troops and provided cover for his final escape two a 1 skyraiders also assisted dropping both explosives and smoke bombs providing a smokescreen returning to river three men were soon able to receive support from south vietnamese forces landing on river bank they were met by some arvn soldiers hambleton was unable to walk and they carried him back to their bunker there an m113 armored personnel carrier carried hambleton norris and nguyen back to brigade headquarters in dong ha news reporters were very aware of intense rescue efforts to bring hambleton home when rescue team and hambleton arrived at dong ha a reporter commented to norris it must have been tough out there i bet you wouldn t do that again norris replied an american was down in enemy territory of course i d do it again from dong ha hambleton was transported via us army 571st dustoff helicopter lt ken warner aircraft commander dustoff 502 to 95th evacuation hospital da nang he was shortly afterward evacuated to hospital at clark air force base in philippines where he recuperated for a month norris began to plan for rescue of walker still more than a kilometer behind front lines walker managed to evade capture for almost 11 days when on night of 18 april without fac coverage he moved on his own accord and ran into a local villager who alerted north vietnamese they began tracking him and next morning fac saw nva very near walker s position walker radioed fac that rescue should not be attempted because nva forces were closing in and he was under fire bilk 36 an ov 10a flown by fac 1st lt mickey fain reported that walker was surrounded by more than 20 nva soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body lying in grass walker s body was never recovered rescue cost there were no rules to apply to determine when a search and rescue was no longer cost effective sar priority air force remained fully committed to finding and bringing back every downed air man regardless of cost air crew s morale depended on it search and rescue was based on premise that it was necessary to secure safety of pilots as valuable military assets and to enhance their effectiveness by boosting morale on 2 june 1972 general john vogt commander of 7th air force sent a huge task force of 119 aircraft to rescue capt roger locher a f 4 weapons officer who during operation linebacker had been shot down only from hanoi when he was picked up by a hh 53 from 40th aerospace rescue and recovery squadron he was within of heavily defended yen bai air base and had eluded capture while covering in north vietnamese territory for 23 days there were also political overtones to hambleton s rescue u s personnel held as prisoners of war constituted a serious political liability to u s government as many as 90 sorties a day were called in to suppress north vietnamese forces around hambleton in contrast prior to easter offensive number of daily sorties was about 10 and during action peaked at about 300 during multi day effort to rescue men americans hit north vietnamese with over 800 air strikes in direct support of rescue search and rescue took priority over almost all strike targets no fire zone enforced to protect downed airmen and search and rescue forces col cecil muirhead ordered 7th air force to establish a standard no fire zone around hambleton shortly after he went down it remained in effect until 22 00 and while in force it prohibited friendly artillery naval gunfire or aircraft from engaging any target within without jsarc approval no fire zone encompassed nearly entire combat zone of arvn 3rd division including crucial cam lo bridge as a result south vietnamese army in area was severely hampered in its efforts to stem nva offensive against dong ha and quang tri city during this six hour period thousands of nva troops pushed into region designated military region 1 when it was seen that nva forces were pouring through gap unimpeded no fire zone was reduced at 22 00 that night but not before action generated considerable debate one ranking adviser commented when viewed in relation to all events of day a worse decision could not have been made 3rd arvn had lost most of its artillery in first two days of offensive and in fact had surrendered two of their batteries intact to nva hambleton commented after war if taxpayers and my neighbors knew what it cost to pull me out of there they d probably shoot me maj david a brookbank a u s air force liaison with 3rd division reported operation cost 3rd arvn dearly he concluded that restriction gave north vietnamese an opportunity unprecedented in annals of warfare to advance at will he stated it seems logical to assume that many south vietnamese troops died because air and artillery support were not available he warned his superiors that 3rd division s officers resented fact that 7th air force would put thousands of south vietnamese soldiers lives at risk to rescue one of their own american response to nva operation virtually ground to a halt as air resources were diverted to support recovery and for a few days defense of northern border area was second in priority to rescuing hambleton casualties as a direct result of rescue operation five aircraft were lost 11 people were killed and two were captured additional aircraft were seriously damaged hambleton wrote from an air force hospital after he was rescued i had to stand by and watch six young men die trying to save my life it was a hell of a price to pay for one life i m very sorry his rescue was according to stars and stripes biggest u s air rescue effort of war during vietnam war search and rescue forces saved 3 883 lives at cost of 71 rescuers and 45 aircraft aftermath rescue of bat 21 was a watershed event for military and led them to find a new approach to high threat search and rescue they recognized that if a sar mission was predestined to fail it should not be attempted and other options such as special operations diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to situation had to be considered recognizing need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support air force accepted navy s a 7 corsair military also improved night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions awards and recognition john van etten nail 32 received
