hogg rock is a tuya volcano and lava dome in cascade range of northern oregon located close to santiam pass produced by magma with an intermediate andesite composition it has steep slopes and thick glassy margins hogg rock exhibits normal magnetic polarity and is probably about 80 000 years old hogg rock lies south of three fingered jack and north of hayrick butte a somewhat larger tuya of similar age and composition a tuya is a type of subglacial volcano formed when lava erupts underneath an overlying glacier or ice sheet and then melts through to surface and pools producing flat plateau on top with near vertical walls along ice contact margin as lava cools and hardens it is a historic landmark with remnants of colonel t egenton hogg s oregon pacific railroad santiam lodge and a quarry mountain offers snowshoe and snowmobile trails and its summit provides views of surrounding area including volcanoes like black butte stratovolcano mount washington sand mountain and potato hill geography hogg rock is located in linn county in u s state of oregon it is close to santiam pass by hayrick butte tuya another feature produced from interaction of volcanic eruptive materials with glaciers it is close to mount jefferson wilderness near where oregon route 22 and us highway 20 intersect with cascade range at santiam pass and sits next to oregon route 126 hogg rock lies about north of collier cone a cinder cone at northern side of base of north sister united states geological survey considers hogg rock part of three fingered jack quadrangle while siebert and kimberly 2010 list it as a volcanic cone of three fingered jack hogg rock lies south of three fingered jack and north of hoodoo butte and hayrick butte according to geographic names information system volcano has an elevation of ecology oregon department of fish and wildlife determined in early 1990s that there was potential for peregrine falcon nests at hogg rock though it was considered low quality habitat because of its lack of suitable ledges and high amounts of human disturbance wildflowers and bracken ferns occur along roadways area has previously been affected by fires geology thumb 350px hogg rock three fingered jack mount jefferson and u s 20 near santiam pass north sister and mount washington mark isolated volcanic centers among highly mafic rich in magnesium and iron platform of central high cascades about 4 5 million years ago eruption of mafic lava filled a subsiding pliocene depression creating modern mafic edifice of high cascades compared to eruptive products at and near north sister lava deposits at mount washington have a greater abundance of incompatible elements elements unsuitable in size and or charge to cation sites of minerals of which it is included hogg rock shows more similarity to basaltic andesite deposits at north sister which are poorly enriched in incompatible elements part of high cascades that extends south from mount jefferson to santiam pass includes shield volcanoes lava domes and cinder cones high elevation of matuyama aged rocks east of santiam pass coupled with exposure of brunhes aged rocks to west imply presence of a northward trending normal fault part of a mostly mafic chain of volcanoes between three sisters and mount jefferson hogg rock has magma with an intermediate composition a tuya hogg rock is also considered a small lava dome with flat top typically observed for tuya volcanoes unlike most lava domes in cascades which are made of dacite or rhyodacite hogg rock is comprised by andesitic lava it is thick with steep sides that have glassy margins between in thickness and rock forming dome is heavily jointed andesite forming hogg rock has an only slightly porphyritic texture with plagioclase orthopyroxene and olivine phenocrysts along with hayrick butte silica content for hogg rock measures about 59 60 percent volcano has been eroded by glaciers it was formed during pleistocene with an approximate age of roughly 80 000 years according to deligne et al 2017 corresponding to wisconsin glacial period hill and priest 1992 assign it an age of 90 000 years 20 000 years while sherrod et al argue that its age by k ar dating is 80 000 years 20 000 years volcano exhibits a normal magnetic polarity santiam pass has been assessed for its geothermal energy potential and there is a drill extending to a depth of south of highway area in addition to expected basaltic andesite lava and a number of dikes core also detected unusual basalt andesite and coarse sediment indicative of debris flows dating for these samples cannot be confirmed because of close proximity of brunhes aged dikes which likely heated nearby rock and caused loss of radiogenic argon human history hogg rock served as a landmark for travelers searching for hogg pass which was later renamed to santiam pass by united states board on geographic names in 1929 this name drew from santiam river its name referring to santiam people who were forced to leave area and move to grand ronde reservation hogg rock was named after colonel t egenton hogg head of oregon pacific railroad that was supposed to cross cascades in this location construction on railroad began in 1870s costing hogg about 5 million railway was intended by hogg to travel from yaquina bay to snake river also known as corvallis and eastern railroad it was built by chinese and italian workers to connect newport and boise though in actuality it only extended to hogg ran out of money but trying to meet government contract stipulation that he finished crossing cascade range before claiming land grants he built of isolated around hogg rock before getting a 14 person crew to pull a boxcar on them he then claimed isolated tracks around tuya were a train railway hogg eventually declared bankruptcy in 1890 after other businesspeople tried to pick up railroad it was absorbed by southern pacific transportation company today remnants of railroad are still present at volcano santiam pass located at an elevation of marks a historic feature in cascade range west of mount washington and three fingered jack there are three major routes one travels north and west down north santiam river same path followed by hogg s railroad while another moves southwest along mckenzie river third route moves west over tombstone pass reaching south santiam river and was followed by santiam wagon road from 1865 to 1914 as well as auto race of 1905 lewis and clark centennial exposition in addition to railroad there is also a quarry at hogg rock and rotting santiam lodge building santiam lodge constructed by civilian conservation corps in 1939 is a boarded up building at santiam pass it has survived major forest fires in 1968 and 2003 withstanding flames in latter fire after firefighters swathed it in kevlar sheets it is abandoned but there are plans with united states forest service to restore it these are on hold because cost is estimated to be several million dollars recreation hoodoo ski area is located on nearby hoodoo butte hogg rock can be reached from a snowshoe trail that starts at santiam pass sno park which has restrooms and a snow play area for children entrance to sno park requires a permit there is also a snowmobile trail that moves west from santiam lodge and then north at hogg rock traveling along remnants of hogg s railroad it eventually reaches hogg rock summit by passing a trail left of a rock quarry at mountain peak offers views of black butte stratovolcano mount washington hoodoo butte sand mountain three fingered jack and potato hill there is a viewpoint on western slope of hogg rock shows forests on potato hill and hoodoo butte as well as hoodoo ski area notes a dole 1968 claims that hogg rock and hayrick butte
