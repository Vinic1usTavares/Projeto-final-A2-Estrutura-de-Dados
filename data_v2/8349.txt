whitetip reef shark triaenodon obesus is a species of requiem shark in family carcharhinidae and only member of its genus a small shark does not usually exceed in length so this species is easily recognizable by its slender body and short but broad head as well as tubular skin flaps beside nostrils oval eyes with vertical pupils and white tipped dorsal and caudal fins one of most common sharks found on indo pacific coral reefs whitetip reef shark occurs as far west as south africa and as far east as central america it is typically found on or near bottom in clear water at a depth of during day whitetip reef sharks spend much of their time resting inside caves unlike other requiem sharks which rely on ram ventilation and must constantly swim to breathe this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on bottom at night whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes crustaceans and octopus in groups their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey individuals may stay within a particular area of reef for months or years frequently returning to same shelter this species is viviparous in which developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother whitetip reef sharks are rarely aggressive towards humans though they may investigate swimmers closely however spear fishers are at risk of being bitten by one attempting to steal their catch this species is caught for food though ciguatera poisoning resulting from its consumption has been reported iucn has assessed whitetip reef shark as near threatened noting its numbers are dwindling due to increasing levels of unregulated fishing activity across its range slow reproductive rate and limited habitat preferences of this species renders its populations vulnerable to overfishing taxonomy and phylogeny thumb left early illustration of a whitetip reef shark from systematische beschreibung der plagiostomen 1841 whitetip reef shark was first described by german naturalist eduard ruppell as carcharias obesus in 1837 fische des rothen meere fishes of red sea his choice of specific epithet obesus was curious given that this shark is actually quite slender later in 1837 johannes muller and friedrich henle moved this species into its own genus triaenodon from greek meaning trident and odon meaning tooth as ruppell did not originally designate a holotype in 1960 a 31 cm long specimen caught off jeddah saudi arabia was made species lectotype other common names for this shark include shark light tip shark reef whitetip shark and whitetip shark once placed in family triakidae whitetip reef shark is now recognized by most authors as belonging to family carcharhinidae on basis of morphological characters such as a full nictitating membrane well developed precaudal pit strong lower caudal fin lobe and scroll like intestinal valves morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest whitetip reef shark is grouped with lemon sharks negaprion and shark in occupying an intermediate position on evolutionary tree between most basal genera galeocerdo rhizoprionodon and scoliodon and most derived carcharhinus and sphyrna distribution and habitat thumb left alt photo of a whitetip reef shark resting amongst many brightly colored corals its head concealed in a cave whitetip reef shark almost exclusively inhabits coral reefs whitetip reef shark is distributed widely across entire indo pacific region it was once thought to have formerly existed in atlantic ocean based on fossil teeth found in north carolina dating to miocene epoch however more recent research indicates that teeth belonged to a mackerel shark and that this species has never colonized atlantic in indian ocean it occurs from northern kwazulu natal south africa to red sea and indian subcontinent including madagascar mauritius comoros aldabra group seychelles sri lanka and chagos archipelago in western and central pacific it occurs from off southern china taiwan and ryukyu islands to philippines southeast asia and indonesia to northern australia and is also found around numerous islands in melanesia micronesia and polynesia as far as hawaii to north and pitcairn islands to southeast in eastern pacific it occurs from costa rica to panama and off galapagos islands associated almost exclusively with coral reef habitats whitetip reef sharks are most often encountered around coral heads and ledges with high vertical relief and additionally over sandy flats in lagoons and near drop offs to deeper water they prefer very clear water and rarely swim far from bottom this species is most common at a depth of on occasion they may enter water less than 1 m deep and there is an exceptional record of a whitetip reef shark being captured from a depth of in ryukyu islands description thumb right upright 1 2 alt frontal view of a whitetip reef shark which has a wedge shaped snout oval eyes and tubular flaps of skin next to nostrils face of a whitetip reef shark is distinctive with a broad snout tubular nasal flaps and oval eyes with vertical pupils a relatively small species few whitetip reef sharks are longer than maximum length this species attains is often given as though this was originally based on visual observations and may be dubious maximum reported weight is whitetip reef shark has a slim body and a short broad head snout is flattened and blunt with large flaps of skin in front of nares that are furled into tubes eyes are small and oval with vertical pupils and prominent ridges above

tooth rows in lower jaw each tooth has a single narrow smooth edged cusp at center flanked by a pair of much smaller cusplets first dorsal fin is positioned well back on body closer to pelvic than pectoral fins second dorsal and anal fins are large about half to three quarters as high as first dorsal fin broad triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before level of fifth gill slit there is no ridge between first and second dorsal fins lower lobe of caudal fin is half length of upper which has a strong notch near tip dermal denticles are small and overlapping usually with 7 horizontal ridges giving skin a smooth feel coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below with a pattern of scattered small dark spots unique to each individual tips of first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe and sometimes also second dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe are bright white biology and ecology thumb upright 1 2 left alt three gray sharks lying beside each other on sea bottom whitetip reef sharks spend much of day lying still on bottom whitetip reef shark is one of three most common sharks inhabiting reefs of indo pacific other two being blacktip reef shark carcharhinus melanopterus and grey reef shark carcharhinus amblyrhynchos habitat preferences of this species overlap those of other two though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like blacktip reef shark nor outer reef like grey reef shark whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration this species is most active at night or during slack tide and spends much of day resting inside caves singly or in small groups arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another off hawaii these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes while off costa rica they are often seen lying in open on sandy flats martin r a coral reefs whitetip reef shark reefquest centre for shark research retrieved on august 7 2009 whitetip reef sharks generally remain within a highly localized area only rarely do they undertake long movements wandering for a while before settling down somewhere new one study at johnston atoll found that none of sharks examined had moved more than away from their original capture location over periods of up to a year another study at rangiroa atoll in french polynesia found that after more than three years around 40 of originally tagged sharks were still present on same reef where they were first captured an individual shark may rest inside same cave for months to years daytime home range of a whitetip reef shark is limited to approximately at night this range increases to these sharks are not territorial and share their home ranges with others of their species they do not perform threat displays important predators of whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks galeocerdo cuvier galapagos sharks carcharhinus and possibly also silvertip sharks carcharhinus albimarginatus though they usually occur at depths greater than those favored by whitetip reef sharks an long whitetip reef shark has also been found in stomach of a giant grouper though these groupers are unlikely to be significant predators of this species due to their rarity known parasites of whitetip reef shark include copepod elongatus and praniza parasitic larvae of isopod gnathia grandilaris bester c biological profiles whitetip reef shark florida museum of natural history ichthyology department retrieved on august 7 2009 while resting during day these sharks have been observed being cleaned by wrasse and goby elacatinus unusually there is also a report of seven whitetip reef sharks adopting a cleaning posture mouth agape and gills flared in midst of a swarm of non cleaning hyperiid amphipods mechanical stimulation from moving amphipods are thought to have evoked this behavior through their similarity to actual cleaner organisms feeding thumb lower jaw and teeth of whitetip reef shark with its slender lithe body whitetip reef shark specializes in wriggling into narrow crevices and holes in reef and extracting prey inaccessible to other reef sharks alternatively it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water this species feeds mainly on bony fishes including eels snappers parrotfishes and goatfishes as well as octopuses spiny lobsters and crabs whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to olfactory acoustic and electrical cues given off by potential prey while its visual system is attuned more to movement and or contrast than to object details nelson d r and r h johnson 1970 acoustic studies on sharks rangiroa atoll july 1969 onr technical report 2 no 68 c it is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low frequency sounds in 25 100 hz range which evoke struggling fish whitetip reef sharks hunt primarily at night when many fishes are asleep and easily taken after dusk groups of sharks methodically scour reef often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey multiple sharks may target same prey item covering every exit route from a particular coral head each shark hunts for itself and in competition with others in its group unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and are unlikely to be stirred into a feeding frenzy despite their nocturnal habits whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime off borneo this species gathers around reef drop offs to feed on food brought up by rising current off hawaii they follow hawaiian monk seals monachus and attempt to steal their catches a whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food life history thumb upright 1 2 left alt four sharks cruising amongst shallow rock outcrops gregarious in nature whitetip reef sharks are often found in groups like other members of its family whitetip reef shark is viviparous once developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which mother delivers nourishment for remainder of gestation mature females have a single functional ovary on left side and two functional uteruses reproductive cycle is biennial mating mating is initiated when up to five males follow closely behind a female and bite at her fins and body possibly cued by pheromones indicating female s readiness each male attempts to seize female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously once engaged sharks sink to bottom whereupon male or males rotates one of his claspers forward inflates associated siphon sac a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater that is used to flush sperm into female and attempts to make contact with female s vent in many cases female resists by pressing her belly against bottom and arching her tail this may reflect mate choice on her part male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation as while he is holding female s pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen on other hand if female is willing pair settles side by side with their heads pressed against bottom and their bodies at an upward angle after a gestation period of 10 13 months females give birth to litters of 1 6 usually 2 3 pups number of offspring is not correlated with female size each female produces an estimated average of 12 pups over her entire lifetime parturition occurs from may to august autumn and winter in french polynesia in july summer off enewetak atoll and in october summer off australia females give birth while swimming making violent twists and turns of their bodies each pup takes under an hour to fully emerge newborns measure long and have relatively longer caudal fins than adults this shark develops slowly compared to other requiem sharks newborns grow at a rate of per year while adults grow as a rate of per year sexual maturity is reached at a length of around and an age of 8 9 years though mature males as small as long have been recorded from maldives suggesting regional variation in maturation size on great barrier reef males live to 14 years and females to 19 years maximum lifespan of this shark may be upwards of 25 years in 2008 a whitetip reef shark produced a single pup through possibly asexual means at nyiregyhaza centre in hungary previous instances of asexual reproduction in sharks have been reported in sphyrna and blacktip shark carcharhinus limbatus human interactions unlike its oceanic cousin white tip reef shark is more harmless and is seldom aggressive unless provoked they are also fearless and curious as whitetip reef sharks may approach swimmers closely to investigate however these sharks readily attempt and quite boldly to steal catches from spear fishers which has resulted in several people being bitten in process in some places local whitetip reef sharks have learned to associate sound of a speargun discharge or a boat dropping anchor with food and respond within seconds as of 2008

areas present a substantial risk of ciguatera poisoning especially liver which contains a much higher concentration of toxin than meat international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as near threatened as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing and thus far unregulated fishing pressure in tropics its restricted habitat low dispersal and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark s capacity for recovering from overfishing on great barrier reef populations of whitetip reef sharks in fishing zones have been reduced by 80 relative to no entry zones furthermore populations in no take zones where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited exhibit levels of depletion comparable to fishing zones due to poaching demographic models
