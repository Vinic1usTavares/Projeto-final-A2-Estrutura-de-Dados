line drawing of a nassau class battleship showing disposition of main battery design work on nassau class began in late 1903 in context of anglo german naval arms race at time battleships of foreign navies had begun to carry increasingly heavy secondary batteries including italian and american ships with guns and british ships with guns outclassing previous german battleships of with their secondaries german designers initially considered ships equipped with secondary guns but erroneous reports in early 1904 that british s would be equipped with a secondary battery of guns prompted them to consider an even more powerful ship armed with an all big gun armament consisting of eight guns over next two years design was refined into a larger vessel with twelve of guns by which time britain had launched all big gun battleship ship was long wide and had a draft of she displaced with a normal load and fully laden she retained 3 shaft triple expansion engines instead of more advanced turbine engines steam for engines was provided by twelve coal fired water tube boilers this type of machinery was chosen at request of both admiral alfred von tirpitz and navy s construction department latter stated in 1905 that use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself this decision was based solely on cost at time parsons held a monopoly on steam turbines and required a 1 million gold mark royalty fee for every turbine engine german firms were not ready to begin production of turbines on a large scale until 1910 rheinland carried twelve sk l 45 guns in an unusual hexagonal configuration her secondary armament consisted of twelve sk l 45 guns and sixteen sk l 45 guns all of which were mounted in casemates ship was also armed with six submerged torpedo tubes one

and battlecruisers von der tann and force operated under command of vice admiral franz von hipper eight battleships were to provide cover for forces engaging russian flotilla first attempt on 8 august

slava resulting in three hits on russian ship that forced her to retreat by 19 august russian minefields had been cleared and flotilla entered gulf however reports of allied submarines in area prompted germans to call off operation following day admiral hipper later remarked that to keep valuable ships for a considerable time in a limited area in which enemy submarines were increasingly active with corresponding risk of damage and loss was to indulge in a gamble out of all proportion to advantage to be derived from occupation of gulf before capture of riga from land side return to
