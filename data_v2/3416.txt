of track is original critics and fans alike say artwork is lackluster at best there is a certain old vibe to cover what with font of writing and shot in itself but it s not helping singer in any way garner much interest in release leah greenblatt of entertainment weekly said louboutins does for ultra high end shoe brand what crocs do for sexy she pointed out how song was not as good as lopez s previous material and at one point even called song poo further to this peter of e online was also critical of song suggesting that song leaked online before its official debut to warn fans of what lopez was about to inflict on them track begins with singer insisting i m taking back my love personally we wish we could take back last three minutes and 49 seconds tom stacks of entertainment weekly was less than impressed saying j lo needs to move on from her recording career she had some fun catchy songs if you had my love love don t cost a thing but trying to regain musical relevance by singing about pricey high heels just seems a little sad i say focus on getting movie career back on track becky bain of idolator was more positive of song saying she actually forgot lopez is still considered a singer what with her two year hiatus to focus on all her fragrances and clothing lines and babies and such it s nice to have her back yes not every j lo song was a hit but we all danced to if you had my love and waiting for tonight back in day louboutins definitely has catchiest chorus she s had in years this could actually bring jennifer out of pit her last album brave dug her into nick levine from digital spy described track as a tricky and dream produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition with a proper janet jackson style dance break truth be told it s not a j lo classic to rival play or love don t cost a thing and it s about as original as starting your day with a bowl of kellogg s cornflakes but it does burrow into your brain after a few
