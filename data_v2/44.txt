thumb karlsruhe circa 1930 new cruiser was ordered as cruiser c and given temporary name ersatz medusa as a replacement for old cruiser construction of karlsruhe began on 27 july 1926 with her keel laying at deutsche werke shipyard in kiel she was launched on 20 august 1927 and she was commissioned into reichsmarine on 6 november 1929 gardiner chesneau p 230 karlsruhe completed sea trials in baltic sea after entering service after which she was assigned to training ship duty in may 1930 she departed on her first overseas training cruise to africa and south america after returning to germany she was modernized late in year her foremast was shortened and her rear superstructure was slightly enlarged over next five years she embarked on four more world cruises for naval cadets traveling as far as japan between each cruise she conducted exercises with rest of fleet in german waters gunther lutjens served as ship s commander from september 1934 to september 1935 williamson pp 18 19 in 1935 she had more modifications made including installation of a pole mast aft of funnels along with an aircraft catapult amidships with a crane to handle floatplanes williamson p 18 on her last training cruise in 1936 karlsruhe was badly damaged by a tropical storm in pacific ocean williamson p 19 structural weaknesses in her mostly welded hull plating caused significant damage and cruiser was forced to put into san diego in april for repairs there her hull was repaired and strengthened which increased her displacement and beam slightly she returned to germany in june 1936 and immediately went into drydock for more permanent repairs and a major overhaul during this period in dockyard hands she had her two single mount 8 8 cm anti aircraft guns replaced with three twin mounts fire control directors were also installed for these guns after emerging from this refit she conducted sea trials and then joined non intervention patrols during spanish civil war though she only remained off spain for a few months world war ii after returning to germany she resumed training duties in baltic she was withdrawn from service in may 1938 for a major modernization funnels were modified with raked caps and searchlight platforms on their sides ship s 8 8 cm guns were replaced with more powerful 10 5 cm guns work lasted until november 1939 shortly after outbreak of world war ii she spent next several months on trials and training maneuvers on 4 january karlsruhe and minelayer schiff 23 were sent to intercept swedish steamer konung oscar which was transporting polish refugees from riga to sweden karlsruhe caught swedish vessel declared it a prize and sent it and 41 poles aboard to memel rohwer p 13 she was not ready for combat operations by start of operation weserubung so she was used as a troop transport for attack on kristiansand attack force also included an e boat tender four large torpedo boats and several e boats thumb left karlsruhe in san diego in 1934 invasion force left bremerhaven early on 8 april 1940 bound for kristiansand when they arrived a heavy fog obscured city making passage of fjord outside harbor very dangerous as a result they had to wait until following morning to begin attack as karlsruhe entered fjord she came under heavy fire from norwegian coastal guns at fortress cruiser turned in fjord to bring her full broadside into action artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered port forcing both sides to cease fire norwegians surrendered an hour later and german ships landed their soldiers williamson p 20 karlsruhe then left kristiansand with three of torpedo boats as escorts british submarine was positioned outside fjord and when her crew spotted german ships she fired a spread of torpedoes karlsruhe zig zagged to evade torpedoes but two still hit ship one struck her bow and other hit amidships they blasted large holes in hull and allowed thousands of tons of water to flood ship flooding disabled her engines and electricity generators which cut off power to pumps that were trying to keep pace with progressively worsening flooding with pumps shut off there was no hope to save karlsruhe and so her commander friedrich rieve issued order to abandon her two hours after attack torpedo boat took off her crew and fired two more torpedoes into ship to ensure that she sank williamson p 21 rieve and his executive officer were both severely criticized for failing to take all possible steps to save karlsruhe in a later investigation into sinking report concluded that since ship was still afloat after two hours and two torpedoes were required to sink her it might have been possible to take her under tow back to kristiansand or another port in addition forward pumps still had power and so flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a return to a safe harbor notes footnotes citations references category konigsberg class cruisers 1927 category ships built in kiel
