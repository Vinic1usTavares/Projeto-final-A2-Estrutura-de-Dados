relationship thompson said it seemed to be written in stars that mercedes and riley will get back together but dr browning won t let that happen and to do this he threatened riley thompson claimed

suggests that riley killed lynsey and that doctor browning is innocent doctor browning appears at trial to give evidence which metcalfe revealed is a total surprise i don t think she knows how she ll

after chance and feels that she doesn t deserve anything more in another twist mercedes discovered that silas would not be put on trial and would instead be put in an institute for insane metcalfe

mercedes felt like silas was getting away with it metcalfe explained that mercedes feared that silas would escape and explained that mercedes never recovered from her ordeal but did what she usually did put it in a box and tried to forget about it if mercedes dwelt on all bad things she s been through she d go crazy that box must be full now metcalfe told katy moon from inside soap that to forget about situation mercedes wants to feel numb and as a means of escape she called doctor browning which left her feeling awful metcalfe explained that mercedes was in self destruct mode and she hates herself for having sex with doctor browning although she does not take money this time metcalfe justified mercedes actions by saying mercedes was looking for any distraction any way to escape her demons metcalfe told a journalist from sun s magazine tv buzz that mercedes believes doctor browning will help her move on with her ordeal mercedes took a business man back to her hotel room where things end badly she locked herself in bathroom and refused to come out as metcalfe explained lynsey soon arrived to comfort her and came to her rescue when she s at her lowest point lynsey can see how broken mercedes is on friendship metcalfe said that characters are like chalk and cheese which i think works well while hassan said characters have this kind of prickly friendship she added that they have a lot of things in common but they re very different people it s almost like they shouldn t be friends but opposites attract lynsey sees qualities in mercy that she kind of wishes she had herself mercy s very straight talking she s quite ballsy and calls a spade a spade and sometimes lynsey wishes she had a bit of that gusto so i think that s what attracts her to mercy both metcalfe and hassan praised friendship between mercedes and lynsey with metcalfe saying she loved friendship and enjoyed seeing her persona form a good bond with lynsey while hassan praised chemistry between herself and metcalfe riley was furious when he discovered mercedes escorting and told her he did not want her around their son bobby regarding mercedes maternal feelings for bobby she stated mercedes feels that when she s getting closer to riley she can bond a bit more with bobby as well but when riley forgets her she finds it a lot more difficult to cope with bobby mercedes explained that she did not sleep with doctor browning for money this time which calmed riley down metcalfe said that mercedes was very honest and open with riley and that they were very natural together actress said riley had begun to see that she s really damaged and has been affected by what s happened a lot more than she s letting on metcalfe added that riley felt sorry for mercedes after seeing vulnerable mercedes one who doesn t hurt people metcalfe said that mercedes wanted riley back but if she could not she wanted to prevent anyone else from getting life mercedes would have had if she had married riley she

would feel utterly betrayed to cause tension between friends mercedes discovered riley s relationship with lynsey metcalfe said that her character gets such a shock but because of mercedes close friendship with lynsey she might not react way people expect metcalfe went on to say that she felt her character s feelings for riley have gone beyond love it s an obsession now she explained that mercedes plan was more destructive than winning him back and that she was playing a game old mercedes will be back shortly stalking mitzeee right thumb 200px rachel shenton pictured said mitzeee has no idea mercedes was her character s mystery stalker mitzeee begins being stalked her portrayer shenton said mitzeee was unaware of who stalker was and that mercedes hasn t even crossed her mind she thinks it s a crazed fan viewers learn that it was mercedes stalking stopped but later was resumed when mitzeee and riley begin a relationship shenton explained that stalker had a key to mitzeee s flat and had been watching her every move and said that not only has stalker come back but they ve come back on a whole new level shenton added that at this point mitzeee definitely has no idea that it s mercedes in fact mercedes is probably last person that she d suspect she actually thinks that it s lynsey and accuses her because it seems to make sense when mitzeee realised mercedes was her stalker mercedes knocked mitzeee out after mitzeee tries to stab her mercedes realised that she will be blamed for stalking mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people mitzeee was mad metcalfe said situation was born through pure desperation she said that thought of mitzeee riley and bobby as a family together was too much for her to take and she just saw red i don t think it s something that mercedes thought about or planned she wouldn t have even dreamed of doing it to herself but at time she saw it as only way out of situation shenton explained that mitzeee was worried due to stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine which as she states isn t a great combination shenton revealed that mercedes arrived to see who still has no idea who stalker really is but as they re talking mercedes says something that makes mitzeee discover truth and she s totally shocked mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in kitchen next thing you know mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious first thing she sees is mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere mitzeee doesn t have a clue whether she could have stabbed mercedes or if someone else came into flat and did it according to metcalfe during mercedes hospitalisation and recuperation she starts putting it on to get sympathy she s determined to get what she wants metcalfe explained that mercedes did not feel guilt at all she just wants riley back and she ll do whatever it takes to get him metcalfe believed that it was easy for mercedes to lie hence why she does it so much and so well mercedes felt that she had to lie and found it easy to cry if she needed to especially if it will benefit her metcalfe was unsure whether audience would start to hate her character because she believed that mercedes was not hateful she stated i hope i ve done a good job and people still feel sorry for her she said that viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for mercedes i was getting lots of tweets saying i feel so sorry for mercedes she needs to get back with riley and mitzeee is being a bitch metcalfe said that she was surprised by fans strong reaction hollyoaks executive
