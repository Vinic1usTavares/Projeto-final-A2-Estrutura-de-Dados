mary magdalene sometimes called simply magdalene or madeleine was a jewish woman who according to four canonical gospels traveled with jesus as one of his followers and was a witness to his crucifixion burial and resurrection mary magdalene cliches bbc religions july 20 2011 she is mentioned by name 12 times in canonical gospels more than most of apostles and more than any other non family woman in gospels according to many mainstream scholars mary s epithet magdalene may mean that she came from town of magdala a fishing town on western shore of sea of galilee gospel of luke lists mary as one of women who traveled with jesus and helped support his ministry out of their resources indicating that she was probably relatively wealthy same passage also states that seven demons had been driven out of her a statement which is repeated in longer ending of mark in all four canonical gospels she is a witness to crucifixion of jesus and in synoptic gospels she is also present at his burial all four gospels identify her either alone or as a member of a larger group of women which includes jesus s mother as first witness to empty tomb and first to testify to jesus s resurrection thompson mary r mary of magdala apostle and leader new york paulist press 1995 for these reasons she is known in many christian traditions as apostle to apostles mary is a central figure in later apocryphal gnostic christian writings including dialogue of savior pistis sophia gospel of thomas gospel of philip and gospel of mary these texts which scholars do not regard as containing accurate historical information portray her as jesus s closest disciple and only one who truly understood his teachings in gnostic gospels mary magdalene s closeness to jesus results in tension with other disciples particularly simon peter in a series of easter sermons delivered in 581 pope gregory i conflated mary magdalene who is introduced in luke 8 2 with mary of bethany luke 10 39 and unnamed sinful woman who anoints jesus s feet in this resulted in a widespread but inaccurate belief that she was a repentant prostitute or promiscuous woman elaborate medieval legends from western europe tell exaggerated tales of mary magdalene s wealth and beauty as well as her alleged journey to southern france identification of mary magdalene with mary of bethany and unnamed sinful woman was a major controversy in years leading up to reformation and some protestant leaders rejected it during counter reformation catholic church used mary magdalene as a symbol of penance in 1969 identification of mary magdalene with mary of bethany and sinful woman was removed from general roman calendar by pope paul vi but view of her as a former prostitute has persisted in popular culture mary magdalene is considered to be a saint by catholic eastern orthodox anglican and lutheran churches with a feast day of july 22 other protestant churches honor her as a heroine of faith eastern orthodox churches also commemorate her on sunday of myrrhbearers orthodox equivalent of one of western three marys traditions modern speculations that mary magdalene was jesus s wife or that she had a sexual relationship with him are regarded by most historians as highly dubious life it is widely accepted among secular historians that like jesus mary magdalene was a real historical figure nonetheless very little is known about her life unlike paul apostle mary magdalene has left behind no writings of her own nor were any works later forged under her name as was common for other disciples she is never mentioned in any of pauline epistles or in any of general epistles earliest and most reliable sources about her life are three synoptic gospels of mark matthew and luke which were all written during first century ad larry hurtado lord jesus christ devotion to jesus in earliest christianity 260 during jesus s ministry thumb upright 1 2 photograph taken 1900 of ruins of

magdala a town on lake of gennesaret or from word which signifies a plaiting or curling of hair a thing usual with harlots commentary on new testament from talmud and hebraica chapter upon gospel of st matthew a village on western shore of sea of galilee that was primarily known in antiquity as a fishing town mary was by far most common jewish given name for females during first century so it was necessary for authors of gospels to call her magdalene in order to distinguish her from other women named mary who followed jesus although gospel of mark earliest surviving gospel does not mention mary magdalene until jesus s crucifixion gospel of luke provides a brief summary of her role during his ministry thumb upright 1 5 conversion of mary magdalene 1548 by paolo veronese according to gospel of luke jesus exorcized seven demons from mary magdalene statement that mary had been possessed by seven demons is repeated in part of longer ending of that gospel this is not found in earliest manuscripts and is actually a second century addition to original text possibly based on gospel of luke may herbert g and bruce m metzger new oxford annotated bible with apocrypha 1977 in first century demons were widely believed to be cause of physical and psychological illness bruce chilton a scholar of early christianity states that reference to number of demons being seven may mean that mary had to undergo seven exorcisms probably over a long period of time due to first six being partially or wholly unsuccessful bart d ehrman a new testament scholar and historian of early christianity contends that number seven may be merely symbolic since in jewish tradition seven was number of completion so statement that mary was possessed by seven demons may simply mean she was completely overwhelmed by their power in either case mary must have suffered from severe emotional or psychological trauma in order for an exorcism of this kind to have been perceived as necessary consequently her devotion to jesus on account of this healing must have been very strong gospel writers normally relish giving dramatic descriptions of jesus s public exorcisms with possessed person wailing thrashing and tearing his or her clothes in front of a crowd fact that mary s exorcism is given so little attention may indicate that it was either done in private or that it was not seen as particularly dramatic because mary is listed as one of women who were supporting jesus s ministry financially she must have been relatively wealthy places where she and other women are mentioned throughout gospels strongly indicate that they were vital to jesus s ministry and fact that mary magdalene always appears first whenever she is listed in synoptic gospels as a member of a group of women indicates that she was seen as most important out of all of them carla ricci notes that in lists of disciples mary magdalene occupies a similar position among jesus s female followers as simon peter does among male apostles fact that women played such an active and important role in jesus s ministry was not entirely radical or even unique inscriptions from a synagogue in aphrodisias in asia minor from around same time period reveal that many of major donors to synagogue were women furthermore it is highly improbable that historical jesus ever advocated complete equality between sexes especially considering that one of best attested facts of his life is that all twelve of his chosen apostles were male nonetheless jesus s ministry did bring women greater liberation than they would have typically held in mainstream jewish society jesus taught that in imminent kingdom of god there would be a reversal of roles and those who had been oppressed would be exalted according to ehrman this idea would have probably been particularly appealing and empowering to women of time such as mary magdalene who may have felt oppressed by traditional attitudes to gender roles witness to jesus s crucifixion and burial thumb upright 1 detail of mary magdalene weeping at crucifixion of jesus as portrayed in descent from cross 1435 by flemish artist rogier van der weyden all four canonical gospels agree that mary magdalene along with several other women watched jesus s crucifixion from a distance lists names of women present as mary magdalene mary mother of james and salome lists mary magdalene mary mother of james and joseph and unnamed mother of sons of zebedee who may be same person mark calls salome mentions a group of women watching crucifixion but does not give any of their names lists mary mother of jesus her sister mary wife of cleopas and mary magdalene as witnesses to crucifixion virtually all reputable historians agree that jesus was crucified by romans under orders of pontius pilate jesus remembered by james d g dunn 2003 p 339 states of baptism and crucifixion that these two facts in life of jesus command almost universal assent nonetheless gospels accounts of jesus s crucifixion differ considerably and most secular historians agree that some of details in accounts have been altered to fit their authors theological agendas ehrman states that presence of mary magdalene and other women at cross is probably historical because christians would have been unlikely to make up that main witnesses to crucifixion were women and also because their presence is independently attested in both synoptic gospels and in gospel of john maurice casey concurs that presence of mary magdalene and other women at crucifixion of jesus may be recorded as a historical fact according to e p sanders reason why women watched crucifixion even after male disciples had fled may have been because they were less likely to be arrested because they were braver than men or because of some combination thereof thumb upright 1 3 left deposition 1507 by raphael showing a distressed reddish blond haired mary magdalene dressed in fine clothes clutching hand of jesus s body as he is carried to tomb all four canonical gospels as well as apocryphal gospel of peter agree that jesus s body was taken down from cross and buried by a man named joseph of arimathea lists mary magdalene and mary mother of as witnesses to burial of jesus lists mary magdalene and other mary as witnesses mentions women who had followed him from galilee but does not list any of their names does not mention any women present during joseph s burial of jesus but does mention presence of nicodemus a pharisee with whom jesus had a conversation near beginning of gospel ehrman who previously accepted story of jesus s burial as historical now rejects it as a later invention on basis that roman governors almost never allowed for executed criminals to be given any kind of burial and pontius pilate in particular was not sort of ruler who would break with tradition and policy when kindly asked by a member of jewish council to provide a decent burial for a crucified victim john dominic has controversially argued that jesus s body was probably eaten by wild dogs ehrman notes that this was most common fate for victims of crucifixion but states that it is impossible to know for certain what actually happened to jesus s body once it was removed from cross casey argues that jesus really was given a proper burial by joseph of arimathea noting that on some very rare occasions roman governors did release bodies of executed prisoners for burial nonetheless he rejects that jesus could have been interred in an expensive tomb with a stone rolled in front of it like one described in gospels leading him to conclude that mary and other women must not have actually seen tomb sanders affirms jesus s burial by joseph of arimathea in presence of mary magdalene and other female followers as completely historical resurrection of jesus thumb upright 1 3 holy women at christ s tomb 1590s by annibale in mary magdalene and other mary encounter an angel at tomb who tells them that christ has risen earliest description of jesus s post resurrection appearances is a quotation of a pre pauline creed preserved by paul apostle in which was written roughly 20 years before any of gospels this passage makes no mention of mary magdalene other women or story of empty tomb at all but rather credits simon peter with having been first to see risen jesus despite this all four canonical gospels as well as apocryphal gospel of peter agree that mary magdalene either alone or as a member of a group was first person to discover that jesus s tomb was empty nonetheless details of accounts differ drastically according to earliest account of discovery of empty tomb mary magdalene mary mother of james and salome went to tomb just after sunrise a day and half after jesus s burial and found that stone had already been rolled away they went inside and saw a young man dressed in white who told them that jesus had risen from dead and instructed them to tell male disciples that he would meet them in galilee instead women ran away and told no one because they were too afraid original text of gospel ends here without resurrected jesus ever actually making an appearance to anyone casey argues that reason for this abrupt ending may be because gospel of mark is an unfinished first draft according to mary magdalene and other mary went to tomb an earthquake occurred and an angel dressed in white descended from heaven and rolled aside stone as women were watching angel told them that jesus had risen from dead then risen jesus himself appeared to women as they were leaving tomb and told them to tell other disciples that he would meet them in galilee according to a group of unnamed women went to tomb and found stone already rolled away as in mark they went inside and saw two young men dressed in white who told them that jesus had risen from dead then they went and told eleven remaining apostles who dismissed their story as nonsense in luke s account jesus never appears to women but instead makes his first appearance to cleopas and an unnamed disciple on road to emmaus luke s narrative also removes injunction for women to tell disciples to return to galilee and instead has jesus tell disciples not to return to galilee but rather to stay in precincts of jerusalem thumb upright 1 5 left appearance of jesus christ to maria magdalena 1835 by alexander andreyevich ivanov in mary magdalene sees risen jesus alone and he tells her don t touch me for i have not yet ascended to my father mary magdalene s role in resurrection narrative is greatly increased in account from gospel of john according to mary magdalene went to tomb alone when it was still dark and saw that stone had already been rolled away she did not see anyone but immediately ran to tell peter and beloved disciple who came with her to tomb and confirmed that it was empty but returned home without seeing risen jesus according to mary now alone in garden outside tomb saw two angels sitting where jesus s body had been then risen jesus approached her she at first mistook him for gardener but after she heard him say her name she recognized him and cried out which is aramaic for teacher she tried to touch him but he told her don t touch me for i have not yet ascended to my father jesus then sent her to tell other apostles good news of his resurrection gospel of john therefore portrays mary magdalene as first apostle apostle sent to apostles because scribes were unsatisfied with abrupt ending of gospel of mark they wrote several different alternative endings for it in shorter ending which is found in very few manuscripts women go to those around peter and tell them what they had seen at tomb followed by a brief declaration of gospel being preached from east to west this very forced ending contradicts last verse of original gospel stating that women told no one longer ending which is found in most surviving manuscripts is an amalgam of traditions containing episodes derived from other gospels first it describes an appearance by jesus to mary magdalene alone as in gospel of john followed by brief descriptions of him appearing to two disciples on road to emmaus as in gospel of luke and to eleven remaining disciples as in gospel of matthew in a book published in 2006 ehrman states that it appears virtually certain that stories of empty tomb regardless of whether or not they are accurate can definitely be traced back to historical mary magdalene pointing out that in jewish society women were regarded as unreliable witnesses and were forbidden from giving testimony in court so early christians would have had no motive to make up a story about a woman being first to discover empty tomb in fact if they had made story up they would have had strong motivation to make peter jesus s closest disciple while he was alive discoverer of tomb instead he also points out that story of mary magdalene discovering empty tomb is independently attested in synoptics gospel of john and in gospel of peter n t wright states that it is frankly impossible to imagine that women at tomb were inserted into tradition after paul s day casey challenges this argument contending that women at tomb are not legal witnesses but rather heroines in line with a long jewish tradition he contends that story of empty tomb was invented by either author of gospel of mark or by one of his sources based on historically genuine fact that women really had been present at jesus s crucifixion and burial in a book published in 2014 ehrman rejects his own previous argument stating that story of empty tomb can only be a later invention because there is virtually no possibility that jesus s body could have been placed in any kind of tomb and if jesus was never buried then no one alive at time could have claimed that his non existent tomb had been found empty he concludes that idea that early christians would have had no motive to make up story simply suffers from a poverty of imagination and that they would have had all kinds of possible motives especially since women were overrepresented in early christian communities and women themselves would have had strong motivation to make up a story about other women being first to find tomb he does conclude later however that mary magdalene must have been one of people who had an experience in which she thought she saw risen jesus citing her prominence in gospel resurrection narratives and her absence everywhere else in gospels as evidence apocryphal early christian writings in apocryphal texts mary magdalene is portrayed as a visionary and leader of early movement whom jesus loved more than he loved other disciples king karen l women in ancient christianity new discoveries frontline first christians web november 2 2009 these texts were largely written long after death of historical mary magdalene and are generally not regarded by scholars as reliable sources of information about her life sanders summarizes scholarly consensus that very very little in apocryphal gospels could conceivably go back to time of jesus they are legendary and mythological of all apocryphal material only some of sayings in gospel of thomas are worth consideration nonetheless apocryphal gospels have been frequently promoted in works addressed to popular audiences as though they were reliable often to support sensationalist claims about jesus and mary magdalene s relationship dialogue of savior thumb fragment of a fourth century text of apocryphal dialogue of savior in which mary magdalene is a central figure earliest dialogue between jesus and mary magdalene is probably dialogue of savior a badly damaged gnostic text discovered in nag hammadi library in 1945 dialogue consists of a conversation between jesus and three disciples judas thomas matthew and mary fact that author chose mary over all other apostles including simon peter is highly indicative of her importance for early gnostic christians in saying 53 dialogue even attributes to mary three aphorisms that are attributed to jesus in new testament wickedness of each day is sufficient workers deserve their food disciples

large volume containing numerous early gnostic treatises document takes form of a long dialogue in which jesus answers his followers questions of sixty four questions thirty nine are presented by a woman who is referred to as mary or mary magdalene at one point jesus tells mary mary thou blessed one whom i will perfect in all mysteries of those of height discourse in openness thou whose heart is raised to kingdom of heaven more than all thy brethren at another point he tells her well done mary you are more blessed than all women on earth because you will be fullness of fullness and completion of completion simon peter annoyed at mary s dominance of conversation tells jesus my master we cannot endure this woman who gets in our way and does not let any of us speak though she talks all time mary defends herself saying my master i understand in my mind that i can come forward at any time to interpret what pistis sophia divine being who gives wisdom has said but i am afraid of peter because he threatens me and hates our gender jesus assures her any of those filled with spirit of light will come forward to interpret what i say no one will be able to oppose them gospel of thomas thumb last page of gospel of thomas from nag hammadi containing account of jesus s reaffirmation of mary s authority to peter gospel of thomas usually dated to late first or early second century was among ancient texts discovered in nag hammadi library in 1945 meyer marvin 2004 gospel of thomas hidden sayings of jesus harpercollins gospel of thomas consists entirely of 114 sayings attributed to jesus many of these sayings are similar to ones in canonical gospels but others are completely unlike anything found in new testament some scholars believe that at least a few of these sayings may authentically be traced back to historical jesus two of sayings reference a woman named mary who is generally regarded as mary magdalene in saying 21 mary herself asks jesus perfectly innocuous question whom are your disciples like jesus responds they are like children who have settled in a field which is not theirs when owners of field come they will say let us have back our field they will undress in their presence in order to let them have back their field and to give it back to them following this jesus continues his explanation with a parable about owner of a house and a thief ending with common rhetoric whoever has ears to hear let him hear mary s mention in saying 114 however has generated considerable controversy simon peter said to them let mary go forth from among us for women are not worthy of life jesus said behold i shall lead her that i may make her male in order that she also may become a living spirit like you males for every woman who makes herself male shall enter into kingdom of heaven in ancient world it was almost universally believed that women were inferior to men and that they were in essence imperfect men who had not fully developed when peter challenges mary s authority in this saying he does so on widely accepted premise that she is a woman and therefore an inferior human being when jesus rebukes him for this he bases his response on same premise stating that mary and all faithful women like her will become men and that salvation is therefore open to all even those who are presently women gospel of philip thumb text of gospel of philip from nag hammadi gospel of philip dating from second or third century survives in part among texts found in nag hammadi in 1945 old and new testament and gnostic contexts and text are discussed by robert m grant mystery of marriage in gospel of philip christianae 15 3 september 1961 129 140 in a manner very similar to gospel of philip presents mary magdalene among jesus female entourage adding that she was his koinonos a greek word variously translated in contemporary versions as partner associate comrade companion thayer and smith greek lexicon entry for koinonos new testament greek lexicon http www com there were three who always walked with lord mary his mother and her sister and magdalene who was called his companion his sister this confusing reference is already in original manuscript it is not clear if text refers to jesus or his mother s sister or whether intention is to say something else his mother and his companion were each a mary gospel of philip uses cognates of koinonos and coptic equivalents to refer to literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse but also metaphorically referring to a spiritual partnership and reunification of gnostic christian with divine realm gospel of philip also contains another passage relating to jesus s relationship with mary magdalene text is badly fragmented and speculated but unreliable additions are shown in brackets and companion of saviour was mary magdalene christ loved mary more than all disciples and used to kiss her often on mouth rest of disciples were offended by it and expressed disapproval they said to him why do you love her more than all of us saviour answered and said to them why do i not love you like her when a blind man and one who sees are both together in darkness they are no different from one another when light comes then he who sees will see light and he who is blind will remain in darkness peter kirby for early christians kissing did not have a romantic connotation and it was common for christians to kiss their fellow believers as a way of greeting christ files how historians know what they know about jesus john p 95 sydney south blue bottle books 2006 this tradition is still practiced in many christian congregations today and is known as kiss of peace ehrman explains that in context of gospel of philip kiss of peace is used as a symbol for passage of truth from one person to another and that it is not in any way an act of divine foreplay gospel of mary thumb papyrus oxyrhynchus l 3525 a fragment of greek text of gospel of mary gospel of mary is only surviving gospel named after a woman and it provides important information about role of women in early church gospel of mary was probably written over a century after historical mary magdalene s death gospel does not claim to have been written by her and its author is in fact anonymous instead it received its title because it is about her main surviving text of gospel comes from a coptic translation preserved in a fifth century manuscript gnosticus 1 discovered in cairo in 1896 as a result of numerous intervening conflicts manuscript was not published until 1955 nearly a full lifetime after its discovery roughly half text of gospel in this manuscript has been lost de boer esther a gospel of mary listening to beloved disciple london continuum 2006 2005 first six pages and four from middle are missing in addition to this coptic translation two brief third century fragments of gospel in original greek p rylands 463 and p oxyrhynchus 3525 have also been discovered which were published in 1938 and 1983 respectively first part of gospel deals with jesus s parting words to his followers after a post resurrection appearance mary first appears in second part of gospel in which she tells other disciples who are all in fright for their own lives do not weep or grieve or be in doubt for his grace will be with you all and will protect you rather let us praise his greatness for he has prepared us and made us truly human unlike in gospel of thomas where women can only be saved by becoming men in gospel of mary they can be saved just as they are peter approaches mary and asks her peter said to mary sister we know that savior loved you more than rest of woman tell us words of savior which you remember which you know but we do not nor have we heard them mary answered and said what is hidden from you i will proclaim to you and she began to speak to them these words i she said i saw lord in a vision and i said to him lord i saw you today in a vision mary then proceeds to describe gnostic cosmology in depth revealing that she is only one who has understood jesus s true teachings andrew challenges mary insisting say what you think about what she said but i do not believe savior said this these teachings are strange ideas peter responds saying did he really speak with a woman in private without our knowledge should we all listen to her did he prefer her to us andrew and peter s responses are intended to demonstrate that they do not understand jesus s teachings and that it is really only mary who truly understands apostle levi comes to mary s defense giving a sharp rebuke to peter peter you are always angry now i see you arguing against this woman like an adversary if savior made her worthy who are you to reject her surely savior knows her well that is why he loved her more than us borborite scriptures also known as were an early christian gnostic sect during late fourth century ad who had numerous scriptures involving mary magdalene including questions of mary greater questions of mary lesser questions of mary and birth of mary none of these texts have survived to present but they are mentioned by early christian heretic hunter epiphanius of salamis in his epiphanius claims that greater questions of mary contained an episode in which during a post resurrection appearance jesus took mary to top of a mountain where he pulled a woman out of his side and engaged in sexual intercourse with her then upon jesus drank his own semen and told mary thus we must do that we may live upon hearing this mary instantly fainted to which jesus responded by helping her up and telling her o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt this story was supposedly basis for borborite eucharist ritual in which they allegedly engaged in orgies and drank semen and menstrual blood as body and blood of christ respectively ehrman casts doubt on accuracy of epiphanius s summary commenting that details of epiphanius s description sound very much like what you can find in ancient rumor mill about secret societies in ancient world legacy patristic era thumb upright 1 7 this fresco from nave of dura europos church dates to 240 ad and contains oldest surviving depiction of mary magdalene she is shown alongside two other women third now almost completely missing due to extensive damage each holding a lit torch and a bowl of myrrh as they approach jesus s tomb which is still sealed most of earliest church fathers do not mention mary magdalene at all and those who do mention her usually only discuss her very briefly in his anti christian polemic true word written between 170 and 180 ad pagan philosopher celsus declared that mary magdalene was nothing more than a hysterical female who either dreamt in a certain state of mind and through wishful thinking had a hallucination due to some mistaken notion an experience which has happened to thousands or which is more likely wanted to impress others by telling this fantastic tale and so by this cock and bull story to provide a chance for other beggars church father origen 184 253 defended christianity against this accusation in his apologetic treatise against celsus pointing to which lists mary magdalene and other mary both seeing resurrected jesus thus providing a second witness origen also preserves a statement from celsus that some christians in his day followed teachings of a woman named who is almost certainly mary magdalene origen merely dismisses this remarking that celsus pours on us a heap of names mary magdalene has reputation in western christianity as being a repentant prostitute or loose woman however these claims are not supported by canonical gospels which at no point imply that she had ever been a prostitute or in any way notable for a sinful way of life misconception likely arose due to a conflation between mary magdalene mary of bethany who anoints jesus s feet in and unnamed sinful woman who anoints jesus s feet in morrow carol ann st mary magdalene redeeming her gospel reputation liguori publications as early as third century church father tertullian 160 225 references touch of woman which was a sinner in effort to prove that jesus was not a phantom but really a solid body this may indicate that mary magdalene was already being conflated with sinful woman in though tertullian never clearly identifies woman of whom he speaks as mary magdalene a sermon attributed to of rome 170 235 refers to mary of bethany and her sister martha seeking jesus in garden like mary magdalene in indicating a conflation between mary of bethany and mary magdalene sermon describes conflated woman as a second eve who compensates for disobedience of first eve through her obedience sermon also explicitly identifies mary magdalene and other women as apostles first clear identification of mary magdalene as a redeemed sinner comes from ephrem syrian 306 373 part of reason for identification of mary magdalene as a sinner may derive from reputation of her birthplace magdala which by late first century was infamous for its inhabitants alleged vice and licentiousness in one of his preserved sayings gregory of nyssa 330 395 identifies mary magdalene as first witness to resurrection that she might set straight again by her faith in resurrection what was turned over in her transgression saint ambrose 340 397 by contrast not only rejected conflation of mary magdalene mary of bethany and anointing sinner but even proposed that authentic mary magdalene herself was in fact two separate people one woman named mary magdalene who discovered empty tomb and a different mary magdalene who saw risen christ saint augustine of hippo 354 430 entertained possibility that mary of bethany and unnamed sinner from luke might be same person but did not associate mary magdalene with either of them instead augustine praised mary magdalene as unquestionably more ardent in her love than these other women who had administered to lord early middle ages unnamed sinful woman in is never identified as a prostitute and in jewish society at time gospel was written sinful could have simply meant that she did not assiduously observe law of moses notion of mary magdalene specifically being a former prostitute or loose woman dates to a claim by pope gregory i gregory great made in an influential homily in around 591 in which he not only identifies magdalene with anonymous sinner with perfume in luke s gospel and with mary of bethany sister of martha and lazarus but also for first time explicitly identifies her sins as ones of a sexual nature in pope gregory s interpretation seven demons expelled from mary magdalene by jesus are transformed into seven deadly sins of medieval catholicism leading mary to be condemned not only for lust but for pride and covetousness as well aspect of repentant sinner became almost equally significant as disciple in her persona as depicted in western art and religious literature fitting well with great importance of penitence in medieval theology in subsequent religious legend mary s story became conflated with that of saint mary of egypt a repentant prostitute who then lived as a hermit with that mary s image was according to susan haskins author of mary magdalene myth and metaphor finally settled for nearly fourteen hundred years although in fact most important late medieval popular accounts of her life describe her as a rich woman whose life of sexual freedom is purely for pleasure johnston 64 accounts are life in golden legend french passion plays and her main subject vie de la by francois de rochefort written 1516 17 see p 11 this composite depiction of mary magdalene was carried into mass texts for her feast day in tridentine mass collect explicitly identifies her as mary of bethany by describing lazarus as her brother and gospel is story of penitent woman anointing jesus feet composite magdalene was never accepted by eastern orthodox churches who saw only mary disciple and believed that after resurrection she lived as a companion to virgin mary and not even in west was it universally accepted benedictine order always celebrated mary of bethany together with martha and lazarus of bethany on july 29 while mary magdalene was celebrated on july 22 not only john chrysostom in east matthew homily 88 but also ambrose de virginitate 3 14 4 15 in west when speaking of mary magdalene after resurrection of jesus christ far from calling her a harlot suggest she was a virgin starting in around eighth century christian sources record mention of a church in magdala purported to have been built on site of mary magdalene s house where jesus exorcized her of seven demons in an eastern tradition supported by western bishop and historian gregory of tours 538 594 mary magdalene is said to have retired to ephesus in asia minor with virgin mary where they both lived out rests of their lives gregory of tours de miraculis i xxx gregory states that mary magdalene was buried in city of ephesus modestus patriarch of jerusalem from 630 until 634 describes a slightly different tradition that mary magdalene had come to ephesus to live with apostle john following death of virgin mary high middle ages thumb in 1279 monks of saint maximin la sainte baume claimed to have discovered mary

rooney mara as eponymous character sought to reverse centuries old portrayal of mary magdalene as a repentant prostitute while also combating conspiracy claims of her being jesus s wife or sexual partner instead film portrays her as jesus s closest disciple and only one who truly understands his teachings this portrayal is partially based on gnostic gospel of mary magdalene film which described as having a strongly feminist bent was praised for its music score and cinematography its surprising faithfulness to biblical narrative and its acting but was criticized as slow moving overwritten and too solemn to be believable it was also criticized by many christians who were offended by film s use of source material in western art early notion of mary magdalene as a sinner and adulteress was reflected in western medieval christian art where she was most commonly depicted female figure after virgin mary she may be shown either as very extravagantly and fashionably dressed unlike other female figures wearing contemporary styles of clothes or alternatively as completely naked but covered by very long blonde or reddish blonde hair latter depictions represent penitent magdalene according to medieval legend that she had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a follower of jesus her story became conflated in west with that of saint mary of egypt a fourth century prostitute turned hermit whose clothes wore out and fell off in desert widespread artistic representations of mary magdalene in tears are source of modern english word maudlin meaning sickeningly sentimental or emotional in medieval depictions mary s long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty supplemented in some german versions such as one by tilman by thick body hair but from sixteenth century some depictions like those by titian show part of her naked body amount of nudity tending to increase in successive periods even if covered she often wears only a drape pulled around her or an undergarment in particular mary is often shown naked in legendary scene of her elevation where she is sustained in desert by angels who raise her up and feed her heavenly manna as recounted in golden legend mary magdalene at foot of cross during crucifixion appears in an eleventh century english manuscript as an device rather than a historical motif intended as expression of an emotional assimilation of event that leads spectator to identify himself with mourners schiller ii 116 other isolated depictions occur but from thirteenth century additions to virgin mary and john as spectators at crucifixion become more common with mary magdalene as most frequently found either kneeling at foot of cross clutching shaft sometimes kissing christ s feet or standing usually at left and behind mary and john with her arms stretched upwards towards christ in a gesture of grief as in a damaged painting by cimabue in upper church at assisi of 1290 a kneeling magdalene by giotto in chapel 1305 was especially influential schiller ii 152 154 as gothic painted crucifixions became crowded compositions magdalene became a prominent figure with a halo and identifiable by her long unbound blonde hair and usually a bright red dress as swooning virgin mary became more common generally occupying attention of john unrestrained gestures of magdalene increasingly represented main display of grief of spectators schiller ii 154 158 according to robert no figure in christian pantheon except jesus virgin mary and john baptist has inspired provoked or confounded imagination of painters more than magdalene apart from crucifixion mary was often shown in scenes of passion of jesus when mentioned in gospels such as crucifixion christ carrying cross and noli me but usually omitted in other scenes showing twelve apostles such as last supper as mary of bethany she is shown as present at resurrection of lazarus her brother and in scene with jesus and

gnostic books rejecting view of raymond e brown that these books were later developments and maintaining instead that extant gospel of john is result of modification of an earlier text that presented

magdalene to be disciple whom jesus loved esther a de boer likewise presents idea as one possibility among others not as a definitive solution to problem of identity of anonymous disciple a theological interpretation of mary as magdala elegant tower and certain churches honor her as a heroine of faith in their teachings dan brown s 2003 bestselling mystery thriller novel da vinci code popularized a number of erroneous ideas about mary magdalene including that she was a member of tribe of benjamin that she was jesus s wife that she was pregnant at crucifixion and that she gave birth to jesus s child who became founder of a bloodline which survives to this very day there is absolutely no historical evidence from canonical or apocryphal gospels other early christian writings or any other ancient sources to support any of these claims da vinci code also purports that figure of beloved disciple to jesus s right in leonardo da vinci s last supper is mary magdalene disguised as one of male disciples art historians maintain that figure is in reality apostle john who only appears feminine due to leonardo s characteristic fascination with blurring lines between sexes a quality which is found in his other paintings such as st john baptist painted 1513 1516 furthermore according to ross king an expert on italian art mary magdalene s appearance at last supper would not have been controversial and leonardo would have had no motive to disguise her as one of other disciples since she was widely venerated in her role as apostle to apostles and patron of dominican order for whom last supper was painted there would have even been precedent for it since earlier italian renaissance painter fra angelico had included her in his painting of last supper numerous works were written in response to historical inaccuracies in da vinci code but novel still exerted massive influence on how members of general public viewed mary magdalene in 2012 scholar karen l king published gospel of jesus wife a purported coptic papyrus fragment in which jesus says my wife she will be able to be my disciple overwhelming consensus of scholars including king herself is that fragment is a modern forgery if genuine papyrus would have dated to sometime between sixth and ninth centuries ad although fragment does not contain name of mary magdalene some authors speculated that she was woman referred to ehrman states that historical sources reveal absolutely nothing about jesus s sexuality and that there is no evidence whatsoever to support idea that jesus and mary magdalene were married or that they had any kind of sexual or romantic relationship none of canonical gospels imply such a thing and even in late gnostic gospels where mary is shown as jesus s closest disciple love between them is not sexual extremely late greater questions of mary which is not extant allegedly portrayed mary not as jesus s wife or partner but rather as an unwilling voyeur furthermore ehrman points out that essenes a contemporary jewish sect who shared many views with jesus and apostle paul jesus s later follower both lived in unmarried celibacy so it is not unreasonable to conclude that jesus did as well furthermore according to jesus taught that marriage would not exist at all in coming kingdom of god since jesus taught that people should live as though kingdom had already arrived this teaching implied a life of unmarried celibacy finally ehrman points out that if jesus had been married to mary magdalene authors of gospels would definitely have mentioned it since they mention all his other family members including his mother mary his father joseph his four brothers and his at least two sisters casey rejects idea of mary magdalene as jesus s wife as nothing more than wild
