which were conducting an operation against afghan taliban in afghanistan s eastern kunar province were fired upon from border positions within pakistan nato came under fire from pakistan before attack sources reuters 27 november 2011 there was firing coming from position against afghan army soldiers who requested support said one afghan official in kabul afghan official further stated they were being fired upon directly from a pakistani military outpost itself a western official backed up that view by stating they were fired on from a pakistani army base and it was a defensive action according to afghan and us accounts helicopters were then called in for support against incoming fire afghan soldiers called in deadly nato airstrike ap rahim and khan 27 november 2011 a pakistani defence official reportedly admitted that soldiers in pakistani border post sitting there for express purpose of stopping infiltration fired a few flares a couple of mortar rounds and one or two bursts of machine gun fire in that direction another us official in kabul pointed to an incident in september 2010 when a nato helicopter fired on a pakistan outpost killing two soldiers it was a situation where insurgent forces butted right up against a pakistani border post and used that as a firing position when we fired back we hit pakistani security forces military officials in kabul claimed insurgents in pakistan have also used empty pakistan border bases to stage attacks which they say may have been working assumption of coalition forces who called in airstrike when they drew fire one us official said nato forces had informed pakistani army s 11th corps command near western border that operations against taliban insurgents would take place on that day pakistani general abbas admitted in a press conference that coalition forces had informed our military earlier much earlier that they will be conducting an operation there according to us military information about

incident sparked outrage and controversy in pakistan which termed attack an unprovoked and indiscriminate firing an irresponsible act and a stark violation of its sovereignty leaders of pakistani military establishment viewed nato s attacks on army checkposts as intentional pre planned and premeditated slamming nato s version of events as lame excuses pakistan rejected claims of any firing having emanated from its side as a prelude to encounter saying that soldiers who were manning post were asleep and resting when nato launched assault at night director general of ispr major general athar abbas challenged nato to present proof if they claim that firing was started from pakistani side no fire was opened from our side he asserted that at this point nato and afghanistan are trying to wriggle out of situation by offering excuses where are their casualties meanwhile claim that airstrike was cleared by pakistani authorities was categorically denied by pakistan which claimed that attack continued for two hours even after pakistani officials alerted coalition forces to stop preliminary reports from pakistan army told of about 40 soldiers being present at two check posts most of whom were sleeping or resting when raid took place helicopters first attacked border post named volcano atop mountain peak this initial attack cut all communications to and from post and a pakistan air force air support could not be called in time to counter attack instead pakistani troops stationed at nearby post named boulder engaged nato helicopters with anti aircraft guns helicopters soon withdrew pakistani authorities tried to contact their nato counterparts in an effort to inform them of situation but pakistani request reportedly failed to reach attacking force helicopters returned a second time engaging boulder border post again a short while later communication with nato commanders was established and attack was called off all casualties were from initial attack on volcano border post later major general abbas expressed that it was beyond comprehension why nato forces returned to attack second time according to local officials there was no militant activity along afghan border region when nato conducted attack abbas spokesperson ispr said that coordinates of two border posts had been given to isaf he added that attack lasted for almost two hours and claimed that personnel on posts alerted ghq which in turn immediately informed isaf regional base in afghanistan to stop attack at roughly 12 30 am but they did not ghq in return gave permission to personnel on outposts to retaliate nato communicated at roughly 1 15 am that they had realised that they were attacking pakistan army and that their forces had been ordered to stop yet nato s aerial bombardment

chief of general staff lieutenant general arshad claimed that this was not an unintended incident on accounts of series of events he commented that nato was informed at time of attack but their helicopters remained on course of aggression pakistani military also said that nato forces returned a second time to attack post again when he was asked whether pakistan was satisfied with investigating team headed under us air force brigadier general he responded sharply by commenting that all incidents in past in relation to violation of pakistan s sovereignty did not come to an agreeable conclusion pakistan was invited to jointly investigate incident but pakistan refused to participate matthew rosenberg and eric schmitt pakistan refuses to help as u s sorts out a fatal attack new york times 2 december 2011 on 9 december major general ashfaq claimed that nato had been monitoring radio transmissions that night and knew they had hit volcano post pakistani military called strike unprovoked and indiscriminate government of pakistan launched a strong protest with u s and also immediately discontinued supply to nato troops located in afghanistan notably strike on saturday came one day after gen john allen commander of us led coalition in afghanistan visited pakistani army chief gen ashfaq parvez kayani in that meeting both commanders discussed border co ordination and other measures aimed at enhancing border control on both sides repercussions of incident closure of nato supply lines thumb nato supply lines through pakistan pakistan immediately closed all nato supplies to afghanistan in aftermath of attack leaving blockaded supply trucks vulnerable to attacks nato trucks had been using supply routes in khyber agency through khyber pass at and balochistan near to supply us and international forces fighting in afghanistan us policy makers tried to find alternative routes through russia kazakhstan uzbekistan and tajikistan termed as northern distribution network but these are longer and less effective than routes through pakistan huge costs are associated with central asian supply lines and nato s supply line through russia is already under a looming danger of closure due to friction over missile defence plans being a landlocked country afghanistan is highly dependent on pakistan for its imports according to figures released by pentagon in january 2012 united states was paying six times more to send supplies to troops in afghanistan via alternative supply routes following closure of pakistani routes figures placed new us costs at 104 million per month roughly 87 million costlier per month than when cargo was transported via pakistan high costs were associated with routes being lengthier continued strife in late march 2012 a us military official stated that united states would have to use routes through northern distribution network for supplies to afghanistan if pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines however he conceded of these routes and noted that negotiations with pakistan regarding possibility of opening of supply routes were ongoing after reviewing united states pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair bilateral relations pakistani parliament turned decision of reopening nato supply lines over to government in april 2012 due to an upcoming general election in pakistan with widespread anti american sentiments in country pakistani government was reluctant to reopen lines and postponed its decision until united states responded positively to pakistani demands outlined in parliamentary recommendations such as a us apology for november 2011 incident bringing of those involved in strike to justice and a stop to us drone airstrikes talks between pakistan and united states failed in april 2012 after pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from united states for november 2011 incident white house refused to apologise after taliban attacks in kabul and other cities in afghanistan on 15 april 2012 which according to us military and intelligence officials came from haqqani network an afghan group working from a base in north waziristan along afghanistan border in pakistan s tribal belt pakistani officials said they cannot open nato supply routes in afghanistan without a us apology later in may pakistan demanded united states to pay stiff fees as a condition to open up nato supply routes into afghanistan united states however could not pay required 5 000 per truck due to budgetary restraints according to us secretary of defense leon panetta considering financial challenges that we re facing that s not likely panetta said of pakistani demand of 5 000 for each truck carrying supplies across its territory for nato troops waging afghanistan war unnamed us officials said that us officials said they had hoped a meeting between pakistani president asif ali zardari and us president barack obama as well as sharing spotlight with president obama and other global leaders during 2012 nato chicago summit might provide an incentive for a deal on resuming supply shipments invitation was an inducement to get them back into international fold said a senior us official speaking anonymously because of sensitive issues but pakistanis couldn t get their own act together in time for summit main issue it seems is money united states and pakistan had nearly completed a deal to reopen crucial nato supply routes into afghanistan in june 2012 when defense secretary leon e panetta said us was reaching limits of our patience over islamabad s failure to root out afghan insurgents in its tribal areas in wake of panetta s comments deputy assistant secretary of defense peter lavoy was not allowed to meet with pakistani army chief general ashfaq parvez kayani and pentagon announced that it was bringing home a negotiating team that had worked in pakistani capital for nearly two months to end bitter impasse over supply routes a senior us official disputed notion that panetta s criticism of pakistan had set back talks sticking point for a long time has been apology issue official said supply lines reopening pakistan decided to reopen supply lines after us secretary of state apologised on 3 july 2012 for salala incident via a telephone call to pakistani foreign minister hina rabbani khar foreign minister khar and i acknowledged mistakes that resulted in loss of pakistani military lives clinton said in a statement we are sorry for losses suffered by pakistani military we are committed to working closely with pakistan and afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again us secretary of defence leon panetta said in a separate statement that us remains committed to improving our partnership with pakistan and to working closely together as our two nations confront common security challenges in region us general john r allen said in a statement that agreement is a demonstration of pakistan s desire to help secure a brighter future for both afghanistan and region at large and nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen welcomed announcement to reopen supply lines stating saying it highlighted important role pakistan has in supporting a stable future for afghanistan pakistani reactions to us apology were different we appreciate secretary clinton s statement and hope that bilateral ties can move to a better place from here i am confident that both countries can agree on many critical issues especially on bringing peace to region pakistan s ambassador to us sherry rehman said in a statement in general decision to reopen supply routes was met in pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that pakistani government had given up a much trumpeted increase in transit fees for nato trucks opposition politicians criticised move and demanded more of an explanation from pakistani government and military now government should let people know about terms and conditions for reopening nato supply lines what were demands said former foreign minister shah qureshi and enver baig an opposition politician belonging to pakistan muslim league nawaz complained about americans they did not apologize they said sorry some pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop convoys decision to reopen nato supplies is a big crime against country and we will not sit silently over this retired lt gen hamid gul a leader of defense council of pakistan a coalition of islamic parties that includes pro taliban clerics and other foes of nato routes and a former chief of inter services intelligence agency told pakistani cable channel express news we will come to roads and streets and protest against decision and will also try to stop supplies pakistani taliban announced that they will attack any nato supply trucks travelling along routes transporters who resume supplies will be considered a friend of u s and will face consequences a spokesman for militant group said al jazeera s kamal hyder said that both nato and pakistani forces had taken into account losses in past losses despite fact that they have become a problem are nowhere near levels that would cause alarm bells to ring correspondent said according to his analysis it would cause a problem if pakistani taliban attack bridges or decide to take these people head on in tribal areas connecting pakistan to southern afghan province of kandahar american officials said according to new york times that hillary clinton s increasingly cordial relationship with young pakistani foreign minister hina rabbani khar paid dividends in resolving dispute between both countries over salala incident a final agreement on wording of clinton s statement of her conversation with khar came after a week of marathon talks that included two trips to islamabad by general john r allen us commander in afghanistan and a quickly arranged weekend trip by thomas r nides deputy secretary of state for management and resources in recent weeks nides and pakistani finance minister abdul hafeez shaikh had spearheaded negotiations to reopen supply lines after weeks of behind scenes phone calls e mails and meetings between nides and abdul hafeez shaikh reached an agreement on terms for reopening of nato supply lines besides us apology both sides agreed to following after initially demanding as much as 5 000 for each truck pakistan dropped its insistence on a higher transit fee for each truck carrying nato s nonlethal supplies from pakistan into afghanistan and agreed to keep fee at current rate of 250 obama administration will ask congress to reimburse pakistan about 1 2 billion for costs incurred by 150 000 pakistani troops carrying out counterinsurgency operations along border with afghanistan with open we will look to pay past coalition support fund claims pentagon spokesman captain john kirby said using a pentagon acronym for supply routes united states military by coalition support funds pakistan for logistical military and other support provided to american military operations against militants but these payments have been suspended since pakistan shut off routes more precisely us halted paying bills from pakistan as tension rose between two countries pentagon will now consult with congress about paying bills prior to paying pakistan in full during their telephone call pakistani foreign minister hina rabbani khar made it clear to secretary of state clinton that no lethal equipment would transit into afghanistan through ground lines of communication i e ground supply lines except those meant for equipping afghan national security forces pakistan s defense committee of cabinet which approved deal said agreement was in country s best interest and a boon to afghanistan peace process allowing nato convoys to enter and exit pakistani territory would speed withdrawal of western forces pakistani government said in a statement and enable a smooth transition in afghanistan according to new york times agreement reflected a growing realisation by pakistani officials that they had overplayed their hand misjudged nato s resolve and ability to adapt to closing by using an alternative route through central asia and a recognition on both sides that impasse risked transforming an often rocky relationship into a permanently toxic one at a critically inopportune time despite resolving of salala incident there are frictions in both countries relations such as pakistan s opposition to us drone strikes on pakistan soil and washington s allegations that islamabad or even assists anti american militants deal ended a diplomatic deadlock that brought us relations with nuclear armed south asian nation to a near standstill and hindered counter terrorism operations against pakistan based militants because of supply lines closure united states has spent at least an additional 100 million a month because it was instead forced to move supplies by air rail or truck through russia and other countries north of afghanistan at much longer and more expensive routes closure of supply lines complicated american troop withdrawal from afghanistan cost united states more than 1 billion in extra shipping fees as a result of having to use alternative routes through central asia and also held up delivery of thousands of armoured vehicles and other equipment meant for fledgling afghan army and police slowing us efforts to build afghan forces that can stand up to taliban insurgency as foreign troops withdraw reopening of supply lines means that us will save hundreds of millions of dollars in run up to withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan and also that it would help us and nato to complete its withdrawal of troops from afghanistan at a much lower cost according to clinton despite reopening of critical supply routes from pakistan us military confronts a giant logistical challenge to wind down war in afghanistan because it must withdraw till end of 2014 nearly 90 000 troops and enormous depots of military equipment accumulated over a decade of war which includes 100 000 shipping containers stuffed with materiel and 50 000 wheeled vehicles above mentioned agreement between pakistan and united states was never an issue of money alone it was a matter of honor for army said ur rehman a pakistani defence correspondent for ary news a cable channel only word they were looking for was sorry it was a matter of pride a matter of honor a matter of ego if it had been about money it would have been done months ago said a us senior administration official knowledgeable about negotiations just like for us it was not just about supply routes according to bbc reason for long us refusal to apologise for salala incident was deep anger among americans about death of us soldiers in afghanistan from attacks by militant groups with alleged connections to pakistan s isi intelligence agency another reason for united states refusal to apologise was determination by american military investigators that pakistan was equally culpable in salala incident because pakistani soldiers stationed on a ridge overlooking border had fired first on us troops on afghan side of border pakistan has disputed that conclusion saying its forces did not fire first after first nato supply trucks crossed afghan border on 5 june 2012 pakistanis questioned nato supply line deal us has not apologized formally said nawaz sharif leader of main opposition party pakistan muslim league nawaz imran khan another major opposition figure went further saying that decision isn t only against national interest but can also stir unrest within ranks of armed forces he also criticised incumbent government as being a pawn of united states political and religious parties in undertook long march to islamabad to protest reopening of supply routes to afghanistan pakistan declared it will scan all nato containers passing through country to ensure they do not contain weapons and unapproved items will be seized 560 000 rupees 6 000 compensation per vehicle would be paid to truck owners by nato subcontractors for being out of work for seven months because of blockade according to rana mohammad aslam vice president of all pakistan goods carrier association shamsi airfield vacated on 26 november same day incident occurred pakistan ordered us to shut down and vacate shamsi airfield in southwestern balochistan province within a deadline of 15 days us forces and central intelligence agency had reportedly leased this airbase in 2001 for joint surveillance and launching drone attacks against militants in afghanistan and northwestern pakistan shamsi airbase was only military base in pakistan being used by united states and orders of its evacuation by us personnel symbolised an increasing rift and deterioration in relations between pakistan and united states in early december us military personnel occupying base along with all military equipment were shifted to bagram air base in afghanistan via us military aircraft on 10 december pakistani troops from frontier corps took full control of airfield as scheduled and by 11 december all remaining american staff were evacuated upon establishing control of airfield united states flag was removed from base and replaced with flag of pakistan impact of closure has been questioned as united states still has ability to conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in afghanistan and according to pakistani military base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones as well as for emergency landings and logistical support and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in april 2011 following incident pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future us drones intruding on its airspace and us suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising pakistan one report said that american drone attacks in pakistan dropped by as much as 50 due to salala attack as well as legal cases united states exit strategy among immediate repercussions of incident is that united states attempts to end war in afghanistan peacefully may now be in jeopardy some pakistani officials warned that attack could have huge implications for afghan endgame pakistan which is designated as a major non nato ally by united states and is seen as a key facilitator in bringing united states to negotiations table with afghan taliban and haqqani network had already halted those efforts according to an unnamed pakistani official close to military establishment while addressing a senate committee minister of foreign affairs hina rabbani khar warned that a repeat incident could end pakistan s support to united states in its war against militancy enough is enough government will not tolerate any incident of spilling even a single drop of any civilian or soldier s blood pakistan s role in war on terror must not be overlooked she added that sacrifices rendered by pakistan in war on terror are more than any other country but that does not mean we will compromise on our sovereignty pakistan s refusal to attend bonn conference in wake of nato attacks pakistani government refused to attend bonn conference scheduled on 5 december 2011 event in bonn germany is an important international conference on afghanistan international pressure over pakistan amounted as it refused to attend bonn conference secretary hillary clinton contacted pakistani prime minister but her plea was rejected because pakistani public opinion prohibited attendance conference was generally regarded as a disappointment partially because of pakistan s absence revision of western border rules of engagement pakistan also strengthened its air defences and surveillance along afghanistan border as a precaution against any future incursions dgmo major general nadeem was quoted saying we can expect more attacks from our supposed allies pakistan s army chief general ashfaq parvez kayani issued directions to commanders posted at border to fire without permission if any further aggression is received according to a pakistani security official pakistan had upgraded to a fully equipped air defence system on afghan border which has capability of detecting tracing and shooting down any aircraft these weapons notably include indigenous shoulder to air anza mk iii missiles and anti aircraft guns pakistan air force cancelled leave for all its air reconnaissance related personnel and deployed aircraft to start a round clock combat air patrol over afghan border to prevent all
