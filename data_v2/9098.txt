important trobairitz were alamanda de castelnau azalais de porcairagues maria de ventadorn tibors castelloza garsenda de proenca gormonda de monpeslier and comtessa de dia sources of information there are very few extant sources of information on individual trobairitz almost all information which exists about them come from their vidas biographies and contextual explanations of songs brief descriptions that were assembled in song collections called chansonniers vidas are notoriously unreliable since they frequently consisted of little more than romanticized extrapolations from poems of trobairitz themselves stephens names of about twenty female poets from 12th and 13th centuries survive with an estimated thirty two works attributed to trobairitz there are about 5 percent as many trobairitz as there are troubadours and number of surviving compositions by trobairitz amounts to around 1 percent of those we have by troubadours earliest surviving lyric written by a trobairitz is

and castelloza with three cansos and a fourth that is anonymous early chansonniers did not separate works of male troubadours from those of trobairitz it was only in later italian and catalan chansonniers that works of trobairitz were found in different sections than those of their male counterparts bruckner 1995 xxxiii position in medieval society throughout 13th century women of court were expected to be able to sing play instruments and write partis or a debate or dialogue in form of a poem cultivation of these womanly skills may have led to writings of trobairitz judith tick women in music 500 1500 grove music online trobairitz may also have arisen due power women held in southern france during 12th and 13th centuries women had far more control over land ownership and occitan society was far more accepting of women than were most other societies of time during crusades many men were away which left women with more administrative responsibility and thus power nevertheless this society was not feminist nor was fin amor which exalted women while at same time circumscribing many aspects of their lives and behavior there is difficulty in labeling trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals distinction between these two roles was complicated in medieval era since professionals were generally lower class and amateurs had as much time as professionals to devote to their craft were lower class professional composers far less respected than trobairitz both troubadours and trobairitz wrote of fin amors or courtly love women were generally subject of writings of troubadours however no other group of poets give women so exalted a definition within so tightly circumscribed a context of female suppression troubadours trouveres tension between suppression of women present in poetry of troubadours and similar themes in poetry of trobairitz is a major source of discussion for modern commentators trobairitz poetry pertaining to love tended to offer a less idealized conception of subject than poetry of their male counterparts with a more conversational and less flourished style of writing intended to more closely emulate a more grounded vision of relationships trobairitz wrote in canso strophic song and tenso debate poem genres bruckner matilda tomaryn et al 1995 songs of women troubadours xii besides cansos and trobairitz also wrote political poems lament d amor a love letter not in strophic form alba dawn songs and balada dance songs bruckner matilda tomaryn et al 1995 songs of women troubadours xxxix judging by what survives today trobairitz wrote no or songs unlike their troubadour counterparts furthermore in keeping with troubadour tradition trobairitz closely linked action of singing to action of loving comtessa de dia demonstrates this in her poem fin ioi me don alegranssa stating that fin ioi me dona alegranssa per qu eu chan plus translated as happiness brings me pure joy which makes me sing more cheerfully bruckner matilda tomaryn et al 1995 songs of women troubadours xv attribution number of works attributed to trobairitz is estimated at thirty two songs but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46 there are a number of reasons why an exact number is not known in courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of letters or a debate as in a tenso some of these may have been originally written by one poet however some were originally an actual exchange of epistles later gathered together in a manuscript dronke some of these were between men and some were between a man and a woman some modern editors attribute these solely to man who originated exchange and some attribute them to both man and woman involved there is a long history of attributing these solely to men even when all evidence points to contrary dronke peter women writers of middle ages cambridge university press new york 1984 since poetry was highly stylized it is difficult to determine when a poet speaking as a woman actually was a woman or a man speaking as a woman this adds to difficulty of attribution especially of anonymous writers there is some debate as to whether or not poems by trobairitz represent genuine feminine voices since they worked within highly circumscribed conventions of troubadours matilda bruckner suggests that trobairitz spoke in her own voice as channeled through voices of many others by manipulating strict constructs of troubadour lyric trobairitz were able to create their own fictions of female voice there is one notable instance where clear attribution is given to a woman bieiris de romans also given as beatritz but subject of poem is another woman na maria in poem na maria beatritz expresses her love for maria in traditional fin amors style both in terms of physical longing and courtly admiration this poem if not clearly marked as by a woman would be assumed to be by a man some controversy surrounds works of bieiris de romans as scholars have suggested that her canso expresses lesbian desire troubadour would typically speak to domna woman fact that lyrical dialogue takes place exclusively between one woman and another is an
