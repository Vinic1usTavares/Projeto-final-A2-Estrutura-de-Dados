max yellow line is a light rail service in portland oregon united states operated by trimet as part of max light rail system it connects north portland portland city center and portland state university line runs north south from portland expo center to rose quarter along a segment referred to as interstate max and northbound through downtown portland along portland transit mall on southwest 6th avenue it serves 17 stops between and psu south southwest 6th and college stations of these seven stops occupy median of north interstate avenue giving that segment its name yellow line runs for approximately 21 hours daily from monday to sunday with a minimum headway of 15 minutes during most of day it is fourth busiest service in max system carrying an average of 13 170 daily weekday riders in september 2018 following years of failed attempts to construct south north line between clackamas and vancouver washington portland business leaders and local residents persuaded trimet to build a light rail extension to north portland in 1999 line which began construction in 2001 opened on may 1 2004 four months ahead of schedule from 2004 to 2009 yellow line ran between expo center station in north portland and library and galleria stations in downtown portland serving alongside blue line and red line in 2009 it was rerouted to newly rebuilt portland transit mall and terminated at psu south stations since 2015 yellow line has operated as a northbound through service of orange line from psu south southwest 6th and college station sharing its transit mall alignment with green line conversely most southbound yellow line trains which had served other half of mall on southwest 5th avenue from 2009 to 2015 through operate into orange line from union station northwest 5th glisan street station and terminate at southeast park avenue station in milwaukie history early proposals thumb upright left an aerial view of interstate 5 and interstate avenue upper right facing south shown in 1973 yellow line was originally conceived in 1988 as part of portland s central city and albina community plans these plans sought to extend light rail through north portland across columbia river and into vancouver washington via a potential route on either north interstate avenue interstate 5 or northeast martin luther king jr boulevard formerly northeast union avenue as members of u s senate committee on appropriations oregon senator mark hatfield and washington senator brock adams combined proposal with portland oregon city light rail plan for which committee appropriated 2 million in september 1989 preliminary alignment studies to clark county including an additional proposal for a line between vancouver mall and clackamas town center along interstate 205 commenced shortly after a route from hazel dell washington through downtown portland to clackamas town center was selected in october 1994 officially named south north line 63 percent of portland voters approved a 475 million bond issue in november to cover oregon s portion of project s estimated 2 8 billion cost meanwhile a 0 3 percent increase in sales and vehicle excise taxes was sought out to provide washington s 237 5 million share which clark county voters turned down on february 7 1995 amid fears that exclusion of clark county would result in ridership too low to justify a north portland segment trimet scaled back project and released a second plan to build line up to rose quarter though backed by state government light rail opponents forced a statewide vote which defeated proposal in november 1996 in an effort to regain support of north portland residents who had historically voted highly in favor of light rail trimet announced a third plan in february 1997 it proposed construction of a line from clackamas town center to lombard street in north portland portland city council selected a longer alignment in june accepted proposal crossed willamette river on steel bridge and recommended a new span at caruthers crossing it ran through portland transit mall and median of north interstate avenue terminating an additional mile beyond lombard street in kenton regional government metro approved project following month in august due to wording on original ballot passed in 1994 which described line extending into clark county trimet board elected to renew voter support for another 475 million bond measure votes were cast on new regional ballot measure on november 3 1998 it was narrowly defeated 52 percent to 48 percent with south north line effectively canceled light rail on portland transit mall and to clackamas town center would not be built until 2009 for green line much of proposal s southern half from caruthers crossing to milwaukie would also remain shelved until opening of orange line in 2015 revival and construction in 1999 north portland residents and portland business leaders urged trimet to revive south north line s northern portion but without clark county segment arguing that 81 percent of multnomah county voters had supported light rail trimet agreed and developed a proposal to build line along median of north interstate avenue between portland expo center and rose quarter meetings and polls conducted in june determined that residents supported project which organizers referred to as interstate max as long as it was less expensive did not displace residents and did not require any new taxes portland city council subsequently endorsed this proposal trimet projected cost of extension at 350 million equivalent to in dollars to build it without need for a significant new source of local funding city created an urban renewal district surrounding proposed route this directed 30 million in tax increment funds to project meanwhile 175 million airport max and central city streetcar projects which built red line and portland streetcar s ns line respectively were locally funded and did not require substantial federal assistance they were declared part of interstate max project which granted eligibility for 257 5 million in matching federal funds approved in september 2000 trimet and metro contributed 38 5 million and 24 million respectively to remaining balance sourced from their own general transportation funds thumb right long viaduct north of argyle street that was built for yellow line shown in 2004 construction of interstate max began in february 2001 with a ceremony held near rose quarter initial work on line s junction with eastside max located near east end of steel bridge required a sixteen day closure of operating segment between rose quarter transit center and during which riders were shuttled between two stations in april trimet contracted stacy and witbeck to lay tracks between rose quarter and kenton and to build a new vehicular overpass in lower albina section between kenton and expo center which included construction of a dual track bridge was awarded to f e ward constructors following month rapid pace of construction which was credited to improvements in track laying and street reconstruction technology learned from previous max projects hit a halfway point in april 2002 this was marked by a concrete pouring ceremony at line s intersection with portland boulevard road and sidewalk improvements were completed following november six months ahead of schedule in august 2003 with construction nearly 80 percent complete officials announced line s targeted opening for following spring months earlier than previously planned september commencement line testing began in february 2004 and continued up to extension s inauguration opening and realignment interstate max extension and yellow line service latter officially designated in 2000 opened on may 1 2004 project was four months ahead of schedule and 25 million under budget more than 20 000 people attended opening day celebrations and trimet offered free rides for two days presence of line spurred redevelopment along interstate avenue corridor previously hampered by construction of interstate 5 this included new investments from fred meyer and new seasons market new line replaced trimet bus route 5 interstate from opening day to 2009 yellow line followed first avenue and morrison and yamhill streets upon entry into downtown portland terminating at library and galleria stations and turning around at 11th avenue tracks it served this segment along with blue and red lines on august 30 2009 line was rerouted to use light rail tracks added to newly rebuilt portland transit mall with psu south stations as its southern termini following completion of portland milwaukie light rail project which extended max service to milwaukie yellow line became partially interlined with new orange line trimet claimed separating lines would allow it to better control service frequencies from north portland and milwaukie to downtown portland as it expected higher ridership along orange line it also anticipated few riders from these communities traveling beyond city center most orange line trains subsequently took over operation of southbound segment of transit mall on southwest 5th avenue in september 2015 proposed extension to clark county washington thumb right a vancouver line streetcar seen crossing interstate bridge in 1917 passenger rail services once operated between portland and vancouver washington first which commenced service in april 1888 was a steam dummy line owned and operated by portland and vancouver railway company named vancouver line it ran from corner of first and washington streets up to hayden island requiring vancouver bound passengers to transfer to a ferry to continue across columbia river it was electrified in 1892 after it was purchased by portland consolidated street railway first interstate bridge built in 1917 finally extended line across river replacing ferry service streetcar remained operational as part of portland railway light and power company until its closure in september 1940 several attempts have since been made to restore service to clark county washington planners first considered idea in 1974 when trimet proposed a light rail line at same time a governor s task force was studying options for allocating federal assistance funds diverted from canceled mount hood freeway project then in 1984 prior to south north line proposal a bi state advisory committee revisited concept envisioning 8 000 commuters from clark county by year 2000 both proposals were shelved due to feasibility issues and a lack of funding following south north line s initial defeat planning for a separate north portland to vancouver segment continued new studies were conducted to evaluate feasibility of adding light rail onto a third bridge spanning columbia river which had been shelved in late 1980s in addition to a light rail only bridge and a tunnel an environmental study released in february 1998 for south north line s third iteration included an option for a segment to clark college through a low bridge with a lift span a decision was made to reserve it for a later phase in 2004 states of oregon and washington embarked on efforts to replace aging interstate bridge citing worsening congestion columbia river crossing project which began in 2008 would have replaced bridge and extended yellow line north from expo center through hayden island and across columbia river to downtown vancouver and clark college projected to cost upwards to 3 5 billion equivalent to in dollars extension would have added seven new stations along of new track in june 2013 three months after oregon legislature authorized 450 million in state funding washington state senate declined to fund its own share opponents cited inclusion of light rail as a common reason for rejecting proposal project was terminated in march 2014 a light rail extension into vancouver remains part of metro s 2018 regional transportation plan for 2040 plan assumes a cost of 4 1 billion for entire project of which 3 1 billion would be used to replace interstate bridge 80 million to build a second bridge connecting hayden island to portland expo center and 850 million for remainder of extension southwest washington regional transportation council also includes light rail corridor in their own 2040 plan route interstate max extension is long yellow line s northern terminus is expo center station situated on east end of portland metropolitan exposition center parking lot from there it heads south adjacent to north expo
