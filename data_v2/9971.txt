operation graffham was a military deception employed by allies during second world war it formed part of operation bodyguard a broad strategic deception designed to disguise imminent allied invasion of normandy graffham provided political support to visual and wireless deception of operation fortitude north these operations together created a fictional threat to norway during summer of 1944 planning for operation began in february 1944 in contrast to other aspects of bodyguard graffham was planned and executed by british with no american involvement graffham s aim was to convince german intelligence that allies were actively building political ties with sweden in preparation for an upcoming invasion of norway it involved meetings between several british and swedish officials as well as purchase of norwegian securities and use of double agents to spread rumours during war sweden maintained a neutral stance and it was hoped that if government were convinced of an imminent allied invasion of norway this would filter through to german intelligence impact of graffham was minimal swedish government agreed to few of concessions requested during meetings and few high level officials were convinced that allies would invade norway overall influence of graffham and fortitude north on german strategy in scandinavia is disputed background operation graffham formed part of operation bodyguard a broad strategic military deception intended to confuse axis high command as to allied intentions during lead up to normandy landings one of key elements of bodyguard was operation fortitude north which promoted a fictional threat against norway via wireless traffic and visual deception fortitude north played on german and particularly adolf hitler s belief that norway was a key objective for allies although they had earlier considered and rejected option allies had previously employed several deceptions against region for example operation hardboiled in 1942 and operation cockade in 1943 as a result john bevan head of london controlling section lcs and charged with overall organisation of bodyguard was concerned that visual wireless deception would not be enough to create a believable threat bevan suggested a political deception with aim of convincing swedish government that allies intended to invade norway during war sweden maintained a neutral position and had relations with both axis and allied nations it was therefore assumed that if sweden believed in an imminent threat to norway this would be passed on to german intelligence graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure allies were placing on sweden to end their neutral stance one example being requests to end export of ball bearings an important component in military hardware to germany by increasing this pressure with additional false requests bevan hoped to further convince germans that sweden was preparing to join allied nations planning on 3 february 1944 lcs proposed a plan to induce enemy to believe that we are enlisting help of sweden in connection with british and russian contemplated operations against northern norway in spring of this year department received approval to move forward with graffham on 10 february 1944 it would be an entirely british operation with no american involvement in contrast to other bodyguard components based on recommendations from chiefs of staff lcs outlined seven requests to present to swedish government access to swedish airspace for passage of allied aircraft including permission for emergency landings access to repair facilities at swedish airfields for up to 48 hours permission for reconnaissance flights within swedish airspace collaboration between british and swedish transport experts to organise transport of equipment across sweden following german withdrawal permission for colonel h v thornton former military attache to sweden to meet swedish officials agreement to purchase of norwegian securities by british government false wireless traffic between two countries and option for norwegian exiles to move from britain to sweden after some discussion it was decided that requests to land at swedish airfields and those related to norwegian exiles would be dropped lcs devised a plan to present requests in stages rather than all at once various envoys would build relations with swedish government and present proposals over a period of time operation first stage of graffham began in march and april 1944 sir victor mallet british minister to sweden was recalled to london for a briefing on operation on 25 march wulf schmidt a double agent with code name tate transmitted a message to his handlers explaining that mallet was in country to receive instructions and would be returning to sweden for important negotiations mallet traveled to stockholm on 4 april where he met with erik boheman swedish state secretary for foreign affairs during meeting he presented proposals for british reconnaissance flights and for transport collaboration swedish government rejected former but accepted latter however privately boheman indicated that sweden s air force would not pursue allied planes in their airspace and also that limitations of transport collaboration meant it would have little benefit for british this was not an encouraging start for operation but despite this lcs decided to continue with deception colonel thornton s trip was approved and he travelled to stockholm toward end of april thornton spent two weeks in sweden meeting with head of royal swedish air force general bengt nordenskiold conferences were treated with a high degree of secrecy in hope this would emphasise their importance it had required effect thornton s conversations were recorded by a pro german chief of police and forwarded to germany despite siding with allies nordenskiold communicated very little sensitive information to thornton nordenskiold was convinced that allies intended to invade norway but he kept this conviction to himself contrary to allied hopes thornton returned to england on 30 april in tandem with these approaches british government began purchasing norwegian securities operation was replaced by operation royal flush in june 1944 an expanded political deception also targeting spain and turkey impact overall operation appeared to meet few of its initial aims political approach did lead to an increased discussion amongst lower levels of swedish officialdom as to possibility of an invasion in norway however it failed to convince higher levels of government with exception of nordenskiold who did not communicate his beliefs to anyone even purchase of norwegian securities went unnoticed overriding belief within swedish government was that any invasion of norway would be diversionary and that european mainland would always be main target of allies graffham was envisioned as a way to bolster aims of fortitude north and overall this aspect of plan was successful german documents captured after war showed that although they did not believe norway to be main invasion target fortitude north units were considered capable of a diversionary attack as a result of deceptions german forces in scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce france extent to which both graffham and fortitude north influenced german strategy in scandinavia is disputed with some historians arguing that very little of either deception reached enemy while others argue that existence of fictional units in scotland helped confirm german fears of a diversionary attack in region references bibliography category world war ii deception operations
