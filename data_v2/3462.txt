pavo is a constellation in southern sky whose name is latin for peacock pavo first appeared on a 35 cm 14 in diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in amsterdam by plancius and jodocus hondius and was depicted in johann bayer s star atlas uranometria of 1603 and was likely conceived by petrus plancius from observations of pieter dirkszoon keyser and frederick de houtman french explorer and astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille gave its stars bayer designations in 1756 constellations pavo grus phoenix and tucana are collectively known as southern birds constellation s brightest member alpha pavonis is also known as peacock and appears as a 1 91 magnitude blue white star but is actually a spectroscopic binary delta pavonis is a nearby sun like star some 19 9 light years distant six of star systems in pavo have been found to host planets including hd 181433 with a super earth and hd 172555 with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in past few thousand years constellation contains ngc 6752 third brightest globular cluster in sky and spiral galaxy ngc 6744 which closely resembles milky way but is twice as large pavo displays an annual meteor shower known as delta pavonids whose radiant is near star d pav history and mythology history of modern constellation thumb left constellations pavo and indus featured in chart of southern celestial hemisphere by johann

constellations established by petrus plancius from observations of southern sky by explorers pieter dirkszoon keyser and frederick de houtman who had sailed on first dutch trading expedition known as eerste schipvaart to east indies it first appeared on a 35 cm 14 in diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in amsterdam by plancius with jodocus hondius first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in german cartographer johann bayer s uranometria of 1603 de houtman included it in his southern star catalogue same year under dutch name de peacock pavo and nearby constellations phoenix grus and tucana are collectively called southern birds peacock in greek mythology according to mark chartrand former executive director of national space institute plancius may not have been first to designate this group of stars as a peacock in greek myth stars that are now peacock were argos or argus builder of ship argo he was changed by goddess juno into a peacock and placed in sky

changed io into a heifer to deceive his wife and sister hera and couple with her hera saw through zeus s scheme and asked for heifer as a gift zeus unable to refuse such a reasonable request reluctantly gave heifer to hera who promptly banished io and arranged for argus panoptes a creature with one hundred eyes to guard now pregnant io from zeus meanwhile zeus entreated hermes to save io hermes used music to lull argus panoptes to sleep then slew him hera adorned tail of a peacock her favorite bird with argus s eyes in his honor io greek mythology com accessed 11 19 2013 as recounted in ovid s metamorphoses death of argus panoptes also contains an explicit celestial reference argus lay dead so many eyes so bright quenched and all hundred shrouded in one night hera retrieved those eyes to set in place among feathers of her bird peacock pavo and filled his tail with starry jewels ovid metamorphoses 1 720 it is uncertain whether dutch astronomers had greek mythos in mind when creating pavo but in keeping with other constellations introduced by plancius through keyser and de peacock in new constellation likely referred to green peacock which explorers would have encountered in east indies rather than blue peacock known to ancient greeks equivalents in other cultures wardaman people of northern territory in australia saw stars of pavo and neighbouring constellation ara as flying foxes characteristics pavo is bordered by telescopium to north apus and ara to west octans to south and indus to east and northeast covering 378 square degrees it ranks 44th of 88 modern constellations in size and covers 0 916 of night sky three letter abbreviation for constellation as adopted by international astronomical union in 1922 is pav official constellation boundaries as set by eugene delporte in 1930 are defined by a polygon of 10 segments in equatorial coordinate system right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while declination coordinates are between 56 59deg and 74 as one of deep southern constellations it remains below horizon at latitudes north of 30th parallel in northern hemisphere and is circumpolar at latitudes south of 50th parallel in southern hemisphere features stars thumb upright left constellation pavo as it can be seen by naked eye although he depicted pavo on his chart bayer did not assign its stars bayer designations french explorer and astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille labelled them alpha to omega in 1756 but omitted psi and xi and labelled two pairs of stars close together mu and phi pavonis in 1879 american astronomer benjamin gould designated a star xi pavonis as he felt its brightness warranted a name but dropped chi pavonis due to its faintness lying near constellation s northern border with telescopium is alpha pavonis brightest star in pavo its proper name peacock is an english translation of constellation s name it was assigned by british her majesty s nautical almanac office in late 1930s royal air force insisted that all bright stars must have names star hitherto having lacked a proper name alpha has an apparent or visual magnitude of 1 91 and spectral type it is a spectroscopic binary system one estimate placing distance between pair of stars as 0 21 astronomical units au or half distance between mercury and sun two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours star system is located around 180 light years away from earth with an apparent magnitude of 3 43 beta pavonis is second brightest star in constellation a white giant of spectral class it is an aging star that has used up hydrogen fuel at its core and has expanded and cooled after moving off main sequence it lies 135 light years away from solar system lying a few degrees west of beta is delta pavonis a nearby sun like but more evolved star this is a yellow subgiant of spectral type and apparent magnitude 3 56 that is only 19 9 light years distant from earth east of beta and at constellation s eastern border with indus is gamma pavonis a fainter solar type star 30 light years from earth with a magnitude of 4 22 and stellar class other nearby stars in pavo are much fainter scr 1845 6357 nearest star in pavo is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17 4 consisting of a red dwarf and brown dwarf companion lying around 12 6 light years distant while gliese 693 is a red dwarf of magnitude 10 78 lying 19 light years away pavo contains several variable stars of note lambda pavonis is a bright irregular variable ranging between magnitudes 3 4 and 4 4 this

has a magnitude of 4 38 ar pavonis is a faint but well studied eclipsing binary composed of a red giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 light years from earth it has some features of a cataclysmic variable smaller component most likely having an accretion disc visual magnitude ranges from 7 4 to 13 6 over 605 days solar twin in november 2018 8th magnitude star hd became second star identified to be a solar sibling this one being particularly sun like same spectra g2 virtually same mass as well with a twin spectra revealing identical did astronomers just find sun s sister bob p king november 24 2018 first star identified as a solar sibling in may 2014 hd within hercules is an f type main sequence star somewhat more powerful than sun with a mass 15 greater planetary systems and debris disks six stars with planetary systems have been found three planets have been discovered in system of orange star hd 181433 an inner super earth with an orbital period of 9 4 days and two outer gas giants with periods of 2 6 and 6 years respectively hd and hd are yellow g class sun like stars while hd is an f class main sequence star slightly larger and hotter than sun all three are accompanied by a gas giant companion hd 172555 is a young white a type main sequence star two planets of which appear to have had a major collision in past few thousand years spectrographic evidence of large amounts of silicon dioxide gas indicates smaller of two which had been at least size of earth s moon was destroyed and larger which was at least size of mercury was severely damaged evidence of collision was detected by nasa s spitzer space telescope in south of constellation epsilon pavonis is a 3 95 magnitude white main sequence star of spectral type located around 105 light years distant from earth it appears to be surrounded by a narrow ring of dust at a distance of 107 au deep sky objects thumb globular cluster ngc 6752 contains an estimated 100 000 stars deep sky objects in pavo include ngc 6752 third brightest globular cluster in sky after 47 tucanae and omega centauri an estimated 100 light years across it is thought to contain 100 000 stars barely visible behind cluster is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy known as i lying three degrees to south is ngc 6744 a spiral galaxy around 30 million light years away from earth that resembles milky way but is twice its
