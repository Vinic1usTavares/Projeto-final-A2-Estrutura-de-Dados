searches have failed to discover hoard location castle is built on beeston crag which is in southerly part of mid cheshire ridge a chain of low sandstone hills that stretches from river mersey down to central region of cheshire plain low lying area between southerly and northern ranges of ridge is known as beeston gap it was formed by a meltwater channel at end of ice age crag just like neighbouring peckforton hills is part of a thicker sequence known as new red sandstone it was formed from easterly dipping layers of triassic sandstone lower slopes are formed from wilmslow sandstone formation while upper strata are part of sandstone formation which is around 245 million years old hillock is capped by a small outcrop of sandstones assigned to siltstone formation and formerly known as keuper waterstones both types of sandstones were once quarried at multiple sites within castle grounds along eastern margin of hill is peckforton fault a major north south aligned geological fault

pits dating from 4th millennium bc indicate site of beeston castle was inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during neolithic period archaeologists have discovered neolithic flint arrow heads on crag as well as remains of a bronze age community and of an iron age hill fort rampart associated with bronze age activity on crag has been dated to around 1270 830 bc seven circular buildings were identified as being either late bronze age or early iron age in origin it may have been a specialist metalworking site history construction beeston was built for ranulf de blondeville 6th earl of chester in early 13th century siting of castle s outer bailey walls was chosen to take advantage of fortifications remaining from earlier iron age rampart in medieval documents castle is described as castellum de castle on rock it is one of three major castles built by ranulph in 1220s shortly after his return from fifth crusade others are bolingbroke in lincolnshire and chartley staffordshire both of which share similar architectural features with beeston in particular design of towers thumb right ruins of bolingbroke castle thumb right ruins of chartley castle thumb right engraving of 1727 by buck brothers showing beeston castle from south unlike many other castles of period beeston does not have a keep as its last line of defence instead natural features of land together with massive walls strong gatehouses and carefully positioned towers made baileys themselves stronghold defences consisted of two parts firstly a rectangular castle on summit of hill with a sheer drop on three sides and a defensive ditch up to deep in places cut into rock on fourth side secondly an outer bailey was built on lower slopes with a massive gatehouse protected by a wide and deep ditch outer bailey was roughly rectangular with thick walls faced in sandstone and infilled with rubble walls parts of which still remain contain a number of d shaped towers an innovation in english castles at that time towers allowed defenders to shoot across walls as well as forwards and their open backed design meant that they would not offer cover to any attackers who gained access to outer bailey inner bailey was situated on rocky summit at western end of crag to provide castle s inhabitants with a supply of fresh water two wells were dug into rock one of them at deep one of deepest castle wells in england royal castle thumb right beeston castle is built on a rocky summit 350 feet 110 m above cheshire plain although most of defences were in place by time of ranulph s death in 1232 there were no living quarters and neither were there on death of ranulph s successor john in 1237 john died without a male heir allowing king henry iii to take over earldom of cheshire henry enlarged beeston castle during his wars with wales and used it as a prison for his welsh captives no attempt was made to equip castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within outer bailey in 1254 henry gave beeston together with other lands in cheshire to his son prince edward he also gave title earl of chester to prince a title that has been conferred on heir to throne of england ever since edward succeeded henry as king of england in 1272 and completed conquest of wales in middle of 14th century there are references to men of cheshire who were made constables of royal castle constable would probably have lived in or near gatehouse habitation was described in an account of castle in 1593 by sampson which describes a goodly strong gatehouse and strong wall with other buildings which when they flourished were a convenient habitation for any great personage beeston was kept in good repair and improved during edward s reign and throughout 14th century however by 16th century castle was considered to be of no further use to english crown and in 1602 it was sold to sir hugh beeston c 1547 1626 of beeston hall there have been persistent rumours of a treasure hidden by richard ii somewhere in castle grounds richard is supposed to have hidden part of his personal wealth at beeston on his journey to chester in 1399 before boarding a ship to ireland to suppress a rebellion there on his return richard was deposed by henry duke of lancaster future henry iv and his treasure is said to have remained undiscovered many searches have been carried out most of them focusing on deep well in inner bailey but nothing has ever been found rumour of hidden treasure may not be well founded as henry iv is recorded as having recovered richard s gold and jewellery from its various hiding places civil war during english civil war many neglected castles were pressed into service beeston was seized on 20 february 1643 by parliamentary forces commanded by sir william brereton walls were repaired and motte was cleaned out during 1643 part of royal army of ireland landed at chester on 13 december 1643 captain thomas sandford and eight soldiers from that army crept into beeston at night possibly aided by treachery and surprised castle governor captain thomas steele who was so shaken by event that he surrendered on promise that he would be allowed to march out of castle with honours steele was tried and shot for his failure to hold castle royalists survived a siege by parliamentary forces from november 1644 until november 1645 when their lack of food forced them to surrender castle was partially demolished in 1646 to prevent its further use as a stronghold later history left thumb 19th century gatehouse quarrying was carried out in castle grounds during 18th century and gatehouse leading into outer bailey was demolished to build a track for stones to be removed from site in 1840 castle was purchased by john tollemache 1st baron tollemache at that time largest landowner in cheshire as part of a larger estate in mid 19th century castle was site of an annual two day fete raising
