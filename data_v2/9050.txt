jaekelopterus is a genus of predatory eurypterid a group of extinct aquatic arthropods fossils of jaekelopterus have been discovered in deposits of early devonian age from pragian and emsian stages there are two known species type species j rhenaniae from brackish to fresh water strata in rhineland and j howelli from estuarine strata in wyoming generic name combines name of german paleontologist otto jaekel who described type species and greek word pteron pteron meaning wing based on isolated fossil remains of a large chelicera claw from klerf formation of germany j rhenaniae has been estimated to have reached a size of around 2 3 2 6 metres 7 5 8 5 ft making it largest arthropod ever discovered surpassing other large arthropods such as fellow eurypterids acutiramus and pterygotus and millipede arthropleura j howelli was much smaller reaching 80 centimetres 2 6 ft in length in overall appearance jaekelopterus is similar to other pterygotid eurypterids possessing a large expanded telson hindmost segment of body and enlarged pincers and forelimbs both species of jaekelopterus were first described as species of closely related pterygotus but were raised as a separate genus based on an observed difference in genital appendage though this feature has since proved to be a misidentification other features distinguishing genus from its relatives have been identified including a telson with a triangular shape and a different inclination of denticles of claws chelicerae and compound eyes of jaekelopterus indicate it was active and powerful with high visual acuity most likely an apex predator in ecosystems of early devonian euramerica although eurypterids such as jaekelopterus are often called sea scorpions strata in which jaekelopterus fossils have been found suggest that it lived in fresh water environments description thumb left alt image of how jaekelopterus would have appeared in life restoration of j rhenaniae jaekelopterus is largest known eurypterid and largest known arthropod to have ever existed this was determined based on a chelicera claw from emsian klerf formation of germany that measures long but is missing a quarter of its length suggesting that full chelicera would have been long if ratio of body length to chelicera length matches those of other giant pterygotids such as acutiramus and pterygotus where ratio between claw size and body length is relatively consistent organism that possessed chelicera would have measured between in length with chelicerae extended another metre would be added to this length this estimate exceeds maximum body size of all other known giant arthropods by almost half a metre even if extended chelicerae are not included jaekelopterus is similar to other pterygotid eurypterids in its overall morphology distinguished by its triangular telson hindmost segment of its body and inclined principal denticles on its cheliceral rami moving part of claws pterygotids a group of highly derived advanced eurypterids differ from other groups in several features especially in chelicerae and telson chelicerae of pterygotidae are enlarged and robust clearly adapted for active prey capture with chelae pincers more similar to claws of some modern crustaceans with well developed teeth on claws relative to chelicerae of other eurypterid groups another feature distinguishing group from other eurypterid groups is their flattened and expanded telsons likely used as rudders when swimming j howelli known from over 30 specimens has an almost identical pattern of on chelicerae as j rhenaniae and also preserves a flattened posterior margin of telson which results in a triangular shape as in j rhenaniae its serrated telson margin and massive elongation of second intermediate denticle clearly distinguishes it from j rhenaniae furthermore type a genital appendage is not bifurcated at its end j howelli is much smaller than j rhenaniae reaching 80 centimetres 2 6 ft in length

history of research left thumb alt refer to caption illustration of holotype specimen of pterygotus rhenaniae a pretelson by otto jaekel 1914 jaekelopterus was originally described as a species of pterygotus p rhenaniae in 1914 by german palaeontologist otto jaekel based on an isolated fossil pretelson segment directly preceding telson he received that had been discovered in lower devonian deposits of rhineland in germany jaekel considered pretelson to be characteristic of pterygotus other discovered elements differing little from previously known species of that genus such as p buffaloensis and he estimated length of animal in life to be about 1 metre 1 5 metres if chelicerae are included 3 3 and 4 9 ft based on more comprehensive material including genital appendages chelicerae and fragments of metastoma a large plate that is part of abdomen and telson discovered by german palaeontologist walter r gross near germany norwegian palaeontologist leif stormer provided a more comprehensive and detailed description of species in 1936 stormer interpreted genital appendages as being segmented distinct from other species of pterygotus british palaeontologist charles d waterston erected genus jaekelopterus in 1964 to accommodate pterygotus rhenaniae which he considered sufficiently distinct from other species of pterygotus to warrant its own genus primarily due to abdominal appendages of jaekelopterus being segmented as opposed to those of pterygotus waterston diagnosed jaekelopterus as a pterygotid with segmented genital appendages a trapezoid prosoma narrow and long chelicerae with terminal teeth almost at right angles to rami and primary teeth slightly angled anteriorly and with a telson with an expanded terminal spine and dorsal keel generic name honours otto jaekel greek word pteron pteron meaning wing is a common epithet in eurypterid names in 1974 stormer erected a new family to house genus jaekelopteridae due to supposed considerable differences between genital appendage of jaekelopterus and other pterygotids this diverging feature has since been proven to simply represent a misinterpretation by stormer in 1936 genital appendage of jaekelopterus in fact being unsegmented like that of pterygotus as such family jaekelopteridae has subsequently been rejected and treated as synonymous with family pterygotidae another species of pterygotus p howelli was named by american palaeontologist erik kjellesvig waering and stormer in 1952 based on a fossil telson and tergite dorsal part of a body segment from lower devonian deposits of beartooth butte formation in wyoming species name howelli honours dr benjamin howell of princeton university who loaned fossil specimens examined in description to kjellesvig waering and stormer

superfamily pterygotioidea jaekelopterus is similar to pterygotus virtually only distinct in features of its genital appendage and potentially its telson close similarities between two genera have prompted some researchers to question if pterygotids are on generic level based on some similarities in genital appendage american palaeontologists james c lamsdell and david a legg suggested in 2010 that jaekelopterus pterygotus and even acutiramus could be synonyms of each other lamsdell james c legg david a 2010 11 an isolated pterygotid ramus eurypterida from devonian beartooth butte formation wyoming journal of paleontology 84 6 1206 1208 though differences have been noted in chelicerae these structures were questioned as basis of generic distinctions in eurypterids by charles d waterston in 1964 since their morphology is dependent on lifestyle and varies throughout ontogeny development of organism following its birth whilst telson morphology can be used to distinguish genera in eurypterids lamsdell and legg noted that triangular telson of jaekelopterus might still fall within morphological range of paddle shaped telsons present in pterygotus and acutiramus genital appendages can vary even within genera for instance genital appendage of acutiramus changes from species to species being spoon shaped in earlier species and then becoming bilobed and eventually beginning to look similar to appendage of jaekelopterus lamsdell and legg concluded that an inclusive phylogenetic analysis with multiple species of acutiramus pterygotus and jaekelopterus is required to resolve whether genera are synonyms of each other cladogram below is based on nine best known pterygotid species and two outgroup taxa slimonia acuminata and hughmilleria socialis jaekelopterus had previously been classified as a basal sister taxon to rest of pterygotidae since its description as a separate genus by waterston in 1964 due to its supposedly segmented genital appendages fused and undivided in other pterygotids but restudy of specimens in question revealed that genital appendage of jaekelopterus also was undivided material examined and phylogenetic analysis conducted by american palaeontologist simon j braddy german palaeontologist markus poschmann and o erik tetlie in 2007 revealed that jaekelopterus was not a basal pterygotid but one of most derived taxa in group cladogram also contains maximum sizes reached by species in question which was suggested to possibly have been an evolutionary trait of group per cope s rule phyletic gigantism by braddy poschmann and tetlie palaeobiology gigantism thumb alt size diagram of two species of jaekelopterus size of j rhenaniae larger and j howelli smaller compared to a human pterygotid eurypterids include many of largest known eurypterids such as pterygotus and acutiramus several factors have been suggested that might have contributed to unprecedented large size of jaekelopterus its relatives and other large paleozoic invertebrates such as predation courtship behaviour competition and environmental resources factors such as respiration energy costs of moulting locomotion and actual properties of exoskeleton restrict size of arthropods other than robust and heavily claws most of preserved large body segments of pterygotids are thin and even tergites and sternites plates that form surfaces of abdominal segments are generally preserved as paper thin compressions suggesting that pterygotids were very lightweight in construction similar lightweight adaptations can be observed in other paleozoic giant arthropods such as giant millipede like arthropleura and it has been suggested to be vital for evolution of giant arthropod sizes kraus o c 2003 08 26 fossil giants and surviving dwarfs arthropleurida and diplopoda characters phylogenetic relationships and construction des in hamburg 40 a lightweight build decreases influence of factors that restrict body size despite being largest arthropods lightweight build of jaekelopterus and other giant pterygotid eurypterids meant they likely were not heaviest other giant eurypterids particularly deep bodied walking forms in hibbertopteridae such as almost 2 metre long hibbertopterus may have rivalled pterygotids and other giant arthropods in weight if not surpassed them american palaeontologist alexander kaiser and south african palaeontologist jaco klok suggested in 2008 that massive size estimates for jaekelopterus are exaggerated noting that size estimates assume that relative proportions between chelicerae and body length would stay same as animal matured denticles serrations of claws were observed as showing positive allometry being proportionally larger in larger specimens which kaiser and klok suggest could have occurred in chelicerae as a whole furthermore largest coxae limb segments found of same species measuring wide suggest a total maximum body length of only positive allometry has not been demonstrated in eurypterid chelicerae as a whole in any other eurypterid genus including in closest relatives of jaekelopterus there are also some undescribed specimens of j rhenaniae of similar proportions as large chelicera including another claw found in same strata as original find in opinion of braddy poschmann and tetlie who replied to kaiser and klok same year size estimates around remain most accurate estimates on maximum size of species yet ontogeny thumb alt illustrations of claws of jaekelopterus chelicerae of j howelli a is a juvenile free ramus b is an adult free ramus and c d are articulated and fixed free rami from adults left like all other arthropods eurypterids matured through a sequence of stages called instars consisting of periods of ecdysis moulting followed by rapid growth unlike many arthropods such as insects and crustaceans chelicerates group to which eurypterids like jaekelopterus belongs alongside other organisms such as horseshoe crabs sea spiders and arachnids are generally direct developers meaning that there are no extreme morphological changes after they have hatched extant hatch without full amount of adult opisthosomal appendages appendages attached to opisthosoma posterior segments of body but extant spiders are fully direct developers studies of fossil specimens of strobilopterus and jaekelopterus suggest that ontogeny of eurypterids broadly that of modern horseshoe crabs but that eurypterid like arachnids were true direct developers hatching with their full amount of and segments though several fossilised instars of jaekelopterus howelli are known fragmentary and incomplete status of specimens makes it difficult to study its ontogeny in detail despite this there are some noticeable changes occurring in chelicerae telson and metastoma four of j howelli specimens studied by lamsdell and selden 2013 preserve chelicerae in enough detail to allow for study of denticles two of these chelicerae were assumed to come from juveniles and two were assumed to be from adults morphology of chelicerae is similar across all ages with same arrangement and number of denticles but there were also some noticeable differences particularly principal denticles had grown in size relative to intermediate denticles being 1 5 times size of intermediate denticles in juveniles but up to 3 5 times size of intermediate denticles in adults furthermore terminal denticle was far larger and more robust in adult specimens than in juveniles perhaps most extreme of all second intermediate denticle is not different in size from other intermediate denticles in juveniles but it is massively elongated in adults where it is more than twice length of any principal denticle though such growth in denticles of pterygotids has been described in other genera massive elongation of second intermediate denticle through ontogeny is unique to jaekelopterus particularly to j howelli metastoma of jaekelopterus also altered its dimensions as animal matured in j rhenaniae relative width of metastoma decreased through ontogeny metastoma in j howelli is also broader in juveniles than in adults although length width ratios measured in juveniles and adults were not as disparate as assumed being 1 43 in juveniles and 1 46 in adults such a change in dimensions has been noted in other eurypterid genera as well such as and strobilopterus palaeoecology thumb alt fossil claws of jaekelopterus fossil chelicerae of j howelli thumb alt refer to caption opisthosomal segments of j howelli morphology and body construction of jaekelopterus and other eurypterids in pterygotidae suggests they were adapted to a completely aquatic lifestyle braddy poschmann and tetlie considered in a 2007 study that it was highly unlikely that an arthropod with size and build of jaekelopterus would be able to walk on land eurypterids such as jaekelopterus are often popularly referred to as sea scorpions but deposits from which fossils have been discovered suggest that it lived in non marine aquatic environments beartooth butte formation in wyoming where j howelli fossils have been discovered has been interpreted as a quiet shallow estuarine environment fossil sites yielding j rhenaniae in rhineland have also been interpreted as having been part of a shallow aquatic environment with brackish to fresh water cheliceral morphology and visual acuity of pterygotid eurypterids separates them into distinct ecological groups primary method for determining visual acuity in arthropods is by determining number of lenses in their compound eyes and interommatidial angle ioa which is angle between optical axes of adjacent lenses ioa is especially important as it can be used to distinguish different ecological roles in arthropods being low in modern active arthropod predators both jaekelopterus rhenaniae and pterygotus anglicus had high visual acuity as indicated by low ioa and many lenses in their compound eyes chelicerae of jaekelopterus are enlarged robust and have a curved free ramus and denticles of different lengths and sizes all adaptations that correspond to strong puncturing and grasping abilities in extant scorpions and crustaceans some puncture wounds on fossils of poraspid fish patula from devonian of utah were likely caused by jaekelopterus howelli latest research indicates that jaekelopterus was an active and visual predator fully grown jaekelopterus would have been apex predators in their environments and likely preyed upon smaller arthropods including resorting to cannibalism and early vertebrates further studies on compound eyes of fossilised specimens of j rhenaniae including a large specimen with right eye preserved from uppermost and a small and likely juvenile specimen confirmed high visual acuity of genus overall average ioa of jaekelopterus 0 87deg is comparable to that of modern predatory arthropods visual acuity of jaekelopterus increased with age smaller specimens having relatively worse eyesight this is consistent with other pterygotids such as acutiramus and has been interpreted as indicating that adult jaekelopterus lived in darker environments such as in deeper water trace fossil evidence of eurypterids also supports such a conclusion indicating that eurypterids migrated to nearshore environments to mate and spawn a powerful and active predator jaekelopterus was likely highly agile and possessed high manoeuvrability of swimming paddles and telsons of jaekelopterus and other pterygotids suggest that all members of group were capable of hovering forward locomotion and quick turns though they were not necessarily rapidly swimming animals they were likely able to give chase to prey in habitats such as lagoons and estuaries see also list of eurypterid genera timeline of
