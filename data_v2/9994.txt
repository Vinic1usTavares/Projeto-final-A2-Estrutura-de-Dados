yazdegerd ii also spelled yazdgerd ii and ii new persian was sixteenth sasanian king shah of iran he was successor and son of bahram v and reigned from 438 to 457 his reign was marked by wars against eastern roman empire in west and hephthalites in east as well as by his efforts and attempts to strengthen royal centralisation in bureaucracy by imposing zoroastrianism on non zoroastrians within country namely christians his death led to a dynastic struggle between his two sons hormizd iii and peroz i for throne with latter emerging victorious yazdegerd ii was first sasanian ruler to assume title of kay which evidently associates him and dynasty to mythical kayanian dynasty commemorated in avesta etymology name of yazdegerd is a combination of old iranian divine being and karta made and thus stands for god made comparable to iranian and greek theoktistos name of yazdegerd is known in other languages as pahlavi new persian yazd e gerd syriac yazdegerd and armenian talmudic and arabic greek wars thumb map of roman iranian frontier 280px in 438 shah bahram v died and was succeeded by yazdegerd ii his western neighbours romans had since their peace treaty with iran in 387 agreed that both empires were obligated to cooperate in defense of caucasus against nomadic attacks romans helped in defense of caucasus by paying iranians roughly 500 lbs 226 kg of gold at irregular intervals while romans saw this payment as political subsidies iranians saw it as tribute which proved that rome was deputy of iran roman emperor theodosius ii s unwillingness to continue payment made yazdegerd ii declare war against romans which had ultimately little success for either side romans were invaded in their southern provinces by vandals causing theodosius ii to ask for peace and send his commander personally to yazdegerd ii s camp in ensuing negotiations in 440 both empires promised not to build any new fortifications in mesopotamia and that sasanian empire would get some payment in order to protect caucasus from incursions shortly after his peace treaty with romans yazdegerd ii moved towards important sasanian province of armenia and defeated armenians capturing nobles priests and troops and sending them to eastern sasanian provinces to protect borders from hephthalite attacks in 440s yazdegerd ii had a mudbrick defensive system constructed at derbent to fend off incursions from north in 453 yazdegerd ii moved his court to nishapur in khorasan to face threat from hephthalites and left his minister wuzurg mihr narseh in charge of sasanian empire he spent many years at war against hephthalites according to i provincial capitals of iran yazdegerd ii fortified city of and turned it into a strong border post against hephthalites it was sometime during this period that yazdegerd ii created province of eran khwarrah yazdegerd iran glory of yazdegerd which was in northern part of gurgan province after he managed to secure eastern portion of his empire against hephthalite incursions yazdegerd ii shifted his focus on armenia and caucasian albania to defend caucasus with romans against increasing hun threat religious policy thumb sasanian armenia ca 387 591 policies of yazdegerd ii have been matter of discussion arabic and persian sources emphasize his personal piety and hostility towards aristocracy whilst armenian and syriac sources describe him as a religious fanatic latter aspect is often stressed in modern historiography unsteadiness of empire was ever increasing under yazdegerd ii who had an uneasy relationship with aristocracy and was facing a great challenge by hephthalites in east at beginning of yazdegerd ii s reign he suffered several defeats at hands of hephthalites for which he put blame on christians due to much of his cavalry consisting of iberians and armenians persecutions of christians first started in 446 with christian nobles of inn mesopotamia he later shifted his focus towards christian aristocracy of iberia and armenia yazdegerd ii s persecutions of non zoroastrians generally seem to have been limited with aristocracy being primary target indeed zoroastrian aristocrats were also targeted by yazdegerd ii who had advantage of entry to court dismantled and castrated men in his field armies to generate eunuchs more dutiful to him than to their own families yazdegerd ii had originally continued his father s policies of appeasing magnates however after some time he turned away from them and started a policy of his own when magnates told him that his new policies had offended people he disagreed saying that it is not correct for you to presume that ways in which my father behaved towards you maintaining you close to him and bestowing upon you all that bounty are incumbent upon all kings that come after him each age has its own customs yazdegerd ii however was still fully aware of longstanding conflict between crown and nobility and priesthood which had culminated in murder of several sasanian monarchs thumb a 15th century armenian miniature depicting battle of avarayr yazdegerd ii s primary goal throughout his reign was thus to combat internal and external issues posing a danger to country by strengthening royal centralisation of bureaucracy which demanded cooperation of aristocracy justification behind this is later apparent when yazdegerd ii appointed adhur hormizd as new governor marzban of armenia in 451 putting an end to persecution of non zoroastrians in armenia and allowing religious freedom in country this would have been an unlikely decision to have been made by a religious fanatic indeed according to modern historian scott mcdonough zoroastrian faith was perhaps a test of personal loyalty for yazdegerd ii however yazdegerd ii s policy of integrating christian nobility into bureaucracy still had problematic consequences before appointment of adhur hormizd armenia had been plunged into a major rebellion cause of rebellion was attempt of mihr narseh to impose variant of zoroastrianism in armenia his intentions differed from those of yazdegerd ii as a result many of armenian nobles but not all rallied under vardan mamikonian supreme commander of armenia armenian rebels tried to appeal to romans for help but to no avail meanwhile another faction of armenians led by marzban allied themselves with sasanians on 2 june 451 sasanian and rebel forces clashed at avarayr with sasanians emerging victorious nine generals including vardan mamikonian were killed with a large number of armenian nobles and soldiers meeting same fate sasanians however had also suffered heavy losses due to resolute struggle by armenian rebels although yazdegerd ii put an end to persecutions in country afterwards tensions continued until 510 when a kinsman of vardan mamikonian mamikonian was appointed marzban by yazdegerd ii s grandson kavad i jews were also subject of persecution under yazdegerd ii he is said to have issued decrees prohibiting them from observing sabbath openly and ordered executions of several jewish leaders this resulted in jewish community of publicly retaliating by flaying two zoroastrian priests alive leading in turn to more persecutions against jews personality yazdegerd ii was an astute and well read ruler whose motto was question examine see let us choose and hold that which is best he is generally praised in persian sources and is described as a compassionate and benevolent ruler he is commended for abandoning his father s overindulgence in hunting feasting and having long audience sessions according to medieval historians ibn al balkhi and hamza al isfahani he was known as yazdegerd gentle yazdegerd e narm however favorable account of yazdegerd ii is due to his policy of persecuting non zoroastrians within empire which appeased iranian aristocracy and especially zoroastrian priesthood which sought to use sasanian empire to impose their authority over religious and cultural life of its people this is opposite of policy of his grandfather and namesake yazdegerd i known as sinner who is subject of hostility in persian sources due to his tolerant policy towards his non zoroastrian subjects and his refusal to comply with demands of aristocracy and priesthood coin mints and imperial ideology thumb 16th century shahnameh illustration of yazdegerd ii seated on his throne reign of yazdegerd ii marks start of a new inscription on sasanian coins mazda worshipping majesty kayanian which displays his fondness of legendary avestan dynasty kayanians this is due to a shift in political perspective of sasanian empire originally disposed towards west was now changed to east this shift which had already started under yazdegerd i and bahram v reached its zenith under yazdegerd ii it may have been triggered due to advent of hostile tribes on eastern front of iran war against hephthalites may have awakened mythical rivalry existing between iranian kayanian rulers and their turanian enemies which is demonstrated in younger avesta it may have thus been as a result of conflict between iran and its eastern enemies that resulted in adoption of title of kay used by very same iranian mythical kings in their war against turanians in east left thumb coin minted during reign of yazdegerd ii likewise it was most likely during this period that legendary and epic texts were collected by sasanians including legend of iranian hero king fereydun in middle persian who split up his kingdom among his three sons his eldest son salm receiving empire of west rome second eldest tur receiving empire of east turan and youngest iraj receiving heartland of empire iran accordingly influenced by texts about kayanians yazdegerd ii may believed to be heir of fereydun and iraj thus possibly deeming not only roman domains in west as belonging to iran but also eastern domains of hephthalites thus sasanians may have sought to symbolically assert their rights over those lands by assuming kayanian title of kay a new design also appeared on reverse of sasanian coins where traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants now imitates them in a more venerated manner this presumably further demonstrates yazdegerd ii s fealty to zoroastrianism provinces of and khuzestan provided most mints for yazdegerd ii in west whilst provinces of gurgan and marw provided most in east to support sasanians in their wars on two fronts death and succession yazdegerd ii died in 457 his eldest son hormizd iii ascended throne at ray his younger son peroz i with support of powerful mihranid magnate mihran fled to
