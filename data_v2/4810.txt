work is a watercolor painting on ivory thin enough for light to shine through and thus allow depicted breasts to glow this medium was common for american miniatures but in this case also served as a

goodridge completed her self portrait miniatures were increasing in complexity and heilbrunn timeline of art history describes beauty revealed as a play on eye miniatures which were then popular as tokens of affection in england and france but not common in us such miniatures allowed portraits of loved ones to be carried by their suitors without revealing sitters identities history goodridge was

dear good friend which was out of character she meanwhile painted him more than a dozen times and left her hometown of boston to visit him in washington d c at least twice once in 1828 after his first wife s death and again in 1841 42 when webster was separated from his second wife goodridge completed beauty revealed in 1828 likely from looking at herself in a mirror several works have been cited as possible inspirations including john vanderlyn s ariadne asleep on island of naxos and horatio greenough s sculpture venus victrix goodridge sent her portrait to webster when he was a new widower and based on its miniature format it was likely intended for his eyes alone american art critic john updike suggests that artist intended it to offer herself to webster he writes that bared breasts appear to say we are yours for taking in all our ivory loveliness with our tenderly stippled nipples quoted in ultimately however webster married another wealthier woman after webster s death beauty

delicate writing in antiques in 2012 randall l holton and charles a said that painting continued to present a self that evokes a frisson of erotic possibility packard wrote that beauty revealed served
