not sell well amps toured in 1995 and 1996 with sonic youth guided by voices and foo fighters in 1996 deal changed band s name back to breeders making pacer amps only album background kim deal s band breeders released last splash in august 1993 album was very successful and its release was followed by much touring breeders then took an extended break from activity one reason was that deal s sister kelley who was also in group was arrested on drug charges in november 1994 member josephine wiggs likewise took time away from band although wiggs and deal have different memories of circumstances surrounding this wiggs recalls offering to be involved if deal s next album was going to be a breeders record but having impression that deal wanted to do a solo release deal remembers wiggs declining to be part of any immediate breeders recording but offering to be on one after that regardless deal envisioned her next album as a solo effort and intended to play all instruments herself back at her home in dayton ohio she practiced drums and initially prepared six songs for recording around same time she produced some tracks for guided by voices at easley studios in memphis tennessee while there deal used a portion of studio time to record demos for some of her new songs as an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems deal recruited kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session kelley s involvement changed deal s mind about playing all instruments herself and she began to conceptualize album as a band project after easley recording session deal returned to dayton she asked breeders drummer jim macpherson to play drums in new project and dayton musicians luis lerma and nate farley to play bass and guitar respectively deal adopted a stage persona for herself named tammy ampersand and called band tammy and amps this later evolved into simply amps group began by performing at small shows and learned songs well to prepare for recording album at some point during recording sessions kelley s drug difficulties and rehabilitation prevented her from continuing as a member of band recording thumb john agnello was one of several engineers who helped to record pacer pacer was recorded at seven studios in total with different engineers each time track tipp city was used from original session at easley studios recorded in february 1995 and engineered by doug easley and davis mccain amps next session was with engineer steve albini at his chicago studio deal had previously worked with albini on pixies surfer rosa and breeders pod releases amps and albini recorded songs including further versions of tipp city which are unreleased and an earlier version of latter song had previously been released on breeders divine hammer single in october 1993 other recording sessions whose various engineers included bryce goggin and john agnello took place at studios in long island and woodstock new york as well as dayton los angeles and dublin ireland in a 1996 interview deal said that for pacer she focused on vocals usually i tend to spend more time with instruments last splash had quite a few instrumentals and quite a few songs where i might say five words on pacer songs are all vocal heavy vocal leads and if you take vocal away you don t have much of a song sound of album has been described as lo fi release pacer was released in late october 1995 it was promoted with a full page advertisement in nme in uk where it peaked at no 60 on uk albums chart and no 29 on american heatseekers album chart tipp city was released as album s single and included an alternate version of empty glasses as well as a cover of just like a briar single received some radio airplay in usa and reached no 61 on uk singles chart but pacer did not sell well reception critical appraisal of pacer has been mixed reviewing for allmusic stephen thomas erlewine describes album as exciting gut level rock roll rough guide to rock calls pacer satisfyingly lo fi in spin magazine reviewer joy press writes that album includes a half dozen gems but that its overall foggy sound and indecipherable lyrics prevent listener from fully embracing work village voice critic robert christgau considers album s songs to be definitely slight and uneven but praises vocals stating that speedy or dreamy kim deal sounds so sane so unpretentious so goddamn nice that you want to take her home and give her a shampoo in trouser press guide to 90s rock critic ira robbins writes that other than fine title track and a few others performances are forced and lackluster production varies between flat and colorless new rolling stone album guide similarly praises title song while dismissing rest of album as forgettable pacer is a favorite album of actor elijah wood who said i think pacer has everything it s kind of experimental there s a lot of vocal experimentation on record i love recording drums are very abrasive and raw and it has everything there s an incredible mix of pop songs and weird kind of abrasive almost punk rock songs and there s real beauty i think on this record aftermath thumb right kim deal playing guitar with amps in 1995 amps toured in 1995 and 1996 supporting guided by voices sonic youth helium and foo fighters later in 1996 they recruited carrie bradley who had played on pod and deal changed its name back to breeders band s
