gneisenau was a german capital ship alternatively described as a battleship and battlecruiser of nazi germany s kriegsmarine she was second vessel of her class which included one other ship ship was built at deutsche werke dockyard in kiel she was laid down on 6 may 1935 and launched on 8 december 1936 completed in may 1938 ship was armed with a main battery of nine 28 cm 11 in c 34 guns in three triple turrets though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38 cm 15 in sk c 34 guns in twin turrets gneisenau and scharnhorst operated together for much of early portion of world war ii including sorties into atlantic to raid british merchant shipping during their first operation two ships sank british auxiliary cruiser in a short battle gneisenau and scharnhorst participated in operation weserubung german invasion of norway during operations off norway two ships engaged battlecruiser and sank aircraft carrier gneisenau was damaged in action with renown and later torpedoed by a british submarine off norway after a successful raid in atlantic in 1941 gneisenau and her sister put in at brest france two battleships were subject of repeated bombing raids by raf gneisenau was hit several times during raids though she was ultimately repaired in early 1942 two ships made a daylight dash up english channel from occupied france to germany after reaching kiel in early february ship went into drydock on night of 26 february british launched an air attack on ship one bomb penetrated her armored deck and exploded in forward ammunition magazine causing serious damage and many casualties repairs necessitated by damage were so time consuming that it was determined to rebuild ship to accommodate 38 cm guns as originally intended 28 cm guns were removed and used as shore batteries in 1943 hitler ordered cessation of conversion work and on 27 march 1945 she was sunk as a blockship in gotenhafen gdynia in german occupied poland she was eventually broken up for scrap in 1951 construction and configuration thumb left gneisenau as she appeared in february 1942 gneisenau was ordered as ersatz hessen as a replacement for old pre dreadnought under contract name e deutsche werke in kiel was awarded contract where keel was laid on 6 may 1935 ship was launched on 8 december 1936 after which fitting out work was begun ship was completed in may 1938 and commissioned for sea trials on 21st under command of kapitan zur see kzs erich forste trials revealed a dangerous tendency to ship considerable amounts of water in heavy seas this caused flooding in bow and damaged electrical systems in forward gun turret as a result she went back to dockyard for extensive modification of bow original straight stem was replaced with a raised atlantic bow a diagonal cap was fitted to smoke stack to keep main mast free of smoke modifications were completed by september 1939 by which time ship was finally fully operational gneisenau displaced as built and fully loaded with a length of a beam of and a maximum draft of she was powered by three germania geared steam turbines which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of on speed trials her standard crew numbered 56 officers and 1 613 enlisted men though during war this was augmented up to 60 officers and 1 780 men while serving as a squadron flagship gneisenau carried an additional ten officers and 61 enlisted men she was armed with nine 28 cm 11 1 in l 54 5 guns arranged in three triple gun turrets two superfiring turrets forward anton and bruno and one aft caesar her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm 5 9 in l 55 guns fourteen l 65 and sixteen sk c 30 l 83 and initially ten c 30 anti aircraft guns number of 2 cm guns was eventually increased to thirty eight six above water torpedo tubes taken from light cruisers and were installed in 1942 service history gneisenau left germany for a round of trials in atlantic in june 1939 as it was peacetime ship carried primarily practice ammunition with only a small number of live rounds she was back in germany when war began in september 1939 on 4th day after british declaration of war gneisenau was attacked by fourteen wellington bombers though they made no hits in november kzs forste was replaced by kzs harald ship s first combat operation under command of admiral wilhelm marschall began on 21 november 1939 ship in company with her sister light cruiser and nine destroyers was to patrol area between iceland and faroe islands intent of operation was to draw out british units and ease pressure on heavy cruiser which was being pursued in south atlantic two days later german flotilla intercepted auxiliary cruiser scharnhorst fired first followed by gneisenau eight minutes later ship was quickly reduced to a burning wreck marschall ordered scharnhorst to pick up survivors while he stood by in gneisenau cruiser arrived on scene which prompted marschall to halt rescue operations and flee four allied capital ships british and french followed in pursuit germans reached wilhelmshaven on 27 november and on trip both battleships incurred significant damage from heavy seas and winds after returning to kiel gneisenau went into drydock for repairs for storm damage during repairs bow was remodeled a second time to incorporate additional flare and sheer in an attempt to improve her seaworthiness gneisenau went into baltic for trials on 15 january 1940 after completion of refit her voyage back to north sea was blocked by ice in kiel canal until 4 february operation weserubung thumb gneisenau in port gneisenau was assigned to forces participating in operation weserubung invasion of denmark and norway she and her sister were covering force for assaults on narvik and trondheim flag officer admiral gunther lutjens two ships left wilhelmshaven on morning of 7 april along with heavy cruiser and fourteen destroyers cruiser and destroyers carried assault forces for narvik and trondheim while gneisenau and scharnhorst provided cover for them later that day at around 14 30 three ships came under attack by a force of british bombers though bombers failed to make any hits on morning of 8 april destroyer encountered british destroyer before being sunk glowworm rammed admiral hipper though latter was not seriously damaged crews of two battleships went to battle stations though they did not take part in brief engagement at 21 00 gneisenau and scharnhorst took up a position west of vestfjorden to provide distant cover to both of landings at narvik and trondheim at 04 30 on 9th gneisenau located british battlecruiser renown with her seetakt radar call to battle stations rang out on both gneisenau and scharnhorst though it was that fired first at 05 05 gneisenau scored two hits on renown first failed to explode and second exploded on her upper deck and damaged radio equipment gneisenau and scharnhorst then turned to disengage almost simultaneously two of renown s 15 in 38 cm shells struck gneisenau one shell hit director tower and passed through it without exploding regardless it cut several cables and killed one officer and five enlisted men second shell disabled rear turret this prompted gneisenau to cease firing and increase speed in order to break away from renown vice admiral lutjens feared that destroyers escorting renown could be used to make torpedo attacks against his unescorted battleships in course of action gneisenau fired sixty 28 cm and eight 15 cm rounds during high speed escape both gneisenau and scharnhorst were flooded by significant quantities of water over their bows which caused problems in both of their forward gun turrets admiral hipper rejoined two battleships off trondheim on morning of 11 april and three ships returned to wilhelmshaven arriving following day there damage incurred during engagement with renown was repaired she was then drydocked in bremerhaven for periodic maintenance on 26 29 april ship was to go to baltic following completion of repairs but on morning of 5 may while steaming at off elbe estuary gneisenau detonated a magnetic mine about off port rear quarter and below hull explosion caused significant damage to hull and flooded several compartments which caused ship to take on a half degree list to port concussive shock from blast damaged many internal and topside components including starboard low pressure turbine and rear rangefinders repairs were effected in a floating drydock in kiel from 6 to 21 may a brief shakedown cruise followed in baltic and by 27th she was back in kiel at full combat readiness gneisenau and scharnhorst left wilhelmshaven on 4 june to return to norway they were joined by admiral hipper and four destroyers purpose of sortie operation juno was to interrupt allied resupply efforts to norwegians and to relieve pressure on german troops fighting in norway on 7 june squadron rendezvoused with tanker to refuel admiral hipper and four destroyers next day trawler was discovered and sunk along with oil tanker oil pioneer germans then launched their arado 196 float planes to search for more allied vessels admiral hipper and destroyers were sent to destroy orama a passenger ship while atlantis a hospital ship was allowed to proceed unmolested admiral marschall who had returned from sick leave to command sortie detached admiral hipper and four destroyers to refuel in trondheim while he would steam to harstad area thumb left 400px hms glorious photographed in may 1940 operating off norway at 17 45 german battleships spotted british aircraft carrier and two escorting destroyers and at a range of some scharnhorst was closer and therefore fired first scharnhorst had some boiler difficulty which reduced her speed to this allowed gneisenau to overtake her sister during action although destroyers attempted to cover glorious with smoke screens german battleships used their seetakt radar to assist gunlaying in less than an hour s shooting glorious was reduced to a burning hulk gneisenau then turned her fire on acasta while scharnhorst dispatched ardent before acasta was sunk she fired a spread of torpedoes at gneisenau which latter successfully evaded one of them struck scharnhorst however and caused serious damage after all three british ships had been sunk marschall withdrew his force to trondheim to conduct emergency repairs to scharnhorst in meantime marschall sortied with gneisenau admiral hipper and four destroyers though after two days he returned to trondheim when it became clear that british convoys were too heavily guarded admiral gunther lutjens replaced marschall as commander of squadron permanently and on 20 june he sortied with gneisenau admiral hipper and four destroyers in direction of iceland his intention was to give impression he was attempting to break out into atlantic to draw british attention away from scharnhorst as she made return voyage to germany about northwest of however submarine torpedoed gneisenau torpedo hit ship in bow just forward of splinter belt and caused serious damage ship took on a significant amount of water in two forward watertight compartments and she was forced to return to trondheim at reduced speed in trondheim repair ship huascaran effected temporary repairs that permitted ship to return to kiel on 25 27 july escorted by admiral hipper nurnberg four destroyers and six torpedo boats a strong force from british home fleet attempted to intercept flotilla but it failed to find it upon arrival gneisenau went into drydock at howaldtswerke dockyard for five months of repair work in august ship s commander was replaced by kzs otto fein who would captain ship for majority of her active wartime career operation berlin scharnhorst joined gneisenau in preparation for operation berlin planned breakout into atlantic ocean designed to wreak havoc on allied shipping lanes severe storms caused damage to gneisenau though scharnhorst was undamaged two ships were forced to put into port during storm gneisenau went to kiel for repairs while scharnhorst put into gdynia gotenhafen repairs were quickly completed and on 22 january 1941 two ships again under command of admiral lutjens left port for north atlantic they were detected in skagerrak and heavy units of british home fleet deployed to cover passage between iceland and faroes germans radar detected british at long range which allowed lutjens to avoid british patrols with aid of a squall by 3 february two battleships had evaded last british cruiser patrol and had broken into open atlantic thumb left gneisenau after her second bow alteration in 1942 on 6 february two ships refueled from tanker south of cape farewell shortly after 08 30 on 8 february lookouts spotted convoy hx 106 though it was escorted by battleship lutjens orders prohibited him from engaging allied capital ships and so attack was called off scharnhorsts commander kzs hoffmann however closed to in an attempt to lure ramillies away from convoy so that gneisenau could attack convoy lutjens ordered hoffmann to rejoin flagship immediately two battleships steamed off to northwest to search for more shipping on 22 february pair spotted an empty convoy sailing west though it dispersed at appearance of battleships gneisenau sank three ships and along with a fourth destroyed by scharnhorst pair accounted for 25 784 grt of allied shipping lutjens then decided to move to a new area as surviving members of dispersed convoy had sent distress signals he chose cape town gibraltar convoy route and positioned himself to northwest of cape verde two ships encountered another convoy escorted by battleship on 8 march lutjens again forbade an attack though he shadowed convoy and directed u boats to attack it a pair of u boats sank a total of 28 488 grt of shipping on night of 7 8 march malaya turned on two battleships and closed to well within range of germans guns but lutjens refused to be drawn into an engagement he instead turned toward mid atlantic where two ships refueled from tankers uckermark and ermland on 12 march on 15 march two battleships with two tankers in company encountered a dispersed convoy in mid atlantic gneisenau captured three tankers and sank a fourth totaling 20 139 grt of shipping next day stragglers from a convoy were sighted gneisenau sank seven ships for 26 693 grt while her sister accounted for six vessels for one of surviving ships radioed location of german battleships which summoned powerful british battleships rodney and scharnhorst and gneisenau used their high speed to escape in a squall and intervention by british battleships convinced lutjens that chances of further success were small he therefore decided to head for brest in occupied france which ships reached on 22 march she then entered drydock for periodic maintenance air attacks in brest after arriving in brest gneisenau was subject of repeated british air raids first attack took place on night of 30 31 march and a second occurred on 4 5 april during this second raid a armor piercing ap bomb narrowly missed ship as a result of attacks ship was moved out of dry dock and moved to harbor on 6 april gneisenau was attacked by british torpedo bombers which managed to score a single hit bristol beaufort that struck ship was piloted by flying officer kenneth campbell torpedo struck gneisenau in vicinity of rear main battery turret some of water flooded ship and caused a 2 degree list to starboard flooding also disabled several components of ship s propulsion system explosion caused significant destruction to side plating as well as starboard and centerline propeller shafts concussive shock also caused widespread damage to ship s electronic components a salvage tug came alongside to assist in pumping effort following attack gneisenau returned to drydock for repairs three days later on night of 9 10 april several british bombers dropped around of 227 kg ap bombs on ship four of which hit all four hit starboard side of forward superstructure two of bombs exploded on main armor deck while other two failed to detonate attack killed 72 initially and wounded 90 of whom 16 later died of their injuries bombs slightly damaged main armor deck and caused some structural damage on starboard side it was decided to make alterations to ship while she was drydocked for repairs these included installation of fourteen additional 2 cm anti aircraft guns and six 53 3 cm torpedo tubes amidships aircraft hangar was rearranged and catapult that had been mounted on top of it was removed length of repairs and modifications precluded participation in operation rheinubung sortie by new battleship in may 1941 british continued to attack ship in drydock though no further damage was done on 6 february 1942 a bomb fell close to gneisenau but caused no damage operation cerberus on 12 january 1942 german naval command in a conference with hitler made decision to return gneisenau scharnhorst and heavy cruiser to germany intention was to deploy vessels to norway to interdict allied convoys to soviet union so called channel dash codenamed operation cerberus would avoid increasingly effective allied radar and patrol aircraft in atlantic vice admiral otto ciliax was given command of operation in early february minesweepers swept a route through english channel though british failed to detect activity thumb gneisenau at sea at 23 00 on 11 february scharnhorst gneisenau and prinz eugen left brest they entered channel an hour later three ships sped at hugging french coast along voyage british failed to detect their departure as submarine that had been tasked with observing port had withdrawn to recharge its batteries by 06 30 they had passed cherbourg at which point they were joined by a flotilla of torpedo boats torpedo boats were led by kapitan erich bey aboard destroyer general der jagdflieger general of fighter force adolf galland directed luftwaffe fighter and bomber forces operation donnerkeil during cerberus fighters flew at masthead height to avoid detection by british radar network liaison officers were present on all three ships german aircraft arrived later to jam british radar with chaff by 13 00 ships had cleared strait of dover though half an hour later a flight of six swordfish torpedo bombers with spitfire escort attacked germans british failed to penetrate luftwaffe fighter shield and all six swordfish were destroyed several more attacks were launched over next two hours but luftwaffe screen repulsed them all five british destroyers mounted an attack on german squadron at 16 17 ships attempted to close to torpedo range though heavy seas and overcast conditions hampered their attack gneisenau and prinz eugen inflicted serious damage to destroyer at 19 55 gneisenau detonated a magnetic mine off terschelling mine exploded just forward of rear gun turret but caused only minor damage slight flooding was quickly stopped though shock disabled center turbine ship stopped for less than 30 minutes before resuming voyage by 03 50 gneisenau and two destroyers reached helgoland after being joined there by prinz eugen ships left for kiel but thick ice in canal forced ships to stop in brunsbuttel while maneuvering in port gneisenau struck a submerged wreck collision tore a hole in hull and caused some minor flooding gneisenau reached kiel following day where she went into a floating dry dock at deutsche werke dockyard fate repair work on gneisenau was completed by 26 february 1942 and she was scheduled to deploy to norway on 6 march despite fact that she was still in dry dock her ammunition stores had been restocked and she was prepared for a short round of trials before her departure on night of 26 27 february however british launched a heavy air raid on ship ship was hit by a single bomb in her forecastle that penetrated armored deck and exploded red hot bomb fragments ignited propellant charges in forward turret and caused a tremendous explosion turret was thrown off its mount and entire bow section was burned out crew partially flooded magazine to prevent a more catastrophic explosion blast killed 112 men and wounded 21 others extensive damage convinced naval staff to rebuild gneisenau to mount six 38 cm guns originally planned rather than repair ship damaged bow section was removed in order to attach a lengthened bow which would correct decrease in freeboard that would have been caused by heavier 38 cm guns on 4 april ship went to gotenhafen escorted by training ship and icebreaker castor she was formally decommissioned on 1 july her crew were paid off and redeployed to u boat arm by early 1943 ship had been sufficiently repaired to begin conversion process but hitler angered by failure of german surface raiders at battle of barents sea in december 1942 ordered cessation of all work gneisenau was disarmed and her 28 cm and 15 cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries turret caesar was installed in fort in trondheim as coastal battery gneisenau remained unused in gotenhafen until end of war as red army advanced on city remaining crew took ship out to entrance of harbor and sank vessel as a blockship on 27 march 1945 in 1947 polish government ordered ship be removed and initial salvage operations began ship was sealed and refloated on 12 september 1951 then completely scrapped though it is believed that some of her steel was used in construction of polish merchant vessels ship s bell was preserved and it is now in collection of museum of polish army in warsaw poland it is occasionally presented at exhibitions she was largest ship raised at time norway offered to return turret from trondheim in 1979 though offer was rejected gun turret was instead preserved as a museum in norway notes references category 1936 ships category scharnhorst class battleships category world war ii battleships of
