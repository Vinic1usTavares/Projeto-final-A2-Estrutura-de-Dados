than 1 from 563 000 viewers on march 9 2012 australian viewership data on my way heart critical reception there was a strong and varied reaction to episode by reviewers erica futterman of rolling stone described it as an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy handed but overall did what a winter finale should gave us plenty of surprises while setting things up for future ign s robert canning was won over by a powerfully acted and directed story and gave episode a great rating of 8 0 out of 10 he noted that as is often case smaller stories involving karofsky and quinn were more successful than larger arcs like rachel and finn s bobby hankinson of houston chronicle said that rather than a million different storylines there were a few really good ones and added it was chaos but controlled chaos a v club emily vanderwerff wrote sequence in which karofsky prepared himself for death was unquestionably one of best things glee has ever done she added that it was all more a shame that it occurred in an episode that did not know how to make effective use of impact of that moment and she gave episode as a whole a d grade in a similar vein james poniewozik of time said beginning of episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television but said that was also episode s problem michael slezak of tvline noted that show s audacity allowed it to tackle some of most important issues of day with a and honesty that aren t merely refreshing but absolutely necessary and added if i ve got any complaint with episode it would have to be that for a show that s billed as a musical comedy there certainly weren t many laughs and musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought in a similar vein billboard rae votta wrote any thoughts that glee is in fact a comedy should be soundly crushed by now it s a fantastical reality and sometimes you laugh at that but other times you cry thumb left upright max adler pictured was praised for his portrayal of dave karofsky in this episode sequence where karofsky attempts suicide was greatly praised on many levels slezak called it as devastating as anything i ve seen on tv this year canning wrote that initial locker room scene was heartbreaking and max adler s subtle facial expressions were brilliant crystal bell of huffpost tv applauded adler for doing such an amazing job on suicide scene she stated i would have preferred if karofsky s storyline would have been focus of entire episode buddytv john kubicek was critical of entire storyline and wrote that teen suicide was one of those incredibly sensitive issues that shouldn t be taken on so directly by a light silly musical comedy like glee vanderwerff commented that as show got little details of karofsky s desperate act just right whole thing took on a weight and singled out scene where teachers talked about what had happened and smash cut to karofsky s father screaming at him to get up as heart wrenching he added this was glee i had first loved glee that could blend music and romance and comedy and highly volatile drama into one cocktail though he also said that episode had failed to pay off those emotions bell declared that best scene in entire episode is when kurt visits karofsky in hospital joseph brannigan lynch of entertainment weekly called it one of most touching scenes of this season and guileless well acted and eye watering votta wrote as always kurt and karofsky s scenes shine as strongest in whichever episode they re featured mtv s kevin p sullivan wrote that episode jammed in regionals something that used to matter and did so without any meaningful buildup to competition poniewozik described competition showdown as unconnected with episode we began watching and canning said that regionals just got in way and performances did a disservice to what was going on with karofsky votta characterized mckinley victory as so secondary to point of this episode that it feels completely anticlimactic and vanderwerff summarized when new directions hoists that trophy aloft at end it s about least compelling victory for group yet vanderwerff said that morrison had a nice moment when he underplays scene where he talks about how will once contemplated suicide after getting caught cheating on a test though while lynch thought idea of scene was nice it was more awkward than meaningful slezak called it worst moment of episode and criticized utter lack of context regarding what else will might have been going through kubicek described it as an embarrassingly uncomfortable speech and will s implicit comparison of cheating on a test to stresses of teenage homosexuality was just wrong vanderwerff thought that next part of sequence had a smallness a realness to scene that s kind of beautiful really and that it feels like they re actual high school kids votta commented that as kids admit all things they are looking forward to it reminds viewers why they are rooting for this ragtag bunch wedding of rachel and finn did not excite interest among reviewers votta said plot continues to feel exhausting and was small in comparison to other threads going on and raymund flandez of wall street journal called it most preposterous of all storylines vanderwerff wrote i can buy that finn and rachel would be that stupid as to think getting married would perk everybody right on up as could votta who likened it to people needing to find something positive to focus on even if that supposedly positive thing is its own train wreck washington post jen chaney wondered why showed squander ed presence of jeff goldblum and brian stokes mitchell for second week in a row thumb right 200px reviewers were divided on cliffhanger ending which showed quinn agron pictured moments before she was in a serious automobile accident bell lauded brilliant conversation between quinn and sue toward end where sue told quinn that she admired her lynch though that kurt was out of line when he declared quinn didn t know what it was like to truly suffer he noted that she was kicked out of her house and disowned by her father while pregnant and added she s suffered plenty for a teenager he said about episode s final scene which ended as car quinn was driving was about to be hit by a rapidly moving truck you can t help but feel sucker punched when something like this happens flandez called it a cowardly ending but canning praised good cliffhanger and subtle enough storytelling that did not telegraph anything before closing sequence a number of reviewers praised sebastian s villainous ways despite his decision to abandon his blackmail attempt futterman noted that people had just gotten used to idea of a well played villain on show while amy reiter of los angeles times expressed doubt about a complete conversion we ll see how long that lasts slezak called him a gem when it comes to delivering spicy one liners though he was less enthusiastic about character s vocal solos as was canning who nevertheless hailed sebastian as a fine nemesis absent more screen time for karofsky storyline bell said that episode felt more like a psa as it plugged everything from trevor project to lady gaga s born this way foundation flandez stated that this incredibly monumentous message of hope became sullied with unexpected product placements edible arrangements peanut butter co even sex and city 3 sullivan was unsure whether god squad s plan to bring an edible arrangement to karofsky was a poorly timed joke or product placement but deemed it regrettable either way music and performances musical performances were given a mixed response by reviewers canning wrote that performances of episode didn t measure up to non musical material and were bland and flat while chaney characterized them as often lackluster and added that they were part of most boring regionals competition ever hankinson however called it a night of very solid performances chaney said that criss did a fine job with first number cough syrup which was sung during karofsky suicide sequence and gave it a b futterman said blaine flawlessly deliver ed vocal lynch called it a chilling rendition that was hard to shake and gave it an same grade given by slezak who wrote taken on its own blaine s vocal was strong and passionate perhaps better than original hankinson said it was best of episode and added that scene was really really well done and carried maximum emotional punch regionals songs by warblers were given a lukewarm reception stand was characterized by lynch as bouncy fun but in a bland forgettable sense and glad you came as rather unmemorable both songs received a grade slezak gave two songs a c and called sebastian s lead vocals as bland as a bowl of plain lasagna noodles and canning described his as a weak voice that doesn t deliver a very convincing performance votta described stand as lackluster and mild but called glad you came strongest warbler number since blaine s defection she added it s catchy and well choreographed and if sebastian s addition to warblers spurred them to finally take their in dalton dance heavy and exuberant performance style to competition then it s a welcome one hankinson noted that warblers performed two wonderful songs that were new to him flandez and chaney among others wished it were blaine leading warblers not sebastian chaney wrote that mash up of fly and i believe i can fly was an unexpectedly lovely mix and gave it a b futterman said it seamlessly wove two into an uplifting and thematically appropriate mash up and credited santana and blaine with an impressive job on minaj s rap verses while rachel artie and mercedes split tastefully understated solos slezak credited solid vocals from artie finn rachel and mercedes and some not terrible rapping from blaine and santana but he thought number lacked epic scope you want from a regionals showdown and disliked song i believe i can fly his grade was a votta characterized mashup as just off and better visually than it is just to listen to track lynch said santana had attitude to spare in her rap and new directions harmonized wonderfully on this very re listenable mash up and gave it a b grade slezak said that vocals on what doesn t kill you stronger were fantastic and graded song an flandez called troubletones fine fierce and fabulous though chaney wrote that rendition was a fairly routine take chaney and slezak both wondered about extra girls in number but lynch simply said nice to get a little troubletones action separate from but still part of new directions lynch s grade was a b in part because mercedes s voice seemed strangely buried reviewers of here s to us differed on what they felt worked and didn t lynch said song seemed wrong fit for rachel not horrible but a misfire and gave it a chaney was more critical of song itself when she gave her c grade and described it as so bland that it had little emotional impact despite michele s determined ferocity votta called number pretty but said placement of boys in balconies was cute but not really compelling as a staged performance slezak stated that it was hard to find any fault with lea michele s vocal performances and gave it a b and futterman wrote it s sic and celebratory and rachel kills it chart history of six singles released for episode five debuted on us and canadian top 100 charts mash up of fly and i believe i can fly was highest debut in us at number fifty six on billboard hot 100 followed by cough syrup at number sixty five what doesn t kill you stronger at number
