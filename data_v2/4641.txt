believe it s a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood said episode was a fitting end to a season that had seen simpsons consolidate its success and become even more daring and intelligent dvd movie guide s colin jacobson said that from ingenious and hilarious raiders of lost ark parody at show s start bart s friend falls in love is a keeper it actually develops characters and gets into pre teen emotions but never becomes sappy b plot in which lisa tries to get homer to lose weight provides terrific laughs as well nate meyers of digitally obsessed gave episode a 4 5 out of 5 rating and commented that it s tough to view milhouse in a romantic relationship especially since most recent seasons have made a point of hinting at milhouse being gay still love triangle makes for some interesting drama and script s observations about childhood infatuations are right on point bill gibron of dvd verdict however thought plot seemed drawn out and only homer s eating disorder and subliminal tape attempts at weight loss have lasting appeal since tape turns out to be a vocabulary builder hearing homer expound in flowery language is a real rare treat
