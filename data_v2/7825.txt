amanita exitialis also known as guangzhou destroying angel is a mushroom of large genus amanita it is distributed in eastern asia and probably also in india where it has been misidentified as a verna deadly poisonous it is a member of section phalloideae and related to death cap a phalloides fruit bodies mushrooms are white small to medium sized with caps up to in diameter a somewhat friable ring and a firm volva unlike most agaric mushrooms which typically have four spored basidia spore bearing cells basidia of a exitialis are almost entirely two spored eight people were fatally poisoned in china after consuming mushroom in 2000 and another 20 have been fatally poisoned since that incident molecular analysis shows that species has a close phylogenetic relationship with three other toxic white amanitas a subjunquillea var alba a virosa and a bisporigera taxonomy classification and phylogeny zhu liang yang and tai hui li discovered species by various herbarium specimens of white amanita typically referred to as either a verna or a virosa they realized that collections referred to as these european species actually comprised three taxa new to science or region other two amanita taxa identified in publication were amanita oberwinklerana new to china and amanita subjunquillea var alba which had its known chinese range greatly extended holotype specimen of a exitialis is located in mycological herbarium of guangdong institute of microbiology in 2005 zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on its sequences of several white bodied toxic amanita species their results support a clade containing four lethal amanita species with white fruit bodies a exitialis has two spored basidia similar to north american species a bisporigera but a exitialis has a closer phylogenetic relationship with amanita subjunquillea var alba a four spored white lethal species from china specific epithet exitialis derives from latin word destructive and refers to lethally poisonous nature of mushroom amanita exitialis is classified in section phalloideae of genus amanita species of this section share following characteristics spores that are not strongly elongated and never with a cylindrical shape flesh not reddening upon bruising lamellulae short gills that do not reach edge of cap abruptly cut off a well formed pouch or sac like membranous volva all species of phalloideae are ectomycorrhizal and contain amatoxins description thumb 160px left a exitialis has been misidentified as european species a verna shown here cap is in diameter initially egg shaped then convex but flattening with age and sometimes slightly depressed at center cap surface is smooth white but cream colored in center margin cap edge is non striate non without any partial veil remnants hanging along cap margin flesh white gills are free from attachment to stem white to whitish crowded closely together and up to 5 mm in height lamellulae are long and tapering plentiful and arranged in 2 3 tiers stem is by roughly cylindrical or slightly tapering upward with apex slightly expanded surface is white to whitish smooth or sometimes with fibrous small scales bulb at base of stem is roughly spherical and wide volva is has a distinct edge thin membranous with free limb up to 7 mm in height and both surfaces are white ring is near top of stem thin membranous white persistent or may be torn from stem during expansion of cap all tissues of fruit body will turn yellow if a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied spores are spherical or nearly so rarely broadly ellipsoid and measure 9 5 12 by 9 11 5 um they are hyaline translucent and colorless amyloid absorbing iodine when stained with melzer s reagent thin walled smooth and have a small apiculus spore bearing cells basidia are 27 55 by 10 15 um club shaped and two spored rarely one spored they have sterigmata slender projections that attach spores that are 5 7 um long similar species amanita exitialis is similar to a bisporigera a species originally described by george francis atkinson from united states in comparison to a exitialis a bisporigera differs by its lower placement of ring on stem smaller spores typically 8 9 5 by 7 8 5 um and different structure of volva american specimens of a bisporigera have more abundant inflated cells than that of a exitialis two other white asian species a oberwinklerana and a subjunquillea var alba also resemble a exitialis but are four spored habitat and distribution fruit bodies of a exitialis grow solitarily or in groups on ground in coniferous forests it is known only from type locality guangdong province in a 2003 survey of indian amanita species authors mention several collections identified as a verna from various locations in indian states maharashtra odisha and rajasthan as bhatt et al explain material collected by in odisha and identified as a virosa has two spored basidia and his description matches that of a exitialis field observations suggest that mushroom associates with plant a deciduous tree found only in southern provinces of china such as guangdong yunnan and hunan mushroom fruitings are abundant in warm spring rains of march and april although they are also seen in may to july toxicity thumb right phallacidin is one of several phallotoxins in a exitialis content and distribution of main amatoxins alpha amanitin beta amanitin and phallotoxins phallacidin phallisin phalloin phalloidin in three tissues cap stipe and volva of amanita exitialis have been determined using high performance liquid chromatography cap had highest content of total toxins reaching over 8000 ug g dry weight ug of toxin per gram of dried tissue toxins content in stem was over 3700 ug g dry weight whereas volva had lowest content of total toxins with about 1150 ug g dry weight amatoxins content alpha amanitin and beta especially alpha amanitin in cap stem or volva of a exitialis was higher than that of phallotoxins phallacidin phallisin phalloidin and phalloin but content of phallotoxins especially phallacidin was gradually higher from cap to stem and to volva a 2011 study reported presence of additional toxins and a chinese study concluded that this species had highest mortality rate of all toxic mushrooms in china it has been estimated that about of fresh mushrooms contains sufficient toxin to cause death of a adult in march 2000 nine people consumed mushroom in guangzhou and only one survived since 2000 another 20 people have died in southern provinces of china from consuming mushroom toxic peptides from amanita species have been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit rna polymerase ii an enzyme essential for protein synthesis however these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats and are consequently expensive some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from mycelia of amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture although toxin concentration in mycelium is only about 10 of that in fruiting bodies authors suggest that is possible to increase amatoxin production by optimizing growth conditions bioactive compounds fruit bodies of amanita exitialis contain a unique purine nucleoside that is coupled with an amino acid derivative named n2 1 guanosine discovery and identification of this chemical was first report of a naturally occurring nucleoside in which an amino acid derivative is bonded through its a amino nitrogen nitrogen bonded to a carbon to a by a c n carbon to nitrogen bond new compound was determined to be toxic in brine shrimp lethality test but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines other compounds isolated from fungus include b carboline and a ceramide formerly found in some russula mushrooms see also list of amanita species list of deadly fungi references external links exitialis category
