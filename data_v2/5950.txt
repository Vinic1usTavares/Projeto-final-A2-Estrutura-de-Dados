13th airborne division was an airborne forces formation of division size of united states army that was active during world war ii division was commanded for most of its existence by major general elbridge g chapman flanagan p 289 it was officially activated in united states in august 1943 at fort bragg in north carolina remaining active until february 1946 but never saw combat after activation division remained in united states to complete its training this training was completed by september 1944 but had to be extended by a further four months when division provided replacements for 82nd and 101st airborne divisions division also encountered delays in mounting large scale training exercises due to a lack of transport aircraft in united states this shortage was caused by 82nd and 101st airborne divisions taking priority over 13th in terms of equipment due to two divisions serving in combat in europe huston p 125 as a consequence of these delays division was not fully trained and combat ready until january 1945 and was transferred to france and european theater of operations in february flanagan p 285 when division arrived in france it came under command of first allied airborne army which controlled all allied airborne formations division along with two others was selected to participate in operation varsity airborne operation to support anglo canadian 21st army group crossing river rhine but was removed from operation due to there being insufficient transport aircraft to carry all three divisions into combat blair p 440 several other operations were planned for division after end of operation varsity but these operations were cancelled when their objectives were captured by rapid advance of allied ground forces and they became superfluous huston p 217 after end of conflict in europe 13th airborne was shipped to united states to stage there before it was to participate in planned invasion of japan but conflict in far east ended before it was required and it remained in united states 13th airborne division was finally inactivated on 26 february 1946 and its combat personnel were transferred to command of 82nd airborne division flanagan p 290 formation 13th airborne division was fifth airborne division to be formed in united states during world war ii and was officially activated on friday 13th of august 1943 at fort bragg north carolina under command of major general george w griner jr only a few months after activation of division however major general griner was ordered to take command of 98th infantry division and was replaced by major general elbridge chapman who would go on to command division for rest of conflict blythe and henry p 16 chapman was one of early pioneers of american airborne concept commanding experimental 88th airborne infantry battalion in late 1941 when he was a lieutenant colonel before going on to take command of 13th airborne division flanagan p 19 88th airborne infantry battalion would be renamed as 88th airborne infantry regiment and then finally become 88th glider infantry regiment on 21 september 1942 forming core of 13th airborne division flanagan p 20 when it was activated 13th airborne division was initially composed of 515th parachute infantry regiment 88th glider infantry regiment and 326th glider infantry regiment shoulder sleeve insignia division s

insignia actions during world war ii training between august 1943 and february 1945 13th airborne division remained in united states and did not serve overseas or participate in any airborne operations as it began training to become a combat ready formation in comparison 82nd and 101st airborne divisions had been assigned as active combat formations to serve overseas in europe 11th airborne division was scheduled to be deployed to pacific theater of operations and 17th airborne division had been assigned as united states strategic reserve formation huston p 126 during this period activities of division primarily involved airborne training as well as taking part in several training exercises however while airborne training for first four american airborne divisions was conducted during 1943 13th encountered considerable difficulties when it came to its turn for training huston p 124 by last few months of 1943 82nd and 101st airborne divisions had conducted airborne exercises and finished their training and had then been transferred to europe to ensure divisions could conduct airborne operations a majority of transport aircraft available in united states had been sent with them and even more were transferred to europe as replacements after american airborne landings in normandy in june 1944 huston pp 124 125 consequently very few transport aircraft were available for use by 13th and original training exercise for division that had been scheduled for june 1944 had to be postponed until 17 september and then once again until 24 september huston p 139 thumb left major general eldridge g chapman and lieutenant general lesley j mcnair commander of army ground forces inspect troopers of 13th airborne division 13 may 1944 divisional training exercise took place around camp mackall north carolina and suffered from a number of difficulties and problems poor weather delayed beginning of exercise until night of 25 september and it was only then that aircraft carrying first three battalions of paratroopers could take off and attempt to drop airborne troops on three separate drop zones huston p 140 a combination of poor visibility and a lack of sufficient training for pilots of transport aircraft resulted in paratroopers being dispersed widely when dropped only sixty five percent of airborne troops and equipment dropped on first drop zone were ready for action ninety minutes later and in second drop zone airborne troops were so scattered that by 10 00 next morning commander of battalion only had control over twenty percent of his men a similar number of paratroopers missed third drop zone although majority were dropped in a relatively small area where they could gather further problems were encountered as a plane crash killed eight paratroopers and four aircrew and glider borne elements of division due to land were delayed by poor weather after initial night exercise continued for a further three days and included a complex supply mission designed to test whether it was possible to supply an isolated battalion of airborne troops overall observers present for exercise reported that they had been impressed with performance of glider borne elements of division however several noted that training of aircraft pilots for night formation flying and navigation was far from satisfactory a recommendation was made that night that glider landings should be considered only when an emergency existed and that otherwise gliders should take off during night and land during daylight to avoid wide dispersal of airborne troops and a decrease in efficiency after these exercises had ended division continued to train but encountered further delays these were caused when 1 652 men were removed from division to provide reinforcements for u s airborne units in european theater this drastically reduced strength of division and forced it to extend its training period for a further four months huston p 148 after completing its training in january division was preparing to transfer to pacific theatre in early 1945 however rapid advances made by german forces during battle of bulge led to division being transferred to european theatre of operations to reinforce allied divisions already in combat ruppenthal p 286 european theater of operations division arrived in european theater of operations in early february coming under command of first allied airborne army and major general chapman was informed that there was a possibility that division would be required to conduct airborne operations during closing stages of battle of bulge however campaign in ardennes ended before division could be transported there next chance for 13th to participate in an airborne operation and to actually see combat was in march 1945 when allies had penetrated into germany itself and reached river rhine a few weeks before division was to participate in a combat jump over rhine it was reorganized after a conference by war department had decided that a more efficient composition for an airborne division was two parachute infantry regiments and only a single glider infantry regiment subsequently 517th parachute infantry regiment a veteran unit that had served in italy southern france and ardennes joined division in early march and 88th glider infantry regiment was combined into 326th glider infantry regiment that remained as division s sole glider based element 517th had recently fought during ardennes campaign and had received a presidential unit citation for its actions thumb right allied disposition in western europe by march 1945 rhine river was a formidable natural obstacle to allied advance but if breached would allow allies access to north german plain and ultimately to advance on berlin and other major cities in northern germany following broad front approach laid out by general dwight d eisenhower supreme allied commander of allied expeditionary force it was decided to attempt to breach rhine in several areas saunders tim p 41 field marshal bernard montgomery commanding anglo canadian 21st army group devised a plan to allow forces under his command to breach rhine which he titled operation plunder and which was subsequently authorized by eisenhower plunder envisioned british second army under lieutenant general miles c dempsey and u s ninth army under lieutenant general william simpson crossing rhine at rees wesel and an area south of lippe canal to ensure that operation was a success montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into plans for operation to support amphibious assaults that would take place which was code named operation varsity devlin pp 258 259 three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in varsity these being british 6th airborne division u s 17th airborne division and finally 13th all of which were assigned to u s xviii airborne corps commanded by major general matthew ridgway however it was discovered that there were only enough transport aircraft available in europe to transport two airborne divisions into combat and as such it was removed from operation varsity due to its lack of combat experience after its removal from operation varsity division remained in reserve as allied armies advanced even further into germany moving to oise france on 3 april for supply and administrative tasks division was scheduled to participate in several other airborne operations however these were all cancelled before they could take place warren p 157 first of these was operation arena which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a strategic airhead in kassel region of northern germany planners of operations envisioned that operation would deny a large swathe of territory to german defenders and give allied armies a staging area for further advances into germany 13th was chosen to participate along with 17th 82nd and 101st airborne divisions and british 6th and 1st airborne divisions huston pp 216 217 a preliminary date for 1 may was set for operation once all of required airborne and air landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 march due to rapid movement of allied ground forces negating need for operation huston pp 217 218 two other airborne operations were planned to include 13th operation choker ii was to be an airborne landing on east bank of rhine near worms germany planning for operation got to an advanced stage and division was only hours from taking off from airfields in france when operation was cancelled due to allied ground forces overrunning proposed landing areas operation effective was designed to land 13th south of stuttgart seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near black forest operation was scheduled for 22 april but was cancelled on 18 april due to allied units encircling black forest region and making it unnecessary warren p 201 inactivation conflict with germany came to an end a few weeks after operation effective was cancelled and shortly afterwards it was announced that division would be redeployed to pacific to participate in invasion of japan after a brief stop over in united states deactivation of 17th airborne division meant that 13th acquired several combat units from that division to bolster it for its envisioned action in japan flanagan p 344 division arrived in new york city on 23 august but did not leave united states before surrender of japan in september 1945 with conflict at an end division was no longer required by united states army and it was permanently inactivated at fort bragg north carolina on 25 february 1946 with its personnel transferred to command
