battle of huoyi huo yi zhi zhan wade giles huo i was fought in china on 8 september 617 between forces of rebel duke of tang li yuan and army of ruling sui dynasty li yuan with an army of around 25 000 was advancing south along fen river towards imperial capital daxingcheng his advance was stalled for two weeks due to heavy rainfall and he was met at town of huoyi by an elite sui army of 20 000 or 30 000 men li yuan s cavalry under command of his two eldest sons lured sui out of protection of city walls but in first clash between two main armies li yuan s forces were initially driven back at that point possibly due to a stratagem on li yuan s behalf arrival of rest of rebel army or to flanking manoeuvres of li yuan s cavalry which had gotten behind sui army sui troops collapsed and routed fleeing back towards huoyi li yuan s cavalry however cut off their retreat battle was followed by capture of weakly defended huoyi and advance on daxingcheng which fell to rebels in november in next year li yuan deposed sui and proclaimed himself emperor beginning tang dynasty background during later reign of second emperor of sui dynasty yang imperial authority began to wane main reason was immense material and human cost of protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer korean kingdom of goguryeo coupled with natural disasters conscription of more and more men for war and hoarding of scarce grain reserves for army s needs increased provincial discontent as a result from 611 on rural revolts broke out across empire and with emperor s prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on korean campaigns and only as unrest spread within empire and powerful eastern turks turned hostile did he realize gravity of situation in 616 he abandoned north and withdrew to jiangdu where he remained until his assassination in 618 with emperor s withdrawal from scene local governors and magnates were left free to advance their own ambitions to power nine major contenders emerged some claiming imperial title for themselves others like li mi in henan contenting themselves for time being with more modest titles of duke gong and king wang among most well positioned contenders was li yuan duke of tang and governor of taiyuan in northwest modern shanxi a scion of a noble family related to sui dynasty and with a distinguished career behind him li yuan was an obvious candidate for throne his province possessed excellent natural defences a heavily militarized population and was located near capitals of daxingcheng chang an and luoyang li yuan s march south thumb right upright 1 4 li yuan s march from taiyuan to chang an traditional chinese historiography emphasizes li yuan s initial reluctance to revolt against sui and claims that he had to be persuaded by his senior aides and his second son and eventual successor li shimin in reality as revealed by diary of his chief secretary wen daya li yuan was considering a rebellion at least by time of his appointment to taiyuan in early 617 and was very much driving force behind revolt in mid 617 li began raising additional troops from his province and executed his two deputies who were appointed by yang to watch over him he also concluded an alliance with powerful khagan of eastern turks which secured his northern frontier from a turkish invasion and provided him with men and most importantly horses which he lacked initially however li yuan portrayed himself a sui loyalist and proclaimed his intention of placing yang s grandson yang you on throne li yuan s campaign was recorded in detail by wen daya in mid july a first expedition under li yuan s eldest sons li jiancheng and li shimin was launched against loyalist commandery further south along fen river li yuan s sons succeeded in capturing province within a few days and returned to taiyuan finally after completing his preparations on 10 august li yuan began his march south along fen towards daxingcheng his righteous army comprised 30 000 men raised from local soaring hawk militia but with some 10 000 additional volunteers and including a 500 strong turkish contingent provided by khagan along with 2 000 horses his fifteen year old son li was left behind to guard taiyuan while li jiancheng and li shimin accompanied their father as his lieutenants a small force under zhang lun zhang lun was detached to advance parallel to main army and captured loyalist commanderies further west securing flanks li yuan s advance was stopped at a place called guhubao for two weeks in late august due to heavy rainfall giving time to sui authorities to react general tong was sent to secure commandery on yellow river another 20 000 elite troops under song laosheng advanced north to town of huoyi some south of guhubao to confront him huoyi was placed on southern exit of a defile through which road passed following course of fen river and provided an excellent position from which to check an army coming from north when li yuan s army learned of song laosheng s presence some began advocating a retreat to taiyuan fearing that in their absence turks might break treaty and attack it a council was held at which li yuan sided with his sons who argued forcefully for continuing campaign thus on 8 september after rains stopped li yuan s army set out from its encampment instead of following road through defile however they chose a path through southeastern hills allegedly revealed to them by a peasant li yuan s army that arrived at huoyi numbered less than its original 30 000 men perhaps as few as 25 000 due to detachments left behind it was predominantly composed of infantry and was divided into six divisions under a general but it is unclear how they were subordinated to li yuan and his sons li jiancheng and li shimin were named in traditional fashion as commanders of left and right respectively but in accounts of battle army appears formed in van middle and rear divisions cavalry a few hundred strong was apparently kept as a reserve very little is also known about sui army except that song laosheng s troops were considered to be elite warriors some sources raise their number to 30 000 from more typical 20 000 this could be an error or possibly indicate additional forces recruited at huoyi battle thumb right upright 0 8 li yuan emperor gaozu of tang there are two accounts of subsequent battle account of wen daya and a later official account which became dominant version in traditional chinese historiography latter was compiled during reign of li shimin and therefore enhances his own role having him decide battle in a cavalry charge while denigrating role of both his father and his elder brother li jiancheng whom li shimin would murder and supplant on throne two accounts are difficult to reconcile but wen daya s account despite its own inadequacies is to be preferred as an eyewitness testimony according to wen daya li yuan feared that song laosheng would deny battle and instead force him to engage in a prolonged and costly siege of town for this reason as soon as headquarters with cavalry cleared hills and came into view of huoyi in early afternoon of 8 september li yuan sent his sons at head of cavalry to manoeuvre before walls of huoyi hoping to entice sui army to come out in this he hoped to exploit song laosheng s reputation for rashness slower moving infantry which formed bulk of li yuan s army was still in process of traversing hills and li yuan sent officers to hurry them up song laosheng who may have seen this as an opportunity to destroy his enemy piecemeal deployed his army outside town wall but proved reluctant to advance further and had to be goaded further away from town through a feigned retreat by cavalry at this time li yuan s infantry began arriving with van division deploying in a square to fend off a sui attack while other two divisions were coming up behind it wen daya s account now becomes indicating that infantry charged sui army at which point li yuan s sons led cavalry around sui flank towards town where small garrison left behind by song laosheng was forced to drop portcullis gates li yuan then let spread rumour that song laosheng had been killed which demoralized sui force sui army began to retreat but this turned into a rout when they found their retreat to huoyi cut off by li yuan s cavalry and barred gates wen daya s narrative can be supplemented by later account which despite its bias regarding li shimin also contains indications that not everything went according to li yuan s plans it appears that in first clash between li yuan s infantry and sui army sui had upper hand and pushed li yuan back possibly because he had not yet managed to bring all his forces into field either through arrival of rest of li yuan s infantry actions of li yuan s cavalry along and behind sui flanks or li yuan s stratagem sui army s morale gave way abruptly and their resistance collapsed battle was over by 4 00 p m in a crushing victory for li yuan who then led his troops against huoyi itself although he lacked any siege equipment garrison in town was too small to effectively resist li yuan s army and huoyi fell within a few hours aftermath following their victory li yuan and his army continued their southward advance and in mid october reached yellow river part of army was left behind to contain sui garrison at while rest crossed river defeating a sui army that tried to stop them governor of surrendered city and its vital granaries to him and li yuan turned towards capital on way he was joined by his daughter princess and his cousin li with troops they had raised themselves by time li yuan s army reached daxingcheng it was said to number 200 000 men after a brief siege on 9 november li yuan s troops stormed capital this feat established li yuan as a major contender for empire but for moment despite calls of his generals to proclaim himself emperor there and then he still pretended to be a sui loyalist sui imperial family was kept safe and its dignity respected and young yang you was enthroned as emperor gong with yang himself delegated to honorific position of retired emperor taishang huang it was not until 16 june 618 exactly a year after he formally broke with sui by executing his deputies that li yuan deposed puppet emperor and proclaimed himself first emperor of tang dynasty with temple name of gaozu new dynasty still had to face various local rebels and warlords that had sprung up throughout chinese empire but by 628 with a judicious mixture of force and clemency tang had succeeded in pacification and consolidation of china under their rule references sources category 617 huoyi
