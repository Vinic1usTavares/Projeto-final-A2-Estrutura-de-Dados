grand coulee dam is a concrete gravity dam on columbia river in u s state of washington built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water constructed between 1933 and 1942 grand coulee originally had only two powerhouses third powerhouse completed in 1974 to increase energy production makes grand coulee largest power station in united states by nameplate capacity at 6 809 mw proposal to build dam was focus of a bitter debate during 1920s between two groups one group wanted to irrigate ancient grand coulee with a gravity canal while other pursued a high dam and pumping scheme dam supporters won in 1933 but for fiscal reasons initial design was for a low dam tall which would generate electricity without supporting irrigation that year u s bureau of reclamation and a consortium of three companies called mwak mason walsh atkinson kier company began construction after visiting construction site in august 1934 president franklin delano roosevelt endorsed high dam design which at high would provide enough electricity to pump water into columbia basin for irrigation congress approved high dam in 1935 and it was completed in 1942 first waters overtopped grand coulee s spillway on of that year power from dam fueled growing industries of northwest united states during world war ii between 1967 and 1974 third powerplant was constructed decision to construct additional facility was influenced by growing energy demand regulated river flows stipulated in columbia river treaty with canada and competition with soviet union through a series of upgrades and installation of pump generators dam now supplies four power stations with an installed capacity of 6 809 mw as centerpiece of columbia basin project dam s reservoir supplies water for irrigation of reservoir is called franklin delano roosevelt lake named after united states president who presided over dam s authorization and completion creation of reservoir forced relocation of over 3 000 people including native americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded while dam does not contain fish passage neither does next downstream dam chief joseph dam this means no salmon reach grand coulee dam second large dam downstream rocky reach dam has an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning and migration background grand coulee is an ancient river bed on columbia plateau created during pliocene epoch calabrian by retreating glaciers and floods originally geologists believed a glacier that diverted columbia river formed grand coulee but it was revealed in mid late 20th century that massive floods from lake missoula carved most of gorge earliest known proposal to irrigate grand coulee with columbia river dates to 1892 when coulee city news and spokesman review reported on a scheme by a man named laughlin mclean to construct a dam across columbia river high enough that water would back up into grand coulee a dam that size would have its reservoir encroach into canada which would violate treaties soon after bureau of reclamation was founded it investigated a scheme for pumping water from columbia river to irrigate parts of central washington an attempt to raise funds for irrigation failed in 1914 as washington voters rejected a bond measure in 1917 william m clapp a lawyer from ephrata washington proposed columbia be dammed immediately below grand coulee he suggested a concrete dam could flood plateau just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago clapp was joined by james o sullivan another lawyer and by rufus woods publisher of wenatchee world newspaper in nearby agricultural centre of wenatchee together they became known as dam college woods began promoting grand coulee dam in his newspaper often with articles written by o sullivan dam idea gained popularity with public in 1918 backers of reclamation in central washington split into two camps pumpers favored a dam with pumps to elevate water from river into grand coulee from which canals and pipes could irrigate farmland ditchers favored diverting water from northeast washington s pend oreille river via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in central and eastern washington many locals such as woods o sullivan and clapp were pumpers while many influential businessmen in spokane associated with washington water and power company wwpc were staunch ditchers pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from dam could cover costs and claimed ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly on electric power ditchers took several steps to ensure support for their proposals in 1921 wwpc secured a preliminary permit to build a dam at kettle falls about upstream from grand coulee if built kettle falls dam would have lain in path of grand coulee dam s reservoir essentially blocking its construction wwpc planted rumors in newspapers stating exploratory drilling at grand coulee site found no granite on which a dam s foundations could rest only clay and fragmented rock this was later disproved with reclamation ordered drilling ditchers hired general george w goethals engineer of panama canal to prepare a report goethals visited state and produced a report backing ditchers bureau of reclamation was unimpressed by goethals report believing it filled with errors in president warren g harding visited washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there but died a month later his successor calvin coolidge had little interest in irrigation projects bureau of reclamation desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation was focusing on boulder canyon project that resulted in hoover dam reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923 but project s cost made federal officials reluctant washington state proposals received little support from those further east who feared irrigation would result in more crops depressing prices with president coolidge opposed to project bills to appropriate money for surveys of grand coulee site failed thumb dam site before construction looking south in 1925 congress authorized a u s army corps of engineers study of columbia river this study was included in rivers and harbors act of which provided for studies on navigation power flood control and irrigation potential of rivers in army corps responded with first of 308 reports named after 1925 house document no 308 69th congress 1st session with help of washington s senators wesley jones and clarence dill congress ordered 600 000 in further studies to be carried out by army corps and federal power commission on columbia river basin and snake rivers u s army major john butler was responsible for upper columbia river and snake river and in 1932 his 1 000 page report was submitted to congress it recommended grand coulee dam and nine others on river including some in canada report stated electricity sales from grand coulee dam could pay for construction costs reclamation whose interest in dam was revitalized by report endorsed it although there was support for grand coulee dam others argued there was little need for more electricity in northwest and crops were in surplus army corps did not believe construction should be a federal project and saw low demand for electricity reclamation argued energy demand would rise by time dam was complete head of reclamation elwood mead stated he wanted dam built no matter cost president franklin d roosevelt who took office in march 1933 supported dam because of its irrigation potential and power it would provide but he was uneasy with its price tag for this reason he supported a low dam instead of high dam he provided in federal funding while washington state provided 377 000 in 1933 washington governor clarence martin set up columbia basin commission to oversee dam project and reclamation was selected to oversee construction construction low dam on july 16 1933 a crowd of 3 000 watched driving of first stake at low dam site and excavation soon began core drilling commenced that september while bureau of reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for dam it would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity though at a reduced capacity most importantly it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate plateau around grand coulee however dam s design provided for future raising and upgrading thumb east side cofferdam after west base was complete before and during construction workers and engineers experienced problems contracts for companies to construct various parts of dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them this forced companies to consolidate in addition native american graves had to be relocated and temporary fish ladders had to be constructed during construction additional problems included landslides and need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing construction on downstream grand coulee bridge began in and more considerable earth moving began in august excavation for dam s foundation required removal of of dirt and stone to reduce amount of trucking required in excavation a conveyor belt nearly long was built to further secure foundation workers drilled holes into granite and filled any fissures with grout creating a grout curtain at times excavated areas collapsed from overburden in order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation diameter pipes were inserted into mass and chilled with cold liquid from a refrigeration plant this froze earth and secured it so construction could continue final contract bidding for dam began 1934 in spokane and four bids were submitted one bid was from a lawyer with no financial backing another was from actress mae west which consisted of nothing more than a poem and promise to divert river of two serious bids lowest bid was from a consortium of three companies silas mason co from louisville kentucky walsh construction co of davenport iowa and new york and atkinson kier company of san francisco and san diego consortium was known as mwak and their bid was 29 339 301 almost 15 lower than option submitted by next bidder six companies inc which was building hoover dam at time cofferdams two large cofferdams were constructed for dam but they were parallel to river rather than straddling its width so drilling into canyon walls was not required by end of 1935 about 1 200 workers completed west and east cofferdams west cofferdam was long thick and was constructed above bedrock cofferdams allowed workers to dry portions of riverbed and begin constructing dam while water continued to flow down center of riverbed in once west foundation was complete portions of west cofferdam were dismantled allowing water to flow through part of dam s new foundation in mwak had begun constructing cofferdams above and below channel between east and west cofferdams by december entire columbia river was diverted over foundations constructed within east and west cofferdams on 1936 wenatchee daily world announced river was diverted and by early next year people were arriving in large numbers to see riverbed design change left thumb base of dam in 1938 on august 4 1934 president franklin d roosevelt visited construction site and was impressed by project and its purpose he spoke to workers and spectators closing with this statement i leave here today with feeling that this work is well undertaken that we are going ahead with a useful project and we are going to see it through for benefit of our country soon afterward reclamation was allowed to proceed with high dam plan but faced problems of transitioning design and negotiating an altered contract with mwak in for an additional mwak and six companies inc agreed to join together as consolidated builders inc and construct high dam six companies had just finished hoover dam and was nearing completion of parker dam new design chosen and approved by reclamation office in denver included several improvements one of which was irrigation pumping plant roosevelt envisioned dam would fit into his new deal under public works administration it would create jobs farming opportunities and would pay for itself in addition as part of a larger public effort roosevelt wanted to keep electricity prices low by limiting private ownership of utility companies which could charge high prices for energy many opposed a federal takeover of project including its most prominent supporters but washington state lacked resources to fully realize project in with help of roosevelt and a supreme court decision allowing acquisition of public land and indian reservations congress authorized funding for upgraded high dam under 1935 river and harbors act most significant legislative hurdle for dam was over first concrete pour and completion thumb dam after completion with water moving into spillway on december 6 1935 governor clarence martin presided over ceremonial first concrete pour during construction bulk concrete was delivered on site by rail cars where it was further processed by eight large mixers before being placed in form concrete was poured into columns by crane lifted buckets each supporting eight tons of concrete to cool concrete and facilitate curing about of piping was placed throughout hardening mass cold water from river was pumped into pipes reducing temperature within forms from to this caused dam to contract about in length resulting gaps were filled with grout until project began stretch of columbia river where dam was to rise was as yet making it difficult to move men and materials in grand coulee bridge a permanent highway bridge was opened after major delays caused by high water three additional and temporary bridges downstream had moved vehicles and workers along with sand and gravel for cement mixing in mwak completed lower dam and consolidated builders inc began constructing high dam west power house was completed in and about 5 500 workers were on site that year between 1940 and 1941 dam s eleven floodgates were installed on spillway and dam s first generator went into operation in reservoir was full and first water flowed over dam s spillway on 1942 while work was officially complete on 1943 last of original 18 generators did not operate until 1950 reservoir clearing thumb banks and smith felling last tree in reservoir zone in 1933 reclamation began efforts to purchase land behind dam as far as upstream for future reservoir zone reservoir known later as lake roosevelt flooded and reclamation acquired an additional around future shoreline within zone were eleven towns two railroads three state highways about one hundred and fifty miles of country roads four sawmills fourteen bridges four telegraph and telephone systems and many power lines and cemeteries all facilities had to be purchased or relocated and 3 000 residents were relocated anti speculation act was passed in 1937 limiting amount of land farmers could own to prevent inflated prices government appraised land and offered to purchase it from affected residents many refused to accept offers and reclamation filed condemnation suits members of colville confederated and spokane tribes who had settlements within reservoir zone were also resettled acquisition of indian lands for grand coulee dam act of 1940 allowed secretary of interior to acquire land on colville and spokane reservations eventually accounting for by 1942 all land had been purchased at market value a cost of that included relocation of farms bridges highways and railroads relocation reimbursement was not offered to property owners which was common until u s laws changed in 1958 in late 1938 works progress administration began clearing what would be of trees and other plants cut timber was floated downstream and sold to highest bidder lincoln lumber company which paid 2 25 per thousand board feet pace of clearing was accelerated in when it was declared a national defense project and last tree was felled on 1941 felling was done by reclamation supervising engineer frank a banks and state wpa administrator carl w smith during a ceremony 2 626 people living in five main camps along columbia worked on project when it was finished had been spent in labor labor and supporting infrastructure thumb workers installing a penstock section workers building dam received an average of an hour payroll for dam was among largest in nation workers were mainly pulled from grant lincoln douglas and okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in dorms and cookhouse around 8 000 people worked on project and frank a banks served as chief construction engineer bert a hall was chief inspector who would accept dam from contractors orin g patch served as chief of concrete construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died to prepare for construction housing for workers was needed along with four bridges downstream of dam site one of which grand coulee bridge exists today bureau of reclamation provided housing and located their administrative building at engineer s town which was directly downstream of construction site on west side of river opposite engineer s town mwak constructed mason city in 1934 mason city contained a hospital post office electricity and other amenities along with a population of 3 000 three bedroom houses in city were rented for 32 a month of two living areas engineer s city was considered to have better housing several other living areas formed around construction site in an area known as shack town which did not have reliable access to electricity and same amenities as other towns incorporated in 1935 city of grand coulee supported workers as well and is just west of dam on plateau mwak eventually sold mason city to reclamation in 1937 before its contract was completed in 1956 reclamation combined both mason city and engineer s town to form city of coulee dam it was incorporated as a city in irrigation pumps with onset of world war ii power generation was given priority over irrigation in 1943 congress authorized columbia basin project and bureau of reclamation began construction of irrigation facilities in 1948 directly to west and above grand coulee dam north dam was constructed this dam along with dry falls dam to south enclosed and created banks lake which covered northern of grand coulee additional dams such as pinto and o sullivan dams were constructed alongside siphons and canals creating a vast irrigation supply network called columbia basin project irrigation began between 1951 and 1953 as six of 12 pumps were installed and banks lake was filled expansion third powerplant thumb alt diefenbaker and a smiling bald man in a suit sit at a table two women and two men stand behind them canadian prime minister john diefenbaker seated left and us president dwight eisenhower at signing of columbia river treaty 1961 after world war ii growing demand for electricity sparked interest in constructing another power plant supported by grand coulee dam one obstacle to an additional power plant was great seasonality of columbia river s streamflow today flow is closely managed there is almost no seasonality historically about 75 of river s annual flow occurred between april and september during low flow periods river s discharge was between and while maximum spring runoff flows were around only nine out of dam s eighteen generators could run year round remaining nine operated for less than six months a year in 1952 congress authorized 125 000 for reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on third powerplant which was completed in 1953 and recommended two locations nine identical 108 mw generators were recommended but as matters stood they would be able to operate only in periods of high water further regulation of columbia s flows was necessary to make new power plant feasible it would require water storage and regulation projects in canada and a treaty to resolve many economic and political issues involved bureau of reclamation and army corps of engineers explored alternatives that would not depend on a treaty with canada such as raising level of flathead lake or pend oreille lake but both proposals faced strong local opposition columbia river treaty which had been discussed between u s and canada since 1944 was seen as answer efforts to build third powerplant were also influenced by competition with soviet union which had constructed power plants on volga river larger than grand coulee on 1964 columbia river treaty was ratified and included an agreement by canada to construct duncan keenleyside mica dams upstream and u s would build libby dam in montana shortly afterward washington senator henry m jackson who was influential in constructing new power plant announced reclamation would present project to congress for appropriation and funding to keep up with soviet competition and increase generating capacity it was determined generators could be upgraded to much larger designs with possibility of international companies bidding on project soviets who had just installed a 500 mw hydroelectric generator on yenisei river indicated their interest to avoid potential embarrassment of an international rival building a domestic power plant department of interior declined international bidding third powerplant was approved and president lyndon johnson signed its appropriation bill on 1966 left thumb one of new turbines in third powerplant between 1967 and 1974 dam was expanded to add third powerplant with architectural design by marcel breuer beginning in this involved demolishing northeast side of dam and building a new fore bay section excavation of of dirt and rock had been completed before new long section of dam was built addition made original dam almost a mile long original designs for powerhouse had twelve smaller units but were altered to incorporate six of largest generators available to supply them with water six diameter penstocks were installed of new turbines and generators three 600 mw units were built by westinghouse and three 700 mw units by general electric first new generator was commissioned in 1975 and final one in 1980 three 700 mw units were later upgraded to 805 mw by siemens pump generating plant thumb cross section of pump generating plant after power shortages in northwest during 1960s it was determined six remaining planned pumps be pump generators when energy demand is high pump generators can generate electricity with water from banks lake feeder canal adjacent to dam at a higher elevation by 1973 pump generating plant was completed and first two generators p g 7 and p g 8 were operational in 1983 two more generators went online and by final two were operational six pump generators added 314 mw to dam s capacity in pump generating plant was officially renamed john w keys iii pump generating power plant after john w keys iii u s bureau of reclamation s commissioner from 2001 to 2006 overhauls a major overhaul of third powerplant which contains generators numbered g19 through g24 began in and will be continuing for many years among projects to be completed before generators themselves can begin to be overhauled include replacing underground 500 kv oil filled cables for g19 g20 and g21 generators with overhead transmission lines started in new 236 mw transformers for g19 and g20 started in and several other projects planning design procurement and site preparation for 805 mw g22 g23 and g24 generator overhauls are scheduled to begin in 2011 with overhauls themselves to start in 2013 with g22 generator then g23 starting in 2014 and finally g24 starting in 2016 with planned completions in 2014 2016 and 2017 respectively generator overhauls for g19 g20 and g21 have not been scheduled as of 2010 operation and benefits thumb 300px map of columbia basin project green denotes land irrigated by project grand coulee dam near top right dam s primary goal irrigation was postponed as wartime need for electricity increased dam s powerhouse began production around time world war ii began and its electricity was vital to war effort dam powered aluminum smelters in longview and vancouver washington boeing factories in seattle and vancouver and portland s shipyards in 1943 its electricity was also used for plutonium production in richland washington at hanford site which was part of top secret manhattan project demand for power at that project was so great that in 1943 two generators originally intended for shasta dam were installed at grand coulee to hurry generator installation schedule irrigation water is pumped via pump generating plant s diameter pipes from lake roosevelt to a feeder canal from feeder canal water is transferred to banks lake which has an active storage of plant s twelve pumps can transfer up to to lake currently columbia basin project irrigates with a potential for over 60 different crops are grown within project and distributed throughout united states power grand coulee dam supports four different power houses containing 33 hydroelectric generators original left and right powerhouses contain 18 main generators and left has an additional three service generators for total installed capacity of 2 280 mw first generator was commissioned in 1941 and all 18 were operating by 1950 third powerplant contains a total of six main generators with a 4 215 mw installed capacity generators g 19 g 20 and g 21 in third powerplant have a 600 mw installed capacity but can operate at a maximum capacity of 690 mw which brings overall maximum capacity of dam s power facilities to 7 079 mw pump generating plant contains six pump generators with an installed capacity of 314 mw when pumping water into banks lake they consume 600 mw of electricity each generator is supplied with water by an individual penstock largest of these feed third powerplant and are in diameter and can supply up to dam s power facilities originally had an installed capacity of 1 974 mw but expansions and upgrades have increased generation to 6 809 mw installed 7 079 mw maximum grand coulee dam generates 21 twh of electricity annually this means dam generates about 2 397 mw of power on average which results in

downstream riverbanks and deteriorated face of dam and its flip bucket at base toe of spillway flood spurred columbia river treaty and its provisions for dams constructed upstream in canada which would regulate columbia s flow cost benefits bureau of reclamation in 1932 estimated cost of constructing grand coulee dam not including third powerplant to be 168 million its actual cost was 163 million in 1943 in dollars expenses to finish power stations and repair design flaws with dam throughout 1940s and 50s added another 107 million bringing total cost to 270 million in dollars about 33 over estimates third powerplant was estimated to cost in 1967 but higher construction costs and labor disputes drove project s final cost in 1973 to in dollars about 55 over estimates despite estimates being exceeded dam became an economic success particularly with third powerplant exhibiting a benefit cost ratio of 2 1 although reclamation has only irrigated about half of land predicted gross value of crop output in constant dollars had doubled from 1962 to 1992 largely due to different farming practices and crop choices bureau expects money earned from supplying power and irrigation water will pay off cost of construction by 2044 environmental and social consequences dam had severe negative consequences for local native american tribes whose traditional way of life revolved around salmon and original shrub steppe habitat of area because it lacks a fish ladder grand coulee dam permanently blocks fish migration removing over of natural spawning habitat by largely eliminating anadromous fish above okanogan river grand coulee dam also set stage for subsequent decision not to provide for fish passage at chief joseph dam built in 1953 chinook steelhead sockeye and coho salmon as well as other important species including lamprey are now unable to spawn in reaches of upper columbia basin extinction of spawning grounds upstream from dam has prevented spokane and other tribes from holding first salmon ceremony grand coulee dam flooded over 21 000 acres 85 km2 of prime bottom land where native americans had been living and hunting for thousands of years forcing relocation of settlements and graveyards office of indian affairs negotiated with united states bureau of reclamation on behalf of tribes who were concerned about flooding of their grave sites acquisition of indian lands for grand coulee dam 54 stat 703 act of june 20 1940 allowed secretary of interior to remove human remains to new native american grave sites burial relocation project started in september 1939 human remains were put into small containers and many artifacts were discovered but methods of collection destroyed archaeological evidence various estimates for number of relocated graves in 1939 include 915 graves reported by bureau of reclamation reclamation or 1 388 reported by howard t ball who supervised field work tribal leaders reported another 2 000 graves in 1940 but bureau of reclamation would not continue grave relocation and sites were soon covered by water town of washington home to around 250 colville indians was submerged and later relocated kettle falls once a primary native american fishing grounds was also inundated average catch of over 600 000 salmon per year was eliminated in one study army corps of engineers estimated annual loss was over fish in confederated tribes of colville reservation hosted a three day event called ceremony of tears marking end of fishing at kettle falls within a year after ceremony falls were inundated town of kettle falls washington was relocated columbia basin project has affected habitat ranges for species such as mule deer pygmy rabbits and burrowing owls resulting in decreased populations however it has created new habitats such as wetlands and riparian corridors environmental impact of dam effectively ended traditional way of life of native inhabitants government eventually compensated colville indians in 1990s with a lump settlement of approximately plus annual payments of approximately as of 2011 spokane tribe still seeks compensation currently through congressional bill h r 3097 thumb
