details that can be corroborated with military accounts of battle such as specific dates or details about troops her account changed throughout her life historian pierre berton noted that she never stated clearly how she learned of impending attack she told fitzgibbon that her husband had learned about it from an american officer but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard plans directly from american soldiers billeted in her home berton suggested that secord s informant could have been an american still residing in united states who would have been charged with treason

leave her home in case american patrols questioned her a number of historians have questioned secord s account w stewart wallace in his 1932 book story of laura secord a study in historical evidence concluded her story was mostly myth and that she played no significant role in outcome of battle of beaver dams historian george ingram contended in his 1965 book story of laura secord revisited that secord s debunking had been taken too far ruth mackenzie also burnished secord s reputation with laura secord legend and lady in 1971 question of secord s actual contribution to british success has been contested in early 1920s historians suggested that native scouts had already informed fitzgibbon of coming attack well before secord had arrived on 23 june historian ernest cruikshank wrote in 1895 that scarcely had mrs secord concluded her narrative when ducharme s scouts came in they had encountered advance guard of enemy later two testimonials were found which fitzgibbon wrote in 1820 and 1827 which supported secord s claim fitzgibbon asserted that laura secord had arrived on 22 june not 23 june and that in consequence of this information he had been able to intercept american
