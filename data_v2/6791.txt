silicon is a chemical element with symbol si and atomic number 14 it is a hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue grey metallic lustre and it is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor it is a member of group 14 in periodic table carbon is above it and germanium tin and lead are below it it is relatively unreactive because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen it was not until 1823 that jons jakob berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form its melting and boiling points of 1414 degc and 3265 degc respectively are second highest among all metalloids and nonmetals being only surpassed by boron silicon is eighth most common element in universe by mass but very rarely occurs as pure element in earth s crust it is most widely distributed in dusts sands planetoids and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide silica or silicates more than 90 of earth s crust is composed of silicate minerals making silicon second most abundant element in earth s crust about 28 by mass after oxygen most silicon is used commercially without being separated and often with little processing of natural minerals such use includes industrial construction with clays silica sand and stone silicates are used in portland cement for mortar and stucco and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways foundations and roads they are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain and in traditional quartz based soda lime glass and many other specialty glasses silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high strength ceramics silicon is basis of widely used synthetic polymers called silicones late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as silicon age also known as digital age or information age due to elemental silicon having a large impact on modern world economy relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics 10 is essential to metal oxide silicon mos transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as computers and cell phones for example most widely used silicon device is mosfet metal oxide silicon field effect transistor which has been manufactured in larger numbers than any other device in history free silicon is also used in steel refining aluminium casting and fine chemical industries often to make fumed silica silicon is an essential element in biology although only traces are required by animals however various sea sponges and microorganisms such as diatoms and radiolaria secrete skeletal structures made of silica silica is deposited in many plant tissues history due to abundance of silicon in earth s crust natural silicon based materials had been used for thousands of years silicon rock crystals were familiar to various ancient civilizations such as predynastic egyptians who used it for beads and small vases as well as ancient chinese glass containing silica was manufactured by egyptians since at least 1500 bc as well as by ancient phoenicians natural silicate compounds were also used in various types of mortar for construction of early human dwellings discovery thumb left upright jons jacob berzelius discovered silicon element in 1823 in 1787 antoine lavoisier suspected that silica might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element in his table of elements lavoisier listed five earths i e ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts salis salt in latin chaux calcium oxide magnesia magnesium oxide baryte barium sulfate alumina aluminium oxide and silice silica silicon dioxide about these elements lavoisier speculates we are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of metallic substances existing in nature as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses are incapable hitherto of being reduced to a metallic state and consequently being only presented to our observation under form of oxyds are confounded with earths it is extremely probable that which we have just now arranged with earths is in this situation for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies it is even possible that all substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds irreducible by any hitherto known process from p 218 of lavoisier with robert kerr trans elements of chemistry 4th ed edinburgh scotland william creech 1799 original passage appears in lavoisier traite de chimie paris france 1789 vol 1 p 174 but chemical affinity of silicon for oxygen is high enough that he had no means to reduce oxide and isolate element after an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808 sir humphry davy proposed name silicium for silicon from latin for flint and

gay lussac and thenard are thought to have prepared impure amorphous silicon in 1811 through heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride but they did not purify and characterize product nor identify it as a new element gay lussac and thenard recherches physico chimiques paris france 1811 vol 1 pp 313 314 vol 2 pp 55 65 silicon was given its present name in 1817 by scottish chemist thomas thomson he retained part of davy s name but added on because he believed that silicon was a nonmetal similar to boron and carbon thomas thomson a system of chemistry in four volumes 5th ed london baldwin cradock and joy 1817 vol 1 from p 252 base of silica has been usually considered as a metal and called silicium but as there is not smallest evidence for its metallic nature and as it bears a close resemblance to boron and carbon it is better to class it along with these bodies and to give it name of silicon in 1823 jons jacob berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately same method as gay lussac reducing potassium fluorosilicate with molten potassium metal but purifying product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it see berzelius announced his

been prepared long before in 1771 by carl wilhelm scheele by dissolving silica in hydrofluoric acid silicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until 31 years later by deville in 1854 deville was trying to prepare aluminium metal from aluminium chloride that was heavily contaminated with silicon chloride deville used two methods to prepare aluminium heating aluminium chloride with sodium metal in an inert atmosphere of hydrogen and melting aluminum chloride with sodium chloride and then electrolyzing mixture in both cases pure silicon was produced silicon dissolved in molten aluminium but crystallized upon cooling dissolving crude aluminum in hydrochloric acid revealed flakes of crystallized silicon see henri sainte claire deville 1854 note sur deux de preparation de l aluminium et sur une nouvelle forme du silicium note on two procedures for preparation of aluminium and on a new form of silicon comptes rendus 39 321 326 subsequently deville obtained crystalline silicon by heating chloride or fluoride of silicon with sodium metal isolating amorphous silicon then melting amorphous form with salt and heating mixture until most of salt evaporated see h sainte

silicon in 1854 silicon history nautilus fis uc pt retrieved on 2011 08 07 later more cost effective methods have been developed to isolate several allotrope forms most recent being in 2010 meanwhile research on chemistry of silicon continued friedrich wohler discovered first volatile hydrides of silicon synthesising trichlorosilane in 1857 and silane itself in 1858 but a detailed investigation of silanes was only carried out in early 20th century by alfred stock despite early speculation on matter dating as far back as beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in 1830s greenwood and earnshaw pp 337 340 similarly first organosilicon compound was synthesised by charles friedel and james crafts in 1863 but detailed characterisation of organosilicon chemistry was only done in early 20th century by frederic kipping starting in 1920s work of william lawrence bragg on x ray crystallography successfully elucidated compositions of silicates which had previously been known from analytical chemistry but had not yet been understood together with linus pauling s development of crystal chemistry and victor goldschmidt s development of geochemistry middle of 20th century saw development of chemistry and industrial use of and growing use of silicone polymers elastomers and resins in late 20th century complexity of crystal chemistry of silicides was mapped along with solid state chemistry of doped semiconductors silicon semiconductors thumb left 175px mohamed m atalla s development of silicon surface passivation in 1957 and metal oxide silicon mos transistor in 1959 led to silicon revolution first semiconductor devices did not use silicon but used galena including german physicist ferdinand braun s crystal detector in 1874 and bengali physicist jagadish chandra bose s radio crystal detector in 1901 first silicon semiconductor device was a silicon radio crystal detector developed by american engineer greenleaf whittier pickard in 1906 in 1940 russell ohl discovered p n junction and photovoltaic effects in silicon in 1941 techniques for producing high purity germanium and silicon crystals were developed for radar microwave detectors during world war ii in 1947 physicist william shockley theorized a field effect amplifier made from germanium and silicon but he failed to build a working device before eventually working with germanium instead first working transistor was a point contact transistor built by john bardeen and walter brattain later that year while working under shockley in 1954 physical chemist morris tanenbaum fabricated first silicon junction transistor at bell labs in 1955 carl frosch and lincoln derick at bell labs accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide sio2 could be grown on silicon and they later proposed this could mask silicon surfaces during diffusion processes in 1958 in early years of semiconductor industry up until late 1950s germanium was dominant semiconductor material for transistors and other semiconductor devices rather than silicon germanium was initially considered more effective semiconductor material as it was able to demonstrate better performance due to higher carrier mobility relative lack of performance in early silicon semiconductors was due to electrical conductivity being limited by unstable quantum surface states where electrons are trapped at surface due to dangling bonds that occur because unsaturated bonds are present at surface this prevented electricity from reliably penetrating surface to reach semiconducting silicon layer a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology came with work of egyptian engineer mohamed m atalla who developed process of surface passivation by thermal oxidation at bell labs in late 1950s he discovered that formation of a thermally grown silicon dioxide layer greatly reduced concentration of electronic states at silicon surface and that silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces atalla first published his findings in bell memos during 1957 and then demonstrated it in 1958 this was first demonstration to show that high quality silicon dioxide insulator films could be grown thermally on silicon surface to protect underlying silicon p n junction diodes and transistors atalla s surface passivation process enabled silicon to surpass conductivity and performance of germanium and led to silicon replacing germanium as dominant semiconductor material paving way for silicon revolution atalla s surface passivation process is considered most important advance in silicon semiconductor technology paving way for mass production of silicon semiconductor devices atalla s pioneering work on surface passivation and thermal oxidation culminated in his invention of mosfet metal oxide silicon field effect transistor along with his korean colleague dawon kahng in 1959 mosfet was first mass produced silicon transistor and is credited with starting silicon revolution in addition atalla s surface passivation process was basis for two other important silicon semiconductor inventions at fairchild semiconductor swiss engineer jean s planar technology in 1958 and american physicist robert noyce s silicon integrated circuit chip in 1959 this in turn led to atalla in 1960 proposing concept of mos integrated circuit a silicon chip built from mosfets which later became standard semiconductor device fabrication process for integrated circuits by mid 1960s atalla s process for oxidized silicon surfaces was used to fabricate virtually all integrated circuits and silicon devices surface passivation by thermal oxidation remains a key feature of silicon semiconductor technology silicon age thumb left mosfet metal oxide silicon field effect transistor also known as mos transistor is key component of silicon age it was invented by mohamed m atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs in 1959 silicon age refers to late 20th century to early 21st century this is due to silicon being dominant material of silicon age also known as digital age or information age similar to how stone age bronze age and iron age were defined by dominant materials during their respective ages of civilization key component or workhorse of silicon revolution also known as digital revolution or information revolution is silicon mosfet mos transistor it was first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass produced for a wide range of uses beginning of silicon revolution has been dated to 1960 when mohamed m atalla and dawon kahng first demonstrated their invention of mosfet since then mass production of silicon mosfets and mos integrated circuit chips along with continuous mosfet scaling miniaturization at an exponential pace as predicted by moore s law has led to revolutionary changes in technology economy culture and thinking mosfet has since become most widely manufactured device in history with an estimated total of mosfets having been manufactured between 1960 and 2018 because silicon is an important element in high technology semiconductor devices many places in world bear its name for example santa clara valley in california acquired nickname silicon valley as element is base material in semiconductor industry there since then many other places have been dubbed similarly including silicon forest in oregon silicon hills in austin texas silicon

cubic crystal structure thumb covalent bonding in silicon a silicon atom has fourteen electrons in ground state they are arranged in electron configuration ne of these four are valence electrons occupying 3s orbital and two of 3p orbitals like other members of its group lighter carbon and heavier germanium tin and lead it has same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals hence it can complete its octet and obtain stable noble gas configuration of argon by forming sp3 hybrid orbitals forming tetrahedral derivatives where central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of four atoms it is bonded to king pp xiii xviii first four ionisation energies of silicon are 786 3 1576 5 3228 3 and 4 kj mol respectively these figures are high enough to preclude possibility of simple cationic chemistry for element following periodic trends its single bond covalent radius of 117 6 pm is intermediate between those of carbon 77 2 pm and germanium 122 3 pm hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40 pm although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given lack of a simple si4 cation in reality greenwood and earnshaw p 372 at standard temperature and pressure silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish grey metallic lustre as typical for semiconductors its resistivity drops as temperature rises this arises because silicon has a small energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels valence band and lowest unoccupied ones conduction band fermi level is about halfway between valence and conduction bands and is energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature however doping silicon with a such as phosphorus arsenic or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into conduction band either thermally or creating an n type semiconductor similarly doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron aluminium or gallium results in introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from filled valence band creating a p type semiconductor joining n type silicon to p type silicon creates a p n junction with a common fermi level electrons flow from n to p while holes flow from p to n creating a voltage drop this p n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than other a transistor is an n p n junction with a thin layer of weakly p type silicon between two n type regions emitter through a small forward voltage and collector through a large reverse voltage allows transistor to act as a triode amplifier silicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions specifically in a diamond cubic lattice it thus has a high melting point of 1414 degc as a lot of energy is required to break strong covalent bonds and melt solid it is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure culminating in a hexagonal close packed allotrope at about 40 gigapascals known as si vii standard modification being si i silicon boils at 3265 degc this while high is still lower than temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes 3642 degc and silicon similarly has a lower heat of than carbon consistent with fact that si si bond is weaker than c c bond isotopes naturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable isotopes 28si 92 23 29si 4 67 and 3 10 out of these only 29si is of use in nmr and epr spectroscopy as it is only one with a nuclear spin i greenwood and earnshaw p 330 331 all three are produced in stars through oxygen burning process with 28si being made as part of alpha process and hence most abundant fusion of 28si with alpha particles by photodisintegration rearrangement in stars is known as silicon burning process it is last stage of stellar nucleosynthesis before rapid collapse and violent explosion of star in question in a type ii supernova twenty radioisotopes have been characterized two stablest being 32si with a half life of about 150 years and 31si with a half life of 2 62 hours all remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than seven seconds and majority of these have half lives that are less than one tenth of a second silicon has one known nuclear isomer with a half life less than 210 nanoseconds 32si undergoes low energy beta decay to and then stable 32s 31si may be produced by neutron activation of natural silicon and is thus useful for quantitative analysis it can be easily detected by its characteristic beta decay to stable in which emitted electron carries up to 1 48 mev of energy known isotopes of silicon range in mass number from 22 to 44 most common decay mode of isotopes with mass numbers lower than three stable isotopes is inverse beta decay primarily forming aluminium isotopes 13 protons as decay products most common decay mode for heavier unstable isotopes is beta decay primarily forming phosphorus isotopes 15 protons as decay products chemistry and compounds c x and si x bond energies kj mol c si h f cl br i o n 368 360 435 453 351 293 216 360 305 360 340 393 565 381 310 234 452 322 crystalline bulk silicon is rather inert but becomes more reactive at high temperatures like its neighbour aluminium silicon forms a thin continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide sio2 that protects metal from oxidation thus silicon does not measurably react with air below 900 degc but formation of vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950 degc and 1160 degc and when 1400 degc is reached atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give nitrides sin and si3n4 silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600 degc and gaseous phosphorus at 1000 degc this oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with halogens fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature chlorine does so at about 300 degc and bromine and iodine at about 500 degc silicon does not react with most aqueous acids but is oxidised and by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates at high temperatures silicon also reacts with alkyl halides this reaction may be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers upon melting silicon becomes extremely reactive alloying with most metals to form silicides and reducing most metal oxides because heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large as a result containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4 5 and 6 borides greenwood and earnshaw pp 331 335 tetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry however 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with 3s subshell as a result chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon and thus octahedral coordination is also significant for example electronegativity of silicon 1 90 is much less than that of carbon 2 55 because valence electrons of silicon are further from nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from nucleus poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward catenation formation of si si bonds for silicon than for carbon due to concomitant weakening of si si bond compared to c c bond king pp 43 44 average si si bond energy is approximately 226 kj mol compared to a value of 356 kj mol for c c bond greenwood and earnshaw p 374 this results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts an example of double bond rule on other hand presence of 3d orbitals in valence shell of silicon suggests possibility of as seen in five and six coordinate derivatives of silicon such as and lastly because of increasing energy gap between valence s and p orbitals as group is descended divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon this lowering of main oxidation state in tandem with increasing atomic radii results in an increase of metallic character down group silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior particularly in behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases though this takes some effort and is hence often referred to as a metalloid rather than a nonmetal however metallicity does not become clear in group 14 until germanium and dominant until tin with growing importance of lower 2 oxidation state silicon shows clear differences from carbon for example organic chemistry has very few analogies with silicon chemistry while silicate minerals have a structural complexity unseen in greenwood and earnshaw pp 328 329 silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon and this resemblance is enhanced by d block contraction resulting in size of germanium atom being much closer to that of silicon atom than periodic trends would predict nevertheless there are still some differences because of growing importance of divalent state in germanium compared to silicon which result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon additionally lower ge o bond strength compared to si o bond strength results in absence of polymers that would be analogous to silicone polymers silicides thumb right upright 1 8 phase diagram of fe si system many metal silicides are known most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to valence their bonding ranges from metallic to ionic and covalent some known stoichiometries are msi and they are structurally more similar to borides than carbides in keeping with diagonal relationship between boron and silicon although larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between heats of formation of silicides are usually similar to those of borides and carbides of same elements but they usually melt at lower temperatures greenwood and earnshaw pp 335 337 silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1 10 with exception of beryllium in particular uranium and transition metals of groups 4 10 show widest range of stoichiometries except for copper metals in groups 11 15 do not form silicides instead most form eutectic mixtures although heaviest post transition metals mercury thallium lead and bismuth are completely immiscible with liquid silicon usually silicides are prepared by direct reaction of elements for example alkali metals and alkaline earth metals react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides nevertheless even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable and most of these compounds are semiconductors for example alkali metal silicides contain pyramidal silicon in anion isoelectronic with white phosphorus p4 king pp 45 47 metal rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms e g with increasing silicon content catenation increases resulting in isolated clusters of two e g or four silicon atoms e g k 4 si4 4 at first followed by chains e g casi layers e g casi2 or three dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space e g a thsi2 as silicon content rises even higher silicides of group 1 and 2 metals usually are more reactive than transition metal silicides latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents except for hydrofluoric acid however they do react with much more aggressive reagents such as liquid potassium hydroxide or gaseous fluorine or chlorine when red hot pre transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids usually producing hydrogen or silanes 3 h2o 3 h2 2 h2so4 2 sih4 products often vary with stoichiometry of silicide reactant for example is polar and non conducting and has anti pbcl2 structure with single isolated silicon atoms and reacts with water to produce calcium hydroxide hydrated silicon dioxide and hydrogen gas casi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric sih2 while casi2 with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry silanes speculation on silicon hydride chemistry started in 1830s contemporary with development of synthetic organic chemistry silane itself as well as trichlorosilane were first synthesised by friedrich wohler and heinrich buff in 1857 by reacting aluminium silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid and characterised as sih4 and by charles friedel and albert in 1867 disilane followed in 1902 when it was first made by henri moissan and samuel smiles by protonolysis of magnesium silicides further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of great reactivity and thermal instability of silanes it was then that alfred stock began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new vacuum techniques as they were found as contaminants of his focus boron hydrides names silanes and boranes are his based on analogy with alkanes e alfred stock and renaissance of inorganic chemistry pure appl chem vol 49 1977 pp 691 700 j w mellor a comprehensive treatise on inorganic and theoretical chemistry vol vi longman green and co 1947 pp 223 227 moissan and smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used although yield is lowered by hydrolysis of products that occurs simultaneously so that preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in etheric solutions at low temperatures direct reaction of hx or rx with silicon possibly with a catalyst such as copper is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes silanes comprise a homologous series of silicon hydrides with a general formula of 2 they are all strong reducing agents unbranched and branched chains are known up to n 8 and cycles and are also known first two silane and disilane are colourless gases heavier members of series are volatile liquids all silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air they become less thermally stable with room temperature so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature although disilane does not decompose very quickly only 2 5 of a sample decomposes after passage of eight months they decompose to form polymeric hydride and hydrogen gas w w porterfield inorganic chemistry a unified approach 2nd ed academic press 1993 p 219 inorganic chemistry holleman wiberg john wiley sons 2001 p 844 as expected from difference in atomic weight silanes are less volatile than corresponding alkanes and boranes but more so than corresponding they are much more reactive than corresponding alkanes because of larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitating nucleophilic attack at silicon greater polarity of si h bond compared to c h bond and ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower reaction s activation energy silane pyrolysis gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen indeed silicon is commercially produced by pyrolysis of silane while thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by breaking of a c h or c c bond and formation of radical intermediates polysilanes decompose by eliminating sih2 or as activation energy of this process 210 kj mol is much less than si si and si h bond energies while pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide if reaction is carried out in methanol controlled results in products sih2 ome 2 sih ome 3 and si ome 4 si h bond also adds to alkenes a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of silane involved at 450 degc silane participates in an addition reaction with acetone as well as a ring opening reaction with ethylene oxide direct reaction of silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature but reaction of silane with bromine at 80 degc is controlled and yields and may be formed by reacting silane with appropriate hydrogen halide with an catalyst or by reacting silane with a solid silver halide in a heated flow reactor sih4 2 agcl sih3cl hcl 2 ag among derivatives of silane sih3i and potassium are very useful synthetic intermediates in production of more complicated silicon containing compounds latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing k cations and anions in nacl structure and is made by reduction of silane by potassium metal king p 47 additionally reactive hypervalent species is also known with suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes they have surprisingly high electric conductivities arising from sigma delocalisation of electrons in chain halides silicon and silicon carbide readily react with all four stable halogens forming colourless reactive and volatile silicon tetrahalides greenwood and earnshaw pp 340 2 silicon tetrafluoride also may be made by fluorinating other silicon halides and is produced by attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass heating two different tetrahalides together also produces a random mixture of mixed halides which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight though there are many exceptions for example melting and boiling points drop as one passes from through to shift from elements in group 13 and earlier to group 14 elements is illustrated by change from an infinite ionic structure in aluminium fluoride to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules as dictated by lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon stoichiometry 4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity and smaller size of silicon atom compared to aluminium atom silicon tetrachloride is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to production of pure silicon silicon dioxide and some silicon esters silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water unlike carbon tetrahalides again because of larger size of silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and ability of silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks king p 48 reaction of silicon fluoride with excess hydrofluoric acid produces octahedral hexafluorosilicate anion analogous to silanes halopolysilanes 2 also are known while catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in hydrogen compounds rather than halides opposite is true for silicon so that halopolysilanes are known up to at least and a suggested explanation for this phenomenon is compensation for electron loss of silicon to more electronegative halogen atoms by pi backbonding from filled pp orbitals on halogen atoms to empty dp orbitals on silicon this is similar to situation of carbon monoxide in metal carbonyl complexes and explains their stability these halopolysilanes may be produced by comproportionation of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes being a useful catalyst for this reaction silica silicon dioxide sio2 also known as silica is one of best studied compounds second only to water twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known most common being a quartz a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone it also is known to occur in a pure form as rock crystal impure forms are known as rose quartz smoky quartz morion amethyst and some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known such as chalcedony carnelian agate onyx jasper and flint other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite as well as much less common coesite and stishovite biologically generated forms are also known as and diatomaceous earth vitreous silicon dioxide is known as and obsidian and rarely as lechatelierite some synthetic forms are known as and w silica opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide greenwood and earnshaw pp 342 347 most crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of sio4 tetrahedra with si at center connected at their corners with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms in thermodynamically stable room temperature form a quartz these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different si o distances 159 7 and 161 7 pm with a si o si angle of 144deg these helices can be either left or right handed so that individual a quartz crystals are optically active at 537 degc this transforms quickly and reversibly into similar b quartz with a change of si o si angle to 155deg but a retention of handedness further heating to 867 degc results in another reversible phase transition to b tridymite in which some si o bonds are broken to allow for arrangement of sio4 tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure this transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature when cooled to about 120 degc it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to a tridymite similarly to transition from a quartz to b quartz b tridymite slowly transforms to cubic b cristobalite at about 1470 degc which once again exists below this transition temperature and transforms at 200 280 degc to a cristobalite via small atomic displacements b cristobalite melts at 1713 degc freezing of silica from melt is quite slow and vitrification or formation of a glass is likely to occur instead in vitreous silica sio4 tetrahedra remain corner connected but symmetry and periodicity of crystalline forms are lost because of slow conversions between these three forms it is possible upon rapid heating to melt b quartz 1550 degc or b tridymite 1703 degc silica boils at approximately 2800 degc other high pressure forms of silica are known such as coesite and stishovite these are known in nature formed under shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve crystal structure similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes forming glassy lechatelierite w silica is an unstable low density form involving sio4 tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide sis2 and silicon it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water thumb condensed polysilicic acid silica is rather inert chemically it is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid however it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates to give metal silicates among elements it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride hydrogen and carbon also react but require temperatures over 1000 degc to do so silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and metalloid oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in glass and ceramic industries above all but also have many other uses for example sodium silicate is often used in detergents due to its buffering and properties silicic acids adding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800 degc due to breaking of structure by replacing si o si linkages with terminating si oh groups increasing water concentration results in formation of hydrated silica gels and colloidal silica many hydrates and silicic acids exist in most dilute of aqueous solutions but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following formula oh 4 2x n similar to behaviour of boron aluminium and iron among other elements hence although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions such as acid si oh 4 and acid sio oh 2 none of these are likely to exist in solid state silicate minerals typical coordination of metal cations in silicates ionic radii in pm cn 4 lii 59

reflected in oxygen silicon and aluminium being three most common elements in crust in that order measured by mass silicon makes up 27 7 of earth s crust pure silicon crystals are very rarely found in nature but notable exceptions are crystals as large as to 0 3 mm across found during sampling gases from kudriavy volcano on iturup one of kuril islands silicate and aluminosilicate minerals have many different structures and varying stoichiometry but they may be classified following some general principles tetrahedral sio4 units are common to almost all these compounds either as discrete structures or combined into larger units by sharing of corner oxygen atoms these may be divided into neso silicates discrete sio4 units sharing no oxygen atoms soro silicates discrete units sharing one cyclo silicates closed ring structures and ino silicates continuous chain or ribbon structures both sharing two silicates continuous sheets sharing three and silicates continuous three dimensional frameworks sharing four lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close packed or close to it with charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size greenwood and earnshaw pp 347 359 m be mg mn fe zn and zrsio4 are neso silicates be2sio4 phenacite is unusual as both beii and siiv occupy tetrahedral four coordinated sites other divalent cations instead occupy six coordinated octahedral sites and often replace each other as in olivine mg fe mn 2sio4 zircon zrsio4 demands eight coordination of cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius 84 pm also significant are garnets mm sio in which divalent cations e g ca mg fe are eight coordinated and trivalent ones are six coordinated e g al cr fe regular coordination is not always present for example it is not found in which mixes six and eight coordinate sites for caii soro silicates involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units are quite rare metasilicates involving cyclic n 2n units of corner abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known chain metasilicates sio form by corner sharing of an indefinite chain of linked sio4 tetrahedra many differences arise due to differing repeat distances of conformation across line of tetrahedra a repeat distance of two is most common as in most pyroxene minerals but repeat distances of one three four five six seven nine and twelve are also known these chains may then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons as in asbestos minerals involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings thumb right a typical zeolite structure layer silicates such as clay minerals and micas are very common and often are formed by horizontal cross linking of chains or planar condensation of smaller units an example is kaolinite oh in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common so that for example tetrahedral siiv may be replaced by aliii octahedral aliii by mgii and oh by f three dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex they may be conceived of as starting from sio2 structure but having replaced up to one half of siiv atoms with aliii they require more cations to be included in structure to balance charge examples include feldspars most abundant minerals on earth zeolites and ultramarines many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of ternary system their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting aliii to undergo six coordination rather than four coordination and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for discontinuity which would imply that crust and mantle have same chemical composition but different lattices although this is not a universally held view zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks truncated being most common but other polyhedra also are known as zeolite cavities allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as cl and but are otherwise similar to feldspars other inorganic compounds silicon disulfide sis2 is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100 degc sublimation of resulting compound in nitrogen results in white flexible long fibers reminiscent of asbestos with a structure similar to w silica this melts at 1090 degc and sublimes at 1250 degc at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite however sis2 lacks variety of structures of sio2 and quickly to silica and hydrogen sulfide it is also quickly and completely by liquid ammonia as follows to form an greenwood and earnshaw pp 359 361 sis2 4 nh3 si nh 2 2 it reacts with sulfides of sodium magnesium aluminium and iron to form metal reaction with ethanol results in si 4 and hydrogen sulfide is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film like forms of silica reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon such as s 3 cyclic m s and crystalline 4 despite double bond rule stable rr si s have been made thanks to stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an amine group silicon nitride si3n4 may be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300 degc but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500 degc it would make a promising ceramic if not for difficulty of working with and sintering it chemically it is near totally inert and even above 1000 degc it keeps its strength shape and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion it is very hard 9 on mohs hardness scale dissociates only at 1900 degc at 1 atm and is quite dense density 3 185 g cm3 because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite be2sio4 a similar refractory material is formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450 degc in an argon stream containing 5 nitrogen gas involving 4 coordinate silicon and 3 coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non linear si o si linkages to each other reacting silyl halides with ammonia or derivatives in gaseous phase or in solution produces various volatile which are silicon analogues of amines 3 sih3cl 4 nh3 n sih3 3 3 nh4cl 2 4 sih3i 5 n2h4 sih3 sih3 2 4 many such compounds have been prepared only known restriction being that nitrogen is always tertiary and species containing sih nh group are unstable at room temperature stoichiometry around nitrogen atom in compounds such as n sih3 planar which has been attributed to a pp dp interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty dp orbital on silicon similarly are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues tertiary amines although substitution of some sih3 groups by ch3 groups mitigates this weakness for example n sih3 3 does not form an adduct with bh3 at all while men sih3 2 and form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming some silicon analogues of with a si n double bond are known first found was n which was discovered in 1986 thumb right silicon carbide silicon carbide sic was first made by edward goodrich acheson in 1891 who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between diamond an allotrope of carbon and corundum aluminium oxide he soon founded a company to manufacture it and today about one million tonnes are produced each year greenwood and earnshaw p 334 silicon carbide exists in about 250 crystalline forms polymorphism of sic is characterized by a large family of similar crystalline structures called they are variations of same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in third thus they can be viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence it is made industrially by reduction of quartz sand with excess coke or anthracite at 2000 2500 degc in an electric furnace sio2 2 c si 2 co si c sic it is most thermally stable binary silicon compound only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around 2700 degc it is resistant to most aqueous acids phosphoric acid being an exception it forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide on surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000 degc removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas which forms sicl4 and carbon at 100 degc and sicl4 and at 1000 degc it is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory material as it is chemically stable and very strong and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge it is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped in its diamond like behavior it serves as an illustration of chemical similarity between carbon and silicon organosilicon compounds upright 1 8 thumb right a reaction in which si h is added to an unsaturated substrate because si c bond is close in strength to c c bond organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable for example may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428 degc and so may its substituted derivatives and which boil at 378 degc and 305 degc respectively furthermore since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry for example in propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds greenwood and earnshaw pp 361 366 however significant differences also arise since silicon is more electropositive than carbon bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon and vice versa thus si f bond is significantly stronger than even c f bond and is one of strongest single bonds while si h bond is much weaker than c h bond and is readily broken furthermore ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues for example nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by sn2 or processes but instead goes through a negatively charged true intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom this works for silicon unlike for carbon because long si c bonds reduce steric hindrance and d orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack unlike for example a c o s antibonding orbital nevertheless despite these differences mechanism is still often called sn2 at silicon for simplicity clayden pp 668 77 one of most useful silicon containing groups is trimethylsilyl me3si si c bond connecting it to rest of molecule is reasonably strong allowing it to remain while rest of molecule undergoes reactions but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed for example by fluoride ion which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds it may be compared to acidic protons while is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases both removals usually promote elimination as a general rule while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds those based on nonmetals far down on periodic table e g sulfur selenium or iodine or even both silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen fluorine or chlorine for example react at carbon in but at oxygen in silyl chlorides and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile product of reaction is not as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy because is strongly nucleophilic and attacks original molecule to yield silyl ether me3si 2o conversely while sn2 reaction is mostly unaffected by presence of a partial positive charge d at carbon analogous sn2 reaction at silicon is so affected thus for example silyl are so electrophilic that they react 108 to 109 times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen containing nucleophiles trimethylsilyl triflate is in particular a very good lewis acid and is used to convert carbonyl compounds to and silyl enol ethers reacting them together analogously to aldol reaction si c bonds are commonly formed in three ways in laboratory preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium grignard or organoaluminium reagents or by catalytic addition of si h across c c double bonds second route has drawback of not being applicable to most important silanes methyl and phenyl silanes organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10 by weight metallic copper as a catalyst standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners readily undergoing hydrolysis and condensation to form cyclic or linear polymers silicone polymers thumb right structure of principal component of silicones word silicone was first used by frederic kipping in 1901 he invented word to illustrate similarity of chemical formulae between ph2sio and ph2co although he also stressed lack of chemical resemblance due to polymeric structure of ph2sio which is not shared by ph2co silicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates in which methyl groups of silicones correspond to isoelectronic o of silicates they are quite stable to extreme temperatures oxidation and water and have useful dielectric and properties furthermore they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering and are inert physiologically they are fairly unreactive but do react with concentrated solutions bearing hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents and occasionally may even be used as mild reagents for selective syntheses for example me3si 2o is valuable for preparation of derivatives of molybdenum and tungsten oxyhalides converting a tungsten suspension in solution quantitatively to in under an hour at room temperature and then to yellow at 100 degc in light petroleum at a yield of 95 overnight occurrence thumb upright olivine in universe silicon is seventh most abundant element coming after hydrogen helium carbon nitrogen oxygen and neon these abundances are not replicated well on earth due to substantial separation of elements taking place during formation of solar system silicon makes up 27 2 of earth s crust by weight second only to oxygen at 45 5 with which it always is associated in nature further fractionation took place in formation of earth by planetary differentiation earth s core which makes up 31 5 of mass of earth has approximate composition mantle makes up 68 1 of earth s mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates an example being olivine mg fe 2sio4 while lighter siliceous minerals such as aluminosilicates rise to surface and form crust making up 0 4 of earth s mass greenwood and earnshaw pp 329 330 crystallisation of igneous rocks from magma depends on a number of factors among them are chemical composition of magma cooling rate and some properties of individual minerals to be formed such as lattice energy melting point and complexity of their crystal structure as magma is cooled olivine appears first followed by pyroxene amphibole biotite mica feldspar muscovite mica quartz zeolites and finally hydrothermal minerals this sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling and introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides many metals may substitute for silicon after these igneous rocks undergo weathering transport and deposition sedimentary rocks like clay shale and sandstone are formed metamorphism also may occur at high temperatures and pressures creating an even vaster variety of minerals production silicon of 96 99 purity is made by reducing quartzite or sand with highly pure coke reduction is carried out in an electric arc furnace with an excess of sio2 used to stop silicon carbide sic from accumulating sio2 2 c si 2 co 2 sic sio2 3 si 2 co thumb upright 0 9 ferrosilicon alloy this reaction known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide usually is conducted in presence of scrap iron with low amounts of phosphorus and sulfur producing ferrosilicon ferrosilicon an iron silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron accounts for about 80 of world s production of elemental silicon with china leading supplier of elemental silicon providing 4 6 million tonnes or 2 3 of world output of silicon most of it in form of ferrosilicon it is followed by russia 610 000 t norway 330 000 t brazil 240 000 t and united states 170 000 t ferrosilicon is primarily used by iron and steel industry see below with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants another reaction sometimes used is reduction of silicon dioxide as follows zulehner et al p 574 3 sio2 4 al 3 si 2 al2o3 leaching powdered 96 97 pure silicon with water results in 98 5 pure silicon which is used in chemical industry however even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications and this is produced from reduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane former is made by scrap silicon and latter is a byproduct of silicone production these compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated fractional distillation followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure zinc metal as reducing agent spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals before being purified by zone refining other routes use thermal decomposition of silane or another process used is reduction of sodium hexafluorosilicate a common waste product of phosphate fertilizer industry by metallic sodium this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material transistor production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 1010 and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 1012 are needed and attained applications compounds most silicon is used industrially without being purified and indeed often with comparatively little processing from its natural form more than 90 of earth s crust is composed of silicate minerals which are compounds of silicon and oxygen often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance charge many of these have direct commercial uses such as clays silica sand and most kinds of building stone thus vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds either as silicate minerals or silica crude silicon dioxide silicates are used in making portland cement made mostly of calcium silicates which is used in building mortar and modern stucco but more importantly combined with silica sand and gravel usually containing silicate minerals such as granite to make concrete that is basis of most of very largest industrial building projects of modern world greenwood and earnshaw p 356 silica is used to make fire brick a type of ceramic silicate minerals are also in whiteware ceramics an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay minerals natural aluminium phyllosilicates an example is porcelain which is based on silicate mineral kaolinite traditional glass silica based soda lime glass also functions in many of same ways and also is used for windows and containers in addition specialty silica based glass fibers are used for optical fiber as well as to produce fiberglass for structural support and glass wool for thermal insulation silicones often are used in waterproofing treatments molding compounds mold release agents mechanical seals high temperature greases and waxes and caulking compounds silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants contact lenses explosives and pyrotechnics silly putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil other silicon compounds function as high technology abrasives and new high strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide silicon is a component of some superalloys alloys elemental silicon is added to molten cast iron as ferrosilicon or alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent formation of where exposed to outside air presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen so that steel carbon content which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel can be more closely controlled ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of steel industry and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure it accounts for 80 of world s use of free silicon silicon is an important constituent of electrical steel modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron metallurgical grade silicon is silicon of 95 99 purity about 55 of world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium silicon alloys alloys for aluminium part casts mainly for use in automotive industry silicon s importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount 12 of silicon in aluminium forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little thermal contraction this greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity silicon also significantly improves hardness and thus wear resistance of aluminium d 2009 aluminum cast alloys enabling tools for improved performance north american die casting association wheeling illinois electronics thumb upright silicon wafer with mirror finish most elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy and only approximately 20 is refined to metallurgical grade purity a total of 1 3 1 5 million metric tons year an estimated 15 of world production of metallurgical grade silicon is

in electronics and in some high cost and high efficiency photovoltaic applications zulehner et al p 590 pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor which means that unlike metals it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat silicon s electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures pure silicon has too low a conductivity i e too high a resistivity to be used as a circuit element in electronics in practice pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling number and charge positive or negative of activated carriers such control is necessary for transistors solar cells semiconductor detectors and other semiconductor devices used in computer industry and other technical applications zulehner et al p 573 in silicon photonics silicon may be used as a continuous wave raman laser medium to produce coherent light in common integrated circuits a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for circuits which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide an insulator that is easily produced on si surfaces by processes of thermal oxidation or local oxidation locos which involve exposing element to oxygen under proper conditions that can be predicted by deal grove model silicon has become most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown an electron avalanche is created when heat produces free electrons and holes which in turn pass more current which produces more heat in addition insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water which gives it an advantage over germanium an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices in certain fabrication techniques semiconductors without quantum physics monocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths for other uses other types of pure silicon may be employed these include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical grade silicon umg si used in production of low cost large area electronics in applications such as liquid crystal displays and of large area low cost thin film solar cells such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline and are produced in comparable quantities as monocrystalline silicon 75 000 to 150 000 metric tons per year market for lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon by 2013 polycrystalline silicon production used mostly in solar cells was projected to reach 200 000 metric tons per year while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50 000 tons per year lisa a 2009 minerals yearbook usgs biological role upright thumb a diatom enclosed in a silica cell wall although silicon is readily available in form of silicates very few organisms use it directly diatoms radiolaria and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for their skeletons in more advanced plants silica phytoliths opal phytoliths are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in cell some plants for example rice need silicon for their growth silicon has been shown to improve plant cell wall strength and structural integrity in some plants human nutrition there is some evidence that silicon is important to human health for their nail hair bone and skin tissues for example in studies that demonstrate that women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis silicon is needed for synthesis of and collagen of which aorta contains greatest quantity in human body and has been considered an essential element nevertheless it is difficult to prove its essentiality because silicon is very common and hence deficiency symptoms are difficult to reproduce silicon is currently under consideration for elevation to status of a plant beneficial substance by association of american plant food control officials
