song which was shot in los angeles in a behind scenes video mars explained concept of video is my struggle to tell this girl i d do anything for her so i m going as far as dragging a piano to get to her just so i can sing my heart out mars sarcastically replied to rumors related to use of special effects a lot of people think this is a camera trick but that is a heavy piano luckily i ve been doing about you know 800 to 967 push ups every day so it s not a big deal i can handle it regardless this achievement mars was cautious actions in this video serve as a metaphor and should not be taken literally i am aware of power of visual media and i encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of song and not something to imitate music video was released on november 19 2010 on mtv and mtv com and it involves mars s efforts to sing to a woman he loves after dragging an upright piano with a rope tied to it through los angeles scenes also feature singer singing in a dark bedroom looking out of a rainy window he wears a suit and encounters a gang and a pit bull along way when he reaches woman s house and finds out she is with another man he drags himself and piano in front of a train to attempt suicide as train approaches bruno at full speed screen cuts to black and video ends reception video received mixed reviews by critics robbie daw of idolator complemented video by saying that standout track from doo wops hooligans and it s given an extra sheen thanks to a quirky unconventional video that doesn t shy away from dark tone of song s lyrics brian zacher from axs com said that video shares greatness with previous one just way you are james montgomery of mtv news gave a mixed review on video in which he said after all it would ve been easy and expected to make something slick sexy and or saccharine a glossy thing where he croons from a rooftop somewhere removes his shirt and somehow ends up with girl none of that happens here rather we see mars struggling and sweating being taunted and tempted falling and rising again he ends up alone unloved he probably gets flattened by a train on another review by montgomery singer redemption is referred because mars distances himself from his smoove crooning contemporaries and he does it simply by being real really dramatic really emotional really clever this one s a winner even if at end of it mars has lost everything video itself earned mars three nominations at 2011 mtv video music awards in best male video best pop video and video of year video was also one of most seen online in united kingdom in 2011 mark graham for vh1 ranked video as second best of 2011 top spot went for rolling in deep by adele cover versions and remixes some artists made
