features additional vocals by justin vernon frank ocean kid cudi chief keef king l assassin and charlie wilson west was influenced primarily by minimalist design and architecture during production of yeezus and visited a furniture exhibit in louvre five times a single le corbusier lamp was his greatest inspiration west worked closely with architect oana stanescu and took field trips to le corbusier homes fascinated by stanescu s comments on unusual and radical nature of corbusier design choices west applied situation to his own life feeling that visionaries can be misunderstood by their unenlightened peers west also met with architect joseph and belgian interior designer axel and had rare le corbusier lamps pierre jeanneret chairs and obscure body art journals from switzerland delivered to loft west also wanted a deep hometown influence on album and listened to 1980s house music most associated with his home city of chicago for influence alejandro jodorowsky s holy mountain

west began recording his seventh studio album with collaborators including no i d and dj khaled first recordings were held in january 2013 in living room of his personal loft at a paris hotel referred to in album s credits as no name hotel west kept compositions simple in order to hear tracks more clearly too much bass or complexity would simply overpower room s poor acoustics beats emanating from loft space which sometimes lasted through night provoked complaints from neighbors reports emerged that he and his then girlfriend kim kardashian had moved to loft in order for west to begin work on album atmosphere in studio was described by contributor evian christ as very focused and west once again brought in several close collaborators producer hudson mohawke noted inclusive group atmosphere of sessions in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces with different elements ultimately selected from each all involved were given a song to work on and return next day to sit and critique a process anthony kilhoffer compared to an art class producer arca described being initially asked to send west music noting that he purposefully sent perhaps strangest stuff he had with west happening to be excited by it describing west s collaborative style arca stated it was a lot of coming up with design like solving riddles if song called for something aggressive it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was best solution for that aggression in that moment everyone would approach it in completely different ways and ultimately it would all be edited by kanye himself thumb 250px right alt a masked kanye west performing at staples center on october 26 2013 in los angeles on yeezus tour record production is characterized as raw and dark west maintains a stripped down approach while continuing to use eclectic samples determined to undermine commercial several tracks were left off finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with west s previous material west set parameters regarding sound and style insisting that there be no bass wobbles reminiscent of dubstep album s recording process was described as very raw by thomas bangalter of french electronic duo daft punk who produced four songs for album adding that west was rapping kind of screaming actually while previous albums particularly dark fantasy took considerable time in studio yeezus was described by kilhoffer as fastest record we ever made in may 2013 def jam executives listened to final product only later to be changed describing album as dark american musician travis scott opined that snippets he d heard of yeezus were from year 3000 and recalled crazy memories from being around west during recording of it w writer christopher bagley reports that west s creative process often bordered on perfectionist in march 2013 west described album to bagley as near completion only to revise this statement one month later to album is only 30 percent complete west made several last minute alterations to yeezus enlisting co founder of def jam recordings rick rubin as an executive producer for additional recording mere days before its release changes included re recording whole songs and rewriting entire verses rough cut west played rubin ran nearly three and a half hours long west s orders to rubin were to take music in a stripped down minimal direction often removing elements already recorded in a september 2013 interview with radio dj zane lowe west said of rubin that he s not a producer he s a for several days in late may and early june 2013 west and a rotating group of intimates collaborators and hangers on holed up at rubin s shangri la studio in malibu in service of completing record rubin thought it impossible to meet deadline and all involved ended up working long hours with no days off in order to complete record west had intended album be 16 tracks until rubin suggested cutting album down to fewer tracks rubin gave as example bound which was a more middle of road r b song done in an adult contemporary style before west decided to replace musical backing with a minimalistic sample a single note bassline in hook which we processed to have a punk edge in suicide tradition two days before album had to be delivered to label west wrote and sung lyrics to two songs while also recording vocals to three others in just two hours rubin also suggested to reduce album from sixteen songs to just ten saying others could be reserved for a follow up music and composition thumb 175px left alt kanye west live during yeezus tour in 2013 described as west s most sonically experimental work album is driven by abrasive electronics while drawing from an array of industrial punk and hip hop subgenres according to chicago tribune critic greg kot yeezus is a hostile abrasive and intentionally off putting album that combines worlds of 1980s chicago acid house 2013 chicago drill music 1990s industrial music and avant rap of saul williams death grips and odd future independent mass appeal and village voice described it as an experimental release while meagan garvey of outline described it as west s industrial album rolling stone described it as an extravagantly abrasive album full of grinding electro pummeling minimalist hip hop drone y and industrial gear grind while vulture called it a punk rap opus and rolling stone called it an industrial rap opus slant magazine critic ted described album as built on alien angular beats slowly morphing drones and sirens abrupt periods of silence and a pulse quickening style of delivery from yeezy himself writing that west notion of what kind of music or noise can underpin hip hop according to charles aaron of spin yeezus is a hip hop album not a rap album because of how its sounds and subject matter are assembled together and although listeners can hear punk or post punk or industrial throughout hip hop has always been about noise and dissonance and dance music as agitation album also incorporates elements of industrial and trap music record most closely resembles 1990s industrial rock during which genre had a significant pop culture impact with artists such as nine inch nails ministry and marilyn manson gaining success industrial scene created a vast global underground community and esquire notes that one of its epicenters was in chicago where west was raised evan rytlewski of a v club characterized its opening series of songs as electro and industrial hip hop referencing sound of yeezus in september 2013 west stated for me as kanye west i got to fuck shit up i m going to take music and try to make it three dimensional i m not here to make easy listening easily programmable music at same time he viewed himself as artistically being here to crack pavement and break new ground sonically west would later go onto describe sound of album as a protest to music west elaborated claiming that he was like i m gonna take my ball and go home yeezus is primarily electronic in nature and boasts distorted drum machines and synthesizers that sound like they re malfunctioning low resolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura to most analog sounds to this end album incorporates glitches reminiscent of cd skips or corrupted mp3 s and auto tuned vocals are modulated to a point in which they are difficult to decipher esquire cites on sight as an early example of album s connection to electronic music citing its droning synthesizer tone which is modulated until signal starts throwing off harshly treble heavy spikes and begins to clip as if it were overloading a digital audio processor yeezus continues west s practice of eclectic samples he employs an obscure hindi sample on i am a god and a sample of 1970s hungarian rock group omega on new slaves on sight interpolates a melody from sermon he ll give us what we really need by holy name of mary choral family although track originally sampled an old vocal track from original recording as late as a week prior to release lawyers were forced to track down choir director and members of choir on south side of chicago in order to get clearance for such a sample def jam executives were significantly worried enough deal would not be in place in time for record s deadline and producers re recorded vocals with a new choir as sample could not be cleared in enough time bound 2 features heavy soul music samples and has been described as only song on yeezus which recalls sound of west s early work bound a 1971 song by american soul group ponderosa twins plus one from their album 2 2 1 ponderosa twins plus one serves as primary sample used in west s track album s second track black skinhead has alternately been called an industrial hip hop song and a galloping punk rap manifesto i am a god was inspired by a diss from a major fashion designer who informed west of his invitation to a widely anticipated runway show on condition he agree to not attend other shows i m in it began with a different sample and melody but west removed sample and rubin edited track down from a six minute arrangement blood on leaves which samples nina simone s 1965 rendition of strange fruit and was first track in first incarnation of track list is an example of west s signature dichotomy in which he melds sacred and profane strange fruit first recorded by billie holiday in 1939 brought lynchings of black americans to a startling poignancy creating one of most towering important songs of 20th century west s anthemic re telling instead details an mdma fueled hookup and perils of fame promotion and release thumb right alt new slaves a video projection of new slaves in los angeles in may 2013 on may 1 2013 west used twitter to post a single message reading june eighteen

video projections in 66 assorted locations following day west appeared on american late night live television sketch comedy show saturday night live and performed songs new slaves and black skinhead west subsequently revealed album s cover and title yeezus on his official website fellow rapper kendrick lamar offered his opinion on title in an interview that same month stating that s crazy i want to hear that that s that creative kanye genius stuff out box he also claimed that album s whole marketing scheme is crazy and very inspiring itunes store made yeezus available for pre order on may 20 but listing was subsequently taken down for unknown reasons on may 29 a p c founder jean unveiled an advertisement for yeezus which stated that album would not be available for pre order speaking about album s minimal promotion west stated with this album we ain t drop no single to radio we ain t got no nba campaign nothing like that shit we ain t even got no cover we just made some real music in may 2013 american rapper j cole called west one of greatest artists of our generation via twitter with him following this by tweeting which is exactly why i m moving my release date up born sinner june 18th he explained releasing his second studio album born sinner on same day as yeezus during an interview that same month saying i m not going to sit here i worked too hard to come a week later after kanye west drops an amazing album it d be like oh and j cole dropped too a week later nah i m going to go see him on that date he s greatest next month j cole gave further context claiming for coinciding release to be more about statement than sales j cole elaborated on this admitting that music being competed over is art and he can t compete against kanye west celebrity and status that he s earned just from being a genius though stated but i can put my name in hat and tell you that i think my album is great and you be judge and you decide a lyrical reference to releasing on same date as west is included in track forbidden fruit from born sinner physical cd edition of yeezus was released in a clear jewel box with no album artwork reflecting minimalist tone packaging consists of little more than a piece of red tape and a sticker affixed to back with sample credits and album s upc other versions of this release have different colors of stickers with green yellow and orange

with widespread critical acclaim at metacritic album received an average score of 84 based on 46 reviews aggregator anydecentmusic gave yeezus 8 2 out of 10 based on their assessment of critical consensus reviewing album in guardian lead critic alexis petridis found it noisy gripping maddening potent while helen brown from daily telegraph said it was most exciting album she had heard in some time jon dolan from rolling stone called it a brilliant obsessive compulsive career auto correct that made other abrasive records by mad geniuses such as in utero by nirvana and radiohead s kid a seem tame by comparison pitchfork critic ryan dombal viewed it as a razor sharpened take on west s fourth studio album 808s heartbreak concluding that cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on yeezus perhaps more than any other kanye album each fluorescent strike of noise incongruous tempo flip and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across album s fast 40 minutes randall roberts of los angeles times felt it was his most ambitious piece of music yet and evan rytlewski from a v club said it was his most uninhibited record even by standards of an artist who reinvents himself with each release it s a drastic departure in a highly positive review allmusic s david jeffries opined that album was an extravagant stunt with high art packed in offering an eccentric audacious and gripping experience that s vital and truly unlike anything else rock artist lou reed reviewed yeezus in july 2013 shortly before his death describing it as majestic and inspiring he s really trying to raise bar no one s near doing what he s doing it s not even on same planet some reviewers expressed reservations in new york times jon pareles said west s innovative transfiguration of his music with unrefined electronica and drill elements was undermined by his distasteful lyrics and appropriation of 1960s civil rights slogans to his own celebrity or to bedroom exploits in robert christgau s opinion combination of harsh rock and hip hop sounds on yeezus was as bold as public enemy s music during 1980s but west s lyrics were grotesquely off putting he s wordsmith enough to insure that his sexist imagery is very hard to take christgau wrote in barnes noble review looking at album as an alt rap also ran chris richards from washington post found west s lyricism perhaps his least compelling yet and drunk on bitterness though viewed album as west at his most wasted stumbling through rubble alex griffin of tiny mix tapes expressed similar feelings describing it as a nebulous dense paranoid web of utterly unfiltered expression that s utterly or negligibly fascinating depending on how much you care about yeezy in times will hodgkinson surmised that yeezus could have been

one debuting album in 2012 13 and fourth largest for a number one bowing album in soundscan era billboards keith caulfield attributed diminished figures to non traditional marketing considering that

public reaction to yeezus including its unorthodox and deliberate lack of promotion as well as its brash and aggressive sound was mixed yeezus was noted as one of most anticipated releases of 2013 by major publications but lack of a major radio single was regarded as a risky move regardless radio stations have still played tracks from yeezus on air despite it being a departure from normal playlists found on hip hop stations when i listen to radio that ain t where i wanna be no more stated west at his headlining june 9 2013 governor s ball performance where he unveiled several tracks from record for first time rolling stone summarized audience s response half crowd cheered half almost audibly rolled their eyes west s june 11 interview with jon caramanica of new york times was similarly viewed with a mixed reaction with many outlets mocking west s seemingly vain statements in article west compares himself to apple co founder steve jobs and refers to himself as nucleus of all society within four days prior to release yeezus was leaked online new york times wrote that leak stirred up a twitter frenzy and received widespread media coverage washington post commented on significance of leak kanye west s new album didn t leak online over weekend it gushed out into pop ecosystem like a million barrels of renegade crude ominous mesmerizing and of great consequence critics were very kind to yeezus regarding critical reviews but others viewed release as musical and commercial suicide and fans live blogged their own befuddlement on twitter and facebook new yorkers sasha frere jones suggests that yeezus may be preferred over any of west s previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to lean vibrancy of album one of most fascinating aspects of yeezus arrival is discursive crisis it s caused produced by a fast react culture colliding with a work of art so confounding wrote atlantic columnist jack hamilton west was criticized by uk and us parkinson s disease associations for controversial lyrics in lead song on sight oasis lead member liam gallagher criticized yeezus over its title saying of west he s a fucking idiot you ll never see jesus banging his head american rapper hopsin dissed west over album within lyrics of his single hop is back in october 2013 while music video included hopsin reenacting one of west s numerous encounters with paparazzi that same month hopsin went on to explain diss admitting that he is a fan of west who likes a lot of his older music and viewing yeezus as west on some straight up bullshit hopsin elaborated stating godliness stuff nah he can do whatever he wants he s a human he s entitled to do whatever jay z described yeezus as polarizing though claimed that s what great art is and that west pushes genre forward with his experimentation expressing his thoughts on mixed reception of album in october 2013 fellow rapper lupe fiasco viewed himself as not facing a similar uphill battle lupe fiasco continued assuring that his then upcoming studio album tetsuo youth 2015 wouldn t be as open for interpretation as yeezus in february 2014 english singer lily allen announced that she would title her third studio album in an interview with australian radio station nova allen stated that she is terrified that west would think it s a diss rather than a tribute she said that she thinks west is brilliant and praised him for speaking his mind all time that same month jack white a vocal advocate of analog recording remarked that yeezus is obviously recorded on pro tools but sounds unbelievable because it is very simple and there aren t a lot of components going on and this really allows songs to shine plus he mixed using analogue components tingen paul october 2014 inside track jack white sound on sound retrieved october 22 2014 west went on to make claim in october 2015 that despite many people rating my beautiful dark twisted fantasy as his best album yeezus is so much
