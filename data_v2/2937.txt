river irwell is a long river which flows through irwell valley in north west england its source is at irwell springs on deerplay moor approximately north of bacup it forms boundary between manchester and salford and empties into river mersey near irlam in 17th and 18th centuries irwell s lower reaches were a trading route that became part of mersey and irwell navigation in 19th century river s course downstream of manchester was permanently altered by construction of manchester ship canal which opened in 1896 canal turned manchester and salford into a major inland seaport and led to development of trafford park which became largest industrial estate in europe further changes were made in 20th and 21st centuries to prevent flooding in manchester and salford such as anaconda cut in 1970 and river irwell flood defence scheme in 2014 river became severely polluted by industrial waste in industrial revolution but in second half of 20th century a number of initiatives were implemented to improve water quality restock it with fish and create a diverse environment for wildlife stretches of river flowing through manchester and salford have attracted large scale investment in business and residential developments such as salford quays and other parts have become important wildlife havens irwell is used for recreational activities such as pleasure cruising rowing racing swimming and fishing course from its source to confluence with river mersey irwell is about long rising on moors above it flows south through bacup rawtenstall ramsbottom and bury before merging with river roch near radcliffe turning west it joins river croal near farnworth before turning southeast through kearsley clifton and agecroft area of pendlebury it then meanders around lower kersal and lower broughton it bisects salford and manchester joining rivers irk and medlock and then turns west toward irlam as part of manchester ship canal its course ends just east of irlam where it empties into mersey natural history thumb left grey heron wading in irwell near bury until early 19th century irwell was well stocked with fish and other wildlife with people living near manchester cathedral using its water for drinking and other domestic purposes however during industrial revolution increasing levels of pollution caused by waste products discharged into river by local industries proved fatal to wildlife with fish stocks disappearing completely by about 1850 this situation abated somewhat during 20th century with a slow improvement in water quality leading to fresh populations of roach bream and chub and sightings of brown trout have become increasingly common problems with water quality in some of former manchester docks basins became apparent with redevelopment of salford quays years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion in 2001 a compressed air injection system was introduced this raised oxygen levels in water by up to 300 improving water quality to such an extent that number of invertebrate species present increased to more than 30 including freshwater shrimp spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased and are now amongst highest in england two sites of special scientific interest sssis are located close to banks of irwell near to its confluence with river croal at moses gate country park near bolton first is at nob end an 88 800 m2 site which has been designated because of its biological interest based on predominance of flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids nob end is also designated as a local nature reserve lnr second site is ashclough which is a site of geological interest these two sssis are among 21 found in greater manchester in salford river flows through clifton country park and kersal dale country park both of which have been designated as herons cormorants mute swans kingfishers and many species of geese and ducks are regularly sighted on river bullock r salford trail retrieved on 23 october 2008 manchester ship canal near salford quays is one of top ten sites in britain for diving ducks providing a winter home to approximately 3 000 common pochard and 2 000 tufted ducks geology thumb right new red sandstone at clifton irwell is all that remains of shallow seas that covered most of south east lancashire in late carboniferous period when deposits of mud and sand were laid down during permian and triassic periods red sandstones were deposited under arid desert conditions and these became compressed into beds of shales new red sandstone and manchester marls alternating with layers of gritstone glaciers of pleistocene period radically re shaped landscape and then retreated leaving behind deposits of sand pebbles and boulder clay that formed fluvioglacial ridges of lower irwell valley ashclough a 50 800 m2 site which comprises steep banks of river between prestolee and little lever has been designated an sssi because of its geological interest primarily because it is best site in area displaying ashclough marine band and its associated strata ashclough is a site of national importance for interpreting coal measure palaeogeography of great britain river irwell catchment area river irwell catchment area extends from moors above bacup to manchester ship canal climate of catchment area is wetter than uk average with rainfall of per annum compared to per annum and rivers quickly respond to rainfall topography varies considerably with upper reaches dominated by pennine moors at an altitude of between ordnance datum mean sea level and bottom of catchment consisting of relatively flat land which lies between watercourses are characterised by steep narrow valleys which contributes to high rates of run off as does underlying solid geology this comprises lower coal measures overlying millstone grit both of which are classified as minor aquifers which will only hold relatively small amounts of water millstone grit is in turn underlain by limestone rocks from lower carboniferous period surface deposits comprise thick peat in upper reaches with glacial boulder clay and glacial sand and gravel in lower parts sand and gravel are also classified as a minor aquifer whilst boulder clay is a non aquifer higher steeper slopes of upper part of catchment provide a large source of material and debris which is transported downstream to lower flatter parts of catchment where channel is constricted this material is then deposited and can contribute to a reduction in channel capacity history etymology thumb right river irwell divides cities of salford left and manchester origins of name irwell are uncertain but many accept anglo saxon origin ere well meaning hoar or white spring first part of name may also be brittonic ar an ancient river name element that implies horizontal motion flowing rising or else springing up ancient history flint scrapers knives and other materials associated with neolithic period were discovered on kersal moor in late 19th century and early 20th century there have been isolated finds of artefacts characteristic of this period along irwell valley and a possible hunting site was excavated at prestwich golf course in 1982 which produced a quantity of late neolithic and early bronze age flints neolithic tools have also been found in river roch near bury and in radcliffe and bronze age burial sites have been found in bury and shuttleworth celtic roman and medieval first recorded human settlements were those of celtic tribe brigantes who farmed uplands and lower reaches of river in late iron age in ad 79 roman empire conquered these tribes building forts at confluences of irwell and rivers irk and medlock and naming town mamucium they also built a ford with rectangular stone blocks at cornbrook which is thought to be first man made structure to span river for four hundred years pax romana brought peace but their withdrawal in ad 410 left tribes at mercy of saxons who renamed town manigceastre danes later seized and all but destroyed manigceastre and absorbed what was left of tribes danelaw ruled until ad 920 when norsemen were expelled by edward elder in middle ages town which was now known as later to become manchester grew and prospered and trading vessels plied along river hamlet of kersal which now forms part of city of salford was gifted to cluniac priory of lenton near nottingham in 1142 most important part of gift was fishing rights on river irwell and even in 18th century salmon rights on rivers of lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds see hansard 18 april 1950 vol 474 106 19th century during industrial revolution factories mills and terraced grew up along river banks joseph corbett borough engineer of salford wrote in his 1907 book river irwell of his father edward s experiences around 1819 of seeing large shoals of fish chiefly gudgeon but also other fish rising to flies from a vantage point on new bailey bridge now albert bridge in manchester local industry dumped toxic chemicals into river such as gas tar gas lime and ammonia water and by 1850 fish stocks had all but disappeared in 1860 irwell was described as almost proverbial for foulness of its waters receiving refuse of cotton factories coal mines print works bleach works dye works chemical works paper works almost every kind of industry in 1862 scottish geologist hugh miller wrote about irwell in his book first impressions english people describing it as hapless river a pretty enough stream a few miles higher up with trees overhanging its banks and fringes of green sedge set thick along its edges loses caste as it gets among mills and printworks there are myriads of dirty things given it to wash and whole waggon loads of poisons from dye houses and thrown into it to carry away steam boilers discharge into it their seething contents and drains and sewers their fetid impurities till at length it rolls on here between tall dingy walls there under precipices of red sandstone considerably less a river than a flood of liquid manure in which all life dies whether animal or vegetable and which resembles nothing in nature except perhaps stream thrown out in eruption by some mud volcano right thumb irwell flows west through in rossendale in victorian era passenger boat trips were popular but cut short by foul smells from river in 1862 corporation of salford promoted an act of parliament enabling them to establish a river conservancy committee they appointed a river inspector and had to power to take action against anyone polluting river rivers pollution prevention act 1876 was designed to solve problems of river pollution but it was largely ineffective it did however lay groundwork for more draconian legislation which followed and in 1891 mersey and irwell joint committee was formed local authorities were ordered to provide sewage treatment facilities and industrial concerns were told to use best practical means of preventing pollution salford was one of first authorities in irwell watershed to install intercepting sewers and sewage treatment works at mode wheel sewage works one of most famous characters associated with river during this time was mark addy who was born in a tenement on parsonage near blackfriars bridge in manchester in 1838 whenever anyone was in difficulty in river cry would go up bring mark addy and he would race to rescue he was awarded a number of medals including gold and silver medals from humane society for hundred of salford and royal humane society s bronze medal in 1878 he became only civilian ever to be awarded albert medal first class his final rescue was on whit monday in 1889 when he saved a young boy from a particularly sewage laden section of river after this he became ill and died of tuberculosis in 1890 aged 51 he had rescued over 50 people from river during his lifetime 20th century thumb right industrial revolution saw river badly polluted by industry as pictured in this photograph of radcliffe taken in 1902 in 1939 mersey and irwell joint committee was superseded by lancashire rivers board but wartime conditions brought about further deterioration of river in 1951 rivers prevention of pollution act was passed and this board disappeared to be replaced by mersey river board which was replaced in turn by mersey and weaver river authority in 1965 during a 1950s television documentary entitled river of irwell watercourse was described as hardest worked river in world in 1946 there was serious flooding in salford caused by a bottleneck at a bend in river at strangeways on border with manchester flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years hampson 1930 book four 1800 1930 chapter vi peel park and irwell floods and in 1946 decision was made to straighten and widen river to increase its capacity work started in 1951 but it was not until september 1970 that water first flowed through anaconda cut total cost of project was ps2m in a question to house of commons in 1950 member of parliament for rossendale mr anthony greenwood highlighted lamentable condition of irwell and one of its main tributaries river roch today i am afraid that fish in most of those rivers are virtually extinct anybody who stands today in city of manchester outside exchange station and looks down at noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish or any other living creature could ever have lived in what manchester guardian has so rightly called that melancholy stream i have had my differences with british field sports society but i have nothing but admiration for excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that society and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of rivers irwell and roach these two rivers were covered by third report and very sorry reading it made there are two passages in that report which i should like to read first says banks are lined with factories large and small many of which take their water from drainage of hills forming slopes of river s valley and discharge it as a polluted effluent either into small feeders or main river itself so it may be said that no natural water normally enters river from its cradle in moors to its grave in manchester ship canal second quotation is one which i find still more appalling than first it is there are no fish in these rivers apart from a very occasional tributary no insects no weeds no life of any kind except sewage fungus nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use sewage effluents and being usually very good they are most encouraging feature of appalling situation are hailed with delight as being purest water which rivers hold full importance of that statement will be realised when i remind hon members of frequency with which residents in bacup ramsbottom manchester and salford are subjected to flooding from waters of irwell in 1951 it was announced that flood defence works were to be carried out on stretch of river passing through lower broughton between cromwell bridge and gerald road bridge although local property owners and shopkeepers were outraged at being asked to bear part of cost work on concrete wall did not get underway until june 1952 and was still only nearing completion when in august 1957 nearby homes were threatened by flooding during heavy rain 1970s thumb right iron oxide pollution near river s source a report in manchester evening news in 1971 stated that bury angling society had signed an agreement with bury corporation giving them fishing rights along of river between summerseat and radcliffe secretary of society was quoted as saying extensive tests have been carried out on fish we put in river and we are satisfied that water will support fish life roach and perch have already been caught and we have had no reports of any ill effects there is no doubt pollution is clearing it will be a long job but we are sure there is a future for angling in river report went on to state that society intends to carry out stocking operations soon in 1972 newspaper reported that tiddlers small fish had been seen swimming in notorious inky irwell near peel park salford deputy chief water quality officer for salford mr eric harper said ten years ago any fish getting as far down as salford would have been killed almost immediately by pollution in water although river there is now a great deal better than it has been for 100 years fish will probably not be able to live long these had probably got into main river from small streams flowing into irwell but i think it is real progress mr harper went on to say that irwell had been well stocked with fish along its whole length 100 years ago but refused to guess when it would reach same state again in 1974 all of river authorities were merged into regional water authorities in 1974 annual report of north west water authority nwwa it was said that river once internationally famous or infamous as epitome of river pollution is now in a much better state as compared with its condition at time of a special survey carried out nine years ago this was reported in an article in manchester evening news on 26 october of that year which stated that during nine years of pollution control work reviewed by north west water authority biggest improvement had been in bolton district where effluent from five dilapidated sewage plants and two paper mills were now being treated at ringley fold works but there has been little reduction in pollution from river roch at bacup headwater of irwell is discoloured by ochre deposits from a disused mine but work is being done to stop ochre seepage fish do exist in stretch between rossendale and bury and fish are to be introduced in stretches between radcliffe and manchester however it is feared that it will be many years before fish will be able to breed freely in river 1980s in 1980 a scheme for improving a section of river between littleton road and adelphi weir in salford for boating purposes was included in greater manchester policy committee s capital programme for 1981 82 county councillors at a recent committee meeting had criticised condition of river with councillor for metropolitan borough of oldham calling it quite revolting and horrible a spokesperson for nwwa said that although river had a reputation for being polluted it was getting much better but still had not reached a state where they would be satisfied she added that tests were being carried out to show improved cleanliness of irwell and that 600 trout had recently been put in river at summerseat near bury proposals were welcomed by both salford university and agecroft rowing club with university stating that they wished to use that section for their boat race later that year it was reported that hundreds of trees and shrubs were to be planted along banks of irwell between broughton and pomona dock in a ps650 000 green finger scheme to bring countryside into heart of industrial salford dossier outlining scheme prepared by salford s technical services officer emphasised bleak character of irwell valley with many constructions by river that are decaying and rotting and said main problems are caused by an excess of ammonia and a high organic content from sewage effluents which discharge into water upstream report recommended that even more support should be given to nwwa in their pollution control of river irwell throughout 1980s sightings of fish as far downstream as manchester city centre were reported in local newspapers in february 1981 manchester evening news reported that ten sticklebacks about two inches long had been spotted by a site manager working on mark addy public house which was then being built on disused new bailey landing stage below new bailey street on border of manchester and salford plans for developing river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that over may bank holiday first pleasure cruise on river in 20th century would leave from mark addy as part of a three day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success in 1983 over 100 canal and river boats rode flooded river for greater manchester waterways festival an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could transform bleak waterway in heart of manchester by 1984 two local men felt waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten mile 16 km charity fund raising swim from clifton to manchester although they were warned by a spokesman for north west water authority that cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that irwell was still a class 4 river top of pollution chart during 1985 croal irwell valley local plan was launched listing 187 proposals for improvement of valley and in 1986 mersey basin campaign was announced campaign was to cover a large area from rossendale in north to crewe in south and it was promised that would be made available in first three years for water and land based projects in september 1987 plans were revealed for a mile long landscaped walkway in manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked up railway arches on side of river opposite manchester cathedral into a wine bar and restaurant in 1988 manchester s first water bus made its maiden voyage from new bailey landing stage then known as mark addy quay on a five mile 8 km inaugural round trip to salford quays by end of 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn manchester into a top international tourist centre mainly based on derelict areas around waterways of manchester salford and trafford irwell irk ship canal and bridgewater canal bringing of investment and 13 000 new jobs over next 10 years manchester ship canal company also announced a ps70 million redevelopment scheme for pomona docks in salford to include a marina homes offices and other commercial developments 1990s thumb right trinity bridge in 1990 newly formed mersey and irwell packet company launched regular tourist trips along river from a landing stage opposite granada studios tour entrance in quay street taking in stretch from castlefield to salford quays this was not universally welcomed as by september of that year a retired chemical engineer claimed that pleasure boat was leaving clouds of methane in its wake as it disturbed sediment on river bed however in 1991 a feature article appeared in magazine lancashire life extolling virtues of cruise and stating that irwell once thought a liability is in fact a major asset to urban regeneration now twin cities compete to befriend her to dress her in finery and proudly introduce her back into society and public are cordially invited back onto her waters during 1994 construction work began on a new ps1 3m footbridge to link manchester and salford to be known as trinity bridge box girder and steel cable construction was designed by spanish architect santiago calatrava to represent a ship in full sail as centrepiece of ps50m chapel wharf regeneration scheme which was expected to breathe new life into a run down area of salford and to create up to 8 000 new jobs in may 1995 a new long multimillion pound arts trail to be known as irwell sculpture trail was reported in manchester evening news and in june 1997 work began on ps10 million lower irwell valley flood defence scheme in lower kersal 21st century thumb right irwell at cromwell bridge broughton in july 2000 there was a setback for clean up programme when a pollution incident affected approximately of river between rawtenstall and ramsbottom causing death of more than 36 000 fish large number of fish killed however did serve to illustrate how much river had improved from lifeless melancholy stream of 1950s in 2005 a ps1m project to make river cleanest it has been for decades was announced by united utilities improvements included fitting filters on sewers in lower broughton to ensure litter was not washed into river as part of a scheme to improve overflows across adlington wigan chorley rochdale and bury then in october 2008 united utilities announced that work on ringley fold wastewater works in to be completed by end of year should increase number of fish in river and massively improve environment locally so walkers canoeists and anglers will all reap benefits company said that this was to be biggest scheme that they had undertaken in region and project manager was quoted as saying reducing amount of phosphate in water is main driver behind scheme new legislation states that amount of phosphate in waste water should be one milligram per litre because it causes water to clog with algae and reduces amount of oxygen in water which results in less aquatic life and fish treatment plant which was built in 1930s and last updated in 1970s treats waste water from a population of half a million from bolton prestwich whitefield and clifton there was another pollution incident in march 2008 when twenty miles of river turned orange iron oxide from old mine workings near source at irwell springs had polluted water since 1969 and in 1997 a coal authority survey identified stretch as having fourth worst case of pollution in country a treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove pollution at a cost of ps1m however it is thought that there was a collapse in mine after heavy rains in spring of 2008 although water was stained with ochre no damage to wildlife was reported commerce right thumb upright lock on mersey and irwell navigation c 1850 mersey and irwell navigation in late 17th century warrington businessman thomas patten had made river mersey navigable as far as warrington and suggested that there would be significant commercial value in extending this along irwell as far as manchester in 1721 parliament authorised alteration with mersey and irwell navigation act and by 1736 work had been completed by creating eight canal locks along route from warrington to manchester allowing access to boats of up to 51 tonnes waterway which became known as mersey irwell navigation played a central role in cotton industry of 18th century that spearheaded industrial revolution bridgewater canal when francis egerton 3rd duke of bridgewater built bridgewater canal task of crossing irwell was one of main obstacles he faced solution was to build a canal carrying bridge across river first barge aqueduct in england aqueduct which opened in 1761 measured high and long and became one of wonders or age mersey and irwell navigation and bridgewater canal competed for trade to and from manchester for next 120 years and specially designed barges with a shallow draft known as mersey flats were used on both waterways over years both trade and rivalry continued to grow with each company offering reduced freight charges or special rates and concessions to gain business from other most important cargo carried was raw cotton from liverpool to manchester but timber pig iron lead copper nails tar sand grain and flour were also carried passenger services had been operating on bridgewater canal for some years and in 1807 irwell and mersey navigation company began to compete with daily services between runcorn and manchester in 1816 they began to use packet steamers however in 1830 liverpool and manchester railway opened packet boat services went into decline and ceased to operate completely in 1860s in manchester two other canals used irwell as a point of access manchester bolton bury canal from 1809 and manchester and salford junction canal from 1839 previous year short hulme locks branch canal had also connected irwell to bridgewater canal at castlefield all are now non navigable although first is under restoration manchester ship canal right thumb river mersey empties into manchester ship canal at irlam as 19th century progressed increasing need for large freight carriers led to liverpool s dominance as a port manchester became increasingly reliant on its merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports but handling charges and dues charged by mersey docks and harbour board made goods from manchester uncompetitive a solution was to build manchester ship canal in 1887 bridgewater navigation company was purchased by manchester ship canal company with a cheque for ps1 710 000 which was at time largest cheque ever written and building of manchester ship canal began canal which was made by greatly deepening and widening eastern section of mersey and irwell navigation opened on 1 january 1894 it reduced shipping costs of raw cotton to mills and dispatching finished cloth overseas canal had helped region to become centre of industrial revolution and it had transformed manchester into england s third largest port despite being inland as canal was built it became clear that brindley s famous aqueduct would have to be demolished as it allowed insufficient headroom for freighters that canal would carry fortunately in 1896 councillors of eccles paid to have aqueduct moved to spot it occupies today alongside canal bridgewater canal is now carried over manchester ship canal by equally celebrated barton swing aqueduct which was completed in 1893 with novel idea of opening by rotating 90 degrees to allow ships to pass construction of manchester ship canal and manchester docks led to development of trafford park as largest industrial estate in europe and brought employment to area for next eighty years by 1960s however uk had begun to lose its position as an industrial world power by mid 20th century uk cotton industry had gone into decline because of low cost competition from asian manufacturers decline of heavy industry in area increasing size of freight carrying ships and competition from road transport brought about decline of terminal docks at salford which closed in 1982 river irwell flood defence scheme thumb right peel park flood obelisk showing 1866 flood level a second flood line was added after 1870 floods lower reaches of irwell have flooded many times in its history most well documented being floods of 1866 1946 1954 1980 2007 and 2015 in december 1816 rapidly thawing snow caused river to flood sweeping away a considerable amount of property including building materials and livestock locals reported height of river to have been almost as great as a more serious flood of 1768 a local public house black boy suffered extensive damage as water caused rear wall to collapse a local brewery was flooded with loss of all its stock and a mersey flat came free of its moorings hitting regent bridge in 1866 year of great flood rain fell for three continuous days commencing on tuesday 13 november by end of first day river had risen above normal at peel park street lamps could not be lit and mills were brought to a stop in all ps1 million of property was damaged 450 hectares of land was flooded 700 people had to be rescued from wrecked homes but only one man died by drowning height of flood was marked by an obelisk erected in peel park construction of ship canal is said to have reduced risk of flooding by providing a larger outlet below regent bridge in 1946 in salford 5 300 properties were flooded and 600 were flooded in 1954 to alleviate such problems two flood storage basins with a capacity of have been constructed to west of littleton road kersal at a cost of around ps11 million as part of river irwell flood defence scheme defences help to protect some 3 000 properties in kersal and lower broughton against a 1 in 75 year flood concerns have been raised that a 1 in a 100 year flood would breach these defences and cause some ps55 million damage to property defences proved successful on 22 january 2008 when worst flooding to hit region in thirty years caused irwell to burst its banks further downstream in centre of manchester on 2 february 2018 environment agency announced completion of a ps10 million extension to flood defence scheme which will protect almost 2 000 homes and businesses and has created more than 5 hectares of high quality urban wetland habitat new development also provides a new footpath around site which links to existing footpaths to provide a green route to and from centre of manchester 28 hectare flood basin will protect surrounding properties by holding up to 650 million litres of water during flood conditions scheme utilises an offline storage basin created in a meander of irwell on site of old manchester racecourse that will work in tandem with existing flood storage area at littleton road embankment around basin features an inlet to allow controlled spill of water into basin when river levels are high water will then be stored in basin during a flood and released back into river once water level has dropped flood embankments have also been planted with 10 hectares of wildflower habitat to attract pollinating species such as moths butterflies and bees regeneration thumb right ontario basin salford quays a large urban regeneration project salford quays development plan was published in 1985 and work began a few years later to redevelop site for residential business and leisure purposes salford quays waterside development has made living by irwell and manchester ship canal into which it flows fashionable once again there are further plans to turn tide on years of neglect and once again embrace river irwell as a fundamental part of manchester and salford s heritage and future economic and social growth vision is to reinvent central manchester conurbation as major waterfront destination in northern england a number of key stakeholders are involved in development of this regeneration vision these include manchester salford and trafford councils manchester ship canal company environment agency mersey basin campaign local businesses landowners community groups and wider manchester salford and trafford communities irwell city park in 2007 manchester city council salford city council and trafford metropolitan borough council prepared planning guidance to support delivery of a project for restoration of river and creation of a new urban park to be called irwell city park intention is to develop of riverside between meadows and peel park in north through salford and manchester city centres and pomona dock areas around to salford quays and trafford wharfside three authorities formally adopted draft planning guidance in march 2008 guidance sets out guidelines that councils will use as a material consideration in determining applications for planning permission and other matters in irwell city park area it also establishes a set of principles to ensure provision of a continuous riverside cycle walkway and high quality design of new public open spaces and other infrastructure an application is to be made to north west development agency in october 2008 to support pre project implementation work including design and technical feasibility work sport on irwell rowing has existed along river in manchester and salford since 1823 a regatta was inaugurated on 12 september 1842 on a straight course from throstle s nest weir to regent road bridge racing continued in manchester with events such as agecroft regatta and warburton regatta at turn of 20th century rowing was very popular in area with many local clubs such as nemesis prince of wales minerva didsbury and agecroft all competing regularly with decline in condition of water by second world war only agecroft and broughton rowing clubs were still active agecroft rowing club was formed in 1861 making it one of oldest open membership rowing clubs in world club was originally based in grounds of agecroft hall and then a short distance downstream at littleton road however river became impossible for eight s and fours to pass due to encroachment of weeds and river life following clean up of environment club now operates from a boat house next to salford watersports centre at salford quays which it has shared with university of salford boat club since 2004 boat house which sport s governing body british rowing has nominated as north west centre of excellence also hosts two cities boat race which has been held on river since
