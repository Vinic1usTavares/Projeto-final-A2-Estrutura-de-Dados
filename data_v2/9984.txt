admiral spiridov class were a pair of monitors built for imperial russian navy in late 1860s sister ships were assigned to baltic fleet upon completion and remained there for their entire careers aside from several accidental collisions and one grounding their careers were uneventful they were reclassified as coast defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900 admiral spiridovs were stricken from navy list in 1907 one ship became a stationary target and other a coal storage barge their ultimate fates are unknown design and description thumb left line drawing from brassey s naval annual 1888 by late 1863 russian admiralty board had begun planning for second generation of ironclads to succeed those ships then under construction they ordered eight ships two fully rigged seagoing types and six coastal defense ships in march 1864 british shipbuilder charles mitchell submitted four different designs for coastal defense vessels two broadside ironclads and two turret ships shipbuilding technical committee decided in august that broadside designs would be based on hull shape of earlier for better seaworthiness but they would be armed with fewer but more powerful guns than numerous smoothbore guns of older ships two variants were worked out that differed in fineness of hull and draft mclaughlin p 112 in november committee decided to revise designs to use three gun turrets each armed with a pair of massive american designed rodman guns although armament was changed to rifled muzzle loading guns two months later on 4 june 1865 admiral spiridov and admiral chichagov were ordered to shallower draft version of two designs construction of ships was repeatedly delayed by design changes and delayed deliveries of components both of most significant design changes were related to armor protection shortly after they were ordered admiralty board realized that specified armor would be outclassed by latest rifled gun and decided that existing armor would be reinforced by an additional armor plate and additional wooden backing inside existing armor additional weight was offset by increasing height of hull by which also deepened ships draft second change occurred after new rifled guns were able to penetrate a replica of armor scheme in june 1866 admiralty board decided to significantly thicken armor of two ships and removed one gun turret to compensate for weight of extra armor in november numerous other changes flowed from this decision as engine and boilers had to be moved forward about to maintain ships trim and two transverse bulkheads also had to be moved this major change added over 270 000 rubles to cost of ships and added more delays as russian ironworks had problems rolling thicker armor plates mclaughlin pp 113 14 admiral spiridov class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessors and were long at waterline they had a beam of and a maximum draft of ships were designed to displace but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced they were fitted with a plough shaped ram admiral spiridovs had a double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by six main watertight bulkheads their crew consisted of 280 officers and crewmen mclaughlin pp 115 16 propulsion admiral spiridov class had a single two cylinder horizontal direct acting steam engine it had a bore of and a stroke of and drove a single three bladed propeller steam was provided by four rectangular fire tube boilers at a pressure of engine was designed to produce a total of which gave ships speeds between when they ran their initial sea trials in 1869 monitors also had a donkey boiler for small steam engine that powered ventilation fans and pumps admiral spiridov class carried of coal which gave them a range of about at a speed of 10 knots they were fitted with a light fore and aft sailing rig with three pole masts and a bowsprit it had an area of and its primary purpose was to steady ships and assist in turning mclaughlin pp 116 122 23 armament monitors were ultimately designed to be armed with four obukhov 9 inch rifled guns a pair in each coles type turret an armored bulkhead separated guns inside each turret in 1874 75 guns were replaced by a single gun in each turret based on a krupp design during russo turkish war of 1877 78 a 9 inch mortar was fitted to attack thin deck armor of enemy ships but accuracy was poor and they were later removed probably in early 1880s an improved more powerful 11 inch gun was installed aboard admiral chichagov during 1880s although admiral spiridov retained her original guns until 1902 if not for rest of her career mclaughlin pp 118 19 light guns for use against torpedo boats were added to admiral spiridov class ships during russo turkish war when a pair of 4 pounder guns were mounted on roofs of each gun turret other guns known have been fitted included baranov quick firing qf guns qf hotchkiss guns and qf hotchkiss five barreled revolving cannon ships could also carry 12 15 mines intended to be used to create a secure anchorage mclaughlin pp 119 20 armor hull of admiral spiridov class monitors was completely covered by three strakes of wrought iron armor upper two were about high and lower one below waterline was high middle strake was thick for a length of amidships and other strakes were generally thick upper strake was thick abreast turrets armor thinned to aft and forward of main belt this outermost layer of armor was backed by 9 inches of teak reinforced with angle irons and then came 1 inch inner armor plates backed in its turn by another 9 inches of teak mclaughlin pp 121 122 turrets had 6 inches of armor except around gun ports where it thickened to 6 5 inches reinforced by 12 inches of teak conning tower was thick deck armor was in two layers with a total thickness of 1 inch that were separated by a layer of cloth or felt to better deflect glancing hits expected upper layer was thick and lower was mclaughlin p 122 ships

waters around saint petersburg prevented deep draft ships from being completed this added more delays as dockyard there lacked equipment to efficiently fit out ships both ships were assigned to baltic fleet upon completion they were not fully equipped until around 1872 and their trials continued until 1873 admiral spiridov accidentally rammed monitor in kronstadt harbor in 1871 and her sister collided with monitor four years later neither ship was seriously damaged several days after collision admiral chichagov struck a sandbank at full speed while not damaged in incident she was very firmly stuck and early attempts to pull her off failed during which one seaman was killed and an officer badly wounded monitor had to be unloaded as much as possible and her forward guns were removed before she was freed from sandbank five days after running aground mclaughlin pp 114 124 26 ships received electric dynamos and searchlights were installed in late 1870s admiral chichagov served as flagship for captain 1st rank stepan makarov during 1885 naval maneuvers in approaches to gulf of riga and her boilers were replaced in two years later steam powered steering gear was installed in sisters in 1887 and they were reclassified as coast defense ironclads on 13 february 1892 by this time their role in russian war plans was to defend gulf of riga against an anticipated german amphibious landing mclaughlin pp 123 24 in 1900 they were transferred to kronstadt engineering school as training ships before they were transferred to port of kronstadt on 31 march 1907 for disposal sisters were stricken on 14 august and admiral spiridov became a stationary coal storage barge while admiral chichagov was grounded near reval and used as a target their subsequent fates are unknown
