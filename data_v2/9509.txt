in myth and art impalement was also used during times of war to suppress rebellions punish traitors or collaborators and punish breaches of military discipline offenses where impalement was occasionally employed included contempt for state s responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing highway robbery or grave robbery violating state policies or monopolies or subverting

eastern slovakia case of a woman who was to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants first a grave some one and a half ell deep was dug woman was then placed within it her hands and feet were secured by driving nails through them executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face he then placed and held vertically a wooden stave on her heart in order to mark its location while his assistants piled earth on woman keeping her head free of earth at behest of clerics because to do otherwise would have quickened death process once earth had been piled upon her executioner used a pair of tongs to grab a rod made of iron which had been made red hot he positioned glowing iron rod beside wooden stave and as one of his assistants hammered rod in other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon woman s head it is said that a scream was heard and earth moved upwards for a moment before it was all over wagner 1687 p 55 note german word with associated verb zu

ottoman empire and its territories like egypt in late 1650s emphasizes regional variations in impalement frequency of constantinople and turkey de thevenot writes that impalement was not much practised and very rarely put in practice an exception he highlighted was situation of christians in constantinople if a christian spoke or acted out against law of mahomet or consorted with a turkish woman or broke into a mosque then he might face impalement unless he converted to islam in contrast de thevenot says that in egypt impalement was a very ordinary punishment against arabs there whereas turks in egypt were strangled in prison instead of being publicly executed like natives see de thevenot 1687 p 68 69 and p 259 thus actual frequency of impalement within ottoman empire varied greatly not only from time to time but also from place to place and between different population groups in empire highway robbers were still impaled into 1830s but one source says practice was rare by then
