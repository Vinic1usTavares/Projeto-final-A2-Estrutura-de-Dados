egyptian temples were built for official worship of gods and in commemoration of pharaohs in ancient egypt and regions under egyptian control temples were seen as houses for gods or kings to whom they were dedicated within them egyptians performed a variety of rituals central functions of egyptian religion giving offerings to gods reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals and warding off forces of chaos these rituals were seen as necessary for gods to continue to uphold maat divine order of universe housing and caring for gods were obligations of pharaohs who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance out of necessity pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties to a host of priests but most of populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple s most sacred areas nevertheless a temple was an important religious site for all classes of egyptians who went there to pray give offerings and seek oracular guidance from god dwelling within most important part of temple was sanctuary which typically contained a cult image a statue of its god rooms outside sanctuary grew larger and more elaborate over time so that temples evolved from small shrines in late prehistoric egypt late fourth millennium bc to large stone edifices in new kingdom c 1550 1070 bc and later these edifices are among largest and most enduring examples of egyptian architecture with their elements arranged and decorated according to complex patterns of religious symbolism their typical design consisted of a series of enclosed halls open courts and entrance pylons aligned along path used for festival processions beyond temple proper was an outer wall enclosing a wide variety of secondary buildings a large temple also owned sizable tracts of land and employed thousands of laymen to supply its needs temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence and despite their ostensible subordination to king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority temple building in egypt continued despite nation s decline and ultimate loss of independence to roman empire in 30 bc with coming of christianity traditional egyptian religion faced increasing persecution and temple cults died out during fourth through sixth centuries ad buildings they left behind suffered centuries of destruction and neglect at start of nineteenth century a wave of interest in ancient egypt swept europe giving rise to discipline of egyptology and drawing increasing numbers of visitors to civilization s remains dozens of temples survive today and some have become world famous tourist attractions that contribute significantly to modern egyptian economy egyptologists continue to study surviving temples and remains of destroyed ones as invaluable sources of information about ancient egyptian society functions religious thumb right alt relief showing an ornately dressed egyptian man reaching toward a male figure on a pedestal low relief of seti i performing rituals for god amun ancient egyptian temples were meant as places for gods to reside on earth indeed term egyptians most commonly used to describe temple building hwt ntr means mansion or enclosure of a god a divine presence in temple linked human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with god through ritual these rituals it was believed sustained god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature they were therefore a key part of maintenance of maat ideal order of nature and of human society in egyptian belief maintaining maat was entire purpose of egyptian religion and it was purpose of a temple as well because he was credited with divine power himself pharaoh as a sacred king was regarded as egypt s representative to gods and its most important upholder of maat thus it was theoretically his duty to perform temple rites while it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies existence of temples across egypt made it impossible for him to do so in all cases and most of time these duties were delegated to priests pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain provide for and expand temples throughout his realm although pharaoh delegated his authority performance of temple rituals was still an official duty restricted to high ranking priests participation of general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited much of lay religious activity in egypt instead took place in private and community shrines separate from official temples as primary link between human and divine realms temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary egyptians each temple had a principal deity and most were dedicated to other gods as well not all deities had temples dedicated to them many demons and household gods were involved primarily in magical or private religious practice with little or no presence in temple ceremonies there were also other gods who had significant roles in cosmos but for uncertain reasons were not honored with temples of their own of those gods who did have temples of their own many were venerated mainly in certain areas of egypt though many gods with a strong local tie were also important across nation even deities whose worship spanned country were strongly associated with cities where their chief temples were located in egyptian creation myths first temple originated as a shelter for a god which god it was varied according to city that stood on mound of land where process of creation began each temple in egypt therefore was equated with this original temple and with site of creation itself as primordial home of god and mythological location of city s founding temple was seen as hub of region from which city s patron god ruled over it pharaohs also built temples where offerings were made to sustain their spirits in afterlife often linked with or located near their tombs these temples are traditionally called mortuary temples and regarded as essentially different from divine temples in recent years some egyptologists such as gerhard have argued that there is no clear division between two egyptians did not refer to mortuary temples by any distinct name nor were rituals for dead and rituals for gods mutually exclusive symbolism surrounding death was present in all egyptian temples worship of gods was present to some degree in mortuary temples and egyptologist stephen quirke has said that at all periods royal cult involves gods but equally all cult of gods involves king even so certain temples were clearly used to commemorate deceased kings and to give offerings to their spirits their exact purpose is not fully understood they may have been meant to unite king with gods elevating him to a divine status greater than that of ordinary kingship in any case difficulty of separating divine and mortuary temples reflects close intertwining of divinity and kingship in egyptian belief economic and administrative temples were also key centers of economic activity largest of them required prodigious resources and employed tens of thousands of priests craftsmen and laborers temple s economic workings were analogous to those of a large egyptian household with servants dedicated to serving temple god as they might serve master of an estate this similarity is reflected in egyptian term for temple lands and their administration pr meaning house or estate some of temple s supplies came from direct donations by king in new kingdom when egypt was an imperial power these donations often came out of spoils of king s military campaigns or tribute given by his client states king might also levy various taxes that went directly to support a temple other revenue came from private individuals who offered land slaves or goods to temples in exchange for a supply of offerings and priestly services to sustain their spirits in afterlife thumb right alt relief showing two kneeling people carrying trays piled with plants jars of liquid and food sunk relief of personified provinces of egypt bearing offerings for temple god much of a temple s economic support came from its own resources these included large tracts of land beyond temple enclosure sometimes in a completely different region than temple itself most important type of property was farmland producing grain fruit or wine or supporting herds of livestock temple either managed these lands directly rented them out to farmers for a share of produce or managed them jointly with royal administration temples also launched expeditions into desert to collect resources such as salt honey or wild game or to mine precious minerals some owned fleets of ships with which to conduct their own trade across country or even beyond egypt s borders thus as richard h wilkinson says temple estate often represented no less than a slice of egypt itself as a major economic center and employer of a large part of local population temple enclosure was a key part of town in which it stood conversely when a temple was founded on empty land a new town was built to support it all this economic power was ultimately under pharaoh s control and temple products and property were often taxed their employees even priests were subject to state corvee system which conscripted labor for royal projects they could also be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes a trading expedition led by harkhuf in sixth dynasty c 2255 2246 bc was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished and mortuary temples of theban necropolis in new kingdom oversaw provision of royally employed tomb workers at deir el medina kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription royal administration could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand thus a king might increase income of temples of a god he favored and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead most drastic means of controlling temple estates was to completely revise distribution of their property nationwide which might extend to closing down certain temples such changes could significantly alter egypt s economic landscape temples were thus important instruments with which king managed nation s resources and its people as direct overseers of their own economic sphere administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed a challenge to authority of a weak pharaoh although it is unclear how independent they were once egypt became a roman province roman officials sought to limit temples power and independence temples were made to either pay rent to government for land they owned or surrender that land to state in exchange for a government stipend their cults became tightly regulated less self supporting and dependent on government donations and various small sources of revenue history and development early development earliest known shrines appeared in prehistoric egypt in late fourth millennium bc at sites such as sais and buto in lower egypt and nekhen and coptos in upper egypt most of these shrines were made of perishable materials such as wood reed matting and mudbrick despite impermanence of these early buildings later egyptian art continually reused and adapted elements from them evoking ancient shrines to suggest eternal nature of gods and their dwelling places in early dynastic period c 3100 2686 bc first pharaohs built funerary complexes in religious center of abydos following a single general pattern with a rectangular mud brick enclosure in old kingdom c 2686 2181 bc that followed early dynastic period royal funerary monuments greatly expanded while most divine temples remained comparatively small suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized cult of divine king more than direct worship of deities deities closely connected with king such as sun god ra received more royal contributions than other deities ra s temple at heliopolis was one of great religious centers of age and several old kingdom pharaohs built large sun temples in his honor near their pyramids meanwhile small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from predynastic times unaffected by royal cult sites thumb left 300px alt drawing of a pyramid surrounded by a wall a building with many rooms extends from one side of pyramid and at opposite end of

his complex entirely of stone and placed in enclosure a step pyramid under which he was buried pyramid of djoser for rest of old kingdom tomb and temple were joined in elaborate stone pyramid complexes near each pyramid complex was a town that supplied its needs as towns would support temples throughout egyptian history other changes came in reign of sneferu who beginning with his first pyramid at built pyramid complexes symmetrically along an east west axis with a valley temple on banks of nile linked to a pyramid temple at foot of pyramid sneferu s immediate successors followed this pattern but beginning in late old kingdom pyramid complexes combined different elements from axial plan and from rectangular plan of djoser to supply pyramid complexes kings founded new towns and farming estates on undeveloped lands across egypt flow of goods from these lands to central government and its temples helped unify kingdom rulers of middle kingdom c 2055 1650 bc continued building pyramids and their associated complexes rare remains from middle kingdom temples like one at medinet madi show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period and divine temples made increasing use of stone pattern of a sanctuary lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in middle kingdom temples and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts foreshadowing

statues and an obelisk entrance pylon of luxor temple one of major new kingdom temples with greater power and wealth during new kingdom c 1550 1070 bc egypt devoted still more resources to its temples which grew larger and more elaborate higher ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions and they controlled a large portion of egypt s wealth anthony spalinger suggests that as influence of temples expanded religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into temples increasingly important festival rituals most important god of time was amun whose main cult center precinct of amun re at karnak in thebes eventually became largest of all temples and whose high priests may have wielded considerable political influence many temples were now built entirely of stone and their general plan became fixed with sanctuary halls courtyards and pylon gateways oriented along path used for festival processions new kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples without pyramids to build around mortuary temples began using same plan as those dedicated to gods in middle of new kingdom pharaoh akhenaten promoted god aten over all others and eventually abolished official worship of most other gods traditional temples were neglected while new aten temples differing sharply in design and construction were erected but akhenaten s revolution was reversed soon after his death with traditional cults reinstated and new temples dismantled subsequent pharaohs dedicated still more resources to temples particularly ramesses ii most prolific monument builder in egyptian history as wealth of priesthoods continued to grow so did their religious influence temple oracles controlled by priests were an increasingly popular method of making decisions pharaonic power waned and in eleventh century bc a military leader made himself high priest of amun and de facto ruler of upper egypt beginning political fragmentation of third intermediate period c 1070 664 bc as new kingdom crumbled building of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived some rulers of third intermediate period such as those at tanis were buried within enclosures of divine temples thus continuing close link between temple and tomb later development in third intermediate period and following late period 664 323 bc weakened egyptian state fell to a series of outside powers experiencing only occasional periods of independence many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to kingship of egypt one such group kushite pharaohs of eighth and seventh centuries bc adopted egyptian style temple architecture for use in their native land of nubia beginning a long tradition of sophisticated nubian temple building amid this turmoil fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and independence of amun s priesthood was broken but power of priesthood in general remained thumb right alt small stone building surrounded by half walls and columns with elaborate capitals roman era mammisi at dendera temple despite political upheaval egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent temples focused more on popular religious activities such as oracles animal cults and prayer new architectural forms continued to develop such as covered kiosks in front of gateways more elaborate column styles and mammisi a building celebrating mythical birth of a god arnold 1999 pp 282 286 298 though characteristics of late temple style had developed by last period of native rule most of examples date from era of ptolemies greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years after rome conquered ptolemaic kingdom in 30 bc roman emperors took on role of ruler and temple patron reducing temples wealth and political power many temples in roman egypt continued to be built in egyptian style others including some that were dedicated to egyptian gods such as temple to isis at ras el soda were built in a style derived from roman architecture temple building continued into third century ad as empire weakened in crisis of third century imperial donations to temple cults dried up and almost all construction and decoration ceased cult activities at some sites continued relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from surrounding communities in following centuries christian emperors issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples some christians attacked and destroyed temples as in plundering of serapeum and other temples in alexandria in ad 391 or 392 through some combination of christian coercion and loss of funds temples ceased to function at various times last temple cults died out in fourth through sixth centuries ad although locals may have venerated some sites long after regular ceremonies there had ceased construction thumb upright alt a stone wall that has eroded so that joints between blocks are exposed blocks have straight edges but uneven shapes stone construction in a temple wall temples were built throughout upper and lower egypt as well as at egyptian controlled oases in libyan desert as far west as siwa and at outposts in sinai peninsula such as timna in periods when egypt dominated nubia egyptian rulers also built temples there as far south as jebel barkal most egyptian towns had a temple but in some cases as with mortuary temples or temples in nubia temple was a new foundation on previously empty land exact site of a temple was often chosen for religious reasons it might for example be mythical birthplace or burial place of a god temple axis might also be designed to align with locations of religious significance such as site of a neighboring temple or rising place of sun or particular stars great temple of abu simbel for instance is aligned so that twice a year rising sun illuminates statues of gods in its innermost room most temples were aligned toward nile with an axis running roughly east west an elaborate series of foundation rituals preceded construction a further set of rituals followed temple s completion dedicating it to its patron god these rites were conducted at least in theory by king as part of his religious duties indeed in egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work in reality it was work of hundreds of his subjects conscripted in corvee system construction process for a new temple or a major addition to an existing one could last years or decades use of stone in egyptian temples emphasized their purpose as eternal houses for gods and set them apart from buildings for use of mortals which were built of mudbrick early temples were built of brick and other perishable materials and most of outlying buildings in temple enclosures remained brick built throughout egyptian history main stones used in temple construction were limestone and sandstone which are common in egypt stones that are harder and more difficult to carve such as granite were used in smaller amounts for individual elements like obelisks stone might be quarried nearby or shipped on nile from quarries elsewhere temple structures were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand filled trenches in most periods walls and other structures were built with large blocks of varying shape blocks were laid in courses usually without mortar each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked interiors of walls were often built with less care using rougher poorer quality stones to build structures above ground level workers used construction ramps built of varying materials such as mud brick or rough stone when cutting chambers in living rock workers excavated from top down carving a crawlspace near ceiling and cutting down to floor once temple structure was complete rough faces of stones were dressed to create a smooth surface in decorating these surfaces reliefs were carved into stone or if stone was of too poor quality to carve a layer of plaster that covered stone surface reliefs were then decorated with gilding inlay or paint paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments with some kind of adhesive possibly natural gum temple construction did not end once original plan was complete pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing in course of these additions they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for interiors of new structures on rare occasions this may have been because old structures or their builders had become anathema as with akhenaten s temples but in most cases reason seems to have been convenience such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort original temple plan as happened at enormous precinct of amun re at karnak which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples design and decoration thumb right upright alt rectangular stone building from above with courtyards and pylons at front and remains of walls at back a rectangular wall and foundations of other buildings surround main building temple of ramesses iii at medinet habu surrounded by remains of subsidiary structures like all ancient egyptian architecture egyptian temple designs emphasized order symmetry and monumentality and combined geometric shapes with stylized organic motifs elements of temple design also alluded to form of earliest egyptian buildings cornices at tops of walls for instance were made to imitate rows of palm fronds placed atop archaic walls and batter of exterior walls while partly meant to ensure stability was also a holdover from archaic building methods temple ground plans usually centered on an axis running on a slight incline from sanctuary down to temple entrance in fully developed pattern used in new kingdom and later path used for festival processions a broad avenue punctuated with large doors served as this central axis path was intended primarily for god s use when it traveled outside sanctuary on most occasions people used smaller side doors typical parts of a temple such as column filled hypostyle halls open peristyle courts and towering entrance pylons were arranged along this path in a traditional but flexible order beyond temple building proper outer walls enclosed numerous satellite buildings entire area enclosed by these walls is sometimes called temenos sacred precinct dedicated to god temple pattern could vary considerably apart from distorting effect of additional construction many temples known as hypogea were cut entirely into living rock as at abu simbel or had rock cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons as at wadi es they used much same layout as free standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms in some temples like mortuary temples at deir el bahari processional path ran up a series of terraces rather than sitting on a single level ptolemaic temple of kom ombo was built with two main sanctuaries producing two parallel axes that run length of building most idiosyncratic temple style was that of aten temples built by akhenaten at el amarna in which axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars traditional design was a highly symbolic variety of sacred architecture it was a greatly elaborated variant on design of an egyptian house reflecting its role as god s home moreover temple represented a piece of divine realm on earth elevated enclosed sanctuary was equated with sacred hill where world was created in egyptian myth and with burial chamber of a tomb where god s ba or spirit came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ba came to inhabit its mummy this crucial place egyptians believed had to be insulated from impure outside world therefore as one moved toward sanctuary amount of outside light decreased and restrictions on who could enter increased yet temple could also represent world itself processional way could therefore stand for path of sun traveling across sky and sanctuary for duat where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night space outside building was thus equated with waters of chaos that lay outside world while temple represented order of cosmos and place where that order was continually renewed inner chambers thumb right upright alt small room with a cabinet like structure near back shrine in cella of temple of edfu temple s inner chambers centered on sanctuary of temple s primary god which typically lay along axis near back of temple building and in pyramid temples directly against pyramid base sanctuary was focus of temple ritual place where divine presence manifested most strongly form in which it manifested itself varied in aten temples and traditional solar shrines object of ritual was sun itself or a stone representing sun worshipped in a court open to sky in many mortuary temples inner areas contained statues of deceased pharaoh or a false door where his b personality egyptological ba was believed to appear to receive offerings in most temples focus was cult image a statue of temple god which that god s ba was believed to inhabit while interacting with humans sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos a cabinet like shrine that housed divine image or a model barque containing image within its cabin which was used to carry image during festival processions in some cases sanctuary may have housed several cult statues to emphasize sanctuary s sacred nature it was kept in total darkness whereas in earlier times sanctuary lay at very back of building in late and ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside temple further insulated from outside world by surrounding corridors and rooms subsidiary chapels dedicated to deities associated with primary god lay to sides of main one when main temple god was male secondary chapels were often dedicated to that god s mythological consort and child secondary chapels in mortuary temples were devoted to gods associated with kingship several other rooms neighbored sanctuary many of these rooms were used to store ceremonial equipment ritual texts or temple valuables others had specific ritual functions room where offerings were given to deity was often separate from sanctuary itself and in temples without a barque in sanctuary there was a separate shrine to store barque in late temples ritual areas could extend to chapels on roof and crypts below floor finally in exterior wall at back of temple there were often niches for laymen to pray to temple god as close as they could come to its dwelling place halls and courts thumb right upright alt large shadowy room filled with tall thick columns column capitals are shaped like stylized flowers hypostyle hall of esna temple hypostyle halls covered rooms filled with columns appear in temples throughout egyptian history by new kingdom they typically lay directly in front of sanctuary area these halls were less restricted than inner rooms being open to laymen at least in some cases they were often less dark as well new kingdom halls rose into tall central passages over processional path allowing a clerestory to provide dim light epitome of this style is great hypostyle hall at karnak whose largest columns are tall in later periods egyptians favored a different style of hall where a low screen wall at front let in light shadowy halls whose columns were often shaped to imitate plants such as lotus or papyrus were symbolic of mythological marsh that surrounded primeval mound at time of creation columns could also be equated with pillars that held up sky in egyptian cosmology beyond hypostyle hall were one or more peristyle courts open to sky these open courts which had been a part of egyptian temple design since old kingdom became transitional areas in standard plan of new kingdom lying between public space outside temple and more restricted areas within here public met with priests and assembled during festivals at front of each court was usually a pylon a pair of trapezoidal towers flanking main gateway pylon is known from only scattered examples in old and middle kingdoms but in new it quickly became distinctive and imposing facade common to most egyptian temples pylon served symbolically as a guard tower against forces of disorder and may also have been meant to resemble hieroglyph for horizon underscoring temple s solar symbolism front of every pylon held niches for pairs of flagpoles to stand unlike pylons such flags had stood at temple entrances since earliest predynastic shrines they were so closely associated with presence of a deity that hieroglyph for them came to stand for egyptian word for god enclosure outside temple building proper was temple enclosure surrounded by a rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected sacred space from outside disorder on occasion this function was more than symbolic especially during last native dynasties in fourth century bc when walls were fully fortified in case of invasion by achaemenid empire in late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks so that top of wall vertically this pattern may have been meant to evoke mythological waters of chaos thumb right alt vaulted brick buildings brick storehouses at ramesseum walls enclosed many buildings related to temple s function some enclosures contain satellite chapels dedicated to deities associated with temple god including mammisis celebrating birth of god s mythological child sacred lakes found in many temple enclosures served as reservoirs for water used in rituals as places for priests to ritually cleanse themselves and as representations of water from which world emerged mortuary temples sometimes contain a palace for spirit of king to whom temple was dedicated built against temple building proper mortuary temple of seti i at abydos incorporates an unusual underground structure osireion which may have served as a symbolic tomb for king in some temples provided a place for sick to await healing dreams sent by god other temple buildings included kitchens workshops and storehouses to supply temple s needs especially important was pr nh house of life where temple edited copied and stored its religious texts including those used for temple rituals house of life also functioned as a general center of learning containing works on non religious subjects such as history geography astronomy and medicine although these outlying buildings were devoted to more mundane purposes than temple itself they still had religious significance even granaries might be used for specific ceremonies through enclosure ran processional path which led from temple entrance through main gate in enclosure wall path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations where priests carrying festival barque could set it down to rest during procession processional path usually ended in a quay on nile which served as entrance point for river borne visitors and exit point for festival procession when it traveled by water in old kingdom pyramid temples quay adjoined an entire temple valley temple which was linked to pyramid temple by processional causeway decoration thumb right upright alt stone doorway whose jambs and lintels are covered with images and hieroglyphs in relief reliefs are painted various colors decoration on and ceilings at medinet habu temple building was elaborately decorated with reliefs and free standing sculpture all with religious significance as with cult statue gods were believed to be present in these images temple with sacred power symbols of places in egypt or parts of cosmos enhanced mythical geography already present in temple s architecture images of rituals served to reinforce rituals magical effect and to perpetuate that effect even if rituals ceased to be performed because of their religious nature these decorations showed an idealized version of reality emblematic of temple s purpose rather than real events for instance king was shown performing most rituals while priests if depicted were secondary it was unimportant that he was rarely present for these ceremonies it was his role as an intermediary with gods that mattered most important form of decoration is relief relief became more extensive over time and in late temples walls ceilings columns and beams were all decorated as were free standing stelae erected within enclosure egyptian artists used both bas relief and sunken relief bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief sunken relief was therefore used on harder more difficult stone and when builders wanted to finish quickly it was also appropriate for exterior surfaces where shadows it created made figures stand out in bright sunlight finished reliefs were painted using basic colors black white red yellow green and blue although artists often mixed pigments to create other colors and ptolemaic temples were especially varied using unusual colors such as purple as accents in some temples gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint temple decoration is among most important sources of information on ancient egypt it includes calendars of festivals accounts of myths depictions of rituals and texts of hymns pharaohs recorded their temple building activities and their campaigns against enemies of egypt ptolemaic temples go further to include information of all kinds taken from temple libraries decoration in a given room either depicts actions performed there or has some symbolic tie to room s purpose providing a great deal of information on temple activities interior walls were divided into several registers lowest registers were decorated with plants representing primeval marsh while ceilings and tops of walls were decorated with stars and flying birds to represent sky illustrations of rituals surrounded by text related to rituals often filled middle and upper registers courts and exterior walls often recorded king s military exploits pylon showed smiting scene a motif in which king strikes down his enemies symbolizing defeat of forces of chaos text on walls was formal hieroglyphic script some texts were written in a cryptographic form using symbols in a different way than normal conventions of hieroglyphic writing cryptographic text became more widespread and more complex in ptolemaic times temple walls also frequently bear written or drawn graffiti both in modern languages and in ancient ones such as greek latin and demotic form of egyptian that was commonly used in greco roman times although not part of temple s formal decoration graffiti can be an important source of information about its history both when its cults were functioning and after its abandonment ancient graffiti for instance often mention names and titles of priests who worked in temple and modern travelers often inscribed their names in temples that they visited graffiti left by priests and pilgrims at philae include last ancient hieroglyphic text inscribed in ad 394 and last one in demotic script from ad 452 large free standing sculpture included obelisks tall pointed pillars that symbolized sun largest of them lateran obelisk was more than high they were often placed in pairs in front of pylons or elsewhere along temple axis statues of king which were similarly placed also reached colossal size colossi of memnon at mortuary temple of amenhotep iii and statue of ramesses ii at ramesseum are largest free standing statues made in ancient egypt there were also figures of gods often in sphinx form that served as symbolic guardians of temple most numerous statues were votive figures donated to temple by kings private individuals or even towns to gain divine favor they could depict god to whom they were dedicated people who donated statue or both most essential temple statues were cult images which were usually made of or decorated with precious materials such as gold and lapis lazuli personnel thumb right upright alt painting of a man with elaborate robes and a shaved head he holds up a cup from which rises a wisp of smoke a priest burning incense a temple needed many people to perform its rituals and support duties priests performed temple s essential ritual functions but in egyptian religious ideology they were far less important than king as temple decoration illustrates all ceremonies were in theory acts by king and priests merely stood in his place priests were therefore subject to king s authority and he had right to appoint anyone he wished to priesthood in fact in old and middle kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of year to serve temple in shifts once priesthood became more professional king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for highest ranking positions usually to reward a favorite official with a job or to intervene for political reasons in affairs of an important cult lesser appointments he delegated to his vizier or to priests themselves in latter case holder of an office named his own son as his successor or temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by wealthiest and most influential members of egyptian society until roman economic reforms reduced temples resources requirements for priesthood differed over time and among cults of different gods although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices little is known about what knowledge or training may have been required of officeholders priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in sacred space they shaved their heads and bodies washed several times a day and wore only clean linen clothing they were not required to be celibate but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god s mythology such as rules against eating meat of an animal that represented god acceptance of women into priesthood was variable in old kingdom many women served as priests but their presence in clergies declined drastically in middle kingdom before increasing in third intermediate period lesser positions such as that of a musician in ceremonies remained open to women in even most restrictive periods as did special role of a ceremonial consort of god this latter role was highly influential and most important of these consorts god s wife of amun even supplanted high priest of amun during late period at head of temple hierarchy was high priest who oversaw all temple s religious and economic functions and in largest cults was an important political figure beneath him might be as many as three grades of subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies while these higher ranks were full time positions from new kingdom onward lower grades of priesthood still worked in shifts over course of year whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks clergy also contained several ritual specialists prominent among these specialized roles was that of lector priest who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals and who hired out his magical services to laymen besides its priests a large temple employed singers musicians and dancers to perform during rituals plus farmers bakers artisans builders and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs in ptolemaic era temples could also house people who had sought asylum within precinct or recluses who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving god and living in its household a major cult therefore could have well over 150 full or part time priests with tens of thousands of non priestly employees working on its lands across country these numbers contrast with mid sized temples which may have had 10 to 25 priests and with smallest provincial temples which might have only one some priests duties took them beyond temple precinct they formed part of entourage in festivals that traveled from one temple to another and clergies from around country sent representatives to national sed festival that reinforced king s divine power some temples such as those in neighboring cities of memphis and were overseen by same high priest at certain times there was an administrative office that presided over all temples and clergies in old kingdom pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers in reign of thutmose iii office passed from viziers to high priests of amun who held it for much of new kingdom romans established a similar office that of high priest for all egypt which oversaw temple cults until their extinction religious activities daily rituals thumb right alt relief of an ornately dressed man kneeling and holding a tray of food and flowers amenhotep iii presents a variety of offerings in a relief from luxor temple daily rituals in most temples included two sequences of offering rites one to clean and dress god for day and one to present it with a meal exact order of events in these rituals is uncertain and may have varied somewhat each time they were performed in addition two sequences probably overlapped with each other at sunrise officiating priest entered sanctuary carrying a candle to light room he opened doors of shrine and prostrated himself before god s image reciting hymns in its praise he removed god from shrine clothed it replacing clothes of previous day and anointed it with oil and paint at some point priest presented god s meal including a variety of meats fruits vegetables and bread god was believed to consume only spiritual essence of this meal this belief allowed food to be distributed to others an act that egyptians called reversion of offerings food passed first to other statues throughout temple then to local funerary chapels for sustenance of dead and finally to priests who ate it quantities even for daily meal were so large that only a small part of it can have been placed on offering tables most of it must have gone directly to these secondary uses temple artwork often shows king presenting an image of goddess maat to temple deity an act that represented purpose of all other offerings king may have presented a real figurine of maat to deity or temple reliefs depicting act may have been purely symbolic other offering rituals took place at noon and at sunset though sanctuary was not reopened some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily including rituals specific to a particular god in cult of sun god ra for instance hymns were sung day and night for every hour of god s journey across sky many of ceremonies acted out in ritual battle against of forces of chaos they might for instance involve destruction of models of inimical gods like apep or set acts that were believed to have a real effect through principle of hk egyptological pronunciation heka coptic magic in fact egyptians believed that all ritual actions achieved their effect through hk it was a fundamental force that rituals were meant to manipulate using magic people objects and actions were equated with counterparts in divine realm and thus were believed to affect events among gods in daily offering for instance cult statue regardless of which deity it represented was associated with osiris god of dead priest performing ritual was identified with horus living son of osiris who in mythology sustained his father after death through offerings by magically equating himself with a god in a myth priest was able to interact with temple deity festivals on days of particular religious significance daily rituals were replaced with festival observances different festivals occurred at different intervals though most were annual their timing was based on egyptian civil calendar which most of time was far out of step with astronomical year thus while many festivals had a seasonal origin their timing lost its connection with seasons most festivals took place at a single temple but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of egypt a few were celebrated throughout country in new kingdom and later festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by priests in those festivals that involved a procession outside temple local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate these were most elaborate temple ceremonies accompanied by recitation of hymns and performance of musicians thumb right alt relief showing rows of men carrying poles that support a model boat priests carrying a festival barque in a relief from ramesseum festival ceremonies entailed reenactment of mythological events or performance of other symbolic acts like cutting of a sheaf of wheat during harvest related festival dedicated to god min many of these ceremonies took place only within temple building such as union with sun disk festival practiced in late period and afterward when cult statues were carried to temple roof at start of new year to be enlivened by rays of sun in festivals that involved a procession priests carried divine image out from sanctuary usually in its model barque to visit another site barque might travel entirely on land or be loaded onto a real boat to travel on river purpose of god s visit varied some were tied to ideology of kingship in festival an extremely important ceremony during new kingdom image of amun from karnak visited form of amun worshipped at luxor temple and both acted to reaffirm king s divine rule still other celebrations had a funerary character as in beautiful festival of valley when amun of karnak visited mortuary temples of theban necropolis to visit kings commemorated there while ordinary people visited funerary chapels of their own deceased relatives some may have centered on ritual marriages between deities or between deities and their human consorts although evidence that ritual marriage was their purpose is ambiguous a prominent example is a festival in which an image of hathor from dendera temple complex was brought annually to visit temple of edfu temple of her mythological consort horus these varied ceremonies were united by broad purpose of renewing life among gods and in cosmos gods involved in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among priests alone so it is likely that celebrating commoners also participated in reversion of these offerings sacred animals thumb right alt painting of a bull on a platform bull has a yellow disk and a pair of feathers between its horns apis some temples kept sacred animals which were believed to be manifestations of temple god s ba in same way that cult images were each of these sacred animals was kept in temple and worshipped for a certain length of time ranging from a year to lifetime of animal at end of that time it was replaced with a new animal of same species which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature among most prominent of these animals were apis a sacred bull worshipped as a manifestation of memphite god ptah and falcon at edfu who represented falcon god horus during late period a different form of worship involving animals developed in this case laymen paid priests to kill and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god these animals were not regarded as especially sacred but as a species they were associated with god because it was depicted in form of that animal god thoth for instance could be depicted as an ibis and as a baboon and both ibises and baboons were given to him although this practice was distinct from worship of single divine representatives some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose dunand and p 21 these practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals such as catacombs around serapeum of saqqara where apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings oracles by beginning of new kingdom and quite possibly earlier festival procession had become an opportunity for people to seek oracles from god their questions dealt with subjects ranging from location of a lost object to best choice for a government appointment motions of barque as it was carried on bearers shoulders making simple gestures to indicate yes or no tipping toward tablets on which possible answers were written or moving toward a particular person in crowd were taken to indicate god s reply in greco roman period and possibly much earlier oracles were used outside festival allowing people to consult them frequently priests interpreted movements of sacred animals or being asked questions directly wrote out or spoke answers that they had supposedly received from god in question priests claim to speak for gods or interpret their messages gave them great political influence and provided means for high priests of amun to dominate upper egypt during third intermediate period popular worship although they were excluded from formal rituals of temple laymen still sought to interact with gods there is little evidence of religious practices of individual people from early egyptian history so egyptologists understanding of subject derives mostly from new kingdom or later periods evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary egyptians used many venues to interact with divine such as household shrines or community chapels official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration thumb right upright alt statue of a kneeling man holding a box containing a small male figure votive statue of a man donating a shrine containing a figure of osiris unable to address cult image directly laymen still attempted to convey their prayers to it at times they related messages to priests to deliver to temple deity at other times they expressed their piety in parts of temple that they could access courts doorways and hypostyle halls might have spaces designated for public prayer sometimes people directed their appeals to royal colossi which were believed to act as divine intermediaries more private areas for devotion were located at building s outer wall where large niches served as chapels of hearing ear for individuals to speak to god egyptians also interacted with deities through donation of offerings ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts serving as memorials to donors after their deaths and receiving portions of temple offerings to sustain donors spirits other statues served as gifts to temple god and inscribed stelae conveyed to resident deity donors prayers and messages of thanks over centuries so many of these statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of way by burying them in caches beneath floor commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives form of these models may indicate reason for their donation figurines of women are among most common types of votive figures and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child festival processions offered a chance for laymen to approach and perhaps even glimpse cult image in its barque and for them to receive portions of god s food because key rituals of any festival still took place within temple out of public sight egyptologist anthony spalinger has questioned whether processions inspired genuine religious feelings or were simply seen as occasions for revelry in any case oracular events during festivals provided an opportunity for people to receive responses from normally isolated deities as did other varieties of oracle that developed late in egyptian history temples eventually became a venue for yet another type of divine contact dreams egyptians saw dreaming as a means of communion with divine realm and by ptolemaic period many temples provided buildings for ritual incubation people slept in these buildings in hopes of contacting temple god petitioners often sought a magical solution to sickness or infertility at other times they sought an answer to a question receiving answer through a dream rather than an oracle after abandonment after their original religious activities ceased egyptian temples suffered slow decay many were defaced by christians trying to erase remnants of ancient egyptian religion some temple buildings such as mammisi at dendera or hypostyle hall at philae were adapted into churches or other types of buildings most commonly sites were left disused as at temple of khnum at elephantine while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times limestone was especially useful as a source of lime so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled sandstone temples found mostly in upper egypt were more likely to survive what humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand while those near nile particularly in lower egypt were often buried under layers of river borne silt thus some major temple sites like memphis were reduced to ruin while many temples far from nile and centers of population remained mostly intact with understanding of hieroglyphic script lost information about egyptian culture that was preserved in surviving temples lay incomprehensible to world situation changed dramatically with french campaign in egypt and syria in 1798 which brought with it a corps of scholars to examine surviving ancient monuments results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient egypt throughout europe in early nineteenth century growing numbers of europeans traveled to egypt both to see ancient monuments and to collect egyptian antiquities many temple artifacts from small objects to enormous obelisks were removed by outside governments and private collectors this wave of egyptomania resulted in rediscovery of temple sites such as abu simbel but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness discoveries of period made possible decipherment of egyptian hieroglyphs and beginnings of egyptology as a scholarly discipline thumb reconstruction work on a pylon at karnak from whose interior blocks from amarna period are being retrieved nineteenth century egyptologists studied temples intensively but their emphasis was on collection of artifacts to send to their own countries and their slipshod excavation methods often did further harm slowly antique hunting attitude toward egyptian monuments gave way to careful study and preservation efforts government also took greater control of archaeological activity as egypt s independence from foreign powers increased yet even in recent times ancient remains have faced threats most severe was construction of aswan dam in 1960s which threatened to submerge temples in what had been lower nubia beneath newly formed lake nasser a major effort by united nations disassembled some of threatened monuments and rebuilt them on higher ground and egyptian government gave several of others such as temple of temple of and temple of as gifts to nations that had contributed to preservation effort nevertheless several other temples vanished beneath lake today there are dozens of sites with substantial temple remains pt v passim although many more once existed and none of major temples in lower or middle egypt are well preserved those that are well preserved such as karnak luxor and abu simbel draw tourists from around world and are therefore a key attraction for egyptian tourist industry which is a major sector of egyptian economy three temple sites ancient thebes with its necropolis memphis and its necropolis and nubian monuments from abu simbel to philae have been designated by unesco as world heritage sites egyptian government is working to balance demands of tourism against need to protect ancient monuments from harmful effects of tourist activity archaeological work continues as well as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied some damaged or destroyed structures like temples of akhenaten are even being reconstructed these efforts are improving modern understanding of egyptian temples which in turn allow a
