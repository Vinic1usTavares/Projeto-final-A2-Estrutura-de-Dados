entertainment europe wanted a launch game for playstation portable console and ordered studio to develop game in time for console s release due to short notice studio was given only a year to develop a game thus it was decided that a remake of original medievil would be suitable as developing an original title would take more time to develop despite success of previous games in medievil series only three original team members were involved in making of medievil resurrection chris sorrell creator of medievil stressed in a retrospective interview that he would have preferred to direct resurrection if he was not at time instructed to direct video game adaptation of 24 since release of resurrection sorrell expressed disappointment with changes made to game and fact that his superiors did not allow him to direct it but praised team s ability for working under a time constraint piers jackson was instead appointed as producer for resurrection he directed overall development of title working closely with a new design team led by dominic mitch phillips who was character animator for previous two installments was appointed as lead artist for game phillips along with paul arnold and andrew barnabas musical duo more commonly known as bob barn who composed original soundtrack for medievil were only people from original team to return according to piers jackson thrust of design was to produce a title that could showcase full abilities of playstation portable including its built in wi fi capabilities jackson also asserted that resurrection was an entirely different game from original whilst studio had taken basic story and some of locations from original game all code graphics and voice actors were changed new additions to resurrection included an expanded plot added mini games multiplayer facilities and a cloud save function during late stages of development studio attempted to preserve ideas that they thought worked well in original though their uses were altered or repositioned to keep game fresh even to those who had played original addition of anubis stone sub plot was to strengthen story arc and creation of al zalam was to act as dan s internal monologue as well as player s guide music soundtrack in resurrection is orchestrated unlike first installment approximately half of themes from original were removed while new themes were created to fit with new levels music is split into two halves cues from first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues from original game with addition of extra thematic elements to strengthen them other half of music is original and composed exclusively for resurrection new soundtrack was composed by bob barn and features performances from members of city of prague philharmonic orchestra that was recorded in czech republic orchestra headed by nic raine consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir also recorded in same venue this follows tradition of sce cambridge studio s previous orchestral game primal which was also recorded in prague by same performers reception medievil resurrection received mixed reviews upon release it received an aggregate score of 69 from gamerankings and a score of 66 from metacritic general criticisms from reviewers were directed at camera controls which was cited as being particularly poor during combat sequences and occasionally being cause for frame rate drops jason allen of ign noted that camera angles were not as bad during open areas of game but became rather clumsy in middle of a heated battle kristan reed of eurogamer expressed similar concerns with camera work stating that camera was sloppy and that it proved particularly difficult during combat when enemies were to suddenly appear off screen combat was also criticized for its poor hit detection greg mueller of gamespot noted that poor collision detection turned most of combat sequences to a frustrating and tedious experience reed similarly criticized combat system citing that system is unremarkable on basic level and was disappointed with lack of technical additions to game allen also expressed concern with fighting mechanics stating that every melee attack was inaccurate and clumsy combined with cumbersome camera work graphics and voice talent were most praised aspects of game especially tom baker s role as narrator and grim reaper mueller praised soundtrack and dialogue stating that best part of game is easily sound and that voice of any character fits their role perfectly making them more interesting than average voice over reed also praised baker s role in game stating that voice overs and audio were most enjoyable experiences in resurrection also citing that baker s voice performance was majestic and eccentric chris of gamespy felt that overall dialogue was heavy on stereotypical accent but was assured that players would enjoy electric atmosphere of medievil which he often compared to that of tim burton s nightmare before christmas chris sorrell and jason wilson co creators of medievil had also expressed disappointment with game neither of them had any involvement with medievil resurrection and when they were asked about game during a retrospective interview with wilson felt disheartened with having to watch something he cherished to be altered with decisions he thought were questionable sorrell felt similar disappointment in redesign of game and there were a number of aspects of it that he disagreed with he did however praise development team of resurrection stating that they did an awesome job considering time constraints they were up against references external links category 2005 video games category action adventure games category fantasy video games set in middle ages
