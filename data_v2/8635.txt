diamond peak is a volcano in klamath and lane counties of central oregon in united states it is a shield volcano though it might also be considered a modest stratocone diamond peak forms part of cascade volcanic arc a segment of cascade range in western north america extending from southern british columbia through oregon to northern california reaching an elevation of mountain is located near willamette pass in diamond peak wilderness within deschutes and willamette national forests surrounded by coniferous forest and visible in skyline from foothills near eugene diamond peak offers a few climbing routes and can be scrambled volcano consisting mostly of basaltic andesite has relatively steep slopes and an andesitic volcanic cone that contains pyroclastic materials at its core mountain has a number of subfeatures including mount yoran lakeview mountain and a number of cinder cones diamond peak was thoroughly eroded by glaciers and has several cirques as a result geography thumb diamond peak as seen from willamette pass alt a mountain with steep slopes covered in snow rises above dense forest located north of mount bailey and diamond lake in u s state of oregon diamond peak volcano represents predominant feature of willamette pass locality on border of klamath and lane counties reaching an elevation of and can be seen from many summits in western oregon wilderness diamond peak wilderness located southeast of eugene and southwest of bend encompasses an area of jointly administered by willamette national forest on west and deschutes national forest on east it incorporates of pacific crest trail and of additional trails forested landscape below diamond peak features several lakes and creeks as wilderness area ranges in elevation from diamond peak is highest and most predominant peak though five other mountains reach elevations greater than mount yoran an unnamed 7 138 foot peak near mount yoran crater butte lakeview mountain and redtop mountain wilderness area is largely inaccessible by road in winter season though its northern side can be reached from gold lake sno park on oregon route 58 geology thumb 350px diamond peak seen from northeast with mount yoran at far right in january 2016 alt broad slopes of diamond peak sit above a forest with steeper yet smaller mount yoran volcano to its right diamond peak forms part of central arc of cascade volcanoes and it joins several other volcanoes in eastern segment of cascade range known as high cascades formed towards end of pleistocene epoch these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north south faulting in surrounding region high cascades consist mostly of pleistocene volcanoes constructed on top of upper cenozoic lava flows and volcanic vents produced within last 15 million years with compositions varying from homogenous mafic lava flows rich in magnesium and iron and pyroclastic rocks to lava more enriched with basalt and rhyodacite composed of of basaltic andesite and of andesite diamond peak is a shield volcano though it might be considered a modest stratocone because of its steep slopes and pyroclastic materials at its core having produced andesite diamond peak represents one of few mafic shield volcanoes in cascades that are known to grade into andesite along with mount defiance mount bailey devils peak and prospect peak it consists of a main cone made of pyroclastic material including rock along with basaltic andesite cinders and glassy scoria as well as thin layers of basaltic andesite lava flows diamond peak has two overlapping volcanic cones with elder edifice making up its lower northern peak volcano does not show evidence of producing lahars eruptive activity began at an eruptive vent by diamond peak s northern summit and shortly after eruptions commenced at a second slightly higher vent closer to southern summit though diamond peak s eruptions always produced olivine rich basaltic andesite they likely grew more rich in silicon dioxide over time ranging from 55 to 58 percent silicon dioxide lava flows from volcano vary from in thickness rich in porphyritic rocks like olivine plagioclase and clinopyroxene there is no silicic rock rich in silica in diamond peak vicinity mazama ash including pumice up to thick as well as plagioclase pyroxene and hornblende crystals can be found throughout diamond peak wilderness area and represents newest volcanic rock deposited in region in total eruptive output probably totaled in volume volcano is older than last glacial period that ended 11 000 years ago but probably younger than 100 000 years though its lava flows show residual magnetism volcano does not display evidence of activity within past 10 000 years suggesting that it may now be extinct lavas intrusive volcanic rocks and volcanic vents have largely gone unaltered by erosion or other geological processes besides sparse mineralization as a result of volcanic processes though there are tiny amounts of specular hematite and malachite in cracks among lava flows heavily eroded by glaciers which no longer exist on diamond peak mountain has several cirques from glacial erosion some of which have talus deposits due to holocene glacial motion glaciers also placed both lateral and ground moraines along lower to middle elevations of wilderness area pebble deposits interbedded with sand and rock these deposits have very few weathering rinds corresponding to their production during late pleistocene diamond peak lies directly on cascade crest and therefore receives a heavy snowpack snowfields on northern side may have been glaciers as recently as 100 years ago subfeatures nearby features include crater butte a basaltic andesite cinder cone volcano to southeast and redtop mountain to east and composed of basalt both mountains are likely close to same age as diamond peak and are formed by layers of red and black lapilli scoria and volcanic bombs earliest strata have been converted to palagonite with a yellow orange color that was derived from volcanic glass emigrant butte a basaltic andesite peak to south has been altered more extensively by glaciers and therefore is likely older mount yoran is a significantly older mountain made from basaltic andesite lava that has a summit protruding from northern slope of diamond peak it has been potassium argon dated to be between 520 000 and 220 000 years old a shield volcano yoran is often considered one of subfeatures of diamond peak along with diamond rockpile cinder cone and crater butte yoran and nearby stratovolcano lakeview mountain have similar compositions to diamond peak with dissected cones made of pyroclastic material with embedded lava flows both volcanoes have been invaded with sills fed by dikes that can be traced to nearby volcanic plugs ecology ecology of diamond peak is characteristic of oregon cascades forests supported by wilderness area include flora such as lodgepole pine western white pine mountain hemlock noble fir and silver fir trees timberline is at an elevation of about along yoran lake there are forests of engelmann spruce silver fir and noble fir as well as a wet meadow local fauna include common animals found in cascade arc such as roosevelt elk black tailed deer red squirrels snowshoe hares and a number of bird species predators like american black bear and cougars are in area trout species can be found throughout wilderness lakes brook trout and rainbow trout appearing most often abundance of water supports mosquito populations particularly during early summer human history william macy and john diamond climbed diamond peak in july 1852 these two men were part of a preliminary survey party known as road viewers they climbed peak in order to plan a road that later became known as free emigrant road they named peak for diamond who was a pioneer from eugene road was completed in late september 1853 only days before some 1 027 people with 250 wagons arrived at deschutes river at what is now bend these emigrants known as lost wagon train of 1853 were following elijah elliott through central oregon high desert on what became known as elliott cutoff it took time to locate road because it was upstream on deschutes road led them to emigrant pass by summit lake and then down western side of pass in mid october emigrants were discovered on middle fork willamette river by settlers of upper willamette valley and a large rescue operation was launched to help emigrants reach settlements this emigration doubled population of lane county diamond peak and surrounding wilderness area have not been subject of any major mining operations besides old placers accumulations of valuable minerals formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes that can be found along crescent creek to east of diamond peak wilderness no mineral resources of interest have been identified in local area while cinder from red mountain and crater butte cinder cones estimated at a volume of might be useful for construction materials for road building there is plenty of cinder and rock outside of immediate vicinity of diamond peak closest mining operations took place in bohemia district which lies to west of diamond peak moreover volcano has little potential as a geothermal energy resource since surrounding area lacks hot springs therefore in 1980s surveyors determined that there is little future potential for mineral deposits or geothermal energy resources for diamond peak or wilderness area recreation though diamond peak cannot be accessed by paved roads it lies adjacent on its eastern side to pacific crest trail although mountain lacks a clearly denoted trail to top and itself has multiple peaks which can make identification of summit difficult summitting diamond peak is not a technical climb instead it is a physically demanding hike and scramble that climbs and runs for lasting between six and eight hours climbers can access diamond peak from two major trailheads at rockpile and summit lake to southeast of oakridge and eugene two major routes to southern summit offer views of summit lake and mount thielsen another route for climbing diamond peak begins from corrigan lake which can be reached by forest roads about past hills creek reservoir near oakridge corrigan lake trailhead starts at an elevation of following a forested trail toward diamond peak s western flank a challenging trip it demands use of crampons traction devices attached to footwear to improve mobility on snow and ice and ice axes are also recommended because of avalanche hazards on western side of diamond peak route can be dangerous climb runs about for round trip achieving peak s elevation of notes a this is acreage
