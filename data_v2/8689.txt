that controller s analog stick took time to get used to but functioned well alt a black and grey plastic game console attached via cables to a grey w shaped controller with colored buttons turok originally appeared in comics from western publishing and dell comics in december 1954 valiant comics revived series and published first issue of their turok series in 1993 video game publisher acclaim entertainment bought valiant for 65 million in 1994 and acquired developer iguana entertainment for 5 million plus stock a year later part of a strategy to develop games in house and make money licensing characters in different entertainment media turok was announced in august 1994 as an exclusive title for nintendo s planned ultra 64 console eventually called nintendo 64 development of turok commenced in 1996 while loosely based on comic book iguana made game more action oriented in early discussions about project developers decided that typical side scrolling game presentation had become tired iguana considered a third person perspective similar to super mario 64 and tomb raider but decided to make game a first person shooter instead according to project manager david dienstbier first person perspective was a natural way to showcase 3d power of nintendo 64 while development team benefited from acclaim s clout as a longtime nintendo supporter getting earlier feedback from publisher and more face to face time during production most of developers at iguana were new and inexperienced turok was dienstbier s first title due to game s action and violent content dienstbier believed they were pushing limits of what nintendo would allow on their console but nintendo never asked to see or approve anything in game nintendo 64 platform had superior processing capabilities compared to most personal computers available at time but also came with challenges nintendo 64 is capable of doing a lot of stuff dienstbier said if you want to handle fancy particle lighting and transparency effects and you want to throw around huge amounts of math or geometry onscreen it s got processing power to do that and yes it s a fantastic machine however calling it a developer s dream kinda gives you impression that it s easy to crank out a game like turok and it s definitely not while nintendo was supportive iguana had to produce all its game development tools internally fitting game on its 8 mb cartridge was difficult ultimately iguana had to compress everything and reduce quality of music to meet size requirements despite system constraints developers were interested in producing best looking video game for system game used real time lighting effects and particle systems for added realism iguana was able to use acclaim s state of art motion capture studio allowing humanoid characters to move smoothly and in a convincing manner motion capture helped alleviate problems of iguana s limited resources and tight schedule a stuntman recorded movements for human characters while developers tried to use emus and ostriches for dinosaurs results were only used as reference material at time acclaim entertainment was in financial jeopardy company was a major publisher in 16 bit era of games but company s sales suffered as it was slow to migrate from older game systems like sega genesis and super nintendo entertainment system to next generation platforms company lost 222 million in 1996 fiscal year due to sales falling to 162 million compared to 567 million previous year in first quarter of fiscal 1997 company lost a further 19 million company laid off 100 of its 950 workers since march 1996 and its stock had dropped from a high of 13 875 a share to as low as 3 turok acclaim s first nintendo 64 title became company s best hope of a turnaround as there were only ten nintendo 64 games on market and turok was only shooter turok was only major nintendo 64 software demonstrated at september 1996 european computer trade show with nintendo themselves absent from show alex brown inc analysts figured that selling one million copies of turok could bring acclaim as much as 45 million due to cash flow issues much of money planned for marketing turok was contingent on strong sales of magic gathering endangering turoks sales was its high price 79 99 in us ps70 in uk and 129 95 in australia and entertainment software rating board s mature rating which suggested lower sales as parents would not buy game for their children following game s success sculptured software another of acclaim s internal studios conducted tests to see if turok dinosaur hunter could be faithfully converted to playstation delay and release originally slated for a september 30 1996 release in north america game was initially delayed to january 1997 acclaim explained that game had not reached desired quality level nintendo maintained that delay was to add more depth to gameplay according to new york times delay stemmed from computer bugs in program acclaim heavily marketed turok on covers of video gaming magazines and in television commercials for nintendo 64 acclaim gave media outlets such as mirror customized turok branded game consoles to give away in sweepstakes responding to positive pre orders and advance sales of turok acclaim announced on january 2 1997 that a sequel tentatively titled turok dinosaur hunter 2 would be released in late 1997 acclaim dubbed march 4 release date of game turok tuesday reporting that pre sales at toys r us had exceeded expectations acclaim stock increased in anticipation before game s release up 0 62 to 5 94 reception turok was a critical and commercial success earning rave reviews from video game magazines and becoming most popular title for nintendo 64 in months following its release on aggregate review web sites metacritic and gamerankings console version of turok has an 85 and 86 6 rating respectively each figure based on scores from thirteen contemporary and recent reviews douglass perry of multimedia website ign compared turok favorably to other first person shooters saying that title distinguished itself by allowing a level of 3d movement not possible in other members of genre scary larry of gamepro who gave turok a perfect score in all four categories control funfactor graphics and sound similarly said turok has more firepower more control over its environment and more gruesome graphics than other corridor shooters while agreeing that game offers greater freedom of movement a next generation reviewer opined that first person platforming does not work since player cannot see their character he found this strongly contrasted with game s top notch shooting elements australians steve polak wrote that while turok was highly derivative game was evidence of evolution of genre offering more graphics and gameplay options video game magazine edge said that turok contradicted prevailing notion at time that only nintendo could create superior games for console in contrast william burrill of toronto star wrote that turok offered nothing new if players had tried a first person shooter before and next generation online said that its similar gameplay essentially made game a very pretty duke nukem four reviewers of electronic gaming monthly remarked that while graphics and animation are stunning controls and level design are lacking speaking to shacknews in 2007 propaganda games s josh holmes said that while goldeneye 007 is commonly considered standard setting console shooter turok pioneered console shooter first by offering open environments and deviating from corridor based shooters that were standard until then reviewers found that turoks controls generally worked well perry scary larry and next generation all noted that while many players would not initially like using nintendo 64 s analog stick for weapon movement they would become adept at control scheme electronic gaming monthly review team however said they wished controls could be reconfigured to a scheme that was easier to master polak wrote that joystick let players aim with a remarkable amount of precision george of daily news found controls to be easy to learn and simple to keep track of in comparison to pc shooters but said joystick control could be disorienting only problem is when you look up in air and make slightest twitch to left or right you can end up like a tourist staring up at empire state building and whirling like a dervish he wrote reviewers found that game s included tutorial helped players adapt to controls critics lauded turoks graphics while giving rest of game a tepid response burrill and egm team both rated visuals highly polak said that game proved supremacy of nintendo 64 s graphics in console market translucent water destructible trees and lens flares were among graphical details praised by reviewers washington posts tom ham said that equally impressive as environmental detail were true to life animations blow away a baddie and he ll grab his throat blood and then fall to ground still convulsing ham wrote how can you put a price on that scary larry agreed that gruesome death animations are a highlight of all around impressive graphics level of gore and blood in game lead reviewers such as scary larry timess tim and washington timess joseph szadkowski to caution against letting children play game gamespot s jeff gerstmann noted that graphics came at a price if more than a few enemies appeared on screen at same time game s frame rate would slow down gerstmann wrote that distance fog used to reduce slowdown was a neat effect as enemies would appear out of mist fangs first although it masked console s limitations perry commented that inability to look into distance forced players to rely on game map next generation said that while turok was overall probably best looking nintendo 64 game to date limited texture palette causes all environments to appear similar making game disorienting despite map pc port was not as well received colin williamson commented in pc gamer that game s popularity on nintendo 64 could in part be attributed to shortage of games for system at time like next generation he said that while graphics are impressive limited textures and constant fog make game disorienting and first person platform jumping does not work he added that game s problems are compounded on pc because conversion failed to add on features that pc gamers take for granted such as a multiplayer mode and ability to save at any point gamespots tim likewise criticized pc version s retention of problems and checkpoint based save system of nintendo 64 version though he had an overall positive reaction to game calling it a technically arresting adventure steve bauman of computer games magazine reviewed pc version and said that while it was an excellent port game itself was inferior to other shooters such as quake worldwide sales of turok dinosaur hunter surpassed 60 million in late june 1997 and accounted for 45 of acclaim s revenues in fiscal quarter in which game was released game also held top spot for video game rentals for seven weeks consecutively acclaim re issued game for 1997 holiday season due to its sales potential for increased console player base turok was later named a nintendo player s choice title in 1998 only third party nintendo 64 game to be featured at time and ultimately sold about 1 5 million units ngc magazine wrote that turok changed perceptions of a nintendo console on a machine from a company that had long specialised in primary colours and family fun last thing anyone anticipated was kind of cutting edge first person shooter that was previously sole preserve of expensive gaming pcs not only did turok change this but it established a system selling franchise that persisted even after n64 was replaced in addition to turok turok franchise includes five other games turok 2 seeds of evil 1998 turok rage wars 1999
