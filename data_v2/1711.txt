life thumb left 150px abiah folger franklin francis grandmother and namesake francis folger franklin was born on october 20 1732 in philadelphia pennsylvania then a colony in british america he was eldest legitimate son of benjamin franklin then publisher of pennsylvania gazette and deborah read franklin also had an illegitimate son william born whose mother may have been a maid in household perhaps a woman named barbara or even deborah read herself it has been suggested that william was franklin s son by deborah but was acknowledged as illegitimate because he had been conceived before marriage of his parents some accounts argue that william s birth was legitimized sometime after francis death possibly due to lack of an heir baby s middle name folger was maiden name of franklin s mother abiah franklin was proud of his maternal family one of first settlers of new england and thus in an era when a middle name was unusual for ordinary people to receive francis was baptized as francis folger francis baptism took place on september 16 1733 while franklin was away at anglican christ church in philadelphia which deborah attended francis affectionately called franky by his parents was described as a precocious curious and special child by franklin a golden child his smiles brighter his more telling and his tricks more magical than all other infants in colonies combined by historian of medicine howard markel and as a most engaging child of singular beauty and wonderful knowingness by biographer james parton given that franklin considered francis to be a healthy child who thrived from start and very clever he advertised for a tutor for his two sons in december 1734 by all accounts francis was doted on by his parents his portrait was painted while he was still a baby by 1734 franklin s business as a writer publisher and founder of library company of philadelphia was going well enough that he was able to build a house for his family of four at 318 market street death and aftermath thumb right an illustration showing effects of smallpox inoculation franklin and his brother james criticized smallpox inoculation which was performed by drawing a string previously in contact with pustules of a smallpox victim through a small incision on person being inoculated at time inoculation offered a mortality chance of 2 while smallpox contracted naturally was fatal to 15 of infected later while james still opposed inoculation franklin came to support it believing it was a safe and beneficial practice in 1736 however francis contracted smallpox and died on november 21 of that year without having been inoculated both franklin and deborah were devastated and their devastation was compounded because they were unsure they could have another child franklin had written his paper on death of infants while francis was still alive and was inspired by his youngest son when writing about beauty of babies francis was buried on same day he died his tombstone reading delight of all who knew him rumors quickly surfaced that francis had died after being inoculated and so franklin wrote in pennsylvania gazette on december 30 that he intended to get francis inoculated as soon as he should have recovered sufficient strength from a flux with which he had been long afflicted and that boy received distemper in common way of infection however choice of having his son inoculated was a difficult one for franklin as francis could die either way inoculation would become a real choice only if there was a high chance of smallpox being contracted naturally in this case choice of having francis inoculated was justified even with its 2 mortality rate after francis death franklin became involved in promoting inoculation in philadelphia he published many studies on its value working with several physicians including famed william heberden at pennsylvania hospital which he helped found in 1774 he founded society for inoculating poor gratis in order to help poor people of philadelphia afford inoculation in his autobiography franklin writes in 1736 i lost one of my sons a fine boy of four years old by smallpox taken in common way i long regretted bitterly and still regret that i had not given it to him by inoculation this i mention for sake of parents who omit that operation on supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it my example showing that regret may be same either way and that therefore safer should be chosen seven years after francis death deborah gave birth to sarah who was franklin s only surviving legitimate child in 1772 franklin s sister jane franklin mecom wrote him with news of his grandsons franklin replied that it brings often afresh to my mind idea of my son franky though now dead thirty six years whom i have seldom since seemed equaled in everything and whom to this day i cannot think of without a sigh references footnotes notes bibliography external links category 1732
