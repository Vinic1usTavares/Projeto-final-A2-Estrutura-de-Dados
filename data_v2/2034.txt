400px thumb a blue ice area in miller range with a meteorite a blue ice area is an ice covered area of antarctica where wind driven snow transport and sublimation result in net mass loss from ice surface in absence of melting forming a blue coloured surface that contrasts with white colour of antarctic surface such blue ice areas typically form when movement of both air and ice are obstructed by topographic obstacles such as mountains that emerge from ice sheet generating particular climatic conditions where net snow accumulation is exceeded by wind driven sublimation and snow transports only about 1 of antarctic ice area can be considered to be blue ice area but they have attracted scientific interest due to large numbers of meteorites that accumulate on them these meteorites either fall directly on blue ice area and remain there or they fall elsewhere into ice sheet and are transported to blue ice area by ice flow additionally ice up to 2 7 million years old has been obtained from blue ice areas blue ice areas are sometimes used as runways for aircraft appearance blue ice areas have a generally smooth and often rippled appearance a blue colour and a lack of bubbles in ice this light blue colour is a consequence of absorption of light by ice and air bubbles encased within it and source of name blue ice area it contrasts markedly with white colour of antarctic plains and can be seen from space and from aerial images while density of blue ice makes it appear on radar images as a dark ice form scalloped or rippled surfaces have almost regular surface patterns although wholly smooth blue ice areas exist as well and terrain even of rippled surfaces features very low aerodynamic roughness perhaps among lowest of all permanent natural surfaces this is because most aerodynamic drag is caused by surface anomalies less than a centimetre long not larger uneven forms occurrence of moraines at blue ice areas has been reported these form when debris contained within a glacier accumulates at surface due to melting or sublimation small depressions in ice known as holes are common and are formed where rocks got embedded in ice but are absent on more mountainous blue ice areas typical blue ice areas often feature intense katabatic winds with average winds reaching and gusts of up to such winds can remove and take up large amounts of snow they are usually warmer than comparable snow covered areas sometimes by up to which makes them identifiable from brightness temperature imaging this warming is due to lower albedo of blue ice compared to snow which results in them absorbing more sunlight and warming more blue ice areas also alter climate above them as commonly defined blue ice areas display little or no evidence of melting thus excluding glaciers and frozen lakes in antarctic dry valleys where sublimation dominated ice also occurs but which may be more comparable to ablation areas of regular glaciers occurrence thumb 400px occurrence of blue ice areas in antarctica blue ice areas are known only from antarctica although similar ice patches on greenland have been reported and blue ice is widespread at glaciers worldwide blue ice areas make up only about 1 of antarctic surface ice however they are locally common and scattered across continent especially in coastal or mountainous areas but not directly beside coastline they have been found in dronning maud land catchment of lambert glacier transantarctic mountains and victoria land individual locations in antarctica include areas of allan hills queen mountains yamato ice field there covers an area of and is largest such structure and sor mountains origin and processes blue ice areas are regions where more snow is removed by sublimation or by wind than accumulates by precipitation or wind driven transport leading to emergence of blue ice in most of antarctica net tendency is for snow to accumulate except in coastal antarctica where melting occurs and blue ice areas where sublimation dominates this sublimation occurs at rates of snow water equivalent and is balanced by ice flow with sublimation rate decreasing with elevation and increasing with temperature summer also increases sublimation rate although it still occurs during winter winds remove snow that rest on surface and could even scour exposed ice away although occurrence of scouring is not established without doubt and role of abrasion is also unclear such areas exist even in coldest parts of antarctica and they are characterized by high mean wind speeds and low precipitation once they have formed smooth surface prevents snow from accumulating as it is quickly blown away by wind and blue colour increases absorption of sunlight and thus sublimation both these phenomena act to maintain blue ice area and wind driven transport of warm air can cause blue ice area to expand downwind blue ice areas are common in mountainous regions presumably irregular surface topography obstructs ice flow and locally creates atmospheric conditions suitable for development of blue ice areas irregular topography does not need to be exposed to surface in order to generate blue ice areas although they must have an effect on ice surface topography to induce formation of blue ice areas consequently many blue ice areas form when ice thicknesses decrease which has been postulated to happen during although in general past history of blue ice areas is poorly known such areas may not have existed at all during glacial times when ice sheet was thicker changes in mean wind speeds cause short term fluctuations in land covered by blue ice areas global warming is predicted to decrease wind speeds across antarctica causing a small decrease in land surface covered by blue ice areas age ages of particular blue ice areas have been inferred from ages of meteorites there discovered although redistribution of meteorites between various areas through ice flow can cause this procedure to yield erroneous age estimates oldest blue ice areas may be up to 2 5 million years old and ice in them can be quite old as well with ages of several hundred thousand years estimated on basis of ice flow dynamics and radiometric dating and development of a horizontal stratigraphy this occurs because ice blocked by obstacles and moves at a rate commensurate with ablation rate younger ages have been found as well however such as 250 000 years old at allan hills and 75 000 years old at yamato mountains types several subtypes have been defined which encompass most blue ice areas type i form in lee of an obstacle and are most common type of blue ice area although they usually cover only a small surface area compared to other three types they are often 50 100 times as long as obstacle is high which is often a mountain type ii form where katabatic winds clear snow from surface until ice appears they form on valley glaciers type iii form where winds blowing on steep slopes or even over flat terrain remove snow from surface type iv form by wind removing snow from lowest part of a glacier basin meteorites thumb pathways of meteorites in ice blue ice areas are known primarily for meteorites that accumulate there they originally fell on ice elsewhere and were transported by ice flows to blue ice area where they accumulate when ice they were encased in away this mechanism has been compared to a conveyor belt that transports meteorites to blue ice areas additionally meteorites that fell directly on blue ice areas are represented because of often great age of surface a number of meteorites can accumulate even without ice driven transport over 20 000 meteorites from blue ice areas were known by 1999 a large share of all known meteorites on earth meteorite findings occur only on a minority of all blue ice areas and are mostly limited to inland blue ice areas whereas coastal ones tend to be lacking in meteorites this might reflect fact that at low altitude ice surrounding meteorites can melt due to solar heating of meteorite thus removing it from view research history earliest research in blue ice areas occurred during norwegian british swedish antarctic expedition in 1949 1952 and was followed by two decades of mostly geological and geomorphological research discovery of meteorites in a blue ice area of yamato mountains led to an uptick in scientific interest a number of programs to collect meteorites began this also led to increased research in glaciological and dynamical properties of blue ice areas and later to their meteorological and climatological implications use hard flat and smooth surfaces of blue ice areas have been used as aircraft runways blue ice runways in parts of antarctica very old ice in blue ice areas has been used to reconstruct past climate and temporal resolution may be larger than in deep ice cores blue ice areas are candidate sites for ice core drilling aimed at recovering 1 5 million year old ice and 2 7 million year old ice has been recovered from such areas references sources category glacial erosion landforms category antarctica category geomorphology category ice
