severn railway bridge historically called severn bridge was a bridge carrying railway across river severn between sharpness and lydney gloucestershire it was built in 1870s by severn bridge railway company primarily to carry coal from forest of dean to docks at sharpness at that time it was furthest downstream bridge over severn when company got into financial difficulties in 1893 it was taken over jointly by great western railway and midland railway companies bridge continued to be used for freight and passenger services until 1960 and saw temporary extra traffic on occasions that severn tunnel was closed for engineering work bridge was constructed by hamilston s windsor ironworks company limited of garston liverpool it was approached from north via a masonry viaduct and had twenty two spans pier columns were formed of circular sections bolted together and filled with concrete twenty one regular wrought iron spans were then put in place as well as southernmost span swinging bridge over gloucester and sharpness canal bridge was long and above high water a total of of iron being used in its construction a number of accidents took place at bridge over years with vessels colliding with piers due to hazardous nature of waterway in 1960 two river barges hit one of piers on bridge causing two spans to collapse into river repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred following year after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair bridge it was demolished between 1967 and 1970 with few traces remaining construction for more than fifty years before severn railway bridge was opened there had been discussion and various proposals for rail routes to cross severn either by a bridge or a tunnel but most of these did not leave drawing board exception was a tunnel near newnham on severn in 1810 this had been excavated part way under river when water broke in and tunnellers were lucky to escape with their lives damage was irreparable and project abandoned in 1845 an ambitious project by isambard kingdom brunel was to bridge severn near awre for his projected south wales railway bypassing gloucester completely this plan got as far as receiving approval of parliament but did not proceed other schemes were mooted and in 1871 six different schemes were under consideration finally severn bridge railway s scheme was approved by parliament and received royal assent on 18 july 1872 thumb left bridge under construction engineer 5 january 1877 p 15 severn railway bridge was built by severn bridge railway company to transport coal from forest of dean on severn and wye railway at time it was expected that amount of coal freighted would increase year by year and existence of a bridge would remove necessity for coal to be shipped via gloucester work began in 1875 and was completed in 1879 wrought iron bridge which was long and above high water had twenty two spans and had stone abutments made from local limestone first span across gloucester and sharpness canal which ran parallel to severn at this point operated as a swing bridge twenty one fixed spans in order of erection from south east sharpness side consisted of 13 of length 5 of length 2 of length and a single span of length bridge incorporated of iron it was approached from south east by a two arch masonry viaduct on canal embankment leading to swing bridge and on north west by a 12 arch viaduct about high river with its large tidal range and strong currents made construction difficult pier columns were formed of cylindrical sections about in diameter near west bank bedrock was a long way below shifting sands so much work had to prepare firm foundations staging was used through which sections were lowered by chains and when in place filled with concrete near east bank a primitive piling machine was used to drive sections through a ridge of clay staging was extended upwards for use while assembling spans spans were assembled on site staging was laid and rails put in place to carry a travelling crane long beams were hoisted in place first followed by vertical and then outer and inner plates of top chordal trusses and diagonals whole structure was bolted together at first and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand operated forges some individual spans were completed within a week with contractors being complimented on efficiency of their work main contractor was hamilston s windsor ironworks company limited of garston liverpool they were tasked with founding and erection of pier cylinders on riverbed and erection and riveting of twenty one bowstring spans and swing bridge over gloucester and sharpness canal they were also responsible for another swing bridge on north docks branch of line close to new docks at sharpness company manufactured castings and wrought iron structures for bridge project manager george earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out project engineers for project were george wells owen and george william keeling history thumb right 250px upright a 1946 ordnance survey map showing bridge and branch line bridge carried a single track railway line when it came into service it took approximately off journey from bristol to cardiff with trains no longer having to pass through gloucester bridge predated construction of severn tunnel a dozen miles or so downstream by seven years opening ceremony for bridge took place on 17 october 1879 nearly four hundred dignitaries travelled in twenty three first class carriages across bridge and back again with fog signals exploding on each of spans during return trip a banquet followed at pleasure grounds near sharpness station during construction it was anticipated that severn bridge railway would mainly receive its revenue from carrying coal from forest of dean however severn bridge railway company ran into financial difficulties as coal was not carried in volumes that had been anticipated nor had tourist travel risen to expected levels miners in forest of dean went on strike about low pay and poor conditions and coal trade there continued to be depressed opening of severn tunnel providing an alternative route from england into south wales was a serious blow to bridge by 1890 company was unable to pay interest on its debentures and faced bankruptcy as a result it was taken over jointly by great western railway and midland railway in 1893 becoming severn and wye joint railway several fatalities occurred during construction of bridge a baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped and another died when he fell from part completed structure injuring himself on staging as he fell only a few days after bridge s opening a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized one occupant being drowned over succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at bridge involving larger vessels trow brothers was lost after a collision with one of piers in 1879 and victoria employed in bridge s construction was wrecked in 1880s in 1938 a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by tide into bridge a connecting hawser snagged one of piers and vessels capsized with several fatalities in 1943 a flight of three spitfires was being delivered by ata pilots including one woman ann wood from their factory in castle bromwich to whitchurch bristol as it was low tide lead pilot johnnie jordan flew under bridge some time later ann wood repeated this under flying without realising that this time it was high tide and there was less headroom but she just squeezed through these were not only instances of pilots buzzing bridge and on one occasion a vickers wellington a much larger aircraft was seen to fly under it practice became so common that raf police were called in and tasked with recording of serial numbers of offending aircraft after a few courts martial incidents ceased railway operation until severn road bridge was opened in 1966 severn railway bridge was often referred to as severn bridge there was a small station known as on lydney side adjacent to gloucester to newport line which severn bridge line crossed over bridge was used as a diversionary route for passenger services when severn tunnel was closed for engineering work south to north chord at berkeley loop south junction used for this route was closed when bridge was abandoned remaining line from berkeley rd junction to sharpness docks remains and on north side of severn estuary line from former otters pool junction at lydney to severn bridge has long been lifted but a short section of track exists as part of forest of dean railway network while bridge provided a considerably shorter railway route between london to south wales its use was limited in that route was single track and also because bridge was only strong enough to carry locomotives up to a 2 6 0 by early 1960s traffic was restricted to trains serving lydney both passenger trains to berkeley road and freight to stoke gifford with gwr 1600 class typically heading trains there were plans by british railways to improve bridge in order to provide additional capacity for diverted main line trains 1960 accident thumb left after accident april 1966 on 25 october 1960 in thick fog and a strong tide two barges named arkendale h and wastdale h which had overshot sharpness dock collided with one of columns of bridge after being carried upstream two bridge spans collapsed into river as they fell parts of structure hit barges causing fuel oil and petroleum they were carrying to catch fire five people died in incident during collapse of bridge 12 inch diameter gas main that ran alongside railway line was damaged leaving households across forest of dean without mains gas locals who were around at time talk of people from gas company banging on doors early in morning and being told not to use their gas and of having to be supplied with bottled gas for weeks and months until mains could be restored gas engineers from across uk were brought in to help with visiting every house affected before household could use mains gas again thumb wreckage of barges arkendale h bows left and wastdale h stern right still visible at low water local people favoured repairing bridge as schoolchildren who had used bridge daily now had to be taken on a detour via gloucester an underwater survey in december 1961 found extensive damage to pier 16 rebuilding costs were estimated to be ps312 000 as against dismantling costs of ps250 000 western region of british railways planned to go ahead with reconstruction but shortly before work was due to start a capsized tanker caused further damage to pier 20 and this same pier was struck again when contractor s crane broke adrift these accidents added a further ps20 000 to estimated costs of repair and in 1965 british rail decided that bridge was damaged beyond economic repair and opted for demolition demolition thumb left remaining tower of swing section over canal demolition began in august 1967 contract was awarded to nordman construction after an unsuccessful tender process company brought in magnus ii a floating crane with a lifting capacity of which could remove all but two of spans these longer spans were pulled sideways off piers expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight they proved stronger than this and remained intact needing to be broken up in river with much sinking into bed instead of being recovered in may 1968 another firm swinnerton miller completed main demolition work with help of explosives but clearing of debris took another two years evidence of several of piers remains most significant is a large circular tower sited between canal and river this had formed base of swinging section and housed steam engine to power it a large stone arch also remains on landward side of canal original abutment to swinging section some piers are reduced to stone foundations and only visible at low tide as are wrecks of petrol barges that caused original damage river at this point has always been hazardous to shipping because of strong tidal currents which caused 1960 collision during demolition a support vessel severn king an old aust ferry boat that had become surplus after new severn road bridge opened and ferry closed broke its mooring in tide grounded on remains of bridge and flooded a wooden motor barge of 1913 was also used in demolition work for collecting small pieces of wreckage worn out by this work and frequent groundings it was abandoned on shore at aust see also crossings of river severn references bibliography further reading external links category bridges
