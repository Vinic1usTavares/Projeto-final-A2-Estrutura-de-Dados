coffin birth also known as postmortem fetal extrusion lasso et al 2009 schulz 2005 is expulsion of a nonviable fetus through vaginal opening of decomposing body of a deceased pregnant woman as a result of increasing pressure of intra abdominal gases this kind of postmortem delivery occurs very rarely during decomposition of a body practice of chemical preservation whereby chemical preservatives and disinfectant solutions are pumped into a body to replace natural body fluids and bacteria that reside therein have made occurrence of coffin birth so rare that topic is rarely mentioned in international medical discourse typically during decomposition of a human body naturally occurring bacteria in organs of abdominal cavity such as stomach and intestines generate gases as by products of metabolism which causes body to swell in some cases confined pressure of gases can squeeze uterus womb even forcing it downward and it may turn inside out and be forced out of body through vaginal opening a process called prolapse if a fetus is contained within uterus it could therefore be expelled from mother s body through vaginal opening when uterus turns inside out in a process that to outward appearances mimics childbirth main differences lie in state of mother and fetus and mechanism of delivery in event of natural live childbirth mother s contractions thin and shorten cervix to expel infant from womb in a case of coffin birth built up gas pressure within body of a pregnant woman pushes dead fetus from body of mother cases have been recorded by medical authorities since 16th century though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history while cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when body of a pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death there are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from body of pregnant woman about time of death or during decomposition though because those cases are not consistent with processes described here they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion causes cause of postmortem fetal extrusion is not completely understood as event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous while it is possible that more than one cause can produce same result there is an accepted hypothesis based on established research in fields of biochemistry and forensic taphonomy 1997 80 and further supported by observational research that accounts for taphonomic mechanisms that would result in most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a non viable fetus typically as a dead body decomposes body tissues become depleted of oxygen and body begins to anaerobic bacteria in gastrointestinal tract proliferate and as a result of increased metabolic activity release gases such as carbon dioxide methane and hydrogen sulfide carter et al 2007 gill king 1997 93 108 these bacteria secrete exoenzymes to break down body cells and proteins for ingestion which thus weakens organ tissues increasing pressure forces diffusion of excessive gases into weakened tissues where they enter circulatory system and spread to other parts of body causing both torso and limbs to become bloated these decompositional processes weaken structural integrity of organs by separating necrotizing tissue layers bloating usually begins from two to five days after death depending on external temperature humidity and other environmental conditions galloway 1997 as volume of gas increases pressure begins to force various body fluids to exude from all natural orifices carter and 2008 it is at this point during decomposition of a pregnant body that amniotic membranes become stretched and separated and intra abdominal gas pressure may force eversion and prolapse of uterus which would result in expulsion of fetus through vaginal canal and knight 2004 65 it has been observed that bodies of multiparous women are more likely to spontaneously expel fetus during decomposition than those who died during their first pregnancy because of more elastic nature of cervix history numerous documented cases of postmortem fetal extrusion were described in medical compendium anomalies and curiosities of medicine first published in 1896 gould and pyle 1997 earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by courts of spanish inquisition four hours after her death and while body still hung by neck two dead infants were seen to fall free of body this is unusual for short amount of time elapsed between death and postmortem delivery as no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances it is unclear whether onset of putrefaction was accelerated or if other causal factors were at work in city of brussels in 1633 a woman died in convulsions and three days later a fetus was spontaneously expelled in weissenfels in 1861 postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after death of a pregnant woman other cases are described though only a few describe unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation most cases occurred before burial in some of these body was in casket while in other cases body was still on its deathbed or on a bier during late 19th century modern embalming techniques were developed whereby preservative and disinfectant chemical compounds such as formaldehyde are pumped into a body flushing out body s natural fluids and with them bacteria that flourish during putrefaction and generate gases that comprise active force behind expulsion of fetus dinn 1999 15 17 however phenomenon was still recognized by medical science and in 1904 john whitridge williams wrote a textbook on obstetric medicine that included a section on coffin birth williams 1904 755 756 although text has remained an important reference in obstetrics subject whether called coffin birth or postmortem fetal extrusion was excluded by its 13th edition in 1966 eastman and hellman 1966 and was not mentioned in edition published in 2009 cunningham et al 2009 subject was discussed in german medical literature during 20th century and musick 1941 panning 1941 prokop and 1976 118 1921 though more detailed case reports in forensic literature have been published recently in 2005 body of a 34 year old woman eight months pregnant was discovered in her apartment in hamburg germany body was bloated and discolored and upon initial examination it was found that head of fetus had made its appearance in vaginal opening at autopsy medical examiners found that both head and shoulders of fetus had emerged and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress woman who had given birth twice before had died of a heroin overdose case was unusual and serendipitous as it was first modern case in which medical practitioners were able to document a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress in 2008 body of a 38 year old woman seven months pregnant was discovered in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in panama a plastic bag had been left over her head and she had been gagged case was ruled a homicide body had suffered from tropical heat and high humidity and was bloated and highly discolored at autopsy remains of fetus were discovered in woman s undergarments although fetus was in a similar state of decomposition umbilical cord was intact and still attached to placenta inside uterus this was first forensic case in which it could be concluded that coffin birth had occurred based on position of bodies and clear attachment of umbilical cord to un expelled placenta in 2019 autopsy reports in case of watts family homicides in august 2018 revealed that watts who had been 15 weeks pregnant at time of her murder had been found in a shallow grave and that fetus had been expelled from her body along with placenta and umbilical cord postmortem fetal extrusion can be very difficult to recognize once a body has undergone complete and are often very cautious about asserting presence of this phenomenon lewis 2007 34 37 91 wells 1975 1237 there are numerous cultural reasons why a mother and an infant might be interred together so joint presence of neonatal remains and an adult female is not taken as conclusive evidence of postmortem fetal extrusion however there have been excavated burials where position of a set of fetal remains relative to those of an adult female supported this hypothesis there are a few general guidelines when an archaeologist is assessing placement of fetus and adult if fetal remains are found in a fetal position and are wholly within pelvic cavity of adult fetus died and was interred before delivery pregnant woman may therefore have died due to labor complications if infant is found alongside adult with head oriented in same direction as adult then infant was delivered whether naturally or by caesarian incision around time of death and thereafter interred delivered infants have also been interred between or alongside tibiae shins but infant is still oriented in same direction as adult if majority of fetal remains are in pelvic cavity of adult yet legs are extended and or cranium lies among ribs then infant may have been delivered and then placed on top of mother s torso before burial as both bodies skeletonized infant s bones would have settled among mother s ribs and vertebrae if fetal remains are complete and in a position inferior to and in line with pelvic outlet with head oriented opposite to that of mother toward foot of coffin or grave then there is possibility of coffin birth o donovan et al 2009 70 71 evidence for postmortem fetal extrusion may be less ambiguous when fetal remains are found to lie within pelvic outlet of adult thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition hawkes and wells 1975 moller christensen 1982 in 1975 it was reported that during excavation of a medieval cemetery in kings worthy england fetal remains appeared to lie within birth canal of skeleton of a young woman with fetal cranium external to pelvic outlet and between two femora thigh bones and fetal leg bones clearly within pelvic cavity other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described such as in 1978 at a neolithic site in germany kaiser 1978 at a medieval site in denmark in 1982 and in 2009 at an early christian period site at fingal ireland a coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of bbc show history cold case featuring roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near baldock hertfordshire woman and three babies bbc two another was identified in 2006 in a 14th century black death cemetery in genoa italy cesana et al 2017 applicability of diagnosis because postmortem fetal extrusion is so rare and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions regarding individual and ambient environment this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation even if study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods experimental research would be highly problematic at present forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs in archaeology study of mortuary context that is interpretation of postmortem treatment of dead whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group has led to development of hypotheses on social status and or hierarchy regarding many cultures ancient and extant larsen 1999 126 127 131 bell 1992 1975 robb et al 1992 in addition determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred before death has a bearing on analyses of mother s population as concentration of trace elements differ markedly between skeletons of prepartum adult women before giving birth and women who are lactating identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of number of lactating women in a population or rate of maternal mortality lewis 2007 37 it is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial 2003 176 comparable phenomena there are also many cases where remains of fetus are found separate from body of mother but expulsion was not through birth canal and separation of two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors process of separation is so unusual that a specific term for phenomenon may not have been proposed to scientific community these cases may have comparable results but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion in april 2003 body of laci peterson washed up on a shore near san francisco bay she had been pregnant when she disappeared four months earlier and fetus she had been carrying was discovered on a separate beach when questioned by media medical authorities initially speculated that a coffin birth might have occurred usa today 15 april 2003 however at autopsy cervix was found to be in a prepartum condition medical examiners later concluded that while peterson s body was in bay skin over abdominal cavity had ruptured due to natural decompositional processes seawater entered abdominal cavity and washed out most of internal organs along with fetus 2003 141 142 in 2007 a 23 year old woman in india over eight months pregnant hanged herself after contractions had begun et al 2007 a viable infant was spontaneously delivered unassisted from woman s body which was suspended by neck healthy infant was found on floor still tethered to body of mother by umbilical cord primary cause of delivery was otherwise normal contractions which had begun before death and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition while this is not postmortem fetal extrusion it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant lopez zeno et al 1990 in 2008 in germany a 23 year old woman in her third trimester was involved in a motor vehicle accident and died non viable fetus was found between her feet et al 2008 vehicle caught fire following initial impact woman died of blunt trauma and her body burned in car investigators came to conclusion that extreme heat of fire burned away epidermal and subcutaneous tissue around abdominal cavity after which anterior aspect of uterus ruptured causing fetus to spill out of uterine cavity and land on floor between woman s feet umbilical cord was still intact and connected fetus to placenta through ruptured wall of uterus unlike woman who suffered fourth degree burns over her entire body body of fetus was relatively undamaged because primary cause of separation from mother s body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of abdominal and uterine cavities traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes and expulsion of fetus did not involve passage through birth canal this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in animals whales can be subject to postmortem fetal extrusion many species float when dead due to gases of putrefaction
