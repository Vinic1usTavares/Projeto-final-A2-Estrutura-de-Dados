three maine class battleships and were built at turn of 20th century for united states navy based on preceding they incorporated several significant technological advances over earlier ships they were first american battleships to incorporate krupp cemented armor which was stronger than harvey armor smokeless powder which allowed for higher velocity guns and water tube boilers which were more efficient and lighter maines were armed with four guns and sixteen guns and they could steam at a speed of a significant increase over illinois class three maine class battleships served in a variety of roles throughout their careers maine and missouri remained in atlantic fleet for their careers though ohio initially served with asiatic fleet from 1904 to 1907 all three ships took part in cruise of great white fleet in 1907 1909 though maines excessive coal consumption forced her to proceed independently for most of voyage missouri was used as a training ship for much of rest of her career and ohio took part in american intervention in mexican revolution in 1914 all three ships were employed as training ships during world war i after war all three ships were withdrawn from service between 1919 and 1920 before being sold for scrap in 1922 and 1923 and broken up design thumb left painting of maine c 1900 by 1897 us navy had five battleships under construction and no plans to request additional units for 1898 with destruction of armored cruiser in havana harbor and subsequent declaration of war on spain on 25 april 1898 however a large naval expansion program was passed through congress program called for three new battleships first of which would be named for destroyed maine design work began immediately though broad parameters for new battleships proved to be contentious board on construction advocated a design based on to be armed with 13 8 and 6 inch 330 203 and 152 mm guns though others on board argued that repeating which was armed with and 6 in guns and had a speed of would save construction time additionally they pointed out that 8 in guns could not be incorporated within displacement limit several important technological advances had become available by this time however which necessitated several changes to design advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities navy had accordingly designed a 12 inch 305 mm 40 caliber high velocity gun in addition krupp cemented armor had been developed in germany steel was a significant improvement over older harvey process since steel was stronger thinner armor plating could achieve same level of protection and more importantly significant savings in weight water tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships these were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire tube boilers shortly after three ships had been authorized navy learned that russian battleship recently ordered from william cramp sons in philadelphia would be capable of steaming at a margin of over maine design navy requested that shipyards submitting designs for contract increase speed of their proposed ships to match russian vessel cramp sons responded by lengthening hull by to increase its fineness and thus reduce drag and incorporate new niclausse boilers while newport news shipbuilding drydock company lengthened hull by and increased horsepower of propulsion system by sixty percent to ultimately newport design was chosen for new ships general characteristics and machinery thumb upright maine in 1916 ships of maine class were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of to they displaced as designed and up to at full load ships had a metacentric height of they had a forecastle deck that extended to main mast as built they were fitted with heavy military masts with fighting tops but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909 they had a crew of 40 officers and 521 enlisted men which increased to 779 813 officers and men ships were powered by two shaft triple expansion steam engines rated at steam was provided by twelve coal fired thornycroft boilers for missouri and ohio and twenty four niclausse boilers for maine which were trunked into three tall funnels amidships ships engines generated a top speed of though ohio only made on her speed trials normal coal capacity was though maine could carry up to missouri had capacity for and ohio could store of coal at a speed of ships had a designed endurance of though they could steam for at that speed significantly greater coal capacity allowed her to cruise for at that speed steering was controlled by a single rudder and ships had a turning radius of at 10 knots armament ships were armed with a main battery of four 12 inch 40 caliber mark 3 guns in two twin gun turrets on centerline one forward and aft guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of turrets were mark iv mounts which required guns to be horizontal to be reloaded these mounts could elevate to 15 degrees and depress to 5 degrees and they were electrically operated and guns could be operated independently secondary battery consisted of sixteen 6 inch 50 caliber mark 6 guns which were placed in casemates in hull ten were mounted in a battery on upper deck four more were located in another battery directly above on forecastle deck and last two were placed in sponsoned casemates in bow they fired a shell at for close range defense against torpedo boats they carried six 50 caliber guns mounted in casemates along side of hull eight 3 pounder guns and six 1 pounder guns as was standard for capital ships of period maine class battleships carried two torpedo tubes submerged in her hull on broadside they were initially equipped with mark ii whitehead design which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of armor ships armor consisted of both krupp cemented and harvey steel their main armored belt was thick over magazines and machinery spaces and tapered down to on lower edge belt was elsewhere and reduced to on bottom edge belt extended from above waterline to below main deck was thick and was increased slightly to on sloped sides that connected it to belt deck was increased to 4 in at stern main battery gun turrets had 12 in thick faces and supporting barbettes had same thickness of armor plating on their exposed sides thick bulkheads connected belt with barbettes behind these barbettes were protected with 8 in of steel armor that was 6 in thick protected secondary battery conning tower had thick sides with a thick roof construction thumb

after maine and missouri entered service they were assigned to north atlantic fleet while ohio built on west coast of united states was instead sent to serve as flagship of asiatic fleet based in philippines in april 1904 a turret fire killed 36 men aboard missouri but quick action of three men prevented fire from reaching magazines and destroying ship for which they were awarded medal of honor in 1907 ohio returned from western pacific and joined her sisters in what was now atlantic fleet during this period maine served as flagship of atlantic fleet until she was relieved in april 1907 in december 1907 three ships and other battleships in atlantic fleet steamed out of hampton roads virginia at start of cruise of great white fleet fleet steamed south around south america and back north to us west coast maine was detached owing to her excessive use of coal along with battleship two ships continued journey independently and on a greatly shortened itinerary rest of ships then crossed pacific and stopped in australia philippines and japan before continuing on through indian ocean they transited suez canal and toured mediterranean before crossing atlantic arriving bank in hampton roads on 22 february 1909 for a naval review with president theodore roosevelt over following six years ships had fairly uneventful careers missouri spent most of time out of active service only recommissioning for summer training cruises with midshipmen from us naval academy in 1914 ohio was sent to mexican waters to protect american interests in country during mexican revolution after united states entered world war i by declaring war on germany on 6 april 1917 all three ships were used to train naval recruits for expanding wartime fleet following german surrender in november 1918 missouri was used to ferry american soldiers back from france though other two vessels were not so employed since their short range and lack of sufficient accommodations would have made them inefficient transports three ships remained in active service only very briefly after war ohio was decommissioned in january 1919 and missouri and maine followed in september 1919 and may 1920 respectively all three ships were sold for scrap with maine and missouri going to breakers yard in january 1922 and ohio joining them in march 1923 footnotes notes citations references category
