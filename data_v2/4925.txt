year contract as he did not want to make a long term commitment to series as michelle rodriguez signed under similar conditions that lead to her character ana lucia cortez only appearing in show s second season show runners damon lindelof and carlton cuse negotiated with akinnuoye agbaje to make his character mr eko to appear in third season as well adding some space between two character deaths to develop eko s closure better as filming of season 2 ended conversations between actor and writers ended setting eko s departure during first six episodes prior to mid season break with a shocking and emotional death to make sure sequence was big and impressive effects supervisor kevin blank decided to set death at jackass ginger in a large space that allowed to make smoke monster flip him around in weird physical positions a stunt double was dragged through cables and along with digital monster and wire removal fast editing made scene akin to a magician s trick in blank s opinion episode was written by monica owusu breen and alison schapker who had previously worked in another series by lost production company bad robot productions alias cuse and lindelof stated that nikki and paulo served as a red herring as rumors were raised of an incoming character death and fanbase would expect this to happen to newcomers who were sort of just there all along instead of a prominent and popular character as eko juliet s message to jack is an homage to bob dylan s video for subterranean homesick blues where musician flips cue cards while looking at camera reception this episode attracted 16 07 million american viewers in its original broadcast on november 1 2006 standing as tenth most watched program of week in united kingdom episode had 1 247 million viewers ranking third in multichannel shows after ford super sunday and simpsons in canada cost of living had 1 15 million viewers ranking as 26th highest rated program of week reviews were positive though most critics found that character of eko was killed too soon in show writing for zap2it rick porter said that while cost of living was best episode of season 3 thus far with an illuminating flashback some heavy island juju and a nice mix of campers and others death of eko removed from lost one of its most compelling characters and best actors which just flat out sucks kristin dos santos of e online called mr eko best character of show and was therefore very disappointed with his death christine fenno of entertainment weekly stated that she would miss adewale akinnuoye agbaje and found juliet s message to be best part of episode that like rest of season three answered a few questions whose tumor raised a few questions who s eye patch guy and ignored many long standing questions how did yemi and eko crash on same island ign s chris carabott ranked episode 9 3 out of 10 saying it was one of series best efforts exploring series mythology and providing new paths while also featuring eko in one of most refreshing flashbacks that series has produced thus far and a shocking confrontation with smoke monster reviewer still complained about nikki and paulo s participation considering them poorly developed and giving sense that they are being shoehorned in website later ranked cost of living as 25th best episode of series saying that while early season 3 might have dragged a bit cost of living saw excitement and drama ramp up considerably only thing marring this otherwise excellent episode was presence of nikki and paolo on other hand a similar list by los angeles times ranked it 96th considering that despite being actually a pretty good piece of tv episode was just marred by fact that show was forced into killing mr eko a character whose story was far from over references external
