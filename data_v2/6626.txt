minister for almost all of 14 years of international isolation that followed and oversaw rhodesia s security forces during most of bush war which pitted unrecognised administration against communist backed black nationalist guerrilla groups smith who has been described as personifying white rhodesia remains a highly controversial figure supporters venerate him as a man of integrity and vision who understood uncomfortable truths of africa while critics describe an unrepentant racist whose policies and actions caused deaths of thousands and contributed to zimbabwe s later crises smith was born to british immigrants in selukwe a small town in southern rhodesian midlands four years before colony became self governing in 1923 during second world war he served as a royal air force fighter pilot

with assistance of south africa and until 1974 portugal talks with uk in 1966 1968 and 1971 came to nothing smith declared rhodesia a republic in 1970 and led rf to three more decisive election victories over next seven years after bush war began in earnest in 1972 he negotiated with non militant nationalist leader bishop abel muzorewa and rival guerrilla movements headed by joshua nkomo and robert mugabe in 1978 smith and non militant nationalists including muzorewa signed internal settlement under which country became zimbabwe rhodesia in 1979 mugabe and nkomo continued fighting no country recognised settlement smith was part of muzorewa s delegation that settled with uk and revolutionary guerrillas at lancaster house and following zimbabwe s recognised independence in 1980 he was leader of opposition during mugabe s first seven years in power smith was a stridently vocal critic of mugabe government both before and after his retirement from frontline politics in 1987 he dedicated much of his 1997 memoirs great betrayal to condemning mugabe and several uk politicians as mugabe s reputation thereafter plummeted amid zimbabwe s economic ruin reckoning of smith and his

wonderful examples to live up to he considered his father a man of extremely strong principles one of fairest men i have ever met and that is way he brought me up he always told me that we re entitled to our half of country and blacks are entitled to theirs raised on frontier of british empire in uk s youngest settler colony smith and his generation of white rhodesians grew up with a reputation for being more british than british something in which they took great pride smith showed sporting promise from an early age after attending selukwe primary school he boarded at chaplin school in gwelo about away in his final year at chaplin he was head prefect captain of school teams in cricket rugby and tennis recipient of victor in athletics and school s outstanding rifle marksman i was an absolute lunatic about sport he later said i concede looking back that i should have devoted much more time to my school work and less to sport all same his grades were good enough to win a place at rhodes university college in grahamstown in south africa then often attended by rhodesian students partly because rhodesia then had no university of its own and partly because of common eponymous association with cecil rhodes smith enrolled at start of 1938 reading for a bachelor of commerce degree after injuring his knee playing rugby he took up rowing and became stroke for university crew second world war royal air force pilot when second world war broke out in 1939 southern rhodesia had had self government for 16 years having gained responsible government from uk in 1923 it was unique in british empire and commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers including defence but not foreign affairs while lacking dominion status as a british colony southern rhodesia entered conflict automatically when britain declared war on 3 september 1939 but its government issued a symbolic declaration of war anyway smith who was about halfway through his university course later described feeling patriotically compelled to put his studies aside to fight for britain and all that it represented excited by idea of flying a spitfire he wanted to join air force but was prevented from immediately doing so by a policy adopted in rhodesia not to recruit university students until after they graduated smith engineered his recruitment into royal air force raf in spite of this rule during 1940 suppressing mention of his studies and formally joined in september 1941 thumb left smith with no 237 rhodesia squadron raf 1943 in second world war s middle eastern theatre alt a man in a

during a dawn takeoff suffering serious facial disfigurements he also broke his jaw leg and shoulder doctors and surgeons in cairo rebuilt smith s face through skin grafts and plastic surgery and he

during a strafing raid over northern italy on 22 june 1944 enemy flak hit smith s craft and he had to bail out behind german lines a peasant family named zunino hid him for a brief time he then joined a group of pro allied italian partisans with whom he took part in sabotage operations against german garrison for about three months when germans pulled out of area in october 1944 smith left to try to link up with allied forces who had just invaded southern france accompanied by three other servicemen each from a different european country and a local guide smith hiked across maritime alps finishing journey walking barefoot on ice and snow american troops recovered him in november 1944 smith again turned down offer of a billet in rhodesia and returned to active service in april 1945 with no 130 punjab squadron by then based in western germany he flew combat missions there having a little bit of fun shooting up odd things he recalled until war in europe ended on 7 may 1945 with

smith s alma mater alt a white building with large windows with jock in increasingly poor health after war smith family briefly considered sending ian to start a life in united states with help of jock s brother elijah who had become a prosperous new york businessman smith showed little interest in leaving rhodesia however and decided that he would finish at university then come home and buy his own farm he returned to rhodes university in early 1946 to find campus swamped with veterans like himself there were 400 of them out of barely 1 000 students smith became spokesman for university s ex servicemen senior student of his hall and chairman of students representative council he turned down presidency of rowing club saying it would be one administrative commitment too many but agreed to coach crew training rowers under strict military style discipline he led them to victory at 1946 south african inter varsity boat race at vaal dam south of johannesburg upstaging well fancied wits crew and subsequently received national standard varsity honours for rowing first rhodes student ever to do so at end of year having passed exams to gain his commerce degree by some miracle he recalled he returned to southern rhodesia to study farming at gwebi agricultural college near salisbury smith attended dedicated courses for ex servicemen at gwebi during 1947 and 1948 learning skills such as ploughing herding and milking he gained practical experience at taylor s dairy farm near selukwe and on a tobacco ranch at marandellas in 1947 he met janet nee watt a schoolteacher from cape in south africa who had come to selukwe to stay with family after death of her husband piet on rugby field what janet had planned as a short holiday for herself and her two infant children jean and robert turned into a permanent move when she accepted a job offer from selukwe junior school smith later wrote that qualities that had attracted him most to janet were her intelligence courage and on principle to side stepping or evading an issue her tendency was to opt for a decision requiring courage as opposed to taking easy way out they became engaged in 1948 meanwhile smith negotiated purchase of a piece of rough land near selukwe bounded by lundi and rivers and bisected by a clear stream he and janet gave previously nameless plot name that local people used to refer to stream gwenoro and set up a ranch where they ran cattle and grew tobacco and maize a general election was called in southern rhodesia in july 1948 after united party government headed by prime minister sir godfrey huggins unexpectedly lost a vote in legislative assembly in august about a month before election day smith was approached by members of opposition liberal party who asked him to stand for them in selukwe jacob smit s liberals despite their name were decidedly illiberal chiefly representing commercial farming mining and industrial interests smith was initially reluctant saying he was too busy organising his life to stand but agreed after one of liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend values he had fought for in second world war with their wedding barely a fortnight away janet was astonished to learn of smith s decision to run for parliament having never before heard him discuss politics i can t say that i am really interested in party politics smith explained to her but i ve always been most interested in sound government smith duly became a liberal party politician finalised his purchase of gwenoro and married janet adopting her two children as his own all in a few weeks in august 1948 they enjoyed a few days honeymoon at victoria falls then went straight into election campaign southern rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race but since most black citizens did not meet set standards electoral roll and colonial parliament were overwhelmingly white smith canvassed around geographically very large selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity many white families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father or because they had had children at school with him his raf service also helped particularly as local united party candidate petrus cilliers had been interned during hostilities for opposing war effort on 15 september 1948 smith defeated cilliers and labour candidate egon with 361 votes out of 747 and thereby became member of parliament for selukwe at 29 years old he was youngest mp in southern rhodesian history liberals however were roundly defeated going from 12 seats before election to only five afterwards jacob smit who had lost his seat in salisbury city retired and was replaced as leader of opposition by raymond stockil who renamed liberals rhodesia party having grown up in an area of cape town so pro smuts that she had never had to vote janet did not think her husband s entry to parliament would alter their lives at all first of all i was marrying a farmer she later said now he was going to be a politician as well so i said well if you are really interested in it carry on it never dawned on me being so naive about politicians that our lives would be affected in slightest degree parliament backbencher thumb upright 1 7 seventh southern rhodesian legislative assembly first to feature smith in 1948 smith is left most figure in back row alt a formative photograph of about 30 politicians standing and sitting in four rows because of southern rhodesia s small size and lack of major controversies its unicameral parliament then sat only twice a year for about three months in total holding discussions in afternoons either side of a half hour break for tea on lawn smith s early parliamentary commitments in salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching his maiden speech to legislative assembly in november 1948 concerned union of south africa trade agreement bill then at its second reading he was slow to make an impact in parliament most of his early contributions related to farming and mining but his exertions within party won him stockil s respect and confidence janet ran gwenoro during smith s absences and gave birth to his only biological child alec in gwelo on 20 may 1949 smith also served as a presbyterian elder pursuit of full dominion status was then regarded as something of a non issue by most southern rhodesian politicians they viewed themselves as virtually independent already they lacked only foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder expense for high commissions and embassies overseas huggins and united party instead pursued an initially semi independent federation with northern rhodesia and nyasaland two protectorates directly administered from london with hope of ultimately creating a single united dominion in south central africa smith was one of few to raise independence issue at this time according to his memoirs because his instinct and training told me to be prepared for every contingency during federation debate in house of assembly he posited that since southern rhodesia was effectively choosing federation over independence a clause should be inserted into bill guaranteeing southern rhodesia dominion status in event of a federal break up united party rejected this on grounds that federation had to be declared indissoluble so it could raise loans smith was uncertain about federal project but publicly supported it after mostly white electorate approved it in a referendum in april 1953 he told rhodesia herald that now it had been decided to pursue federation it was in southern rhodesia s best interests for everybody to try to make it succeed he and other rhodesia party politicians joined new federal party headed by huggins and northern rhodesia s sir roy welensky on 29 april 1953 federation chief whip thumb three territories of federation of rhodesia and nyasaland alt a map see description federation was overtly led by southern rhodesia most developed of three territories salisbury was its capital and huggins its first prime minister garfield todd replaced huggins as prime minister of southern rhodesia resigning his selukwe seat smith contested and won federal assembly s midlands constituency in inaugural federal election on 15 december 1953 and thereafter continued as a backbench member of little distinction in recollection of welensky who took over as federal prime minister on huggins s retirement in 1956 smith didn t spend much time in salisbury during early federal period and had three major interests one was daylight saving one was european education and he always showed an interest in farming smith received his first political office in november 1958 following that month s federal election in which he was returned as mp for after one of welensky s federal cabinet ministers requested smith s appointment as a parliamentary secretary in new united federal party ufp government welensky turned this down saying that while he appreciated smith s relative seniority on back benches after 10 years in parliament he did not think he had shown particular drive that i would have expected for such a role he decided to instead give smith a run as chief whip which is generally step to a ministerial appointment and see how he works out according to his biographer berlyn smith remained a somewhat pedestrian figure as chief whip though he was acknowledged by his peers as someone who did his homework well whenever he contributed clifford dupont then smith s counterpart as chief whip of dominion party later commented that ufp s huge majority in federal assembly gave smith little opportunity to distinguish himself as few votes were ever in serious doubt leaving ufp amid decolonisation and wind of change idea of no independence before majority rule gained considerable ground in british political circles during late 1950s and early 1960s federation which had faced black opposition from start particularly in northern rhodesia and nyasaland grew ever more tenuous despite todd s lowering of southern rhodesia s educational and financial voting qualifications in 1957 to enlarge black electorate very few of newly enfranchised blacks registered to vote partly because black nationalist movement targeted those who did with arson attacks and petrol bombings attempting to advance case for southern rhodesian independence particularly in event of federal dissolution sir edgar whitehead who replaced todd in 1958 agreed to a new constitution with britain in 1961 1961 constitution contained no explicit independence guarantees but whitehead welensky and other proponents nevertheless presented it to southern rhodesian electorate as independence constitution under which southern rhodesia would become a commonwealth realm on a par with australia canada and new zealand if federation broke up smith was one of loudest voices of white dissent against new constitution he opposed its splitting of heretofore non racial qualified electorate into graduated a and b rolls saying proposed system had racialist connotations and objected to idea that first black mps would be elected on what he said would be a debased franchise our policy in past has always been that we would have a government in rhodesia based on merit and that people wouldn t worry whether you were black or whether you were white he said he also pointed out that document did not actually guarantee southern rhodesian independence in event of federal dissolution at ufp vote on constitution on 22 february 1961 smith was only member out of 280 to vote against it deeply disillusioned by these developments he resigned from ufp soon after to sit in federal assembly as an independent he lent his support to united group an awkward coalition wherein winston field s conservative dominion party closed ranks with sir robert tredgold and other liberals against constitutional proposals despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons black nationalist leaders initially endorsed constitution signing draft document but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it a referendum of mostly white electorate approved new constitution by a majority of 65 on 26 july 1961 forming rhodesian front as uk government granted majority rule in nyasaland and made moves towards same in northern rhodesia smith decided that federation was a lost cause and resolved to found a new party that would push for southern rhodesian independence without an immediate transfer of power with support of millionaire rancher miner and industrialist d c boss lilford he formed rhodesian reform party rrp based around defectors from ufp in december 1961 meanwhile whitehead attempted to counter black nationalists and persuade newly eligible blacks to register as voters he banned main nationalist group national democratic party for being violent and intimidatory it reformed overnight as zimbabwe african people s union zapu and announced that ufp would repeal land apportionment act which segregated ownership and occupation of certain areas on a racial basis if it won next southern rhodesian election commitments such as these won ufp few black votes and prompted many scandalised whites to defect to rrp or field s dominion party smith field and others met in salisbury on 13 march 1962 and agreed to unite against whitehead as rhodesian front rf front ranged from former ufp men including smith who advocated gradual transition and a government based on merit and electoral qualifications to dominion party s more right wing members some of whom held segregationist views not dissimilar to those of south africa s national party amid these differences nascent rf coalition was shaky at best its members were brought together by their common opposition to whitehead s promises of fast track reform which they agreed would lead to a congo style national crisis flight of white community and ultimately country s destruction in wider cold war context ardently anti communist rf aspired to represent a pro western bulwark in africa alongside south africa and portugal in face of what they saw as soviet and chinese expansionism smith asserted that rf worked to thwart this mad idea of a hand over of a sell out of european and his civilisation indeed of everything he had put into his country white man is master of rhodesia he said he has built it and intends to keep it rf ignored april 1962 federal elections deeming them irrelevant and instead concentrated on southern rhodesian elections that were due at end of year whitehead attempted to curb continuing black nationalist violence through new legislation and in september 1962 banned zapu arresting 1 094 of its members and describing it as a terrorist organisation but he was still seen by much of electorate as too liberal he set a general election for 14 december 1962 a number of corporations that had previously funded ufp campaigning this time backed rf rf campaign exploited chaos in congo and uncertainty regarding southern rhodesia s future to create a theme of urgency it pledged to keep power in responsible hands to defend land apportionment act to oppose compulsory integration and to win southern rhodesian independence electoral race was close run until night before election day when whitehead made what proved a fatal political gaffe by telling a public meeting at marandellas that he would appoint a black cabinet minister immediately if he won election and might soon have as many as six this statement appeared on radio news just before polling booths opened next morning and stunned white voters many abandoned whitehead at last minute results announced on 15 december 1962 put rf into government with 35 a roll seats to ufp s 15 a roll and 14 b roll seats few had expected this even rf was somewhat taken aback by its victory though smith later described feeling quietly confident on election day contesting constituency in rural south west he bested ufp s reginald segar by 803 votes to 546 deputy prime minister under field announcing his cabinet on 17 december 1962 field named smith his deputy prime minister and minister of treasury two days later r a butler uk s deputy prime minister and first secretary of state announced that uk government would allow nyasaland to leave federation with northern rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government kenneth kaunda and harry nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep ufp out and southern rhodesia under rf federation was effectively over field cabinet made southern rhodesian independence on federal dissolution its first priority but conservative government in uk was reluctant to grant this under 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in united nations un and commonwealth indeed southern rhodesia s minority government had already become something of an embarrassment to uk and it hurt britain s reputation to even maintain status quo there granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from conservatives main parliamentary opposition labour party which was strongly anti colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions thumb victoria falls hotel where federal break up conference was held in 1963 alt a large white colonial style hotel butler announced on 6 march 1963 that he was going to convene a conference to decide federation s future it would be impossible or at least very difficult for uk to dissolve union without southern rhodesia s co operation as latter being self governing had been co signatory to federal agreement in 1953 according to smith field dupont and other rf politicians butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure southern rhodesia s attendance and support at conference but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper field and smith claimed that butler justified this to them day before conference began by saying that binding whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against commonwealth s spirit of trust an argument that field eventually accepted let s remember trust you emphasised smith warned according to field s account wagging his finger at butler if you break that you will live to regret it no minutes were made of this meeting butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise southern rhodesia attended conference held at victoria falls hotel over a week starting from 28 june 1963 and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate federation at end of 1963 federation dissolved on 31 december 1963 with nyasaland and northern rhodesia both on track for full statehood by end of 1964 while southern rhodesia continued to drift in uncertainty under huge pressure from rf to rectify this matter and win independence field s perceived vacillation and in his dealings with uk government caused sections of his party to lose confidence in him during early 1964 on 2 april 1964 with smith in chair rf caucus passed a near unanimous vote of no confidence in field leading to prime minister s resignation 11 days later smith accepted cabinet s nomination to take his place he was first southern rhodesian prime minister to have been born in country something that he thought profoundly altered character of dispute with britain for first time in its history country now had a rhodesian born pm someone whose roots were not in britain but in southern africa he later reflected in other words a white african prime minister first days banning of pcc zapu and zanu most of southern rhodesian press predicted that smith would not last long one column called him a momentary man thrust into spotlight by rf s dearth of proven leaders his only real rival to replace field had been william harper an ardent segregationist who had headed dominion party s southern rhodesian branch during federal years some reporters predicted welensky s imminent introduction to southern rhodesian politics at head of an rf ufp coalition government but welensky showed little interest in this idea saying he would be unable to manoeuvre in an rf dominated house rf s replacement of field with smith drew criticism from british labour leader harold wilson who called it brutal while j b johnston british high commissioner in salisbury indicated his disapproval by refusing to meet smith for two weeks after he took office zapu leader joshua nkomo branded new smith cabinet a suicide squad interested not in welfare of all people but only in their own and predicted that rf would eventually destroy themselves asserting that a lasting place for white man in southern rhodesia would benefit all of country s people new prime minister said government should be based on merit not on colour or nationalism and insisted that there would be no african nationalist government here in my lifetime smith announced his cabinet on his first day in office 14 april 1964 he increased number of ministers from 10 to 11 redistributed portfolios and made three new appointments smith s fellow former ufp men made up most of new rf cabinet with harper and minister of agriculture duke of montrose also called lord graham heading a minority of hardline dominion party veterans ken flower whom field had appointed director of central intelligence organisation cio on its creation previous year was surprised to be retained by smith smith announced his policies to nation through full page advertisements in newspapers no forced integration no lowering of standards no abdication of responsible government no repeal of land apportionment act no appeasement to suit afro asian bloc an honest rhodesian a 1964 political poster declared trust mr smith he will never hand over rhodesia one of smith government s first actions was to crack down hard on black nationalist political violence that had erupted following establishment of a second black nationalist organisation zimbabwe african national union zanu by disgruntled zapu members in tanzania in august 1963 rival movements were split tribally zapu being mostly ndebele and zanu predominantly shona and politically zapu which had relabelled itself people s caretaker council pcc within southern rhodesia to circumvent its ban was marxist leninist and backed by warsaw pact and its allies while zanu had aligned itself with maoism and bloc headed by communist china their respective supporters in black townships clashed constantly also targeting non aligned blacks whom they hoped to recruit and sporadically attacked whites businesses and police stations amid pcc zapu s calls for various strikes and protests including an appeal for black children to boycott state schools smith s justice minister clifford dupont had nkomo and other pcc zapu leaders restricted at in remote south east two days after smith took office politically motivated killing of a white man petrus near melsetter by zanu insurgents on 4 july 1964 marked start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in banning of zanu and pcc zapu on 26 august with most of two movements respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted zanu zapu and their respective guerrilla armies zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla and zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra thereafter operated from abroad unilateral declaration of independence udi smith who had been to uk only four times before 1964 and never more than briefly was soon labelled a raw colonial by whitehall he was almost immediately at loggerheads with uk government which he claimed had forsaken british ideals and commonwealth which he said had abandoned its own founding principles amid wind of change he accused both of isolating southern rhodesia because it still respected these values when he learned in june that salisbury would not be represented at commonwealth prime ministers conference for first time since 1932 he was deeply insulted and alleged british betrayal double standards and appeasement three months later smith accepted british condition that independence terms had to be acceptable to majority opinion but impasse immediately developed regarding mechanism by which black views would be gauged labour s narrow victory in october 1964 uk general election meant that smith would be negotiating not with sir alec douglas home but with harold wilson who was far less accommodating towards rf stand smith declared acceptability to majority opinion to have been demonstrated after a largely white referendum and an indaba of tribal chiefs and headmen both decisively backed independence under 1961 constitution in october and november 1964 but black nationalists and uk government dismissed indaba as insufficiently representative of black community thumb upright uk prime minister harold wilson who took office in october 1964 proved a formidable opponent of smith alt a photograph of harold wilson following northern rhodesia s independence as zambia in october 1964 nyasaland had been independent malawi since july southern rhodesia began referring to itself simply as rhodesia but whitehall rejected this change perceiving smith to be on verge of a unilateral declaration of independence udi wilson issued a statement in october 1964 warning of dire economic and political consequences and wrote to smith demanding a categorical assurance forthwith that no udi would be attempted smith ignored this expressing confusion as to what he had done to provoke it uk and rhodesian governments exchanged often confrontational correspondence over next year or so each accusing other of being unreasonable and intransigent little progress was made when two prime ministers met in person in january 1965 when smith travelled to london for sir winston churchill s funeral rf called a fresh election for may 1965 and campaigning on an election promise of independence won all 50 a roll seats elected mostly by whites wilson s ministers deliberately smith during mid 1965 hoping to eventually break him down but this only caused rhodesian hierarchy to feel yet more alienated from june a peripheral dispute concerned rhodesia s unilateral and ultimately successful attempt to open an independent mission in lisbon portugal s acceptance of this in september 1965 prompted british outrage and rhodesian delight amid rumours that udi was imminent smith arrived in london on 4 october 1965 with declared intent of settling independence issue but flew home eight days later with matter unresolved when wilson travelled to salisbury on 26 october smith offered to enfranchise about half a million black rhodesians immediately along lines of one taxpayer one vote in return for independence but wilson said this was unacceptable as most blacks would still be excluded he proposed a royal commission to test public opinion in rhodesia regarding independence under 1961 constitution and suggested that uk might safeguard black representation in rhodesian parliament by withdrawing relevant devolved powers this latter prospect horrified smith s team as it seemed to them to have ruled out failsafe option of keeping status quo after wilson returned to britain on 30 october 1965 he presented terms for royal commission that rhodesians found unacceptable among other things britain would not commit itself to accepting results smith rejected these conditions on 5 november saying they made whole exercise pointless after waiting a few days for new terms from wilson smith made a consensus decision with his cabinet to break ties unilaterally on 11 november 1965 and signed unilateral declaration of independence at 11 00 local time fallout from udi udi while received calmly by most rhodesians prompted political outrage in uk and overseas it astonished wilson who called on people of rhodesia to ignore post udi government which he described as hell bent on illegal self destroying following orders from whitehall and passage of southern rhodesia act 1965 colonial governor sir humphrey gibbs formally sacked smith and his cabinet accusing them of treason smith and his ministers ignored this considering gibbs s office obsolete under 1965 constitution enacted as part of udi after gibbs made clear that he would not resign smith s government effectively replaced him with dupont who was appointed to post of officer administering government created by 1965 constitution no attempt was made to remove gibbs from his official residence at government house however he remained there ignored by smith administration until declaration of a republic in 1970 smith and his government initially continued to profess loyalty to queen elizabeth ii 1965

general assembly and security council quickly joined uk in condemning udi as illegal and racist security council resolutions 216 and 217 adopted in days following smith s declaration denounced udi as an illegitimate usurpation of power by a racist settler minority and called on nations not to entertain diplomatic or economic relations no country recognised rhodesia as independent black nationalists in rhodesia and their overseas backers prominently organisation of african unity oau clamoured for uk to remove smith s government with a military invasion but britain dismissed this option citing logistical issues risk of provoking a pre emptive rhodesian strike on zambia and psychological issues likely to accompany any confrontation between british and rhodesian troops wilson instead resolved to end udi through economic sanctions banning supply of oil to rhodesia and import of most rhodesian goods to britain when smith continued to receive oil through south africa and portuguese mozambique wilson posted a royal navy squadron to mozambique channel in march 1966 this blockade beira patrol was endorsed by un security council resolution 221 following month wilson predicted in january 1966 that various boycotts would force smith to give in within a matter of weeks rather than months but british and later un sanctions had little effect on rhodesia largely because south africa and portugal went on trading with it providing it with oil and other key resources clandestine trade with other nations also continued initially at a reduced level and diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand even many oau states while bombarding rhodesia with opprobrium continued importing rhodesian food and other products rhodesia thus avoided economic cataclysm predicted by wilson and gradually became more self sufficient rhodesia can not only take it but she can also make it smith said on 29 april 1966 while opening annual central african trade fair in bulawayo when i say take it i use it in two ways firstly when it comes to sanctions we have proved we can take it secondly when it comes to independence we have also proved we can take it tiger and fearless talks with wilson thumb gibraltar venue for talks between smith and wilson in 1966 and 1968 alt rock of gibraltar seen from sea wilson told uk s house of commons in january 1966 that he would not enter any kind of dialogue with smith s post udi government which he called illegal regime until it gave up its claim of independence but by mid 1966 british and rhodesian civil servants were holding talks about talks in london and salisbury by november that year wilson had agreed to negotiate personally with smith smith and wilson subsequently held two rounds of direct negotiations both of which were held aboard royal navy ships off gibraltar first took place aboard hms tiger between 2 and 4 december 1966 while second aboard hms fearless was held between 8 and 13 october 1968 uk s prime minister went to hms tiger in a belligerent mindset wilson s political secretary marcia later wrote of apartheid on that ship with british and rhodesian delegations separated in all activities outside conference room at wilson s orders despite uneasy atmosphere accounts from both sides describe wilson dealing with rhodesians extremely tersely talks progressed relatively smoothly until subject turned to manner of transition wilson insisted on abandonment of 1965 constitution dissolution of post udi government in favour of a broad based multiracial interim administration and a period under a british governor conditions that smith saw as tantamount to surrender particularly as uk proposed to draft and introduce new constitution only after a fresh test of opinion under uk control when smith asserted on 3 december that he could not settle without first consulting his cabinet in salisbury wilson was enraged declaring that a central condition of summit had been that he and smith would have plenipotentiary powers to make a deal according to j r t wood wilson and his attorney general sir elwyn jones then bullied smith for two long days to try to get him to settle without success a working document was ultimately produced and signed by smith wilson and gibbs to be accepted or rejected in its entirety by each cabinet after prime ministers returned home whitehall accepted proposals but salisbury turned them down smith announced on 5 december 1966 that while he and his ministers were largely satisfied with terms cabinet did not feel it could responsibly abandon 1965 constitution while so much uncertainty surrounded transition and new mythical constitution yet to be evolved rhodesia s leader of opposition josiah gondo promptly demanded smith s resignation reasoning that cabinet s rejection of working document he had helped to draft amounted to a vote of no confidence rf ignored him warning that grave actions must follow wilson took rhodesia problem to united nations which proceeded to institute first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with security council resolutions 232 december 1966 and 253 april 1968 these measures required un member states to prevent all trade and economic links with rhodesia thumb left hms fearless royal navy ship that hosted 1968 anglo rhodesian summit off

retained considerable powers to control information it may reflect no more than mr smith s growing confidence that nothing short of a sell out to britain can undermine his position in rhodesia series of rhodesian high court cases debating legality of udi came to a close five months later on 13 september a panel of judges headed by sir hugh beadle ruled udi 1965 constitution and smith s government to be de jure prompting uk commonwealth secretary george thomson to accuse them of breaching fundamental laws of land on hms fearless uk reversed its confrontational approach of tiger talks and made a marked effort to appear genial and welcoming mixing socially with rhodesians and accommodating smith in admiral s cabin on hms kent which was moored alongside marked progress towards agreement was made for example wilson dropped altogether transition period under a colonial governor but rhodesian delegation now demurred on a new british proposal double safeguard this would involve elected black rhodesians controlling a blocking quarter in rhodesian parliament and thereafter having right to appeal passed legislation to privy council in london smith s team accepted principle of blocking quarter but agreement could not be reached on technicalities of it involvement of uk privy council was rejected by smith as a ridiculous provision that would prejudice rhodesia s sovereignty fearless

a republic failed accord with douglas home with their hopes of commonwealth realm status through a settlement with britain dimming smith and rf began to seriously consider alternative of a republic as early as december 1966 after tiger talks republicanism was presented as a means to clarify rhodesia s claimed constitutional status end ambiguity regarding ties with britain and elicit official

surprise election victory in uk edward heath took over as prime minister while douglas home became foreign secretary talks between douglas home and smith began with a lengthy meeting in salisbury in april 1971 and continued until a tentative understanding was reached in early november a uk delegation headed by douglas home and attorney general sir peter rawlinson flew to salisbury on 15 november for negotiations over a new constitution and after six days of discussion an accord was signed on 21 november 1971 constitution agreed upon was based largely on one rhodesia had just adopted but would eventually bring about a black majority in parliament black representation in house would be immediately increased and a majority of both black and white mps would have to approve retrogressive legislation blacks would thus wield an effective veto as long as they voted solidly together robert blake comments principle of majority rule was enshrined with safeguards ensuring that there could be no legislation which could impede this smith wrote in his memoirs on other hand there would be no mad rush into one man one vote with all resultant corruption nepotism chaos and economic disaster

by an unspecified large majority this came as a great shock to white community and a deep disappointment to those in britain who hoped to get rid of this tiresome albatross blake records smith

returned to power in uk in march 1974 portugal s withdrawal made rhodesia hugely dependent on south africa but smith still insisted that he held a strong position if it takes one year five years ten years we re prepared to ride it out he told rf congress on 20 september 1974 our stand is clear and unambiguous settlement is desirable but only on our terms geopolitical situation tilted further against smith in december 1974 when south african prime minister b j vorster pressured him into accepting a detente initiative involving frontline states of zambia tanzania and botswana mozambique and angola would join following year vorster had concluded that rhodesia s position was untenable and that south african interests would be better served by collaborating with black african governments over a rhodesian settlement he hoped that success in this might win south africa some international legitimacy and allow it to retain apartheid detente forced a ceasefire giving guerrillas time to regroup and required rhodesians to release zanu and zapu leaders so they could attend a conference in rhodesia united under uanc banner and led by muzorewa when rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on grounds that zanla and zipra were not observing ceasefire vorster harried smith further by withdrawing south african police which had been helping rhodesians patrol

to consolidate his leadership of guerrillas while sithole joined muzorewa s delegation it had been agreed that talks would take place within rhodesia but black nationalists refused to meet on ground they perceived as not neutral rhodesians insisted on abiding by accord and negotiating inside country to please both camps conference was held on a train halfway across victoria falls bridge on border between rhodesia and zambia delegations sat on opposite sides of frontier conference which took place on 26 august 1975 with kaunda and vorster as mediators failed to produce a settlement each side accused other of being unreasonable smith afterwards held direct talks with nkomo and zapu in salisbury but these also led nowhere nkomo proposed an immediate transition to an interim government headed by himself which smith rejected guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in first months of 1976 on 20 march 1976 smith gave a televised speech including what became his most quoted utterance i don t believe in majority rule ever in rhodesia not in 1 000 years he said i repeat that i believe in blacks and whites working together if one day it is white and next day it is black i believe we have failed and it will be a disaster for rhodesia first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with black nationalists even though speech was one in which smith had said that power sharing with black rhodesians was inevitable and that we have got to accept that in future rhodesia is a country for black and white not white as opposed to black and vice versa not in 1 000 years comment was according to peter godwin an attempt to reassure rf s right wing which opposed any transition whatsoever that white rhodesians would not be sold out in her 1978 biography of smith berlyn comments that regardless of whether statement was taken out of context or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted this was one of his greatest blunders as prime minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors thumb upright henry kissinger us secretary of state was instrumental in smith s public acceptance in 1976 of principle of majority rule alt a black and white photograph of henry kissinger henry kissinger us secretary of state announced a formal interest in rhodesian situation in february 1976 and over next half year held discussions with united kingdom south africa and frontline states in what became anglo american initiative meeting smith in pretoria on 18 september 1976 kissinger proposed majority rule after a transition period of two years according to smith kissinger told him he considered his participation in demise of rhodesia to be one of great tragedies of my life he strongly encouraged smith to accept his deal though he knew it was unpalatable to him as any future offer could only be worse from smith s standpoint especially if as expected us president gerald ford lost upcoming election to jimmy carter smith expressed great reluctance but agreed on 24 september after vorster intimated that south africa might cut off financial and military aid if he refused it was first time smith had publicly accepted principles of unconditional majority rule and one man one vote however frontline states then abruptly revised their stance and turned kissinger terms down saying that any transition period was unacceptable uk quickly arranged an all party conference in geneva switzerland to try to salvage a solution zanu and zapu announced that they would attend this and any summit thereafter as a joint patriotic front pf including members of both parties under a combined leadership geneva conference held between october and december 1976 under british mediation also failed internal settlement and lancaster house becoming zimbabwe smith s moves towards a settlement with black nationalist groups prompted outrage in sections of rhodesian front s right wing but he remained unassailable within party as a whole which had in late 1975 granted him a mandate to negotiate for best possible settlement however he saw fit split in party ultimately led to defection in july 1977 of 12 rf mps after smith introduced legislation to remove racial criteria from land tenure act loss of these seats to breakaway rhodesian action party which opposed any conciliation with black nationalists meant that smith now only barely had two thirds majority in parliament he would need to change constitution as he would have to in event of a settlement he therefore called an early election and on 31 august 1977 roundly defeated defectors dirty dozen rf called them as well as all other opposition for third time in seven years rf had won all 50 white seats party revolt turned out to be a blessing in disguise for smith berlyn comments as it allowed him to shed dead wood of right wing giving him more freedom in negotiations with nationalists need for a settlement was becoming

zanu and zapu were invited to participate but refused nkomo sardonically dubbed smith s black colleagues blacksmiths deal was badly received abroad partly because it kept police military judiciary and civil service in white hands there would be a senate of 20 blacks and 10 whites and whites would be reserved 28 out of 100 seats in new house of assembly smith and nkomo re entered negotiations in august 1978 but these ended after zipra shot down an air rhodesia passenger flight on 3 september and massacred survivors at crash site smith cut off talks introduced martial law across most of country and ordered reprisal attacks on guerrilla positions smith muzorewa and sithole toured us in october 1978 to promote their settlement and met kissinger ford and others including future president ronald reagan on 11 december zanla attacked salisbury s oil storage depot causing a fire that lasted six days and destroyed a quarter of rhodesia s fuel two months later zipra downed another civilian flight this time killing all on board after whites endorsed internal settlement by 85 in a referendum on 30 january 1979 smith dissolved rhodesian parliament for last time on 28 february rf won all white seats in april 1979 elections while muzorewa and uanc won a majority in common roll seats with 67 of popular vote pf rejected this however as did un which passed a resolution branding it a sham sithole astounded that his party had won only 12 seats to uanc s 51 suddenly turned against settlement and alleged that polls had been stage managed in muzorewa s favour mugabe dismissed bishop as a puppet and pledged to continue zanla s campaign to last man nkomo similarly committed zipra on 1 june 1979 day of country s official reconstitution as zimbabwe rhodesia muzorewa replaced smith as prime minister at head of a uanc rf coalition cabinet made up of 12 blacks and five whites smith was included as minister without portfolio nkomo promptly dubbed him minister with all portfolios an observer group from uk conservative party did regard april 1979 elections as fair and margaret thatcher conservative leader was personally disposed to recognise muzorewa s government and lift sanctions potential significance of conservative victory in may 1979 british general election was not lost on smith who wrote to thatcher all rhodesians thank god for your magnificent victory us senate passed a resolution urging president carter to remove sanctions and declare zimbabwe rhodesia legitimate but carter and his cabinet remained strongly opposed carter and thatcher ultimately decided against accepting zimbabwe rhodesia noting continued international support for guerrillas after commonwealth heads of government meeting in lusaka in august 1979 uk foreign secretary lord carrington invited zimbabwe rhodesian government and patriotic front to attend an all party constitutional conference at lancaster house in london starting on 10 september smith was part of muzorewa s delegation at lancaster house several aspects of internal settlement constitution such as a declaration of human rights and a guarantee that land redistributed by government would be paid for were retained it was also agreed to have 20 reserved white seats out of 100 for at least seven years fresh elections would be held during a brief period under a british governor invested with full executive and legislative powers new constitution was agreed on 18 october and on 12 december 1979 house of assembly voted to dissolve itself ending udi lord soames arrived in salisbury later same day to become southern rhodesia s last governor among other things he announced that smith would be granted amnesty for declaring independence final lancaster house agreement was signed on 21 december

captain sir douglas bader uk government and international community ultimately declared february 1980 general election free and fair though many observers attested to widespread political violence and

disciplinary murders as examples of fate awaiting those who failed to conform name taking and claims to possession of machines which would reveal how individuals had voted commonwealth observer group acknowledged that irregularities were occurring but ruled that accounts were exaggerated after rf won all 20 white seats soames announced late on 4 march 1980 that mugabe and zanu pf had won 57 of 80 common roll seats giving them a majority in new house of assembly mugabe invited smith to his house that evening and according to smith treated him most courteously mugabe expressed joy at inheriting a wonderful country with modern infrastructure and a viable economy outlined plans for gradual reform that smith found reasonable and said that he hoped to stay in regular contact this meeting had a profound effect on former prime minister having denounced mugabe as an apostle of satan before election smith now publicly endorsed him as sober and responsible if this were a true picture then there could be hope instead of despair he recalled in his autobiography when i got home i said to janet that i hoped it was not an hallucination opposition first years under mugabe thumb upright robert

formal independence from britain with smith as reconstituted country s first leader of opposition continuing a long standing tradition from rhodesian era government and opposition entered house in pairs mugabe and smith walked in side by side with their respective mps following aptly ing mood of reconciliation martin meredith comments with around 1 000 whites leaving zimbabwe each month smith took to radio to urge them to stay and give mugabe s new order a chance but over half of country s whites left within three years as meredith records 100 000 or so who remained retreated into their own world of clubs sporting activities and comfortable living mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to white farming community which accounted for at least 75 of zimbabwe s agricultural output amid booming zimbabwean commodity prices in years immediately following 1980 many white commercial farmers came to support mugabe new prime minister continued cordially meeting smith until rf leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a one party state smith said this was putting off foreign investors mugabe was not impressed and according to smith refused to ever meet him again as mugabe s main opponent in parliament at head of republican front as rf renamed itself in 1981 smith presented himself as guardian of what he called zimbabwe s white tribe he spoke gloomily about zimbabwe s future prospects repeatedly accused mugabe administration of corruption malevolence and general incompetence and criticised mugabe s support for a one party system rf took an increasingly confrontational line in house after mugabe and other government ministers began regularly pouring scorn on white community in national broadcasts and other media amid rising tensions with south africa various white zimbabweans were arrested accused of being south african agents and tortured when smith complained about whites being imprisoned without trial under emergency powers a number of zanu pf mps pointed out that they themselves had been detained under that same legislation and for far longer by smith s government mugabe openly admitted torturing suspected spies had some who were found not guilty by high court immediately rearrested on street outside and accused western critics of caring only because people in question were white smith visited britain and united states in november 1982 and spoke scathingly about zimbabwe to reporters claiming that mugabe was turning country into a totalitarian marxist leninist dictatorship government retribution was immediate on smith s return home police raided an art exhibition hosting him as guest of honour in harare as salisbury had been renamed in april 1982 and took all attendees in for questioning ostensibly because of suspicions it might be an illegal political meeting a week later police seized his passport according to a government statement because his criticism of zimbabwe while abroad constituted political bad manners and hooliganism police meticulously searched his harare house and gwenoro over next week confiscating firearms personal papers and a diary smith told reporters all this was part of game to intimidate me and so demoralise whites some rf mps left party to sit with zanu pf or as independents feeling that constantly confronting mugabe was ill advised and unnecessary smith remained convinced that nobody would stand up for white zimbabweans if they did not stick together and defend their interests in parliament smith hempstone later wrote that former prime minister had resolved to go down with all rhetorical guns blazing this was in spite of increasingly unstable health in june 1982 he collapsed in house of assembly clutching at his side and shaking half a year later he had to arrange treatment in south africa for a condition stemming from hardening of arteries government s confiscation of his passport and two refusals of its return prevented him from going so in april 1983 smith successfully applied for a british passport i ll still try to get my zimbabwean passport back he said i was born here and that is passport i should travel on smith regained his zimbabwean papers after about a year in 1984 he declared his intention to renounce his british nationality to abide by a new zimbabwean law outlawing multiple citizenship britain did not recognise this legislation according to smith british officials refused to take his uk passport when he tried to return it gukurahundi last years in politics after already tense relations between zanu pf and zapu disintegrated amid mugabe s wish to adopt a one party system in zimbabwe mugabe expelled nkomo from government in february 1982 accusing him and zapu of plotting a coup about a year later mugabe deployed north korean trained 5th brigade to matabeleland zapu s heartland where it massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting dissidents in what came to be called gukurahundi meredith asserts that this far exceeded anything that had occurred during bush war an opinion shared by geoff hill some white farmers were also killed estimates for number of deaths during five year gukurahundi campaign range from 10 000 to 30 000 mugabe concurrently took steps to marginalise other main black nationalist leaders from chimurenga nkomo fled to uk in march 1983 fearing for his life sithole similarly exiled himself in united states muzorewa stayed in zimbabwe and was detained in late 1983 for alleged subversive links with south africa on arriving in england nkomo accused mugabe of genocide and asserted that things are worse now than they ever were under ian smith mugabe denied that anything improper was happening and put reports to contrary down to reactionary foreign journalists zimbabwean government publicly threatened smith on a regular basis but in practice left him and his property largely untouched mugabe frequently pointed to smith s freedom as evidence of zimbabwe s reconciliation policy smith renamed rf conservative alliance of zimbabwe caz on 21 july 1984 concurrently removing racial criteria for membership and inviting black zimbabweans to join caz was very successful in 1985 parliamentary election winning 15 of 20 white seats smith won decisively in bulawayo central mugabe interpreted this as racists of this country defying his government and rejecting reconciliation and immediately pledged to abolish white seats which he said compromised sovereignty of our people after smith described mugabe s government as illiterate on bbc television in november 1985 mugabe told house of assembly smith was an incorrigible racist who should long ago have been hanged and hanged publicly later that month smith s close friend and long standing political associate boss lilford who had provided much of finance to form rf was found beaten and shot to death on his ranch smith described lilford afterwards as a man who was prepared to die for his principles but refused to openly discuss any possible political motive saying simply that it would be premature to come to conclusions smith was by now in twilight of his career but his outspoken confrontational stance continued to irritate zanu pf government he was declared a fifth columnist by information minister nathan shamuyarira in february 1987 after he advised a group of south african businessmen that they could survive economic sanctions if white south africans stood together three months later after he was suspended from zimbabwean parliament for a year over his comments in south africa and criticism of zanu pf he resigned as leader of caz his four decades as an mp formally ended in september 1987 when as allowed under lancaster house terms zanu pf scrapped white seats amid sweeping constitutional reforms office of prime minister was abolished in october mugabe became country s first executive president two months later mugabe and nkomo signed a unity accord at same time merging zapu into zanu pf with stated goal of a marxist leninist one party state this marked end of smith s front line political career gerald smith no relation replaced him as leader of caz but he remained active in opposition at a reduced level in july 1992 he chaired a meeting where caz muzorewa s uanc sithole s zanu party and edgar tekere s zimbabwe unity movement formed a coalition to challenge mugabe and zanu pf in next parliamentary election result was short lived united front which smith agreed to chair saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead united front quickly failed largely due to lack of common ground between constituent parties and never contested an election another brief collaboration between smith muzorewa and sithole in march 2000 also led to nothing retirement thumb upright smith in 1990 speaking at a dinner held in his honour by conservative monday club in england alt an

in for tea he still owned gwenoro but employed a manager to run it after janet s death in 1994 he insisted that he would never leave zimbabwe don t get fazed by riots hold your head high do not be afraid a friend reported him saying show you are not and government will leave you alone he dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography great betrayal to criticising mugabe administration and a long succession of british figures he considered to have let him and rhodesia down he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as prime minister and praised nelson mandela calling him africa s first black statesman smith s enduring popularity among white zimbabweans was evidenced by long queues they formed to have him sign copies of book on its release in harare in december 1997 they were captured hiding their faces and turning to wall as television cameras recorded their betrayal for evening news josephine fisher records not all of country s whites admired smith some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion 2000 2002 back in public eye according to meredith governmental mismanagement and widespread corruption within zanu pf order led to mugabe and others enriching themselves considerably at expense of country as a whole in meredith s view average zimbabwean was worse off in 2000 than he had been in 1980 average wages were lower unemployment had trebled public services were crumbling and life expectancy was falling opposition to zanu pf grew particularly in towns and cities in 2000 hoping to win support from rural blacks mugabe introduced a fast track land reform programme under which groups of zanu pf activists officially referred to as war veterans were sent to take over white owned farms so land could be split up without compensation and redistributed to black peasant farmers white farmers and their black employees were violently forced out food production plummeted and economy collapsed to half size it had been in 1980 when a group of about 50 zanu pf activists briefly invaded gwenoro in may 2000 smith played down incident saying intruders were just bored and out of work there s no politics on farm he said five months later in england to address oxford union smith described mugabe as mentally deranged president announced in response that smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to zimbabwe a threat that smith mocked i would love that let him try it he said it would give me chance to tell world truth about this gangster i will give him date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at airport a mass of reporters descended on harare international airport on 7 november 2000 to witness smith s arrest but far from being detained former prime minister was greeted by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction telling waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation he commented we have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality and went home unmolested in early september 2001 zanu pf militants again attempted to force smith off his farm former prime minister telephoned provincial governor who promptly sent police to remove invaders according to smith trespassers were shocked to hear authorities were taking his side and left before police even arrived half a year later smith lost his zimbabwean passport as a result of further tightening of law regarding multiple citizenship new legislation passed in 2001 required zimbabwean citizens to disavow any claim to other nationalities even if they did not hold foreign passports insisting that mugabe s government had no right to strip him of zimbabwean citizenship smith refused to renounce his right to british nationality though he had not held a uk passport for years zimbabwean authorities duly refused to renew smith s passport in march 2002 state press reported that he had automatically ceased to be a citizen of zimbabwe on passport s expiry having failed to renounce british citizenship before a deadline on 8 january that year smith claimed that his zimbabwean citizenship had been illegally revoked and that he was now stateless an assertion disputed by minister of home affairs john nkomo who said that smith could stay in country but would not receive a new zimbabwean passport until he renounced his right to british nationality by 2002 white community in zimbabwe had shrunk to no more than 50 000 people of whom many like smith were elderly smith had by this time lost most of his former international prominence his visit to uk in 2004 to meet conservative politicians was largely ignored by british press but he achieved new domestic popularity and eminence among zimbabwean opposition supporters who came to see him as an unbreakable defiant symbol of resistance to mugabe government according to r w johnson a speech he gave to students at university of zimbabwe condemning mugabe and zanu pf as incompetent and corrupt gangsters earned him a standing ovation in 2002 smith challenged mugabe to come with him to a township to see who got best welcome only one of us will come out alive smith said i m ready to put that to test right now he s not final years and death thumb st james cape town suburb where smith spent his last years alt a seaside scene with a bay and a high mountain in background smith travelled to south africa for medical treatment in 2005 and moved into a retirement home overlooking sea in st james a southern suburb of cape town he was reportedly devastated by death of his son alec from a heart attack at london heathrow airport in january 2006 despite some marked differences alec had used illegal drugs in his youth and openly opposed his father s policies while he was prime minister they had been very close elder smith had referred to his son as my rock smith s stepdaughter jean who had married prominent rhodesian singer songwriter clem in 1967 was by this time also widowed she and robert smith cared for their stepfather in his final years after some weeks of illness ian smith died in cape town on 20 november 2007 at age of 88 having suffered a stroke jean was with him his ashes were returned to zimbabwe and scattered by his family at gwenoro farm continued to operate under ownership of smith s stepchildren until december 2012 when it was expropriated by mugabe regime as part of land reform programme and given to a technical college investigations into alleged electoral fraud during 2008 presidential and parliamentary elections in zimbabwe when zanu pf was accused of using dead ghost voters to counter morgan tsvangirai and movement for democratic change mdc revealed that smith and hundreds of thousands of other dead people were still on electoral roll according to zimbabwe election support network s audit report published in 2011 deceased voters made up 27 of registered electorate mugabe had insisted during his ultimately victorious campaign in 2008 that he would not allow mdc to take power even if it won asserting that only god could remove him from office smith was finally struck off voters roll in april 2013 along with 345 000 other dead people mugabe resigned presidency four years later after zanu pf moved to impeach him amid a military coup character reputation and legacy thumb upright smith in 1975 as prime minister wearing his royal air force tie from second world war alt a photograph of ian smith he is wearing a blue tie with white and red stripes smith was a simple man graham boynton wrote soon after his death and it was his rather humourless one dimensional rhodesian ness that at once made him a hero among his own people and a figure of derision among his enemies as leader of rhodesian front and its successors he was foremost figure of his country s white community a symbol and father figure in mordechai tamarkin s phrase who as prime minister personified white rhodesia supporters hailed him as a political visionary who understood uncomfortable truths of africa detractors denounced him as an unrepentant racist his determination to preserve white minority s position in rhodesia caused many black africans and others to perceive him as a symbol of iniquitous white rule and racism smith always denied being driven by racial prejudice in a 1987 interview he asserted that he had been defending western principles and that it was marxism i fought not blacks above all he never expressed regret regarding his actions as prime minister he insisted to end that political and economic ruination of zimbabwe under zanu pf had borne out his predictions and proven him right key to understanding smith johnson wrote was that like other white rhodesians he clung to an almost victorian view of world both in moral values and in easy assumptions of british primacy that characterised empire bill schwarz took a similar line writing that smith and his supporters reacted to british empire s demise by imagining white rhodesians to be final survivors of a lost civilisation charged with tak ing on mantle of historic britain in imperial power s absence he spoke endlessly about how rhodesians had been more british than british boynton reflected and how this small community of decent fair minded whites had been betrayed by well just about everybody he could think of it was easy to mock ian smith but he was right both about betrayals and about quality of most african politicians smith s not in 1 000 years quote dominated his obituaries a development that peter godwin despite his critical stance regarding smith and his policies considered unfair and inaccurate over years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free floating clip that has now become his epitaph but there is more than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise smith without resorting to fabrication memories of his travails on uk s behalf during second world war undoubtedly central experience of his life according to johnson were fundamental to sense of profound betrayal smith felt when uk government proved one of his main adversaries as prime minister wartime plastic surgery that corrected wounds to his face left its right side paralysed giving him a crooked smile and a somewhat blank expression while his bodily injuries gave him a stoop and a slight limp he also could not sit for long periods without pain post colonial uk smith encountered as prime minister seemed to him foreign and somewhat effete to quote kenneth young while smith was a foreigner in all but language to most british politicians a man of convictions so outdated of tastes so naive as to make mutual understanding almost impossible smith held most of british politicians he dealt with in extremely low esteem considering them to have pushed him and his country into an impossible position where he asserted in 1970 decision to take unilateral action was forced upon us in his prime smith was widely recognised by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator hempstone considered him a man too principled or short sighted to compromise with what he regards as wrong while welensky compared dealing with him to trying to nail jelly to a wall he had an iron nerve to quote his rf colleague p k van der byl and a reputation for icy calm he almost never got angry or raised his voice he spoke with a nasal monologue as peter younghusband described it uninspiring even by rhodesian oratorical standards his open informal association with general public fostered impression among white rhodesians that their prime minister was still an ordinary decent fellow which berlyn cites as a major factor in his enduring popularity welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an almost hypnotic influence over rhodesian electorate which helped him to win election after election hands down he also had grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during bush war one quoted anonymously by people magazine in 1976 asserted that if we had a leader like mr smith we would have won long ago sithole long time zanu leader said smith is a fighter he put up a great fight for his people we were like two bulls in there way we fought he is a man i respect him patrick an mdc politician and member of zimbabwean senate said after smith s death that zimbabweans had much to thank him for roads that we are using today were all built by smith he said all infrastructure is smith s we never suffered way we are suffering now because smith took care of economy that supported all people and they had enough to eat when he left power british pound was on a par with zimbabwean dollar but president mugabe has killed all that david coltart another mdc politician issued a statement after smith s death praising him as a man of modesty and integrity but criticising what coltart felt to be disastrous political decisions as prime minister coltart considered smith s policies to have radicalised black nationalists fomented mugabe s rise to power and thereby directly contributed to trauma that zimbabwe is suffering from today godwin took a similar line describing emergency powers smith used to combat black nationalists as draconian he also pointed out that these levers of repression had formed base for much of what mugabe later did lord carrington spoke scathingly about smith in a 2005 interview with heidi holland saying he disliked both smith and mugabe but would choose latter if he absolutely had to choose smith was in his opinion a bigoted stupid man responsible for all of zimbabwe s problems while acknowledging privileged position whites had under smith several commentators have latterly agreed with his claims that many black zimbabweans preferred him to mugabe with hindsight albeit a very low bar smith s image improved inversely as mugabe s plummeted johnson wrote when he walked streets of harare africans would almost queue up to grasp his hand and wish him well if you were to go to harare today in 2007 and ask ordinary black zimbabweans who they would rather have as their leader smith or mugabe answer would be almost unanimous boynton asserted and it would not be mugabe smith s death ignited condemnatory remarks in zimbabwe s mugabe controlled state media deputy minister of information bright accused smith of having been a racist blamed him for deaths of thousands of people and asserted that he would not be mourned or missed here by any decent person reactions from zimbabweans on street were mixed however according to western journalists many expressed sadness notes and
