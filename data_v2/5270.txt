was actually expanding hip hop they were offering one of most honest expressions and expression so honest that it went completely over my head at first simmons 2008 p 54 after album was certified platinum laface records gave outkast more creative control and advanced money for their 1996 follow up album atliens after acquiring their own recording studio duo immediately started working on new
