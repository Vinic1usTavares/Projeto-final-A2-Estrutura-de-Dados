campbell s dwarf hamster phodopus campbelli is a species of hamster in genus phodopus it was given its common name by oldfield thomas in honour of charles william campbell who collected first specimen in mongolia on july 1 1902 it is distinguished from closely related djungarian hamster as it has smaller ears and no dark fur on its crown campbell s dwarf hamster typically has a narrow dorsal stripe compared to djungarian hamster and grey fur on stomach this hamster may be raised in captivity and kept as a small pet in wild breeding season for campbell s dwarf hamster varies by location for example breeding season begins towards middle of april in tuva and towards end of april in mongolia however in captivity there is no fixed breeding season and they can breed frequently throughout year females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and gestation period is typically 20 days campbell s dwarf hamster is crepuscular along with all species of phodopus and is active throughout year campbell s dwarf hamsters are omnivores and so feed on both plant and insect material campbell s dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in steppes and semi deserts of central asia altai mountains autonomous areas of tuva and hebei province in northeastern china this hamster is listed as of least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn it is native to china kazakhstan mongolia and russian federation taxonomy and naming binomial name of campbell s dwarf hamster is phodopus campbelli this species is type species of named by thomas in 1917 and now considered a synonym of phodopus and is named after c w campbell who first collected it on july 1 1902 in inner mongolia type locality was village shaborte in mongolia this locality has puzzled later writers and was believed to be a general mongolian word for a dry lake and therefore with no specific coordinates however in reprint of c w campbell s book travels in mongolia it is clear that shaborte is an actual village on route followed through mongolia thomas described type specimen in 1905 as campbelli synonyms for this species are phodopus crepidatus and phodopus common names have been applied to campbell s dwarf hamster including striped hairy footed hamster djungarian hamster siberian hamster and campbell s hamster campbell s dwarf hamster is commonly confused with djungarian hamster phodopus sungorus due to some of common names such as siberian hamster also being used to describe djungarian hamster subspecies american biologist ned hollister described a subspecies in 1912 p c crepidatus found in altai mountains of siberia physical description size of campbell s dwarf hamster varies depending on its location for example eight wild specimens examined from mongolia showed an average head and body length of an average hind foot length of long with a tail length of in captivity they are proportionally larger as commercial pet food and fruits provide more nutrition than food found commonly in wild lips and cheeks have white fur and rest of fur around face can be either grey or brown a dark and narrow dorsal stripe runs along center of back from nape of neck to about above tail surface of hands and feet are white to ensure animal stays warm in colder climates in countries such as mongolia thumb dwarf hamsters running on disc in both wild and captivity campbell s dwarf hamsters scent mark around their territories using glands skin glands located behind ears they use urine and feces for communication campbell s dwarf hamster is distinguished from similar looking djungarian hamster by its smaller ears and no dark patch on crown of its head in certain colourations dorsal stripe of campbell s dwarf hamster is narrower shorter and darker than that of djungarian hamster and fur on stomach of campbell s dwarf hamster is grey but it is white on djungarian hamster campbell s dwarf hamster does not turn white in winter and has a grey tint to its fur it has a smaller interorbital breadth but has a larger auditory bulla campbell s dwarf hamster is much less tolerant to lower temperatures than djungarian hamster a laboratory experiment showed campbell s dwarf hamster can resist temperatures as low as where djungarian hamster can withstand temperatures as low as campbell s dwarf hamster reacts to lower temperatures by constantly exercising and tries to find a sheltered location unlike djungarian hamster which curls up and relies on its autonomic thermoregulation campbell s dwarf hamster has cheek pouches which are an extension of mouth extending from mouth all way to rear legs food is transferred into these pouches through diastema inside of pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae when pouch is full it extends and becomes part of structure of skin by 11 days of age cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to size of a sunflower seed when cheek pouches become full they extend back to shoulder blades which restrict movement campbell s dwarf hamster is prone to genetic abnormalities in metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids they can develop tumours of mammary glands lungs uterus and ovaries tumours can also develop if animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans as well as having a low population density field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in wild lifespan hamsters kept in captivity live for around 2 0 2 5 years young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature but this is not always possible in wild due to lack of food this causes life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters diet as omnivores campbell s dwarf hamsters eat a variety of different foods a balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16 24 protein 60 65 carbohydrates and 5 7 fat with constant access to fresh water in their natural habitats dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials in captivity campbell s dwarf hamsters can get required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters which typically contain a mix of dry grains nuts and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals an excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems obesity and forms nutritional deficiency in addition to a commercially prepared seed mix a balanced diet for a campbell s dwarf hamster in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits dark greens such as kale are rich in vitamins and minerals wild vegetables such as yarrow chickweed and dandelion and raspberry leaves are also good sources of protein that helps prevent obesity a hamster in captivity can occasionally eat mealworms or earthworms which have high protein contents boiled egg whites and small pieces of clean cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein they can also eat wheat grain sunflower seeds and locusts teeth of campbell s dwarf hamster never stop growing like all rodents they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into skin of mouth and causing pain and irritation smooth young wood from nontoxic trees such as apple and willow is readily used by most species in genus most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity certain food items commonly consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters and should be avoided completely in captivity grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure due to their high level of acidity chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster s cheek pouches and lead to infections which can lead to death in wild diets of campbell s dwarf hamsters vary across population range a total of 51 different species of plants were identified to be consumed by transbaikalia population most common being stipa and species of allium however in tuva only 10 species of plant were identified to be consumed by population most common being potentilla campbell s dwarf hamster is a natural predator of burrowing worms and grubs breeding in tuva breeding season of campbell s dwarf hamster begins in april and in mongolia it begins in at end of april or beginning of may however in all distribution ranges it ends in late september or early october in captivity campbell s dwarf hamsters breed throughout year with no fixed breeding season but a large number are born in summer months in wild three to four litters are produced each year with an average of eight offspring per litter in captivity females can have between one and 18 litters per year with one to nine offspring per litter in captivity gestation period for campbell s dwarf hamster is between 18 and 20 days and shortest gestation period recorded for a captive female was 13 days male hamster is likely to assist female during birth male may pull offspring from birth canal clean them or collect food for mother and offspring when offspring are born they are hairless and have a body mass of approximately incisors and claws are already formed but digits eyes and pinnae are closed and cannot be used rate at which young develop differs depending on distribution range however differences are usually no longer than a day in tuva pinnae open on first day of birth and are completely open after three days of development however in mongolia same process occurs between two and four days of development fur first grows on crown back and abdomen young usually have a full coat of fur after seven days of development offspring born in captivity have a shorter development time than those born in wild specifically growth and development of head and body tail hind feet and pinnae can be up to a day sooner than those found in wild after 28 days of development in captivity young are already around half mass of their parents in captivity females become sexually mature at two months of age ovarian follicle forms about 16 days prior to birth of offspring after mating female hamsters typically have larger uteri ovaries and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone with other females or those that have not mated females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner also these females have a shorter gestation period around four to five days hybrids in captivity only campbell s dwarf hamsters and djungarian hamsters are able to interbreed and produce live offspring or hybrids although hybrids make suitable pets breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health problems due to inherited diseases because genetic information can be very similar genetic health problems or vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by offspring widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten existence of both pure species and subspecies of ecosystem this could ultimately lead to extinction of subspecies each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems two species of phodopus hamsters p sungorus and p campbelli have same number of chromosomes and chromosomes are similar in terms of size and morphology however several chromosomes show structural differences in location and size of c heterochromatin blocks in nature two species do not meet but will mate and produce offspring in captivity however both reciprocal crosses produce sterile hybrid males and females with decreased fertility there is a clear effect in which types parents are cross p sungorus male x p campbelli female will have embryos that grow normally like both parent species but cross between p campbelli male x p sungorus female result in overgrowth leading to embryonic death habitat campbell s dwarf hamsters inhabit burrows in steppes and semideserts of central asia altai mountains autonomous areas of tuva and hebei province in northeastern china a burrow can contain four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels tunnels leading to nesting area can be as deep as below ground but are usually deep burrows are lined with either dry grass or sheep s wool they may sometimes share burrows with daurian pikas but only in steppes and semideserts of northern manchuria in parts of mongolia hamsters may also share burrows with species of to save them from digging their own in tuva campbell s dwarf hamsters have been found living with other hamsters such as chinese striped hamster hamster and long tailed dwarf hamster diets of three types of hamsters are different to avoid fighting over same type of food which is why they live together campbell s dwarf hamsters may also live near areas of human civilization in mongolia they may be found in yurts to keep warm during winter as they do not have thermoregulation like djungarian hamster they have five main predators eurasian eagle owl steppe eagle corsac fox common kestrel and saker falcon all distribution areas have more females than males because males are at higher risk from predators as they cannot move as quickly status and conservation this hamster is listed as of least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn population and distribution size are large and no major or widespread threats to species are known however increasing number of livestock in areas of distribution such as steppes of central asia some burrows are at a small risk of being destroyed in arid areas of distribution reduction in amount of water sources is also a minor concern these hamsters are conserved in protected areas references external links category phodopus category mammals of asia
