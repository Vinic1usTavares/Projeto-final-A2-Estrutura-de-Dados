slow lorises are a group of several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates that make up genus nycticebus found in southeast asia and bordering areas they range from bangladesh and northeast india in west to sulu archipelago in philippines in east and from yunnan province in china in north to island of java in south although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all inclusive species there are now at least eight that are considered valid sunda slow loris n coucang bengal slow loris n bengalensis pygmy slow loris n pygmaeus javan slow loris n javanicus philippine slow loris n menagensis bangka slow loris n bancanus bornean slow loris n borneanus and kayan river slow loris n kayan group s closest relatives are slender lorises of southern india and sri lanka their next closest relatives are african lorisids pottos false pottos and angwantibos they are less closely related to remaining lorisoids various types of galago and more distantly to lemurs of madagascar their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results slow lorises have a round head a narrow snout large eyes and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species dependent their arms and legs are nearly equal in length and their trunk is long and flexible allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations that give them a pincer like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time slow lorises have a toxic bite a trait rare among mammals and unique to lorisid primates toxin is obtained by licking a sexual gland on their arm and secretion is activated by mixing with saliva their toxic bite is a deterrent to predators and toxin is also applied to fur during grooming as a form of protection for their infants secretion from arm contains a chemical related to cat allergen but may be augmented by secondary toxins from diet in wild individuals slow lorises move slowly and deliberately making little or no noise and when threatened they stop moving and remain motionless their only documented predators apart from humans include snakes changeable hawk eagles and orangutans although cats civets and sun bears are suspected little is known about their social structure but they are known to communicate by scent marking males are highly territorial slow lorises reproduce slowly and infants are initially parked on branches or carried by either parent they are omnivores eating small animals fruit tree gum and other vegetation each of slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either vulnerable or endangered on iucn red list three newest species are yet to be evaluated but they arise from and further reduce ranks of what was thought to be a single vulnerable species all four of these are expected to be listed with at least same if not a higher risk conservation status all slow lorises are threatened by wildlife trade and habitat loss their habitat is rapidly disappearing and becoming fragmented making it nearly impossible for slow lorises to disperse between forest fragments unsustainable demand from exotic pet trade and from traditional medicine has been greatest cause for their decline deep rooted beliefs about supernatural powers of slow lorises such as their purported abilities to ward off evil spirits or to cure wounds have popularized their use in traditional medicine despite local laws prohibiting trade in slow lorises and slow loris products as well as protection from international commercial trade under appendix i slow lorises are openly sold in animal markets in southeast asia and smuggled to other countries such as japan due in part to large eyes that are an adaptation to their nocturnal lifestyle they have also been popularized as cute pets in viral videos on youtube slow lorises have their teeth cut or pulled out for pet trade they make poor pets as they are nocturnal have specialized diets are difficult to care for and often die from infection blood loss improper caring and handling or inadequate nutrition evolutionary history slow lorises genus nycticebus are strepsirrhine primates and are related to other living lorisoids such as slender lorises loris pottos false pottos angwantibos and galagos family galagidae and to lemurs of madagascar they are most closely related to slender lorises of south asia followed by angwantibos pottos and false pottos of central and west africa lorisoids are thought to have evolved in africa where most living species occur later one group may have migrated to asia and evolved into slender and slow lorises of today lorises first appear in asian fossil record in miocene with records in thailand around 18 million years ago mya and in pakistan 16 mya thai record is based on a single tooth that most closely resembles living slow lorises and that is tentatively classified as a species of nycticebus species is named nycticebus using open nomenclature preceding indicates tentative nature of assignment several lorises are found in siwalik deposits of pakistan dating to 16 to 8 mya including nycticeboides and most are small but an unnamed form dating to 15 16 mya is comparable in size to largest living slow lorises molecular clock analysis suggests that slow lorises may have started evolving into distinct species about 10 mya they are thought to have reached islands of when sunda shelf was exposed at times of low sea level creating a land bridge between mainland and islands off coast of southeast asia discovery and taxonomy earliest known mention of a slow loris in scientific literature is from 1770 when dutchman arnout vosmaer 1720 1799 described a specimen of what we know today as n bengalensis that he had received two years earlier french naturalist georges louis leclerc comte de buffon later questioned vosmaer s decision to affiliate animal with sloths arguing that it was more closely aligned with lorises of ceylon now sri lanka and bengal word loris was first used in 1765 by buffon as a close equivalent to a dutch name loeris this etymology was later supported by physician william baird in 1820s who noted that dutch word loeris signified a clown in 1785 dutch physician and naturalist pieter boddaert was first to officially describe a species of slow loris using name tardigradus coucang this species was based on tailless described by thomas pennant in 1781 which is thought to have been based on a sunda slow loris and on vosmaer s description of a bengal slow loris consequently there has been some disagreement over identity of tardigradus coucang currently name is given to sunda slow loris next slow loris species to be described was lori bengalensis currently nycticebus bengalensis named by bernard germain de lacepede in 1800 in 1812 etienne geoffroy saint hilaire named genus nycticebus naming it for its nocturnal behavior name derives from genitive form of night and monkey geoffroy also named nycticebus javanicus in this work later 19th century authors also called slow lorises nycticebus but most used species name tardigradus given by linnaeus in 1758 in 10th edition of systema naturae for slow lorises until mammalogists witmer stone and james a g rehn clarified in 1902 that linnaeus s name actually referred to a slender loris several more species were named around 1900 including nycticebus menagensis originally lemur menagensis by richard lydekker in 1893 and nycticebus pygmaeus by john james lewis bonhote in 1907 however in 1939 reginald innes pocock consolidated all slow lorises into a single species n coucang and in his influential 1953 book primates comparative anatomy and taxonomy primatologist william charles osman hill also followed this course in 1971 colin groves recognized pygmy slow loris n pygmaeus as a separate species and divided n coucang into four subspecies while in 2001 groves opined there were three species n coucang n pygmaeus and n bengalensis and that n coucang had three subspecies nycticebus coucang coucang n c menagensis and n c javanicus thumb left kayan river slow loris n kayan was distinguished from n menagensis in 2012 in 2006 bornean slow loris was elevated to species level as nycticebus menagensis based on molecular analysis of dna sequences of d loop and cytochrome b gene in 2008 groves and confirmed promotion of fifth species javan slow loris to species status a move that had been suggested in previous studies from 2000 they based their decision on an analysis of cranial morphology and characteristics of pelage species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology such as size fur color and head markings to help clarify species and subspecies boundaries and to establish whether morphology based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships phylogenetic relationships within genus nycticebus were investigated by chen and colleagues using dna sequences derived from mitochondrial markers d loop and cytochrome b previous molecular analyses using karyotypes restriction enzymes and dna sequences were focused on understanding relationships between a few species not phylogeny of entire genus analyses published in 2006 by chen and colleagues proved inconclusive although one test suggested that n coucang and n bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with members of their own species possibly due to introgressive hybridization since tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern thailand this hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared variations in mitochondrial dna sequences between n bengalensis and n coucang and suggested that there has been gene flow between two species in 2012 two taxonomic synonyms formerly recognized as subspecies of n menagensis n bancanus and n borneanus were elevated to species status and a new species n kayan was also distinguished from same rachel munds anna nekaris and susan ford based these taxonomic revisions on distinguishable facial markings with that n menagensis species complex that had been collectively known as bornean slow loris became four species philippine slow loris n menagensis bornean slow loris n borneanus bangka slow loris n bancanus and kayan river slow loris n kayan anatomy and physiology thumb right skull of sunda slow loris slow lorises have a round head because their skull is shorter than in other living strepsirrhine like other lorisids their snout does not taper towards front of face as it does in lemurs making face appear less long and pointed compared with slender lorises snout of slow loris is even less pointed as with other members of lorisidae its interorbital distance is shorter than in lemurs skull has prominent crests ridges of bone a distinguishing feature of slow loris skull is that occipital bone is flattened and faces backward foramen magnum hole through which spinal cord enters faces directly backward brains of slow lorises have more folds convolutions than brains of galagos thumb upright left coloration patterns around eyes differ between slender lorises middle two and slow lorises top and bottom ears are small sparsely covered in hair and hidden in fur similar to slender lorises fur around and directly above eyes is dark unlike slender lorises however white stripe that separates eye rings broadens both on tip of nose and on forehead while also fading out on forehead like other strepsirrhine primates nose and lip are covered by a moist skin called rhinarium wet nose which is a sense organ eyes of slow lorises are forward facing which gives stereo vision their eyes are large and possess a reflective layer called tapetum lucidum that improves low light vision it is possible that this layer blurs images they see as reflected light may interfere with incoming light slow lorises have monochromatic vision meaning they see in shades of only one color they lack opsin gene that would allow them to detect short wavelength light which includes colors blue and green dental formula of slow lorises is meaning that on each side of mouth there are two upper maxillary and lower mandibular incisors one upper and lower canine tooth three upper and lower premolars and three upper and lower molars giving a total of 36 permanent teeth as in all other crown strepsirrhines their lower incisors and canine are procumbent lie down and face outwards forming a toothcomb which is used for personal and social grooming and feeding toothcomb is kept clean by sublingua or under tongue a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris sublingua extends below tip of tongue and is tipped with keratinized serrated points that rake between front teeth slow lorises have relatively large maxillary canine teeth their inner maxillary incisors are larger than outer distal maxillary incisors and they have a diastema gap between canine and first premolar first mandibular premolar is elongated and last molar has three cusps on crown shortest of which is near back bony palate roof of mouth only goes as far back as second molar slow lorises range in weight from bornean slow loris at to as much as for bengal slow loris slow lorises have stout bodies and their tails are only stubs and hidden beneath dense fur their combined head and body lengths vary by species but range from between all species trunk is longer than in other living strepsirrhines because they have 15 16 thoracic vertebrae compared to 12 14 in other living strepsirrhines this gives them greater mobility when twisting and extending towards nearby branches their other vertebrae include seven cervical vertebrae six or seven lumbar vertebrae six or seven sacral vertebrae and seven to eleven caudal vertebrae thumb right eyes of slow lorises are large and have a reflective layer called tapetum lucidum to help them see better at night unlike galagos which have longer legs than arms slow lorises have arms and legs of nearly equal length their index ratio of arm to leg length averages 89 indicating that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs as with slender lorises their arms are slightly longer than their body but extremities of slow lorises are more stout slow lorises have a powerful grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations they can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet where thumb diverges at nearly 180deg from rest of fingers while hallux big toe ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on lower end of thigh bone which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to hind limbs second digit of hand is short compared to other digits while on foot fourth toe is longest sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three four and five grasp opposite side of a tree branch this gives their hands and feet a pincer like appearance strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to presence of a rete mirabile network of capillaries a trait shared among all lorises both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet like nearly all lemuriforms they have a grooming claw on second toe of each foot slow lorises have an unusually low basal metabolic rate about 40 of typical value for placental mammals of their size comparable to that of sloths since they consume a relatively high calorie diet that is available year round it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food for example slow lorises can feed on bark which may be fatal to humans distribution and diversity slow lorises are found in south and southeast asia their collective range stretches from northeast india through indochina east to sulu archipelago small southern islands of philippines and south to island of java including borneo sumatra and many small nearby islands they are found in india northeastern states china yunnan province laos vietnam cambodia bangladesh burma thailand malaysia philippines indonesia brunei and singapore there are currently eight recognized species pygmy slow loris n pygmaeus occurs east of mekong river in yunnan laos vietnam and cambodia bornean slow loris n menagensis found on borneo and nearby islands including sulu archipelago and in 2012 was split into four distinct species adding n bancanus n borneanus and n kayan javan slow loris n javanicus is only found on island of java in indonesia sunda slow loris n coucang occurs on sumatra and malay peninsula including singapore and southern thailand isthmus of kra bengal slow loris n bengalensis has largest distribution of all slow lorises and can be found in bangladesh cambodia southern china northeast india laos burma thailand and vietnam slow lorises range across tropical and subtropical regions and are found in primary and secondary rainforests as well as bamboo groves and mangrove forests they prefer forests with high dense canopies although some species have also been found in disturbed habitats such as cacao plantations and mixed crop home gardens due largely to their nocturnal behavior and subsequent difficulties in accurately quantifying abundance data about population size or distribution patterns of slow lorises is limited in general encounter rates are low a combined analysis of several field studies involving transect surveys conducted in south and southeast asia determined encounter rates ranging from as high as 0 74 lorises per kilometer for n coucang to as low as 0 05 lorises per kilometer for n pygmaeus behavior and ecology thumb upright left alt a small 6 week old infant clings to its mothers back as she climbs vertically through branches infants are either parked on branches or carried by one of their parents while they forage little is known about social structure of slow lorises but they generally spend most of night foraging alone individuals sleep during day usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises home ranges of adults may significantly overlap and those of males are generally larger than those of females in absence of direct studies of genus primatologist simon speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of potto another nocturnal primate such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited scent marking with urine is dominant form of communication adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males vocalizations include an affiliative friendly call and a louder call resembling a crow s caw when disturbed slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl to make contact with other individuals they emit a single high pitched rising tone and females use a high whistle when in estrus thumb right in indonesia slow lorises are called malu malu or shy one because they freeze and cover their face when spotted slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs to move between trees they carefully grip terminal branches of neighboring tree and pull themselves across small gap they will also grip branches with only their hind feet lift themselves upright and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey due to their slow movement all lorises including slow lorises have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation their slow deliberate movement hardly disturbs vegetation and is almost completely silent once disturbed they immediately stop moving and remain motionless in indonesia slow lorises are called malu malu or shy one because they freeze and cover their face when spotted if cornered they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at predator acehnese name buah angin wind monkey refers to their ability to fleetingly but silently escape little is known about predation of slow lorises documented predators include snakes changeable hawk eagle cirrhatus and sumatran orangutans pongo other potential predators include cats sun bears helarctos binturongs and civets slow lorises produce a secretion from their brachial gland a scent gland on upper arm near axilla that is licked and mixed with their saliva in tests three predators binturongs clouded leopards nebulosa and sun bears retreated or showed other signs of displeasure when presented with cotton swabs anointed with a mixture of toxic secretion and saliva whereas toxic secretion alone generated mild interest before stashing their offspring in a secure location female slow lorises will lick their brachial glands and then groom their young with their toothcomb depositing toxin on their fur when threatened slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite their aggressors delivering toxin into wounds slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite which is likely to maximize transfer of toxins this toxic bite is a rare trait among mammals and unique to lorisid primates it may also be used for defense against other slow lorises and parasites according to nekaris this adaptation along with vocalizations movement and coloration patterns similar to those of true cobras may have evolved through mullerian mimicry to protect slow lorises when they need to move across ground due to breaks in canopy thumb upright right slow lorises have a special network of capillaries in their hands and feet that allow them to cling to branches for hours without losing sensation studies suggest that slow lorises are polygynandrous infants are either parked on branches while their parents find food or else are carried by one of parents due to their long gestations about six months small litter sizes low birth weights long weaning times three to six months and long gaps between births slow loris populations have one of slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size pygmy slow lorises are likely to give birth to twins from 50 to 100 of births depending on study in contrast this phenomenon is rare 3 occurrence in bengal slow lorises a seven year study of captive bred pygmy slow lorises showed a skewed sex distribution with 1 68 males born for every 1 female breeding may be continuous throughout year copulation often occurs while suspended with hands and feet clinging to horizontal branches for support in captive sunda slow lorises mating primarily occurs between june and mid september with estrus cycle lasting 29 to 45 days and estrus lasting one to five days likewise gestation lasts 185 to 197 days and young weigh between at birth females reach sexual maturity at 18 to 24 months while males are capable of reproducing at 17 months however fathers become hostile towards their male offspring after 12 to 14 months and will chase them away in captivity they can live 20 or more years diet slow lorises are omnivores eating insects and other arthropods small birds and reptiles eggs fruits gums nectar and miscellaneous vegetation a 1984 study of sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71 fruit and gums and 29 insects and other animal prey a more detailed study of another sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions consisting of 43 3 gum 31 7 nectar 22 5 fruit and just 2 5 arthropods and other animal prey most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of bertram palm tristis sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell preliminary results of studies on pygmy slow loris indicate that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar especially nectar from dives flowers and that animal prey makes up 30 40 of its diet however one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98 insect remains and just 2 plant remains pygmy slow loris often returns to same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing flow of exudates slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from to as much as gouging process whereby loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into hard bark may be loud enough to be heard up to away marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates such as branches it is not known how sympatric pygmy and bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches plant gums obtained typically from species in family fabaceae peas are high in carbohydrates and lipids and can serve as a year around source of food or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates a long narrow tongue to make it easier to reach gum stashed in cracks and crevices a large cecum to help animal digest complex carbohydrates and a short duodenum to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates slow lorises can use both hands to eat while hanging upside down from a branch they spend about 20 of their nightly activities feeding venom secretion from brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to allergen in cat dander hence secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction not toxicosis loris bites cause a painful swelling and single case of human death reported in scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock slow lorises of genus nycticebus are accepted as only known venomous primate slow loris venom was known in folklore in their host countries throughout southeast asia for centuries but dismissed by western science until 1990s animal dealers in southeast asia keep tanks of water nearby so that in case of a bite they can submerge both their arm and slow loris to make animal let go it is thought all nine recognised species of this small bodied nocturnal primate are venomous they possess a dual composite venom consisting of saliva and brachial gland exudate a fluid forming from an sweat gland on animal s forearm both fluids have been demonstrated as being venomous individually and creating a more potent venom when mixed slow loris brachial gland exudate bge has been shown to possess up to 142 volatile components and possesses a variant of cat allergen protein fel d1 bge has several ecological functions including anti parasitic defence and communication slow loris saliva has been shown to be cytotoxic to human skin cells in laboratory experiments without of bge venom is administered through morphologically distinct dentition in form of an adapted toothcomb in wild envenomation occurs from intraspecific competition whereby two slow lorises fight for mates food or territory slow loris inflicted wounds is a major cause of premature death in zoo and wildlife slow loris populations often resulting in festering and necrotic wounds slow loris envenomation in humans is rare but can result in near fatal anaphylactic shock a suite of additional effects of venom have been documented including ranging from mild to permanent disfigurement and mobility loss and near death furthermore secondary toxins may be introduced from consumption of wild food augmenting toxicity combined brachial secretion and saliva of recently captured wild lorises was shown to contain which were not found in slow lorises held in captivity for more than a year study of slow loris venom was brought to public attention in 2012 by research of world renowned professor k a i nekaris and in her award winning bbc documentary jungle gremlins of java in culture beliefs about slow lorises and their use in traditional practices are deep rooted and go back at least 300 years if not earlier based on oral traditions in late 19th and early 20th centuries it was reported that people from interior of borneo believed that slow lorises were gatekeepers for heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in afterlife more often however slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of superstitions associated with slow lorises many strange powers are attributed to this animal by natives of countries it inhabits there is hardly an event in life to man woman or child or even domestic animals that may not be influenced for better or worse by slow loris alive or dead or by any separate part of it and apparently one cannot usually tell at time that one is under supernatural power thus a malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a loris under his threshold which had unknown to him compelled him to act to his own disadvantage a slow loris s life is not a happy one for it is continually seeing ghosts that is why it hides its face in its hands in province of cambodia hunters believe that lorises can heal their own broken bones immediately after falling from a branch so that they can climb back up tree they also believe that slow lorises have medicinal powers because they require more than one hit with a stick to die in province of north sumatra slow loris is thought to bring good luck if it is buried under a house or a road in same province slow loris body parts were used to place curses on enemies in java it was thought that putting a piece of its skull in a water jug would make a husband more docile and submissive just like a slow loris in daytime more recently researchers have documented belief that consumption of loris meat was an aphrodisiac that improves male power gall bladder of bengal slow loris has historically been used to make ink for tattoos by village elders in and koh kong provinces of cambodia loris wine is a traditional cambodian medicine supposed to alleviate pain of childbirth made from a mixture of loris bodies and rice wine conservation thumb left slow lorises are popular in exotic pet trade which threatens wild populations two greatest threats to slow lorises are deforestation and wildlife trade slow lorises have lost a significant amount of habitat with habitat fragmentation isolating small populations and obstructing biological dispersal however despite lost habitat their decline is most closely associated with unsustainable trade either as exotic pets or for traditional medicine each of slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 are currently listed as either vulnerable or endangered by international union for conservation of nature iucn on their red list when they were all considered a single species imprecise population data together with their regular occurrence in southeast asian animal markets combined to erroneously suggest that slow lorises were common this manifested as incorrect red list assessments of least concern as recently as 2000 three newest species are yet to be evaluated by iucn although each were once thought to be subpopulations of bornean slow loris which was evaluated as vulnerable in 2008 with this division of its range and population bornean slow loris and three new species face a higher risk of extinction than before since 2007 all slow loris species have been protected from commercial international trade under appendix i of cites furthermore local trade is illegal because every nation in which they occur naturally has laws protecting them despite their cites appendix i status and local legal protection slow lorises are still threatened by both local and international trade due to problems with enforcement surveys are needed to determine existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises because they are not adapted to dispersing across ground over large distances populations of bengal and sunda slow lorises are not faring well in zoos of 29 captive specimens in north american zoos in 2008 several are hybrids that cannot breed while most are past their reproductive years last captive birth for these species in north america was in 2001 in san diego pygmy slow lorises are doing better in north american zoos from late 1980s when they were imported to 2008 population grew to 74 animals with most of them born at san diego zoo wildlife trade until 1960s hunting of slow lorises was sustainable but due to growing demand decreased supply and subsequent increased value of marketed wildlife slow lorises have been overexploited and are in decline with use of modern technology such as battery powered search lights slow lorises have become easier to hunt because of their eye shine traditional medicine made from loris parts is thought to cure many diseases and demand for this medicine from wealthy urban areas has replaced subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas a survey by primatologist anna nekaris and colleagues 2010 showed that these belief systems were so strong that majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris based medicines slow lorises are sold locally at street markets but are also sold internationally over internet and in pet stores they are especially popular or trendy in japan particularly among women reasons for their popularity according to japan wildlife conservation society are that they re easy to keep they don t cry they re small and just very cute common misconceptions because of their cuteness videos of pet slow lorises are some of most frequently watched animal related viral videos on youtube in march 2011 a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a cocktail umbrella had been viewed more than two million times while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times according to nekaris these videos are misunderstood by most people who watch them since most do not realize that it is illegal in most countries to own them as pets and that slow lorises in videos are only docile because that is their passive defensive reaction to threatening situations despite frequent advertisements by pet shops in japan world conservation monitoring centre reported that only a few dozen slow lorises were legally imported in 2006 suggesting frequent smuggling slow lorises are also smuggled to china taiwan europe russia united states and saudi arabia for use as pets thumb right alt a small young slow loris is gripped by its limbs while its front teeth are cut with a fingernail cutter slow lorises have their front teeth cut or pulled before being sold as pets a practice that often causes infection and death within their countries of origin slow lorises are very popular pets particularly in indonesia they are seen as a living toy for children by local people or are bought out of pity by western tourists or expatriates neither local nor foreign buyers usually know anything about these primates their endangered status or that trade is illegal according to national geographic slow lorises are protected by both local laws in southern asia and by convention on international trade in endangered species cites furthermore few know about their strong odor or their painful bite which may lead to anaphylaxis in some cases according to data compiled from monthly surveys and interviews with local traders nearly a thousand locally sourced slow lorises exchanged hands in medan bird market in north sumatra during late first decade of 21st century international trade usually causes a high mortality rate during transit between 30 and 90 slow lorises also experience many health problems due to both local and international trade in order to give impression that primates are tame and appropriate pets for children to protect people from their potentially toxic bite or to deceive buyers into thinking animal is a baby animal dealers either pull front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or cut them off with nail cutters this results in severe bleeding which sometimes causes shock or death dental infection is common and is fatal in 90 of cases without their teeth animals can no longer fend for themselves in wild and must remain in captivity for life slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished and have had their fur dyed which complicates species identification at rescue centers as many as 95 of slow lorises rescued from markets die of dental infection or improper care as part of trade infants are pulled prematurely from their parents leaving them unable to remove their own urine feces and oily skin secretions from their fur slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from wire cages they are kept in slow lorises are also stress sensitive and do not do well in captivity common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment tooth decay diabetes obesity and kidney failure infection stress pneumonia and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep
