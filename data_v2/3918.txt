modern life is rubbish is second studio album by english alternative rock band blur released in may 1993 although their debut album leisure 1991 had been commercially successful blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release and fell out of public favour after group returned from an unsuccessful tour of united states poorly received live performances and rising popularity of rival band suede further diminished blur s status in uk under threat of being dropped by food records for their next album blur underwent an image makeover championed by frontman damon albarn band incorporated influences from traditional british guitar pop groups such as kinks and small faces and resulting sound was melodic and lushly produced featuring brass woodwind and backing vocalists albarn s lyrics on modern life is rubbish use poignant humour and ray davies characterisation to investigate dreams traditions and prejudices of suburban england according to writer david cavanagh modern life is rubbish was a moderate chart success in uk album peaked at number 15 while singles taken from album charted in top 30 applauded by music press album s anglocentric rhetoric rejuvenated group s fortunes after their post leisure slump modern life is rubbish is regarded as one of defining releases of britpop scene and its chart topping follow ups parklife and great escape saw blur emerge as one of britain s leading pop acts background blur s baggy inspired debut album leisure 1991 was a uk top 10 charting record that according to nme made band acceptable pretty face of a whole

music group frequently drank and members often broke into fist fights with one another homesick tour instilled in band a contempt for everything american cavanagh later wrote frontman damon albarn who started to miss really simple things about england harris 2004 pp 73 75 listened to a tape of english pop group kinks throughout tour upon their return to england group discovered that attention of music press had shifted to suede newcomers success displeased blur who in cavanagh s words were inclined to feel that every record suede sold was an affront to human decency after many poor live shows which blur members often performed while drunk in particular one at a 1992 gig that featured a well received performance by suede on same bill blur were in danger of being dropped by food harris 2004 p 78 recording damon albarn in a 2000 mojo interview said that suede and america fuelled my desire to prove to everyone that blur were worth it there was nothing more important in my life he felt popularity american grunge music was enjoying in britain at time would soon fade and argued that blur would embody a renaissance of classic british pop on their next album food records owner david balfe strongly disagreed and argued with albarn over proposed change in blur s image after still sceptical balfe relented food gave blur go ahead to work on their second album with albarn s first choice of producer xtc leader andy partridge partridge said he was dissatisfied with songs but was immensely fond of band likening them to xtc circa go 2 he said he agreed to project for wrong reasons flattery and money blur began working on album with partridge at church a studio in crouch end owned by david a stewart however sessions ended prematurely bassist alex james described sessions as a disaster he added that as it was all being put together they were all good parts but it just wasn t sexy partridge recalled i felt quite fatherly and i thought i did sterling work they got dave twat balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going this is fantastic you re george martin and they re beatles next day he d say quite frankly andy this is shit band successfully recorded four songs but were wary about working in same conditions again harris 2004 pp 81 82 partridge produced tracks were abandoned three were later included on 2012 boxed set blur 21 work resumed on album due to a chance meeting with producer stephen street who had previously worked with band on their 1991 single there s no other way with street now producing album blur recorded a mix of material spanning both period immediately after release of leisure and their 1992 tour while band members were pleased with recording session results balfe after hearing songs told band they were committing artistic suicide although dejected by his response blur gave food completed album in december 1992 label rejected album and instructed band to record more potential singles harris 2004 p 82 albarn complied and on christmas day wrote song for tomorrow harris 2004 p 83 although for tomorrow sated food s concerns blur s american label sbk voiced discontent upon hearing finished tapes

stops singing and graham coxon supplie s his usual immaculate guitar accompaniment while oily water harked back to baggy sound of leisure nme described intermission as a pub piano knees up that rinky dinks along then gets frazzled in guitars and speeded up drums most of songs on album are melodic and lushly produced often supplemented by a brass section string arrangements and backing vocals to offer contrast to classicist songwriting allmusic noted that coxon s guitar tears each song open either with unpredictable melodic lines or layers of translucent hypnotic effects and his work creates great tension with alex james kinetic bass deriving from biting humor of ray davies and bitterness of paul weller albarn s lyrics on modern life is rubbish are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban english life while rubbish celebrates modern british life it also takes a cynical look at middle class existence overt anglo of album was also retaliation against american popular culture james later explained it was f ing scary how american everything s becoming so whole thing was a f ing big two fingers up to america redfern mark britpop a decade on under radar summer

food further issued two uk top 30 charting singles chemical world and sunday sunday to support record however modern life only managed to sell around 40 000 copies at time nonetheless mood within blur camp was positive as band felt they had accomplished something james told writer david cavanagh in 2000 modern life is rubbish was a successful record because it achieved what we set out to achieve i thought everything was shit except us cavanagh david a hard day s night mojo november 2000 modern life is rubbish was released in united states by blur s american record label sbk in december 1993 seven months after album s uk release this delay was because sbk s alternative music department had closed down blur manager chris morrison later quipped when i asked sbk why they said it was because girl had left cavanagh david one day all this will be ours q april 1997 despite fears that modern lifes overt englishness would be lost on american market sbk insisted on marketing album to mor stations and aimed for top 40 airplay label largely ignored morrison s arguments that blur s best chance of exposure in america would be to court college radio stations sbk s strategy was to list album at a developing artist price around three dollars less than standard send band on an intensive tour in 1994 and to target modern rock airplay with debut single chemical world record company believed this would help expand on base audience who bought leisure and eventually open blur to top 40 radio further to lessen anglocentric feel of record sbk added additional songs to track listing including popscene sprague david sbk bets on blur to clear way for brit bands in u s billboard 11 december 1993 plan fared poorly as modern life had little impact in us album did not chart on us billboard 200 and sold only 19 000 copies a sharp decline compared to 87 000 units that leisure shifted duffy tom sbk blur focus on u s market billboard 28 may 1994 contemporary reviews among contemporary reviews nme reviewer paul moody was mostly enthusiastic about record and rated it seven out of ten while he felt album had enough faults to give a surveyor nightmares he was impressed that unlike their peers blur had thrown on their old clothes and stormed into no man s land with all guns blazing moody also praised improvement in albarn s lyrics which had hitherto made eurovision song contest entries seem like great works of poetry qs david roberts in a favourable four out of five star review called modern life an energised infectious romp around contemporary little england by way of an exuberant trawl through a highly coloured patchwork of its pop past roberts placed coxon as leading contender for vacant crown of smiths guitarist johnny marr roberts david blur modern life is rubbish q april 1993 writing for chicago tribune rock critic greg kot felt album was a vast improvement over leisure which he found highly derivative of madchester genre nothing on leisure prepares
