presence citing nadal s game as a major reason for improvements in areas of his own game from 2004 to 2007 rivalry stood at 8 6 in nadal s favour though federer led on both grass 2 0 and 3 2 nadal led

on hard courts with head to head on this surface at 11 9 in federer s favour an important distinction is relative success of two players on indoor and outdoor hard courts in former federer leads nadal with a 5 1 record while on outdoor hard courts nadal leads 8 6 quicker conditions and low bounce of indoor hard courts fit federer s style while slower and high bouncing conditions of most outdoor ones favor nadal federer has defeated nadal in four out of five encounters they have had at year end championships including 2010 final which are played on indoor hardcourts this is only surface on which they have exchanged lead in their head to head which has happened several times in reference to their match at 2012 australian open nadal has said that federer is typically favourite on these kinds of surfaces clay nadal and federer have played 16 of their 40 matches on clay with nadal holding a 14 2 advantage over federer matches comprise 13 tournament finals and 3 semifinals spaniard has won all of their seven meetings in best of five set matches on clay and all six at roland garros their last match on clay was played at 2019 french open from 2005 to 2008 nadal won every french open defeating federer in each of those tournaments in 2005 semifinal and 2006 2007 2008 finals as well as in 2011 final from 2005 2010 nadal won at least 2 of 3 clay masters events each year defeating federer in 6 of those statistically nadal has highest win percentage on clay of any player in atp history and is second only to anthony wilding all time as a result some analysts and players such as pat cash and conchita martinez consider nadal greatest clay court player ever grass federer and nadal have met four times on grass specifically wimbledon finals from 2006 to 2008 and semifinal of 2019 federer has a 3 1 advantage over nadal on this surface winning first two finals and semifinal while nadal won third final federer has won wimbledon championships eight times and nadal has won championships twice five of federer s titles were consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and sixth seventh and eighth titles were won in 2009 2012 and 2017 2008 wimbledon final has been lauded as greatest match ever by many long time tennis analysts skill comparisons federer has been more successful than nadal on fast courts because he hits a flatter forehand and has a faster serve grass and indoor hard courts are faster surfaces so federer s flatter shots there result in a lower bouncing faster moving trajectory thus nadal s topspin is less effective on such faster courts but is most effective on slower courts such as clay nadal has improved his serving speed and placement over years but federer still serves faster on average and earns more aces and service winners while nadal has an overall stronger ground stroke game while nadal is statistically weaker than federer on both hard and grass courts he has nonetheless achieved considerable success on both surfaces including notable wins at 2008 summer olympics wimbledon 2008 and 2010 australian open 2009 us open 2010 2013 2017 and 2019 and at various hard court masters series tournaments nadal is one of only 2 men to have won at least 2 grand slam titles on each surface similarly federer too has achieved considerable success on clay winning french open 2009 and reaching finals on four other occasions 2006 2007 2008 and 2011 and winning madrid hamburg masters six times 2002 2004 2005 2007 2009 and 2012 media and player commentary during interviews many fellow and former players have regarded both federer and nadal as among best tennis players of all time finding spot in history without looking new york times 29 august 2010 in november 2010 former player bjorn borg stated that he believed federer to be greatest player of all time but rafa has chance to be greatest player if he stays healthy former player and commentator john mcenroe was of a similar opinion noting in 2010 that there is an argument to be made that rafael nadal may be greatest player eventually even possibly now he has subsequently adjusted his opinion on several occasions in 2013 noting that he thought nadal was greatest player that ever lived but later in 2014 bunched federer nadal laver and sampras together as greatest ever in july 2015 he reversed his opinion and again backed roger federer for title in january 2017 after federer then 35 years of age and returning to competitive play after a 6 month layoff due to injury triumphed over nadal in 5 sets to win record breaking 18th major at 2017 australian open mcenroe remarked that federer had cemented his status as being best tennis player of all time but also left open possibility that nadal can be in running again should he win additional men s singles majors to narrow gap in october 2013 rod laver only tennis player to achieve grand slam twice said when i look at federer with what he s accomplished against competition that he s accomplished it with i d have to say i would think that roger is greatest player at press conference following his 9th record french open win in 2014 and a total of 14 slams three shy of federer s 17 nadal said that he really does not care much about records i ll follow my own path then when my career is over then we ll count in may 2014 eight time grand slam tournament champion andre agassi told singapore s straits times newspaper via aljazeera com i d put nadal number one and federer number two federer separated himself from field for four years he separated himself from andy roddick and lleyton hewitt nadal had to deal with federer novak djokovic andy murray in golden age of tennis in november 2014 former world number 1 player andy roddick in noting his support for federer explained why he believes that head to head results are not a valid factor in determining greatest of all time for me roger federer is still ahead in greatest ever debate with rafael nadal second people talk about their head to head being determining factor but i can t comprehend a single match up being deciding factor it s about total wins at major tournaments not an individual match up in my mind in december 2014 rafael nadal s uncle and coach toni nadal indicated to spanish radio station cadena cope that he believed federer to be greatest of all time based on overall statistics and achievements noting i think he is best of all time numbers say so a day before 2017 australian open men s singles finals toni nadal further his regard on federer saying that when federer will call it a career greatest player in tennis history won t be there anymore looking at titles he is greatest at moment in march 2015 former player pete sampras made similar arguments about federer you look at numbers of what he s been able to do you have to say he s greatest we ve seen these comments were echoed by boris becker in july 2015 great respect for roger federer he is our greatest of all time relationship and competitive dynamic both federer and nadal s personal and professional relationship is good natured and gracious though they are both highly competitive they maintain a healthy regard for each other and have had virtually no source of personal animosity two have made slight criticisms of one another in past nevertheless for example federer complained of nadal s slow deliberate style of play on eve of 2008 wimbledon final nadal criticized federer before 2012 australian open for his failure to be more vocal about players grievances on issues such as scheduling and prize money he subsequently apologized for making his views public however and both players maintained that they still enjoyed a good relationship and had high respect for each other which can often be seen in interviews nadal was also once seen watching federer play a match in his box and their family members would congratulate each other on match wins despite their cordial relationship both men had a somewhat different attitude towards their rivalry in its initial years when federer was securely atop tennis world he was ambivalent towards notion of a rivalry with an opponent five years younger than himself but after their memorable 2008 wimbledon final he had no choice but to acknowledge its significance even admitting it definitely becomes more and more special more times we play against each other a few weeks later after nadal had officially surpassed him in rankings federer offered this compliment look at what he had to achieve to get it that s what i like to see nadal has always cherished rivalry because he looks up to federer as both a role model and a measuring stick for success when interest in their rivalry increased both federer and nadal collaborated to arrange occasional charity exhibition matches to benefit their charities philanthropic interests most recent was match for africa played on 21 december 2010 in zurich switzerland which federer won and a follow up match played in madrid on following day titled joining forces for benefit of children which nadal won cultural impact rivalry has also increased overall interest in tennis highly anticipated 2008 wimbledon final drew strong television ratings for tennis in both u s and across europe match was also featured on cover of sports illustrated which was first time in years that tennis had made its cover high profile status of rivalry saw sky sports comparing it to another modern day rivalry between cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi pair s rivalry and indeed mutual respect and friendship was subject of 2009 book strokes of genius by l jon wertheim which explored their career progression and early lives through prism of 2008 wimbledon final book consequently inspired a 2018 film of same name directed by andrew douglas which updated story to include their comebacks and recent domination of slams documentary also includes footage of a skinny 12 year old nadal before development of his famously muscular physique and a number of clips of a surprisingly bad tempered federer who admits in film that he had to change his behaviour in order to progress his career documentary features contributions from former players such as john mcenroe bjorn borg pete sampras tim henman and carlos moya nadal s current coach and family members including federer s mother and father an illuminating film it was well received by audiences scoring
