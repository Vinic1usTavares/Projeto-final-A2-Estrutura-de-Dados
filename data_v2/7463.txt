birth control movement in united states was a social reform campaign beginning in 1914 that aimed to increase availability of contraception in u s through education and legalization movement began in 1914 when a group of political radicals in new york city led by emma goldman mary dennett and margaret sanger became concerned about hardships that childbirth and self induced abortions brought to low income women since contraception was considered to be obscene at time activists targeted comstock laws which prohibited distribution of any obscene lewd and or lascivious materials through mail hoping to provoke a favorable legal decision sanger deliberately broke law by distributing woman rebel a newsletter containing a discussion of contraception in 1916 sanger opened first birth control clinic in united states but clinic was immediately shut down by police and sanger was sentenced to 30 days in jail a major turning point for movement came during world war i when many u s servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases government s response included an anti venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues of public health and legitimate topics of scientific research this was first time a u s government institution had engaged in a sustained public discussion of sexual matters as a consequence contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health encouraged by public s changing attitudes towards birth control sanger opened a second birth control clinic in 1923 but this time there were no arrests or controversy throughout 1920s public discussion of contraception became more commonplace and term birth control became firmly established in nation s vernacular widespread availability of contraception signaled a transition from stricter sexual mores of victorian era to a more sexually permissive society legal victories in 1930s continued to weaken anti contraception laws court victories motivated american medical association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula but medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill informed sources in 1942 planned parenthood federation of america was formed creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics after world war
