america award indeed steven spielberg cites this television film which later spawned kojak as motivation for casting gary as ellen brody in original jaws film besides fact she was wife of studio s chief executive sidney sheinberg at that time making of jaws documentary on jaws dvd directed by laurent bouzereau in regards to revenge gary remarked in an interview i made a good deal on this film but i didn t make as good a deal as i would have if i weren t married to sid shark that won t go away by donna rosenthal newsday march 22 1987 in an interview with boston herald sargent called revenge a ticking bomb waiting to go off sid sheinberg president of mca inc parent company of universal pictures expects a miracle and we re going to make it happen sargent got a call from sheinberg in late september 1986 asking him to direct fourth jaws movie with no script yet written said sargent i didn t have time to laugh because sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings when he told me it s your baby you produce and direct i accepted according to sargent sheinberg cut through all slow lanes and got jaws revenge off and running in a 2006 interview sargent stated that premise was born out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with shark we thought that maybe if we take a mystical point of view and go for a little bit of magic we might be able to find something interesting enough to sit through gary march 9 2006 joseph sargent interview archive of american television filming principal photography for jaws revenge took place on location in

documentary behind scenes with jaws revenge was broadcast in u s on july 10 1987 twenty two minutes in length it was written and directed by william rus for mayfield productions ending changes in ending that was in original theatrical version ellen rammed shark with mike s boat mortally wounding it shark then causes boat to break apart with its death contortions forcing people on boat to jump off to avoid going down with it american audiences disapproved of this ending following this a different ending was ordered to be shot for foreign distribution in which shark gets stabbed with bow and then explodes with jake being found wounded but alive this ending was what universal used on home media releases according to orange coast magazine of orange county re shooting ending prevented michael caine from collecting his academy award for hannah and her sisters in person other sources claim that re shot ending began filming only five days after film was released and was intended for version released in europe one ending can be seen on cable broadcasts while other ending is seen on home media releases ending left many moviegoers confused in his scathing review of film roger ebert says that he cannot believe that director joseph sargent would film this final climactic scene so incompetently that there is not even an establishing shot so we have to figure out what happened on basis of empirical evidence series continuity in its predecessor mike is an engineer for seaworld whereas in jaws revenge he is a marine research scientist one of universal press releases for jaws revenge refers to jaws revenge as third film of remarkable jaws trilogy underwater chase scene between mike and shark in revenge was lifted from an early screenplay draft of jaws 3 d jaws 3 d script revised first draft 8 10 82 http www com scripts 1st draft txt casting lorraine gary portrayed ellen brody in first two films in a press release gary says jaws revenge is also about relationships which makes it much more like first jaws this was gary s first film since appearing in spielberg s 1941 eight years earlier as well as her final film role press release proposes that character had much more depth and texture than either of other films was able to explore promise of further developing this multi dimensional woman under extraordinary circumstances intrigued gary enough to lure her back to screen after a lengthy hiatus although film was always going to be centered on gary roy scheider was offered a cameo if he had accepted it it was his martin brody character rather than sean brody who would have been killed by shark at film s beginning gary is only principal cast member from original film who returned although lee fierro made a brief cameo as mrs kintner mother of a boy killed in jaws as did fritzi jane courtney who played mrs taft one of amity town council members in both jaws and jaws 2 cyprian r dube who played amity selectman mr posner in both jaws and jaws 2 is upgraded to mayor following death of murray hamilton who played larry vaughan mayor in first two jaws films gary states that one of reasons she was attracted to film was idea of an on screen romance with oscar winner michael caine caine had previously starred in another peter benchley adapted flop island first day we were to work together i was nervous as a school girl we were shooting a junkanoo festival with noisy drums and hundreds of extras but he never faltered in his concentration and he put me completely at ease it was all so natural he s an extraordinary actor and just a nice human being caine had mixed feelings about both production and final version he thinks that it was a first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film he compares relationship between two middle aged people to romance between two teenagers although disappointed not to be able to collect an academy award because of filming in bahamas he was glad to be involved in film in press release he explains that it is part of movie history original was one of great all time thrillers i thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that i liked script very much however caine later claimed i have never seen it film but by all accounts it is terrible however i have seen house that it built and it is terrific in his 1992 autobiography what s it all about he says that film will go down in my memory as time when i won an oscar paid for a house and had a great holiday not bad for a flop movie lance guest played ellen s eldest son mike guest had dropped out of his sophomore year at ucla 1981 to appear in another sequel to a horror classic halloween ii karen young played his wife carla she commended director s emphasis upon characterization mario van peebles played jake michael s colleague his father melvin van peebles has a cameo in film as nassau s mayor mitchell anderson appeared as ellen s youngest son sean lynn whitfield played louisa and stunt performer diane hetfield was victim of banana boat attack music score was composed and conducted by michael small who had previously provided music for klute marathon man both of which featured jaws star roy scheider and parallax view john williams original shark motif is integrated into score although small removed orca theme soundtrack net says that small s score is generally tense and he comes up with a few new themes of his own film also contained songs nail it to wall performed by stacy lattisaw and 1986 hit you got it all performed by jets unlike preceding entries in series soundtrack was not released at same time as film although small appears to have mixed tracks for a release however it was given a promotional release in 2000 on audio cd and compact cassette reviews for soundtrack album were more favorable than for film indeed writing for film score monthly ak benjamin says that on a cd small s material fares better since it s not accompanied by film dismissing film as engagingly unwatchable he says that small certainly gave revenge a lot more than it deserved and this a much better score than deep blue sea whatever that means benjamin portrays small as knowing and his work as being superior to film hysterical coda tacked onto end of revenge and finale is almost worth price of disc as it no doubt sums up small s opinion of film it s sad that great michael small was delegated utter crap like jaws revenge in late 80s and even worse that he never found his way back to material that he deserves upon small s death in 2003 independent wrote that composer of some distinction had indignity of working on one of worst films of all time like most reviews of soundtrack article criticizes film whilst saying small produced a fine score in circumstances as if anyone noticed in 2015 intrada records which previously reissued jaws 3 d on compact disc released complete score novelization novelization was written by hank searls who also adapted jaws 2 while searls jaws 2 novelization was based on an earlier draft of that film and was significantly different from finished film his jaws revenge novelization sticks fairly close to final film although it does contain some extra subplots novel contains a subplot in which hoagie is a government agent and he transports laundered money only reference to this in film is when michael brody asks what do you do when you re not flying people to which hoagie replies i deliver laundry in searls novel character of jake is ultimately killed by shark jake was originally supposed to die in film but script was changed to allow him to survive novelization suggests that shark may be acting under influence of a vengeful voodoo witch doctor who has a feud with brody family and shark s apparent revenge has magical implications therefore witch doctor is revenge and shark is his tool this also explains strange psychic connection ellen and shark have with each other plot was deleted as it strayed too far away from plot of killer shark however at one point in theatrical version michael brody says come on sharks don t commit murder tell me you don t believe in that voodoo searls novelization presents a continuity that combines elements from peter benchley s jaws novel as well as jaws film series novelization makes a reference to ellen brody s affair with matt hooper a subplot that exists in benchley s novel but is entirely absent from film adaptation release critical revenge was panned by critics it remains one of few films to hold a 0 score on rotten tomatoes based on 35 reviews with an average rating of 2 04 10 critical consensus reads illogical tension free and filled with cut rate special effects jaws 4 revenge is a sorry chapter in a once proud franchise gary did get nominated for a saturn award for best actress for her performance but also a golden raspberry award for worst actress she lost both awards to jessica tandy for batteries not included and madonna for who s that s girl respectively it was rated by entertainment weekly as one of 25 worst sequels ever made it was voted number 22 by readers of empire magazine in their list of 50 worst movies ever roger ebert of chicago sun times gave film zero stars writing in his review that it is not simply a bad movie but also a stupid and incompetent one he lists several elements that he finds unbelievable including that ellen is haunted by flashbacks to events where she was not present ebert joked that caine could not attend ceremony to accept his academy award for best supporting actor earned for hannah and her sisters because of his shooting commitments on this film because he may not have wanted to return to shoot if he had left it many scenes are considered implausible such as shark swimming from a massachusetts island to bahamas approx 1 193 miles in less than three days somehow knowing that brody family went to bahamas or following michael through an underwater labyrinth as well as implication of such a creature seeking revenge independent pointed out that film was riddled with inconsistencies and errors sharks cannot float or roar like lions special effects were criticized especially some frames of shark being speared by boat s prow and mechanisms propelling shark can be plainly seen in some shots derek ends his otherwise lukewarm review with bahamas backdrops are pretty and shark looks as toothsome as ever richard scheib also praises beautiful above and below water photography and realistic mechanical shark although he considers melodrama back on dry land a bore critics commented upon sepia toned flashbacks to first film a scene with michael and thea imitating each other is interspersed with shots from a similar scene in jaws of sean jay mello and martin brody similarly shark s destruction contains footage of martin brody aiming at compressed air tank saying smile you son of a new york times comments nothing kills a sequel faster than reverence joseph sargent director has
