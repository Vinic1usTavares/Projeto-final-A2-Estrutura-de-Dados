competition for five years following heysel stadium disaster in 1985 football league first division top level of english football since 1888 was behind leagues such as italy s serie a and spain s la

european football s governing body lifted five year ban on english clubs playing in european competitions in 1990 resulting in manchester united lifting uefa cup winners cup in 1991 taylor report on stadium safety standards which proposed expensive upgrades to create all seater stadiums in aftermath of hillsborough disaster was published in january 1990 in 1980s major english clubs had begun to transform into business ventures applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue martin edwards of manchester united irving scholar of tottenham hotspur and david dein of arsenal were among leaders in this transformation commercial imperative led to top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue clubs in division one threatened to break away from football league and in so doing they managed to increase their voting power and gain more favourable financial arrangement taking a 50 share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986 they demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches and revenue from television grew in importance football league received ps6 3 million for a two year agreement in 1986 but by 1988 in a deal agreed with itv price rose to ps44 million over four years with leading clubs taking 75 of cash according to scholar who was involved in negotiations of television deals each of first division clubs received only around ps25 000 per year from television rights before 1986 this increased to around ps50 000 in 1986 negotiation then to ps600 000 in 1988 1988 negotiations were conducted under threat of ten clubs leaving to form a super league but they were eventually persuaded to stay with top clubs taking lion s share of deal negotiations also convinced bigger clubs that in order to receive enough votes they needed to take whole of first division with them instead of a smaller super league by beginning of 1990s big clubs again considered breaking away especially now that they had to fund cost of stadium upgrade as proposed by taylor report foundation in 1990 managing director of london weekend television lwt greg dyke met with representatives of big five football clubs in england manchester united liverpool tottenham everton and arsenal over a dinner meeting was to pave way for a break away from football league dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for lwt if only larger clubs in country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money five clubs agreed with suggestion and decided to press ahead with it however league would have no credibility without backing of football association and so david dein of arsenal held talks to see whether fa were receptive to idea fa did not enjoy an amicable relationship with football league at time and considered it as a way to weaken football league s position fa released a report in june 1991 blueprint for future of football that supported plan for premier league with fa ultimate authority that would oversee breakaway league at close of 1991 season a proposal was tabled for establishment of a new league that would bring more money into game overall founder members agreement signed on 17 july 1991 by game s top flight clubs established basic principles for setting up fa premier league newly formed top division would have commercial independence from football association and football league giving fa premier league licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements argument given at time was that extra income would allow english clubs to compete with teams across europe although dyke played a significant role in creation of premier league dyke and itv would lose out in bidding for broadcast rights as bskyb won with a bid of ps304 million over five years with bbc awarded highlights package broadcast on match of day in 1992 first division clubs resigned from football league en masse and on 27 may 1992 fa premier league was formed as a limited company working out of an office at football association s then headquarters in lancaster gate this meant a break up of 104 year

five years prior champions league defeat could ruin tottenham s season says telegraph retrieved 14 august 2014 criticism of gap between an elite group of super clubs and majority of premier league has

14 by winning league cup in 2012 13 right of welsh clubs to take up such english places was in doubt until uefa clarified matter in march 2012 allowing them to participate scotland and ireland participation in premier league by some scottish or irish clubs has sometimes been discussed but without result idea came closest to reality in 1998 when wimbledon received premier league approval to relocate to dublin ireland but move was blocked by football association of ireland additionally media occasionally discusses idea that scotland s two biggest teams celtic and rangers should or will

premier league and football league since its split with football league many established clubs in premier league have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues owing in large part to disparity in revenue from television rights between leagues many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in premier league in every season except 2001 02 2011 12 and 2017 18 at least one premier league newcomer has been relegated back to football league in 1997 98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at end of season premier league distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from league in form of parachute payments starting with 2013 14 season these payments are in excess of ps60 million over four seasons though designed to help teams adjust to loss of television revenues average premier league team receives ps55 million while average football league championship club receives ps2 million critics maintain that payments actually widen gap between teams that have reached premier league and those that have not leading to common occurrence of teams bouncing back soon after their relegation for some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to premier league financial problems including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed further relegations down
