either or danish eller is first published work of danish philosopher soren kierkegaard appearing in two volumes in 1843 under pseudonymous editorship of victor eremita latin for victorious hermit it

views each life view is written and represented by a fictional pseudonymous author with prose of work reflecting and depending on life view being discussed for example aesthetic life view is written in short essay form with poetic imagery and allusions discussing aesthetic topics such as music seduction drama and beauty ethical life view is written as two long letters with a more argumentative and restrained prose discussing moral responsibility critical reflection and marriage kierkegaard soren essential kierkegaard edited by howard and edna hong princeton views of book are not neatly

realm of existence where an individual lives and extracts pleasure from life only for their own sake in this realm one has possibility of highest as well as lowest ethical on other hand is civic realm of existence where one s value and identity are judged and at times superseded by objective world in simple terms one can choose either to remain oblivious to all that goes on in world or to become involved more specifically ethic realm starts with a conscious effort to choose one s life with a choice to choose either way however an individual can go too far in these realms and lose sight of his

of not both a and not a a thing cannot be both true and not true in same instant thumb hegel giving a lecture in georg wilhelm friedrich hegel s work science of logic 1812 hegel had criticized aristotle s laws of classical logic for being static rather than dynamic and becoming and had replaced it with his own dialectical logic hegel formulated for aristotle s laws from this it is evident that law of identity itself and still more law of contradiction is not merely of analytic but of synthetic nature for latter contains in its expression not merely empty simple equality with self and not merely other of this in general but what is more absolute inequality contradiction per se but as has been shown law of identity itself contains movement of reflection identity as a vanishing of otherness what emerges from this consideration is therefore first that law of identity or of contradiction which purports to express merely abstract identity in contrast to difference as a truth is not a law of thought but rather opposite of it secondly that these laws contain more than is meant by them to wit this opposite absolute difference itself hegel s remarks ss 883 884 law of excluded middle is also distinguished from laws of identity and contradiction latter of these asserted that there is nothing that is at once a and not a it implies that there is nothing that is neither a nor not a that there is not a third that is indifferent to opposition but in fact third that is indifferent to opposition is given in law itself namely a itself is present in it this a is neither a nor a and is equally well a as a something that was supposed to be either a or not a is therefore related to both a and not a and again in being related to a it is supposed not to be related to not a nor to a if it is related to not a something itself therefore is third which was supposed to be excluded since opposite determinations in something are just as much posited as in this positing third which has here form of a dead something when taken more profoundly is unity of reflection into which opposition withdraws as into ground hegel s remarks ss 952 frederick c cambridge companion to hegel cambridge watts michael kierkegaard oneworld law of identity is inaccurate because a thing is always more than itself law of excluded middle is inaccurate because a thing can be both itself and many others law of non contradiction is inaccurate because everything in existence is both itself and not itself kierkegaard spoke of hegel s logic metaphorically in 1844 kierkegaard argues that hegel s philosophy dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through neutralization of either or dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy in hegel s theory because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice other than a submission to will of idea or geist kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated importance of personal responsibility and choice making either or part ii hong p 214ff structure book is first of kierkegaard s works written

strength is gone it rises no more to royal leap i have lost my illusions vainly i seek to plunge myself into boundless sea of joy it cannot sustain me or rather i cannot sustain myself once pleasure had but to beckon me and i mounted light of foot sound and unafraid when i rode slowly through woods it was as if i flew now when horse is covered with and ready to drop it seems to me that i do not move i am solitary as always forsaken not by men which could not hurt me but by happy fairies of joy who used to encircle me in countless multitudes who met acquaintances everywhere everywhere showed me an opportunity for pleasure as an intoxicated man gathers a wild crowd of youths about him so they flocked about me fairies of joy and i greeted them with a smile my soul has lost its potentiality if i were to wish for anything i should not wish for wealth and power but for passionate sense of potential for eye which ever young and ardent sees possible pleasure disappoints possibility never and what wine is so sparkling what so fragrant what so intoxicating as possibility a diapsalmata swenson p 40 first volume either describes aesthetic phase of existence it contains a collection of papers found by victor eremita and written by a aesthete aesthete according to kierkegaard s model will eventually find himself in despair a psychological state explored further in kierkegaard s concept of anxiety and sickness unto death that results from a recognition of limits of aesthetic approach to life kierkegaard s despair is a somewhat analogous precursor of existential angst natural reaction is to make an eventual leap to second phase ethical which is characterized as a phase in which rational choice and commitment replace capricious and inconsistent longings of aesthetic mode ultimately for kierkegaard aesthetic and ethical are both superseded by a final phase which he terms religious mode this is introduced later in fear and trembling diapsalmata first section of either is a collection of many tangential aphorisms epigrams anecdotes and musings on aesthetic mode of life word diapsalmata is related to psalms and means refrains it contains some of kierkegaard s most famous and poetic lines such as what is a poet freedom of speech vs freedom of thought unmovable chess piece tragic clown and laughter of gods oden thomas c parables of kierkegaard princeton university press if one

has to seduce either or part i swenson p 107 190 191 faust seduces just one woman this section deals with theological questions he asks if god seduces 1 003 people at one time or if he seduces one

examines concept of first love as a pinnacle for using his idiosyncratic concepts of in danish and demonic with reference to eugene scribe scribe wanted to create a template for all playwrights to follow he insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction kierkegaard is against any template in field of literature or of christianity he was against systematizing anything in literature because system brings artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in system he wrote about muse as occasion for inspiration how much of calling of muse depends on muse how much on single individual and how much on will or volition soren kierkegaard either or vol 1 swenson 1959 1971 p 232ff can we ever know how inspiration happens later in concluding unscientific postscript he wrote inspiration is indeed an object of faith is qualitatively dialectical not attainable by means of quantification concluding unscientific postscript to philosophical fragments hong 1992 p 29 george brandes described this systematizing tenancy in his book main currents in nineteenth century literature vol 1 1906 english translation kierkegaard has been writing against reading about love instead of discovering love scribe s play is 16 pages long and kierkegaard writes a 50 page review of book he wrote against practice of reading reviews instead of actual books themselves in his review he goes to play himself and sees his lover at a play called first love for him this is a sign like a four leaf clover that she must be one but confusion sets in for poor girl because of mistaken identity she is unable to make up her mind about love and says first love is true love and one loves only once but kierkegaard says this is sophistry because category first is at same time a qualitative and a numerical category her first impression of love when she was eight has become decisive for her whole life either or part i swenson p 253 now she can love only to a certain degree because she s comparing each new experience with past experience kierkegaard discussed this again in 1845 crop rotation an attempt at a theory of social prudence to kierkegaard s aesthete boredom is root of all evil and so one must go to ends of earth to avoid it in this section a explains that just as a farmer rotates crops to keep soil fertile so must a man forever change himself in order to remain interesting a speaks out against anything that may prevent this rotation and lock one into boredom including friends family and most importantly for second half of book marriage diary of a seducer written by johannes seducer this volume illustrates how aesthete holds interesting as his highest value and how to satisfy his voyeuristic reflections he manipulates girl he calls cordelia from being boring into being interesting he grooms her to fall in love with him but then schemes to have her questioning idea of engagement finally johannes succeeds in having cordelia break engagement herself he will use irony artifice caprice imagination and arbitrariness to engineer poetically satisfying possibilities he is not so much interested in act of seduction as in willfully creating its interesting possibility seducer is very reminiscent of goethe s faust part 1 scene vii a street faust says to mephistopheles listen you must get that girl for me mephistopheles says she s an innocent girl but faust says she s older than 14 mephistopheles says he s speaking like some don juan faust then calls devil a master but goethe was probably responding to christopher marlowe s tragical history of doctor faustus 1616 who has characters german valdes cornelius faustus mephistopheles lucifer good and evil angels and a host of other devils faustus asks mephistopheles to answer some questions he asks how many heavens and spheres there are mephistopheles says there are nine faustus asks who made world mephistopheles refuses to answer tragical history of doctor faustus text a 1616 text b was made in 1663 because ethicist got involved goethe and marlowe have devils and angels as third person or persons between him and his love but kierkegaard has a different third person involved in discussions between johannes seducer and cordelia he has this strange power called chance see concept of anxiety by kierkegaard seducer knows value of chance and wants to use chance to be a possibility which seems an impossibility he says kierkegaard has this seducer speak again in stages on life s on life s way hong p where he explores some of possibilities and then once more where he tries to explain that misunderstanding can be root of unity of tragic and comic anyone who when he is twenty years old does not understand that there is a categorical imperative enjoy is a fool and anyone who does not start doing it is a our young friend will always remain on outside eremita s speech begins on p 56 stages on life s way young man speaks as well as fashion designer is a fanatic constantin has paid too much for his intellect fashion designer is a madman all four of you after same girl will turn out to be a fizzle have enough fanaticism to idealize enough appetite to join in jolly conviviality of desire enough understanding to break off in exactly same way death breaks off enough rage to want to enjoy it all over again then one is favorite of gods and of girls stages on life s way hong p 73 kierkegaard has category of choice and esthetic as well as ethical both can choose to love each other but how of love is what kierkegaard is getting at or do not interrupt flight of your soul do not distress what is best in you do not your spirit with half wishes and half thoughts ask yourself and keep on asking until you find answer for one may have known something many times acknowledged it one may have willed something many times attempted it and yet only deep inner motion only heart s indescribable emotion only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you that no power can take it from you for only truth that builds up is truth for you judge vilhelm ultimatum hong translation second volume represents ethical stage victor eremita found a group of letters from a retired judge vilhelm or william another pseudonymous author to a trying to convince a of value of ethical stage of life by arguing that ethical person can still enjoy aesthetic values difference is that pursuit of pleasure is tempered with ethical values and responsibilities aesthetic validity of marriage first letter is about aesthetic value of marriage and defends marriage as a way of life equilibrium between aesthetic and ethical in development of personality second letter concerns more explicit ethical subject of choosing good or one s self and of value of making binding life choices ultimatum volume ends in a discourse on upbuilding in thought that against god we are always in wrong kierkegaard repeats this theme often in his writings third section of stages on life s way 1845 hong p 185ff guilty not guilty is about a person who can never discover or accept his or her own guilt and fourth section of upbuilding discourses in various spirits 1847 joy of it that in relation to god a person always suffers as guilty hong p 265 288 is about person who with joy discovers his or her own guilt and that god still loves him or her his spiritual advice for a and b is that they make peace with each other here kierkegaard quotes from gospel of luke chapter 19 verses 42 to end for this discourse it s human nature to look to external forces when faced with our own inadequacies but ethicist is against this comparison is an esthetic exercise and has nothing to do with ethics and religion he says let each one learn what he can both of us can learn that a person s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions since this would only make him completely unhappy either or ii p 188 hong he also asks if a person absolutely in love can know if he is more or less in love than others soren kierkegaard concluding unscientific postscript 1846 p 509 he completes this thought later in his concluding unscientific postscript and expands on looking inward in practice in christianity ethical and ethical religious have nothing to do with comparative all comparison delays and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and if possible traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among a person who blames others that they have corrupted him is talking nonsense and only informs against himself concluding unscientific postscript p 549 is most disastrous association that love can enter into comparison is most dangerous acquaintance love can make comparison is worst of all seductions soren kierkegaard works of love 1847 hong p 186 lord jesus christ our foolish minds are weak they are more than willing to be drawn and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself there is pleasure with its seductive power multiplicity with its bewildering distractions moment with its infatuating importance and conceited of and careless time wasting of light mindedness and gloomy brooding of heavy mindedness all this will draw us away from ourselves to itself in order to deceive us but you who are truth only you savior and redeemer can truly draw a person to yourself which you have promised to do that you will draw all to yourself then may god grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves so that you according to your word can draw us to yourself from on high but through lowliness and soren kierkegaard practice in christianity 1850 p 157 hong introducing ethical stage it is moreover unclear if kierkegaard acknowledges an ethical stage without religion freedom seems to denote freedom to choose will to do right and to denounce wrong in a secular almost kantian style however remorse seems to be a religious category specifically related to christian concept of deliverance kierkegaard soren 2 ii p 190 1962 1964 either or part ii hong p 224 225 moreover kierkegaard is constant in his point of view that each single individual can become conscious of a higher self than externally visible human self and embrace spiritual self in an eternal understanding discourses and sequel along with this work kierkegaard published under his own name two upbuilding works penned under his own name commentary on kierkegaard d anthony storm on may 16 1843 intended to complement either or expectancy of faith and every good and every perfect gift is from above kierkegaard soren eighteen upbuilding discourses princeton collected by princeton university press in eighteen upbuilding discourses kierkegaard also published another discourse during printing of second edition of either or in 1849 kierkegaard s discourse has to do with difference between wishing and willing in development of a particular expectancy as thought becomes more absorbed in future it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from riddle expectancy always looks to future and can hope but regret which is what goethe did in his book sorrows of young werther closes door of hope and love becomes unhappy kierkegaard points to faith as highest expectancy because faith is something that everyone has or can have he says person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all characters in either or believe everyone is alike in that everyone has talent or everyone has conditions that would allow them to live an ethical life goethe wanted to love and complained that he couldn t be loved but everyone else could be loved but he wished he didn t have an expectancy to work his will to love kierkegaard responds to him in this way ultimatum at end of second volume of either or hinted at a future discussion of religious stage in two upbuilding discourses ask yourself and keep on asking until you find answer for one may have known something many times acknowledged it one may have willed something many times attempted it and yet only deep inner motion only heart s indescribable emotion only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you that no power can take it from you for only truth that builds up is truth for you either or part ii hong p 354 this discussion is included in stages on life s way 1845 first two sections revisit and refine aesthetic and ethical stages elucidated in either or

p trans howard and edna hong princeton university press in addition to discourses one week after either or was published kierkegaard published a newspaper article in titled who is author of either or attempting to create authorial distance from work emphasizing content of work and embodiment of a particular way of life in each of pseudonyms kierkegaard using pseudonym a f writes most people including author of this article think it is not worth trouble to be concerned about who author is they are happy not to know his identity for then they have only book to deal with without being bothered or distracted by his personality themes various essays in either or help elucidate various forms of aestheticism and ethical existence both a and judge vilhelm attempt to focus primarily upon best that their mode of existence has to offer summary of stages aesthetic ethical religious defined by immediacy failure to reflect seriously upon nature of one s way of living defined by critical reflection able to make and take moral responsibility and accountability for his life choices sees outer existence as more important self is entirely subject to external factors sees inner existence as more important self shapes one s own character values inclinations and personal identity thus self is partially subject to internal factors accepts passively that one s life is based entirely upon external factors willing to take active control of one s life tends to avoid commitments as they see it as boring commitments like friendship and marriage are cornerstones of a responsible ethical way of existence exhaustion of aesthetic pleasure leads to boredom and despair strives to become a better human being through taking an active role in shaping oneself and one s manner of life 200px center thumb three stages of life either or discusses aesthetic and ethical stages or spheres an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment size of spheres are for illustrative purposes only alt three concentric circles outer circle is labeled aesthetic middle circle is labeled ethical inner circle is labeled religious a fundamental characteristic of aesthete is immediacy in either or there are several levels of immediacy explored ranging from unrefined to refined unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments that do not require effort or personal cultivation e g alcohol drugs casual sex sloth etc refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically theory of social prudence given in crop rotation is an example of refined immediacy instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies enjoyments are contemplated and cultivated for maximum pleasure however both refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept fundamental given conditions of their life and do not accept responsibility to change it if things go wrong aesthete simply blames existence rather than one s self assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to either or stages on life s way esthetic sphere is sphere of immediacy ethical sphere of requirement and this requirement is so infinite that individual always goes bankrupt religious sphere of fulfillment but please note not a fulfillment such as when one fills an alms box or a sack with gold for repentance has specifically created a boundless space and as a consequence religious contradiction simultaneously to be out on 70 000 fathoms of water and yet be joyful just as ethical sphere is a passageway which one nevertheless does not pass through once and for all just as repentance is its expression so repentance is most dialectical no wonder then that one fears it for if one gives it a finger it takes whole hand just as jehovah in old testament visits of fathers upon children unto latest generations so repentance goes backward continually presupposing object of its investigation in repentance there is impulse of motion and therefore everything is reversed this impulse signifies precisely difference between esthetic and religious as difference between external and internal soren kierkegaard stages on life s way hong translation p 476 477 commitment is an important characteristic of ethicist commitments are made by being an active participant in society rather than a detached observer or outsider ethicist has a strong sense of responsibility duty honor and respect for his friendships family and career judge vilhelm uses example of marriage as an example of an ethical institution requiring strong commitment and responsibility whereas aesthete would be bored by repetitive nature of marriage e g married to one person only ethicist believes in necessity of self denial e g self denying unmitigated pleasure in order to uphold one s obligations kierkegaard had judge william speak again in his 1845 book stages on life s way

13 15 34 213 218 interpretation extremely nested of this work adds a problem of interpretation a and b are authors of work eremita is editor kierkegaard s role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from points of view expressed in his works although absurdity of his pseudonyms bizarre latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from reader kierkegaard s papers first edition viii 2 b 81 89 explain this method in writing he discussed either or in first and second edition in his 1848 1859 book point of view of my work as an author kierkegaard soren point of view translated by howard and edna hong princeton university press in my career as an author a point has now been reached where it is permissible to do what i feel a strong impulse to do and so regard as my duty namely to explain once for all as directly and frankly as possible what is what what i as an author declare myself to be moment however it may be in another sense is now appropriate partly because as i have said this point has been reached and partly because i am about to encounter for second time in literary field my first production either or in its second edition which i was not willing to have published earlier point of view lowrie translation 1962 p 5 furthermore kierkegaard was a close reader of aesthetic works of johann wolfgang von goethe and ethical works of georg wilhelm friedrich hegel see josiah royce s free translation of hegel s phenomenology of spirit each presented a way of living one s life in a different manner kierkegaard s writings in this book are close to what goethe wrote in his autobiography quotation it was not long before i formed a connection with lavater passages of my letter of a pastor to his colleagues had greatly struck him for much of it agreed perfectly with his own views with his never tiring activity our correspondence soon became lively at time it commenced he was making preparations for his larger work on physiognomy introduction to which had already been laid before public he called on all world to send him drawings and outlines and especially representations of christ and although i could do as good as nothing in this way he nevertheless insisted on my sending him a sketch of saviour such as i imagined him to look such demands for impossible gave occasion for jests of many kinds for i had no other way of defending myself against his peculiarities but by bringing forward my own number of those who had no faith in physiognomy or at least regarded it as uncertain and deceitful was very great and several who had a liking for lavater felt a desire to try him and if possible to play him a trick he had ordered of a painter in frankfort who was not without talent profiles of several well known persons lavater s agent ventured upon jest of sending s portrait as mine which soon brought back a merry but thundering epistle full of all kinds of expletives and that this was not my picture together with everything that on such an occasion lavater would naturally have to say in confirmation of doctrine of physiognomy my true likeness which was sent afterwards he allowed to pass more readily but even here opposition into which he fell both with painters and with individuals showed itself at once former could never work for him faithfully and sufficiently latter whatever excellences they might have came always too far short of idea which he entertained of humanity and of men to prevent his being somewhat repelled by special characteristics which constitute personality of individual conception of humanity which had been formed in himself and in his own humanity was so completely akin to living image of christ which he cherished within him that it was impossible for him to understand how a man could live and breathe without at same time being a christian my own relation to christian religion lay merely in my sense and feeling and i had not slightest notion of that physical affinity to which lavater inclined i was therefore vexed by importunity with which a man so full of mind and heart attacked me as well as mendelssohn and others with him a christian of his sort or else that one must bring him over to one s own way of thinking and convince him of precisely that in which one had found peace this demand so directly opposed to that liberal spirit of world to which i was more and more tending did not have best effect upon me all unsuccessful attempts at conversion leave him who has been selected for a proselyte stubborn and obdurate and this was especially case with me when lavater at last came out with hard dilemma either christian or atheist upon this i declared that if he would not leave me my own christianity as i had hitherto cherished it i could readily decide for atheism particularly as i saw that nobody knew precisely what either meant autobiography of johann goethe concluding books fourteen and fifteen 1849 published 1811 1833 p 8 9 autobiography of johann goethe existential interpretation a common interpretation of either or presents reader with a choice between two approaches to life there are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life suggesting aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted idea that there is a good evil distinction to be made likewise choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to aesthete ruling judge vilhelm s ethics as inconsequential and preferring pleasures of seduction thus existentialists see victor eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre ordained value can be discerned one must choose and through one s choices one creates what one is name warburton jean jacques rousseau had published a book in 1762 in which he discussed giving daughters right to choose her own husband this is a quote from fifth book of emile creed of savoyard priest about choice both german and danish citizens were reading this book this choosing for oneself verses having an authority choose for one is a difficult leap for some to make however aesthetic and ethical ways of life are not only ways of living kierkegaard continues to flesh out other stages in further works and stages on life s way is considered a direct sequel to either or it is not same as either or as he points out in concluding postscript in 1846 christian interpretation whole book can be viewed as struggle

find god by studying past as hegel did don juan seduces him away from god and faust robs him of his innocent faith through power of language for him tautology is highest realm of thought either or

argues with a he says ethics are highest a wants to remain a mystery to himself but b says it s meaning of life to become open to yourself it s more important to know yourself than historical persons more you know about yourself more you can find your eternal validity god will bless most ethical person each one knows what s best for other but neither knows what s best for himself kierkegaard speaking in voice of upbuilding discourse at end says they are both wrong they re both trying to find god in a childish way whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning art science dogma and ethics constantly change we all want to be in right and never in wrong once we find what we desire we find that it wasn t what we imagined it to be so kierkegaard says to leave it all to god three spheres of existence were neatly summed up in his concluding unscientific postscript to philosophical fragments kantian interpretation a recent way to interpret either or is to read it as an applied kantian text scholars for this interpretation include alasdair john and anthony rudd kierkegaard after macintyre essays on freedom narrative and virtue

acting on a maxim of mutual aid one must mentally create a world with its own type of humanity and existence an ethical choice requires one to convert to a universal man or model of essential humanity moral judgments cannot be private or privileging of maxims distinction between hypothetical and categorical imperatives earthly love is partiality spiritual love has no ethical laws are universally known and applicable derived from a priori principle of reason criticizes freethinkers who attempt to prove ethical relativity rationality determines moral protection must respect rational beings as

serious manner however other scholars think kierkegaard adopts kantian themes in order to criticize them while yet others think that although kierkegaard adopts some kantian themes their final ethical positions are substantially different george stack argues for this latter interpretation writing despite occasional echoes of kantian sentiments in kierkegaard s writings especially in either or bifurcation between his ethics of self becoming and kant s meta empirical ethics is mutatis mutandis complete since radical individuation specificity inwardness and development of subjectivity are central to kierkegaard s existential ethics it is clear essentially that spirit and intention of his practical ethics is divorced from formalism of kant green p 87 biographical interpretation upright

and his ex fiancee regine olsen johannes seducer in diary of a seducer treats object of his affection cordelia much as kierkegaard treats regine befriending her family asking her to marry him and breaking off engagement either or then could be poetic and literary expression of kierkegaard s decision between a life of sensual pleasure as he had experienced in his youth or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail ultimately however either or stands philosophically independent of its relation to kierkegaard s life warburton p 181 yet

godwin s preface to his book caleb williams 1794 thus i have endeavoured to give a true history of concoction and mode of writing of this mighty trifle when i had done i soon became sensible that i had done in a manner nothing how many flat and insipid parts does book contain how terribly unequal does it appear to me from time to time author plainly reels to and fro like a drunken man and when i had done all what had i done written a book to amuse boys and girls in their vacant hours a story to be hastily gobbled up by them swallowed in a pusillanimous and unanimated mood without chewing and digestion i was in this respect greatly impressed with confession of one of most accomplished readers and excellent critics that any author could have fallen in with unfortunate joseph gerald he told me that he had received my book late one evening and had read through three volumes before he closed his eyes thus what had cost me twelve months labour ceaseless heartaches and industry now sinking in despair and now roused and sustained in unusual energy he went over in a few hours shut book laid himself on his pillow slept and was refreshed and cried to morrow to fresh woods and pastures new he also published a short article who is author of either or a week after publication of either or itself in 1886 georg brandes compared either or with frederik paludan muller s in eminent authors of nineteenth century which was translated into english at that time later in 1906 he compared kierkegaard s diary of seducer with rousseau s julie or new heloise and with goethe s sorrows of young werther he also compared either or to henrik ibsen s brand but edmund gosse disagreed with him henrik ibsen gosse edmund 1849 1928 kierkegaard later referred to his concept of choosing yourself as single individual in concept of anxiety june 17 1844 and then in his four upbuilding discourses august 31 1844 and once again in upbuilding discourses in various spirits 1847 william james echoed kierkegaard in his lecture on sick soul where he wrote man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into real life varieties of religious experience william james lecture 6 7 sick soul you are outside yourself and therefore cannot do without other as opposition you believe that only a restless spirit is alive and all who are experienced believe that only a quiet spirit is truly alive for

myself and my other is posited sleeping it is suspended dreaming it is an intimated nothing actuality of spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it seeks to grasp for it and it is a nothing that can only bring anxiety more it cannot do as long as it merely shows itself concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology therefore i must point out that it is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite whereas anxiety is freedom s actuality as possibility of possibility for this reason anxiety is not found in beast precisely because by nature beast is not qualified as spirit concept of anxiety nichol p 42 now he discovers that self he chooses has a boundless multiplicity within itself inasmuch as it has a history a history in which he acknowledges identity with himself this history is of a different kind for in this history he stands in relation to other individuals in race and to whole race and this history contains painful things and yet he is person he is only through this history that is why it takes courage to choose oneself for at same time as he seems to be isolating himself most radically he is most radically sinking himself into root by which he is bound up with whole this makes him uneasy and yet it must be so for when passion of freedom is aroused in him and it is aroused in choice just as it presupposes itself in choice he chooses himself and struggles for this possession as for his salvation and it is his salvation either or part ii hong p a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself he steps as it were in way of that first self halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after surrounding world that is its object and summons it back from external in order to prompt first self to this withdrawal deeper self lets surrounding world remain what it is remain dubious this is indeed way it is world around us is inconstant and can be changed into opposite at any moment and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by of his wish deeper self now shapes deceitful flexibility of surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to first self then first self either must proceed to kill deeper self to render it forgotten whereby whole matter is given up or it must admit that deeper self is right because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction and as soon as one confesses that it changes it can of course change in that same moment however much that first self shrinks from this there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought twister so wily that he can invalidate deeper self s eternal claim there is only one way out and that is to silence deeper self by letting roar of inconstancy drown it out eighteen upbuilding discourses 1845 hong translation p as a man changes his clothes for celebration so a person preparing for holy act of confession is inwardly changed it is indeed like changing one s clothes to divest oneself of multiplicity in order to make up one s mind about one thing to interrupt pace of busy activity in order to put on repose of contemplation in unity with oneself and this unity with oneself is celebration s simple festive dress that is condition of admittance upbuilding discourses in various spirits soren kierkegaard 1847 hong p a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain past clearly if anxiety creates confusion and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might as he works his way back then he may go to his friend and say my soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me but i confided everything to you you remember it so please explain past to me again but if a person has no friend he presumably goes to god if under other circumstances he has confided something to him if in hour of decision he called god as witness when no one understood him and one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times perhaps was filled with self loathing which is even more oppressive upon discovering that one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all even though he had listened had not sensed what was making him anxious but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life but this would never happen with god who would dare to venture to think this of god even if he is cowardly enough to prefer to forget god until he stands face to face with judge who passes judgment on him but not on one who truly has god as a witness because where god is judge there is indeed no judge if god is witness it by no means follows that a person s life becomes easy because he learns to know god in this way on contrary it can become very hard it may become more difficult than contemptible easiness of sensate human life but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning soren kierkegaard four upbuilding discourses august 31 1844 eighteen upbuilding discourses p 324 thumb august strindberg 1849 1910 august strindberg was familiar with either or and this book made him forever a champion of ethical as juxtaposed to aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful to idea that art and

who satisfied his desires in imagination part ii was his discourse on life as a duty and when he reached end of work he found moral philosopher in despair and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a philistine he then states that kierkegaard s discourses might have led him closer to christianity but he didn t know if he could come back to something which had been torn out and joyfully thrown into fire however after reading book he felt sinful then another writer began to influence his life this is how he described either or kierkegaard put an end to his own double mindedness about devoting himself completely to aesthetics or developing a balance between aesthetic and ethical and going on to an ethical christian religious unscientific postscript p 298 299 in

dew jr insisted that reviewers consider book in this way in general we have a right to discover if we can meaning of a work as comprehensive as either or considering it upon its own merits and not reducing meaning so as to fit into author s later perspective it occurred to me that this was a service to understanding kierkegaard whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence kierkegaard s brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness truth and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another yet these three are integrally related in dynamics of a healthy character structure reply to mrs hess journal of philosophy vol 42 no 8 p 219 david f swenson university of minneapolis saint

john updike said of diary in vast literature of love seducer s diary is an intricate curiosity a feverishly intellectual attempt to reconstruct an erotic failure as a pedagogic success a wound masked as a boast many authors were interested in separating esthetic ethical and religious but it may have been as far as kierkegaard was concerned of more importance for single individual to have a way to
