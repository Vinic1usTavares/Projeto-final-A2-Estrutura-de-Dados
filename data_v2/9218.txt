with army of republic of serb krajina arsk in january 1993 operation maslenica 2nd battalion of ppcli implemented plan in march 1993 to demonstrate unprofor resolve unprofor sector west deputy commander considered plan impractical except for deterrence due to security concerns background in november 1991 croatia serbia and yugoslav people s army jugoslovenska narodna armija jna agreed upon vance plan designed to halt combat operations in croatian war of independence and allow negotiation of a political settlement in addition to ceasefire plan protected civilians in specific areas designated as united nations protected areas unpas and un peacekeepers in croatia ceasefire went into effect on 3 january 1992 shortly after vance plan was accepted european community announced its decision to grant diplomatic recognition to croatia on 15 january 1992 and serb and jna held areas of croatia were organised as republic of serbian krajina rsk despite vance plan s requirement for immediate withdrawal of jna personnel and equipment from croatia jna stayed behind for seven to eight months when its troops eventually pulled out jna transferred their equipment to rsk because of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire unprofor did not begin to deploy until 8 march and took two months to fully assemble in unpas unprofor was tasked with unpas maintaining ceasefire monitoring local police and creating conditions for return of internally displaced persons and refugees these comprised more than 300 000 croats who were exiled from rsk controlled territory and 20 000 serbs who fled areas of western slavonia captured by croatian army hrvatska vojska hv in operations swath 10 papuk 91 and hurricane 91 in late 1991 a portion of western slavonia encompassing an area approximately was designated as unpa western slavonia or sector west by peace plan although unlike other unpas rsk controlled only about one third of area in south centred on town of okucani rsk held area included a section of zagreb belgrade motorway sector west was divided into four areas of responsibility aors western portion of motorway section and its surroundings were assigned to a jordanian battalion of unprofor jordbat and area to east containing rest of motorway within unpa and town of okucani was aor of a nepalese battalion nepbat to north of jordbat and nepbat aors a canadian battalion canbat 1 aor was established northernmost portion of sector west became aor of an argentine battalion unlike canadians who had at their disposal 83 armoured personnel carriers jordanian and nepalese troops were equipped with small arms only sector west was commanded by argentine brigadier general carlos maria zabala and most of staff work was assigned to canadians unprofor established two storage depots for army of rsk arsk heavy weapons near pakrac and in stara gradiska and hv moved its heavy weapons away from sector west although storage facilities were guarded by unprofor rsk was allowed access to maintain weapons canadian order of battle canbat 1 initially included elements from 1st battalion of royal 22nd regiment 3rd battalion of royal canadian regiment and 8th canadian hussars under lieutenant colonel michel jones although lead elements of unit reached croatia on 8 april it took two weeks for all canbat 1 troops to arrive in september 1992 canbat 1 troops were replaced by 3rd battalion of princess patricia s canadian light infantry ppcli canbat 1 was headquartered in polom barracks between towns of pakrac and daruvar plan thumb 300px right upright alt see caption map of unprofor planned operation backstop on map of unpa western slavonia sector west unprofor operations staff in sector west developed several defensive plans assigning top priority to plan codenamed operation backstop it envisaged an active defence against hv assuming that attack s main axis would be zagreb belgrade motorway canbat 1 supported by general zabala thought hv would attack sector west to control zagreb belgrade motorway and un would not object to such a move any croatian attack in area was likely to employ substantially larger forces than those earmarked for operation backstop canbat 1 was expected to deploy one mechanised company each to jordbat and nepbat aors to position themselves defensively forces would attempt to deter hv from advancing demonstrate its resolve to defend sector west engage hv with antitank weapons and mortars protect jordanian and nepalese withdrawal and withdraw under protection of canbat 1 two companies required eight hours notice of hv advance to reach their designated positions in time presumably arsk would retrieve its heavy weapons from unprofor storage by force and resist hv reaction to operation maslenica in january 1993 when hv launched operation maslenica which aimed to capture maslenica bridge canadian troops acted in accordance with part of operation backstop they dug in their positions reinforcing nepalese troops for 72 hours and expecting an hv attack in sector west no reinforcements were deployed to jordbat aor and unprofor prepared to blow up only bridge across sava river linking sector west and bosnian serb held territory in bosnia and herzegovina to prevent army of republika srpska from advancing into area in response to operation maslenica rsk president goran hadzic ordered arsk to retrieve its tanks from un storage in sector west and attack nova gradiska and novska when local rsk authorities led by veljko dzakula in sector west demanded an explanation of order from hadzic he said that croatian forces were about to attack okucani on 26 january zabala met with dzakula in okucani and reassured him that unprofor would protect sector west from a croatian attack agreeing to provide rsk with a written guarantee to that effect although hadzic accepted assurance and cancelled attack orders were reinstated and cancelled three more times over next two days on 7 february canadian troops drilled deck of bridge spanning channel north of stara gradiska to place demolition charges move was protested by rsk authorities who saw route only link between okucani and serb controlled territory in bosnia and herzegovina as crucial to an evacuation in event of an anticipated croatian attack situation calmed down by mid february and hv did not attack sector west exercise 2nd battalion of ppcli replaced 3rd battalion in april as canbat 1 commander of 2nd battalion lieutenant colonel jim calvin instructed his troops to approach their tasks differently than 3rd battalion had calvin unlike his predecessor did not want rsk forces or hv to be aware of canbat 1 operations ordering battalion to observe radio silence according to canadian journalist carol off calvin was eager to fight and instructed his troops to return fire if necessary situation in sector west deteriorated when jordanian general shabshough replaced zabala in march a major contribution to deterioration was shabshough s minimal involvement with local authorities in contrast to zabala s cooperative approach to reassure sector west croatian serb population canbat 1 performed an operation backstop exercise and tasks needed to evacuate nepbat in march or april 1993 afterwards canadian sector west deputy commander colonel k c hague recommended that plan be redesigned primarily as a means of deterrence hague felt that if operation backstop triggered an armed clash with hv unprofor would be forced to withdraw through croatia exposing peacekeepers to grave danger aftermath according to croatian political scientist vladimir filipovic it is unclear whether limited resources earmarked for operation and unclear motivation of canbat 1 troops would stop several hv brigades according to hague plan did not indicate how canbat 1 or other elements of unprofor would retreat through croatia after such a clash hague questioned feasibility of operation backstop because advance warning requirement was considered impossible to meet unprofor had no reliable military intelligence on hv movements outside unpas or beyond wide zones around unpas where only united nations military observers were present however hague considered operation backstop a deterrent although operation backstop was within unprofor mandate since peacekeepers were authorised to use force to prevent armed incursions into unpas croatian authorities resented operation croatia considered unprofor overzealous in defending unpas and protecting serbs while failing to ensure fulfilment of other aspects of vance plan such as return of refugees to their homes by september 1993 canbat 1 was relocated from sector west to sector south northern dalmatia and lika mandate in croatia expired on 31 march 1995 and united nations security council adopted resolution 981 establishing united nations confidence restoration operation in croatia instead sector west was captured by hv in operation flash in early may 1995 with no resistance from un peacekeepers main axis of first day s hv advance was zagreb belgrade motorway as anticipated by planners of operation backstop footnotes references books scientific
