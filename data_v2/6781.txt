unanimous front runner in an october 20 poll of 10 heisman voters conducted by rocky mountain news tim tebow quarterback of florida gators had a vote as 2007 winner seven games into season he said that mccoy would have his vote at that point in season in 45 21 victory over baylor mccoy passed for 300 yards and five touchdowns associated press story commented and mccoy likely refueled his heisman trophy bid by completing 26 of 37 passes for his fourth 300 yard game this season and eighth of his career even without playing final 12 minutes touchdowns went to four different receivers though he did have two interceptions on november 11 with ut holding an 8 1 record heisman voter rodney gilmore of espn com had mccoy listed third of five heisman candidates gilmore said i love his numbers 78 percent completion percentage 28 touchdowns only 7 interceptions and 2 879 yards and his gutsy second half performance against texas tech and i have not forgotten about his epic performance against oklahoma just a few weeks ago however harrell outplayed mccoy head to head in showdown last week so harrell has a leg up on him for now but mccoy is within striking distance that same day rocky mountain news poll listed harrell first and mccoy second in their weekly poll of 10 heisman voters harrell received 44 points and 7 first place votes while mccoy had 34 points and 2 first place

yards 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running comparing mccoy to fellow big 12 south quarterbacks sam bradford and graham harrell mandel said but here s where mccoy stands out to me bradford as talented as he is is helped by fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1 000 yard rushers behind him harrell has michael crabtree daniel has jeremy maclin with all due respect to jordan shipley and quan cosby mccoy is texas offense much like tim tebow last season he s both his team s leading passer and rusher also like tebow you have to wonder sometimes how he s still standing mccoy was sacked three times thursday night and endured several brutal hits following his third quarter touchdown run trainers attended to his shoulder on sideline but he was right back in there next series bradford and harrell each had one regular season game left against oklahoma state and baylor respectively tebow had games remaining against florida state and alabama in final 2008 rocky mountain news poll before heisman votes were announced mccoy moved to top of list but had a very thin lead over sam bradford and tim tebow who were in second and
