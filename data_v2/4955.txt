bali strait incident was an encounter between a squadron of six french navy frigates and six british east india company eic east indiamen in bali strait on 28 january 1797 incident took place east indies campaign of french revolutionary wars repeated french attempts to disrupt highly valuable british trade routes with british india and qing dynasty china in 1796 a large squadron of french frigates arrived in indian ocean under command of contre amiral pierre cesar charles de sercey in july this force sailed on a commerce raiding cruise off british ceylon but a subsequent attack into straits of malacca was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with two british ships of line off northeastern sumatra forced to make repairs sercey took his squadron to allied batavian city of batavia sheltering there until january 1797 as sercey left batavia he turned eastward along northern coast of java to avoid british commander in region admiral peter rainier who was escorting four ships through straits of malacca to west however six east indiamen were sailing to transit bali strait on their way to china on 28 january at entrance to strait sercey s squadron and east indiamen met eic commodore james farquharson captain of knew that if he fled french would rapidly overwhelm his ships so he decided to try a bluff he would attempt to lead sercey into believing that convoy was formed not from lightly armed east indiamen but from powerful ships of line that indiamen resembled farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle sercey under orders not to risk his squadron and fearing that he was facing a superior force retreated declining to risk a battle sercey did momentarily reconsider when british ships equally declined to attack temporarily disabled frigate forte but eventually withdrew completely he retired to his base at ile de france now mauritius where he learned of his error east indiamen reached whampoa anchorage having lost only one ship which wrecked in flores sea in a storm day after encounter background trade through east indies was a vital component of economy of great britain during late eighteenth century east india company which maintained trading ports throughout region most notably in british india at bombay madras and calcutta had a legal monopoly on trade between region and britain bulk of this trade was carried on large merchant ships known as east indiamen victory of seapower gardiner p 101 which had burthens between 500 and 1200 tons bm and carried up to 36 cannon due to their size and weaponry they could be mistaken for ships of line standard large warships of period a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon maffeo p 190 despite their appearance however they could not fight off an enemy frigate or ship of line as their guns were lighter in weight and weight of shot than those of similarly sized warships and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship clowes vol v p 337 and largely composed of lascars an important component of east india trade was an annual convoy from canton qing dynasty china each year a large convoy of east indiamen would gather at canton in order to sail in convoy through indian ocean and atlantic to britain value of trade carried in this convoy nicknamed china fleet was enormous one convoy in 1804 was reported to be carrying goods worth over ps8 million in contemporary values equivalent of ps as of victory of seapower gardiner p 32 by 1797 britain and new french republic had been engaged in french revolutionary wars for nearly four years although there had been significant fighting in europe east indies had remained largely under british control french forces in region were limited and apart from a few raiding cruises french squadron in region had been under intermittent blockade at ile de france parkinson p 84 royal navy commanded in eastern waters by rear admiral peter rainier had focused on commerce protection and elimination of colonies of french allied batavian republic capturing dutch ceylon dutch cape colony and parts of dutch east indies in 1795 and 1796 fleet battle and blockade gardiner p 73 rainier had been engaged in pacifying local uprisings around malacca during latter part of campaign and there had been few forces left in reserve to protect british interests in indian ocean parkinson p 101 in response to british activity in region and reluctance of inhabitants of ile de france to follow orders from national convention abolishing slavery french dispatched a squadron of frigates to east indies early in 1796 james vol 1 p 347 this force led by contre amiral pierre cesar charles de sercey originally comprised three frigates subsequently joined by three more vessels forming a powerful raiding squadron after resupplying on ile de france in july sercey s frigates cruised off ceylon coast dissuaded from attacking undefended ports of british india by false information fed to his scouts that a british battle squadron was at anchor in calcutta parkinson p 101 turning eastwards sercey hoped to raid george town at penang but was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with a british squadron off sumatra on 9 september he spent winter sheltering in batavia on java parkinson p 104 encounter sercey s presence in east indies was known to east india company committee at canton who requested assistance from rainier in response british admiral sailed to macau in his flagship 74 gun ship of line with sloop and on 30 december met with four east indiamen and two smaller country ships used for regional trade rainier elected to sail immediately without waiting for remainder of convoy to assemble escorting his small convoy through straits of malacca during january reaching first penang and then madras by 13 february parkinson p 106 malacca was thought to be most likely point for an ambush by french squadron and orders were issued by committee for remainder of convoy commanded by captain wilson to sail through either strait alas strait or bali strait which were thought to be safer than malacca parkinson p 105 homeward bound exeter crossed second bar on 1 january 1797 and was at penang by 27 january british library exeter 3 rainier did not meet sercey who had learned of british plans and altered his own accordingly sailing from batavia on 4 january sercey cruised java sea in search of china convoy wary that rainier might be searching for him in turn on 28 january as sercey s ships passed southward through bali strait in bad weather sails were sighted james vol 2 p 79 sercey immediately ordered frigate cybele under captain pierre julien trehouart to reconnoitre approaching ships sails belonged to a convoy of indiamen which had gathered in colombo on ceylon before sailing together to china by choosing to come up through bali strait rather than through straits of malacca farquharson had inadvertently led his fleet directly into path of a french squadron whose six frigates were easily more powerful than his six east indiamen woodman p 113 farquharson was aware that he could not win a naval engagement with six frigates and so resolved instead to bluff french into thinking his merchant convoy was a squadron of ships of line when he saw cybele approaching farquharson brought two ships forward to meet frigate gambling that in low light trehouart might mistake east indiamen for warships farquharson compounded his ruse by raising rainier s blue ensign on alfred and instructing rest of convoy to raise ensigns of their own woodman p 114 deception was so convincing that trehouart turned away well short of british convoy signalling to sercey that l ennemi est superieur aux forces francais enemy is superior in force to french sercey turned his squadron away cybele passing close by flagship forte trehouart hailing that british ships comprised a battle squadron of two ships of line and four frigates forte had lost its main topmast in early stages of retreat and sercey had noted that british ships were not pursuing with fervour expected of a superior force encountering a weaker one but trehouart s declaration convinced him he was outnumbered and he ordered his squadron to withdraw orders of battle east india company fleet 22px link east india company alt ship guns commander arrived colombo
