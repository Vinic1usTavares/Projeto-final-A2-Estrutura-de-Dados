battle of sullivan s island or battle of fort sullivan was fought on june 28 1776 during american revolutionary war it took place near charleston south carolina during first british attempt to capture city from american forces it is also sometimes referred to as first siege of charleston owing to a more successful british siege in 1780 british organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in rebellious southern colonies of north america delayed by logistical concerns and bad weather expedition reached coast of north carolina in may 1776 finding conditions unsuitable for their operations general henry clinton and admiral sir peter parker decided instead to act against charlestown arriving there in early june troops were landed on long island now called isle of palms near sullivan s island where colonel william moultrie commanded a partially constructed fort in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault general charles lee commanding southern continental theater of war would provide supervision land assault was frustrated when channel between two islands was found to be too deep to wade and american defenses prevented an amphibious landing naval bombardment had little effect due to sandy soil and spongy nature of fort s palmetto log construction careful fire by defenders wrought significant damage on british fleet which withdrew after an entire day s bombardment british withdrew their expedition force to new york and did not return to south carolina until 1780 background when american revolutionary war broke out in 1775 city of charlestown in province of south carolina was a center of commerce in southern north america city s citizens joined other colonists in opposing british parliament s attempts to tax them and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of april 1775 battles of lexington and concord stokely pp 8 9 throughout 1775 and into 1776 militia recruits arrived in city from colony s backcountry city s manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war material and defensive fortifications began to take shape around city stokely pp 9 13 british operations british army forces in north america were primarily tied up with siege of boston in 1775 seeking bases of operations where they had more control british planned an expedition to southern colonies major general henry clinton then in boston was to travel to cape fear north carolina where he would join with largely scottish loyalists raised in north carolina backcountry and a force of 2 000 men from ireland under command of major general charles cornwallis russell 2000 p 79 plan was beset by difficulties from start irish expedition originally supposed to depart at beginning of december 1775 was delayed by logistical difficulties and its 2 500 troops did not depart until february 13 1776 escorted by 11 warships under command of admiral sir peter parker wilson p 2000 p 85 clinton left boston on january 20 with two companies of light infantry and first stopped at new york city to confer with william tryon new york s royal governor russell 2002 pp 92 98 major general charles lee sent by major general george washington to see to defense of new york coincidentally arrived there same day as clinton russell 2002 p 90 new york was at that time extremely tense patriot forces were beginning to disarm and evict loyalists and british fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions despite this clinton made no secret that his final target was in south lee observed that this was certainly a droll way of proceeding to communicate his full plan to enemy is too novel to be credited russell 2002 p 98 this was not even first notice of expedition to colonists a letter intercepted in december had already provided intelligence that british were planning to go to south russell 2002 p 96 clinton arrived at cape fear on march 12 expecting to find european convoy already there he met with royal governors of north and south carolina josiah martin and william campbell and learned that recruited scottish loyalists had been defeated at moore s creek bridge two weeks earlier wilson p 36 clinton also received pleas for assistance from royal governor of georgia james wright who had been arrested and then escaped to a navy ship montgomery pp 54 55 parker s fleet had an extremely difficult crossing battered by storms and high seas first ships of fleet did not arrive at cape fear until april 18 and cornwallis did not arrive until may 3 after several weeks there in which british troops raided patriot properties clinton cornwallis and parker concluded that cape fear was not a suitable base for further operations ward p 670 parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down coast and reports on partially finished condition of charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that decision was made to go there russell 2002 p 160 american defenses upright right thumb colonel william moultrie john rutledge recently elected president of general assembly that remained as backbone of south carolina s revolutionary government organized a defense force under command of 46 year old colonel william moultrie a former militiaman and indian fighter russell 2000 p 2002 p 131 these forces comprised three infantry regiments two rifle regiments and a small artillery regiment they were augmented by three independent artillery companies and total force numbered about 2 000 ward p 672 these forces were further augmented by arrival of continental regiments from north carolina and virginia 1 900 troops as well as militia numbering 2 700 from charleston and surrounding backcountry moultrie saw sullivan s island a sandy spit of land at entrance to charleston harbor extending north about long and a few hundred yards wide russell 2002 p 87 as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect entrance from intruding enemy warships a large vessel sailing into charleston first had to cross charleston bar a series of submerged shoals lying about southeast of city and then pass by southern end of sullivan s island as it entered channel to inner harbor later it would also have to pass northern end of james island where fort johnson commanded southeastern approach to city wilson p 43 moultrie and his 2nd south carolina regiment arrived on sullivan s island in march 1776 and began construction of a fortress built out of palmetto logs to defend island and channel into charleston harbor russell 2002 p 123 construction moved slowly captain peter horry of patriot naval detachment described site as an immense pen 500 feet long and 16 feet wide filled with sand to stop shot stokely p 15 gun platforms were made of planks two inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes thumb left upright 0 5 general henry clinton congress had appointed general lee to command continental army troops in southern colonies and his movements by land shadowed those of clinton s fleet as it sailed south lee wrote from wilmington on june 1 that fleet had sailed but that he did not know whether it was sailing for virginia or south carolina he headed for charleston saying i confess i know not whether i shall go to or from enemy he arrived in charleston shortly after fleet anchored outside harbor and took command of city s defenses he immediately ran into a problem south carolina troops militia or colonial regiments were not on continental line and thus not formally under his authority some south carolina troops resisted his instructions and rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming lee in command of all south carolina forces ward p 673 square shaped fort sullivan consisted only of completed seaward wall with walls made from palmetto logs high and wide walls were filled with sand and rose above wooden platforms on which artillery were mounted a hastily erected palisade of thick planks helped guard powder magazine and unfinished northern walls an assortment of 31 cannon ranging from 9 and 12 pounders to a few british 18 pounders and french 26 pounders dotted front and rear walls russell 2000 p 88 general lee when he had seen its unfinished state had recommended abandoning fort calling it a slaughter pen president rutledge refused and specifically ordered colonel moultrie to obey lee in everything except in leaving fort sullivan russell 2002 p 199 moultrie s delaying tactics so angered lee that he decided on june 27 that he would replace moultrie battle began next day before he could do so wilson p 48 lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to haddrell s point british arrival british fleet weighed anchor at cape fear on may 31 and arrived outside charleston harbor next day russell 2002 pp 162 167 moultrie noticed a british scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby long island now known as isle of palms just a few hundred yards from sullivan s island troops were consequently sent to occupy northern end of sullivan s stokely pp 17 18 by june 8 most of british fleet had crossed bar and anchored in five fathom hole an anchorage between bar and harbor entrance russell 2002 pp 123 179 180 with fort on sullivan s island only half complete admiral parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls optimistically believing he would not even need clinton s land forces he wrote to clinton that after fort s guns were knocked out he would land seamen and marines which i have practiced for purpose under guns and that they could keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper upright right thumb admiral sir peter parker british fleet was composed of nine man of war ships flagship 50 gun bristol as well as 50 gun experiment and frigates actaeon active solebay sphinx and bomb vessel thunder in total mounting nearly 300 cannon army forces in expedition consisted of 15th 28th 33rd 37th 54th and 57th regiments of foot and part of 46th morrill p 2002 p 209 on june 7 clinton issued a proclamation calling on rebel colonists to lay down their arms however inexperienced defenders fired on boat sent to deliver it which was flying a truce flag and it was not delivered until next day that same day clinton began landing 2 200 troops on long island intent was that these troops would wade across channel now known as breach inlet between long and sullivan s which british believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so while fleet bombarded fort sullivan russell 2000 p 91 general lee responded to british landing with several actions he began reinforcing positions on mainland in case british were intending to launch an attack directly on charleston russell 2002 pp 184 185 he also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for fort s garrison but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge roughly one mile 1 6 km channel separating island from charleston unwillingness of moultrie and rutledge to support effort may also have played a role wilson p 45 americans also constructed an entrenchment at northern end of sullivan s island which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons russell 2000 p 2002 p 212 and began to fortify a guard post at haddrell s point on mainland opposite fort sullivan russell 2002 p 187 general clinton encountered first major problem of attack plan on june 17 an attempt to wade channel between two islands established that part of channel was at least shoulder deep too deep for troops to cross even without prospect of enemy opposition morrill p 22 he considered using boats to ferry troops across but americans with timely advice from general lee adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or long island position wilson p 46 as a result british and american forces faced each other across channel engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have glory of being defeated alone attack was originally planned for june 24 but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off for several days wilson p 47 battle thumb an exact plan of charles town bar and harbour from an actual survey with attack of fort sullivan on 28th of june 1776 by his majesty s squadron commanded by sir peter parker on morning of june 28 fort sullivan was defended by colonel moultrie commanding 2nd south carolina regiment and a company of 4th south carolina artillery numbering 435 men at around 9 00 that morning a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for attack russell 2002 p 204 less than an hour later nine warships had sailed into positions facing fort thunder and friendship anchored about from fort while parker took active bristol experiment and solebay to a closer position about from sullivan s island where they anchored facing broadside to fort each of these ships began to fire upon fort when it reached its position and defenders returned fire ward p 674 although many of thunder shots landed in or near fort they had little effect according to moultrie we had a morass in middle that swallowed them up instantly and those that fell in sand in and about fort were immediately buried wilson p 49 thunder role in action was also relatively short lived she had anchored too far away from fort and overloading of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts owing to shortage of gunpowder moultrie s men were deliberate in pace of their gunfire and only a few officers actually aimed cannons they also fired in small volleys four cannon at a time one british observer wrote their fire was surprisingly well served and it was slow but decisive indeed they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed 300px thumb left a british engineer s map made following engagement general clinton began movements to cross over to northern end of sullivan s island assisted by two sloops of war flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under fire from colonel william thomson s defenses facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire clinton abandoned attempt russell 2002 pp 212 213 around noon frigates sphinx syren and actaeon were sent on a roundabout route avoiding some shoals to take a position from which they could enfilade fort s main firing platform and also cover one of main escape routes from fort however all three ships grounded on an uncharted sandbar and riggings of actaeon and sphinx became entangled in process russell 2002 p 209 british managed to refloat sphinx and syren but acteon remained grounded having moved too far onto submerged sandbar consequently none of these ships reached its intended position a piece of good fortune not lost on colonel moultrie had these three ships effected their purpose they would have enfiladed us in such a manner as to have driven us from our guns at fort moultrie ordered his men to concentrate their fire on two large man of war ships bristol and experiment which took hit after hit from fort s guns chain shot fired at bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both main and mizzenmasts russell 2002 p 222 one round hit her quarterdeck slightly wounding parker in knee and thigh shot also tore off part of his britches leaving his backside exposed wilson p 50 by mid afternoon defenders were running out of gunpowder and their fire was briefly suspended however lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from mainland and defenders resumed firing at british ships russell 2002 p 215 lee even briefly visited fort late in day telling colonel moultrie i see you are doing very well here you have no occasion for me i will go up to town again wilson p 51 admiral parker eventually sought to destroy fort s walls with persistent broadside cannonades this strategy failed due to spongy nature of palmetto wood used in its constructions structure would quiver and it absorbed cannonballs rather than splintering russell 2002 p 217 exchange continued until around 9 00 pm when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities and fleet finally withdrew out of range wilson p 52 thumb right depiction of battle by john blake white 1826 at one point during battle flag moultrie had designed and raised over fort was shot down sergeant william jasper reportedly ran to battlement and raised flag again holding it up and rallying troops until a flag stand could be provided he was credited by moultrie with reviving troops spirits and later given commendations for bravery a painting of this event pictured above depicts jasper s actions counting casualties parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard bristol which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to hull yards and rigging experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded active and solebay reported 15 casualties each morrill p 25 americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded russell 2002 p 220 following morning british unable to drag grounded acteon off sandbar set fire to ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands russell 2002 p 223 patriots in small boats sailed out to burning ship fired some of its cannons at british ships took what stores and loot they could and retreated shortly before ship s powder magazine exploded aftermath right thumb fort moultrie looking into charleston harbor during american civil war british did not attempt to take fort again within days of battle charlestonians learned of signing of declaration of independence in philadelphia wilson p 55 british troops were reembarked on their transports and on july 21 british fleet withdrew northward to help main british army in its campaign against new york city to add insult to injury one of british transports grounded off long island and was captured by patriot forces wilson p 54 british did not return to charleston until 1780 when general clinton successfully besieged city and captured an entire army until south again became a focus of war in late 1778 its states provided military supplies to northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund war effort wilson p 56 admiral parker and general clinton engaged in a war of words after battle each seeking to cast blame on other for expedition s failures although clinton was not blamed by government popular opinion held him responsible and parker was lauded for his personal bravery legacy right thumb 210px monument on sullivans island fort sullivan was renamed fort moultrie shortly after battle to honor colonel william moultrie for his successful defense of fort
