kepler 40b formerly known as koi is a hot jupiter discovered in orbit around star kepler 40 which is about to become a red giant planet was first noted as a transit event by nasa s kepler spacecraft kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available including data on kepler 40 french and swiss astronomers used equivalent to one night of measurements on sophie echelle spectrograph to collect all data needed to show that a planet was producing periodic dimming of kepler 40 planet kepler 40b is twice mass of jupiter and slightly larger than it in size making it as dense as neptune planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than mercury is from sun observational history kepler 40 was first observed by kepler spacecraft a nasa satellite that searches for planets in transit crossing in front of and dimming their host stars from may 13 2009 to june 15 2009 in its first days of operation resulting light curve was made available to public by kepler science team revealing four transit events over 33 5 days a team composed of astronomers from france and switzerland used sophie echelle spectrograph at haute provence observatory in southern france to examine kepler 40 sophie uses radial velocity measurements to examine stars for exoplanets after background light was removed and alternative causes for radial velocity variations were disproved for example that kepler 40 was actually a close binary star team used sophie to analyze properties of actual star astronomers observing star found that it is nearing main sequence turn off star fuses last of its hydrogen and becomes a red giant establishment of stellar parameters helped astronomers extrapolate exoplanet s parameters and prove existence of kepler 40b discovered planet was sixth transiting planet to have been discovered in orbit around stars with a radius of more than 1 8 times that of sun after planets including kepler 5 and kepler 7 discovery of kepler 40b demonstrated that smaller telescopes such as sophie are effective when used as follow ups to space missions like kepler team of astronomers spent what amounted roughly to one night on a 1 meter telescope and gathered all data needed to establish kepler 40b s existence and parameters kepler 40b was published in journal astronomy and astrophysics on january 4 2011 after it was sent to journal on september 15 2010 host star kepler 40 is an f type star located in cygnus constellation star is 1 48 times mass of sun and 2 13 times its radius with an effective temperature of k kepler 40 is larger more massive more diffuse and hotter than sun is metallicity of kepler 40 fe h 0 10 means that it has 25 9 more iron than is measured in sun kepler 40 is nearing main sequence turn off in other words it is about to fuse last of its hydrogen and become a red giant kepler 40 hosts sixth planetary system to be discovered in orbit of a star with a mass of over 1 8 solar masses it lies approximately 2500 parsecs 8100 light years away from earth characteristics kepler 40b is a hot jupiter that is estimated to be 2 2 times mass of jupiter over 700 times mass of earth but 1 17 times jupiter s radius 13 12 times radius of earth thus planet has a density of 1 68 grams per cubic centimeter similar to that of neptune 1 638 g cm3 planet s equilibrium temperature is estimated to be 1620 k thirteen times hotter than jupiter s equilibrium temperature kepler 40b orbits its star every 6 87 days at an average distance of 0 081 au it also has an orbital inclination of 89 7deg meaning that it can be seen nearly edge on with respect to earth in comparison mercury orbits sun every 87 97 days at an average distance of 0 387 au therefore kepler 40b s orbit is approximately thirteen times faster than that of mercury s and five times closer to its host star than mercury is to sun references category hot jupiters category cygnus constellation category transiting exoplanets category exoplanets discovered in 2010 category giant planets 40b
