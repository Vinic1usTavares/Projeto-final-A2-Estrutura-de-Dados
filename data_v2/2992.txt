miniopterus zapfei is a fossil bat in genus miniopterus from middle miocene of france first described in 2002 it is known only from site of la grive m where it occurs with another fossil miniopterus species smaller and more common miniopterus fossilis m zapfei is known from five mandibles lower jaws and an isolated fourth upper premolar p4 fourth lower premolar is more slender than in m fossilis and cingulum shelf surrounding p4 is less well developed than in living miniopterus length of first lower molar is 1 57 to 1 60 mm taxonomy miniopterus zapfei was described by pierre mein and leonard ginsburg in a 2002 paper on ages and faunas of fossil sites of la grive saint alban in southeastern france mein and ginsburg 2002 p 23 mein and ginsburg wrote that it was second fossil miniopterus species to be described after miniopterus fossilis from slovakia but did not mention miniopterus from pliocene of poland or miniopterus tao from pleistocene of china mein and ginsburg 2002 p 24 ziegler 2003 p 485 another fossil species miniopterus rummeli was described from miocene of germany in 2003 ziegler 2003 p 484 specific name zapfei honors helmuth who described m fossilis miniopterus also includes about 20 living species of small insectivorous bats distributed in southern eurasia africa and australia although genus was historically placed in family it is now classified in its own family miniopteridae miller butterworth et al 2007 p 1553 description known material of miniopterus zapfei includes a mandible lower jaw with fourth premolar p4 first molar m1 and second molar m2 a mandible with m1 a mandible with m1 and m2 a mandible with m2 and third molar m3 a mandible without any teeth and an isolated fourth upper premolar p4 some of mandibles also preserve alveoli openings for teeth that have not been preserved dimensions of p4 length and width are 1 03 x 0 88 mm m1 is 1 57 to 1 60 x 1 01 to 1 07 mm m2 is 1 51 to 1 64 x 0 95 to 1 05 mm single m3 is 1 41 mm long and single p4 is 1 38 x 1 52 mm mein and ginsburg 2002 pp 23 24 in a well preserved mandible length from alveolus for first incisor to end of m3 is 8 80 mm and depth of mandible at m1 is 1 50 mm miniopterus zapfei can be identified as a miniopterus on basis of possession of three lower premolars designated p2 p3 and p4 because original first premolar has been lost a two rooted p3 and molars with posterolophid a crest at back of molar behind entoconid cusp m zapfei is about 30 larger than m fossilis and has a more slender p4 compared to living miniopterus cingulum shelf that surrounds p4 is less well developed and parastyle crest is weaker range and ecology miniopterus zapfei is known only from site la grive m in village of saint alban de roche department of isere southeastern france mein and ginsburg 2002 pp 7 24 la grive m is one of several fissure filling sites in area collectively known as la grive saint alban which have yielded rich fossil faunas mein and ginsburg 2002 pp 7 8 la grive m is reference locality for mn zone mn 7 8 about 13 to 11 million years ago steininger 1999 fig 1 2 la grive m is one of older sites of la grive and mein and ginsburg proposed taking it as reference locality for a separate zone mn 7 mein and ginsburg 2002 p 37 m zapfei is rare in la grive m miniopterus fossilis is much more common in same site and has also been found in la grive l7 and other european localities ranging from mn 6 to mn 13 mein and ginsburg 2002 p 24 references literature cited mein p and ginsburg l 2002 sur l age relatif des differents karstiques miocenes de la grive saint alban isere cahiers scientifiques museum d histoire naturelle lyon 2 7 47 miller butterworth c murphy w o brien s jacobs d springer m and e 2007 a family matter conclusive resolution of taxonomic position of long fingered bats miniopterus molecular biology and evolution 24 7 1553 1561 steininger f 1999 chronostratigraphy geochronology and biochronology of miocene european land mammal mega zones elmmz and miocene mammal zones mn zones pp 9 24 in rossner g e and heissig k eds miocene land mammals of europe munich verlag dr friedrich pfeil 515 pp ziegler r 2003 bats chiroptera mammalia from middle miocene karstic fissure fillings of petersbuch near eichstatt southern franconian alb bavaria subscription required geobios 36 4 447 490 category miniopteridae category miocene bats category prehistoric mammals of europe
