original instalments were directed by lawrence gordon clark and films were all shot on 16 mm colour film remit behind series was to provide a television adaptation of a classic ghost story in line

known british actors such as clive swift robert hardy peter vaughan edward petherbridge and denholm elliott first five are adaptations of ghost stories by m r james sixth is based on a short story by

this did not appear on screen until signalman an earlier black and white adaptation of m r james s whistle and i ll come to you directed by jonathan miller and shown as part of series omnibus in 1968

are adaptations of stories from four books by m r james published between 1904 and 1925 ghost stories of james an english mediaeval scholar and provost of eton college and king s college cambridge were originally narrated as christmas entertainments to friends and selected students pfaff richard w montague rhodes james oxford dictionary of national biography online edition oxford university press september 2004 retrieved 2010 08 15 sixth film signalman is an adaptation of a story by charles dickens published in his magazine all year round in 1866 in its original context it was one of eight stories set around fictional junction and its branch lines it was inspired by staplehurst rail crash of june 1865 which dickens himself survived having attended to dying fellow passengers he subsequently suffered panic disorders and flashbacks as a result final two stories were based on original screenplays one by clive exton who was an experienced television screenwriter and other by john bowen who was primarily known as a novelist and playwright but also had extensive television experience including adapting treasure of abbot thomas earlier in series adaptation in an interview in 1995 lawrence gordon clark stated that stories focus on suggestion aim they say is to chill rather than shock partly because television is not best suited to carrying off big screen pyrotechnics but mainly because they want to keep faith with notion of a ghost story in its literary rather than cinematic tradition wheatley 51 helen wheatley notes that best adaptations maintain stories sense of decorum and restraint withholding full revelation of supernatural until very last moment and centring on suggestion of a ghostly presence rather than horror of visceral excess and abjection wheatley 55 after first two adaptations both done by clark tales were adapted by a number of playwrights and screenwriters in most instances adaptations alter original source material for example a warning to curious frequently deviates from its literary source screenplay avoids convoluted plot structure of m r james s original opting for a more linear construction and reducing number of narrators in addition central character paxton is changed from a young fair haired innocent who stumbles across treasure to a middle aged character driven by poverty to seek treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing to take another example in his screenplay for signalman andrew davies adds scenes of traveller s nightmare plagued nights at an inn and reinforces ambiguity of traveller narrator by restructuring ending and matching his facial features with those of spectre film also makes use of visual and aural devices for example appearance of spectre is stressed by vibrations of a bell in signalbox and a recurring red motif connects signalman s memories of a train crash with danger light attended by a ghostly figure filming lawrence gordon clark had made his name as a bbc documentary director during 1960s stalls of barchester was first dramatic production he directed rigby jonathan traces of uneasiness lawrence gordon clark and stalls of barchester in m r james collection bfi 2012 clark recalled in an interview for bfi s dvd release in 2012 that bbc at that time gave you space to fail and generously so too they backed you up with marvellous technicians art departments film departments and so forth gordon clark lawrence interview for i was itching to move into drama and knew i had exactly source material i wanted i d discovered m r james at boarding school and loved him so i met with paul fox who was at time controller of bbc1 i brought a copy of m r james s ghost stories with me with a bookmark stuck in stalls of barchester cathedral fact that period drama always has been very popular at bbc probably helped clark recalls that paul fox gave us a tiny budget and we set out to do a full blooded drama on location budgets were really tiny and we shot for ten days and brought film in for about 8 000 pounds unusually for a bbc television drama of 1970s each instalment was filmed entirely on location using 16 mm film as a result cameraman john mcglashan who filmed first five adaptations was able to make use of night shoots and dark shadowy interiors which would not have been possible with then standard video based studio interiors kerekes 15 filming of adaptations took place at a variety of locations although east anglia where m r james set many of his stories was location for early instalments stalls of barchester was filmed at norwich cathedral and in surrounding close a warning to curious was filmed on coast of north norfolk at happisburgh and wells next sea although original story was set in a disguised version of aldeburgh suffolk later

scolding elliot levey critical reception critical reception of films has been varied but several are regarded as classic television ghost stories sarah dempster writing in guardian in 2005 noted that perhaps most surprising aspect is how little its adaptations have dated they may boast odd signifier of cheap 1970s telly outlandish regional vowels inappropriate eyeliner a surfeit of depressed oboes but lurking within their hushed cloisters and glum expanses of deserted coastline is a timelessness at odds with virtually everything written or broadcast before or since dempster sarah ghosts in machine guardian 17 december 2005 production values have received particular praise helen wheatley writes that series was shot on film on location with much attention paid to minutiae of period detail it might be seen to visually prefigure filmic stylishness and traditions of later literary adaptations such as brideshead revisited and jewel in crown however she notes that unlike those adaptations sinister tone of period pieces could lend itself label of a feel bad heritage television drama wheatley 49 signalman is perhaps most critically acclaimed simon farquhar suggests that film is first evidence of andrew davies s gift as an adaptor of literary fiction despite an extremely arduous shoot davies and clarke s fog wreathed flame crackling masterpiece manages something production team could never have imagined it s better than book dave rolinson notes that while adaptation inevitably misses dickens s nuanced and often unsettling prose it achieves comparably skilful effects through visual language and sound heightening theme and supernatural mood production heightens story s crucial features of repetition and foreshadowing sergio angelini writes about a warning to curious of clark s many adaptations of james s stories this is perhaps most varied in its use of landscape and most visually arresting in its attempt to create an otherworldly atmosphere using long lenses to flatten scenery and make ghost indistinct in background john mcglashan s fine cinematography brilliantly conveys ageless ritualistic determinism of ager s pursuit and signposts inevitability of paxton s demise angelini is less appreciative of ash tree noting that literal adaptation of story s ending loses atmosphere of earlier instalments while creatures are certainly grotesque and threatening compared with some of other adaptations of series ash tree does lose some power through this lack of ambiguity result overall remains satisfyingly unsettling however thanks also to petherbridge s restrained psychologically acute performance adaptations have had an influence on work of writer mark gatiss interviewed in 2008 gatiss said that lost hearts is his favourite adaptation because it is one that frightened him as a child and that i absolutely love treasure of abbot thomas moment when michael bryant has found treasure and is obviously losing his wits he just says rationally it is a thing of slime i think darkness and slime there s also fantastic scene where he thinks he s got away with it by putting treasure back doctor is heading up drive and he can t quite see him in sunlight then it pauses to that amazing crane shot very spooky reception of two later instalments stigma and ice house was decidedly critical most reviewers concluded that switching to original stories instead of adaptations was misjudged david kerekes writes that ice house is almost totally forgotten kerekes 10 wheatley has commented that they heralded a divergence from stage inspired horror of 1940s and 1950s to a more modern gothic horror based in present day losing in process aesthetic of restraint evident in original adaptations bbc four revival beginning in 2005 with a view from a hill was greeted warmly by sarah dempster who stated that programme was in every respect a vintage ghost story for christmas production there are powdery academics hamstrung by extreme social awkwardness there is bumbling protagonist bemused by a particular aspect of modern life there are stunning panoramic shots of a specific area of british landscape here a heavily autumnal suffolk there is determined lack of celebrity pizzazz there is tweed and there is crucially a single moment of heart stopping corner of eye horror that suggests life for one powdery academic at least will never be same again
