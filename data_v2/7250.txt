organized militia units under colonel richard caswell and sent this force south to meet up with moore s regiment of regulars and several other units of militia a force of approximately 1 400 highland scots denizens of north carolina who remained loyal to britain was organized shortly after outbreak of hostilities in 1775 this force concentrated around loyalist hotbed of cross creek near modern day fayetteville alarmed patriot government who dispatched moore and caswell to contain growing army british army and royal navy in cooperation with loyalist elements of colonial government under governor josiah martin planned an invasion of north carolina near wilmington a burgeoning and strategically located seaport in cape fear region highlander units at cross creek were directed to join up with british army units which general thomas gage intended to land in north carolina moore led his command upriver along south bank of cape fear and fortified a river crossing at rockfish creek which would have been loyalists most direct path to wilmington at this site moore continued to gather reinforcements eventually commanding approximately 1 100 men brigadier general donald macdonald who commanded militia of approximately 1 500 highlanders sent an envoy to moore demanding that he join loyalist cause or be faced with an attack moore delaying in his reply to buy time eventually declined that demand essentially calling macdonald s bluff macdonald whose men lacked morale for an immediate confrontation received word that caswell s militia had been ordered to join with moore sensing that time was of essence macdonald withdrew and led loyalist contingent away from moore toward a crossing further downriver moore next set about devising a trap for macdonald s loyalist contingent he positioned a detachment of men at cross creek and ordered regiments of colonels caswell and alexander lillington to a location downriver in path of loyalist militia loyalist force managed to slip past caswell at which point moore ordered caswell to join up with lillington at a location known as moore s creek bridge simultaneously with caswell s corrective maneuver moore floated his troops downriver where they disembarked and joined in pursuit of macdonald s force in battle of moore s creek bridge loyalists attempted to cross over creek in early morning hours of february 27 1776 where they were met with fierce resistance from caswell and lillington s united forces patriots routed loyalists in less than three minutes inflicting severe casualties on macdonald s men and capturing 850 loyalist soldiers and officers while themselves suffering only a single casualty moore did not participate directly in battle but arrived shortly after it was decided and pursued remaining loyalist units moore s creek bridge stopped british plan for conquest of north carolina and was celebrated by patriots throughout colonies british press of time downplayed victory as a defeat of loyalist forces rather than of regular british army units on march 4 1776 provincial congress in new bern passed a resolution thanking moore for his service in suppressing loyalists continental army general thumb right general sir

only five north carolinians to achieve rank of brigadier general or higher in continental army as a brigadier he served under general charles lee commander of army s southern department and was tasked with guarding wilmington from attacks by british ships lurking in cape fear area after battle of moore s creek bridge in that capacity moore alternately harassed and observed british and their loyalist auxiliaries while simultaneously improving wilmington s defenses by erecting two new coastal batteries and by sinking ships in main channel of cape fear river south of city to bar passage by larger vessels in april and may 1776 some british units from approximately 7 000 strong force of general henry clinton disembarked near wilmington and threatened to confront moore s garrison of 1 847 men clinton soon decided that north carolina was not an ideal objective and majority of british fleet and army made its way south to charleston on may 30 1776 after near engagement at wilmington moore devised a plan by which provincial congress raised five additional companies of men to defend north carolina s coast he saw this as necessary because continental army units in north carolina could be ordered out of state which would have left north carolina relatively defenseless lee was recalled to north to aid in defense of new york in september 1776 and moore was placed in command of southern department initially continental congress ordered moore to join general george washington in north but owing to continued threat of a british attack in north or south carolina congress suspended moore s orders and gave north carolina s provincial council discretion over his disposition on october 23 1776 council ordered moore to remain in north carolina and winter his troops in new bern and wilmington this order was confirmed by continental congress on november 16 along with instructions for moore to assist in repelling any invasion attempts in south carolina or georgia if necessary moore then led his command of about 2 035 men south to charleston south carolina in november to assist patriot forces there after attempted british assault at sullivan s island moore s brigade arrived in january but moore spent most of his time traveling between charleston and north carolina lobbying for funds and clothing for his poorly equipped soldiers and recruiting more men he went so far as to obtain a private loan from thomas polk a planter in mecklenburg county for 6 250 in south carolina currency to pay for rations for his command moore s unit engaged in daily drills under his supervision and that of colonel francis nash despite these efforts north carolinians suffered from rampant colds and pneumonia and many of enlisted men deserted to join south carolina line because of high bounty being offered by that state for service in february 1777 continental congress commanded moore to bring north carolina s continental army troops north to aid washington but a lack of supplies and provisions stalled that plan moore himself had returned to north carolina on january 8 1777 in an attempt to alleviate poor conditions in which his soldiers found themselves and to raise funds to pay his men leaving southern department under command of brigadier general robert howe howe countermanded moore s instructions to bring continental army units north by refusing to permit north carolina brigade to leave charleston out of fear of a british attack in south because of moore s failing health francis nash was promoted to brigadier general and assumed command of brigade on its march north death and legacy while preparing to march north in early 1777 moore became ill he died of what was called a fit of gout in his stomach on about april 15 1777 n b that other sources

in correspondence as early as april 19 see april 15 is most frequently given date and conforms with recollection of james walker who was moore s executor that he died in april see oral tradition holds that moore died on same day and in same house as his brother maurice anne moore s wife died a few months thereafter moore who had not been directly involved in any military engagement during revolutionary war was nonetheless able to construct a working military force out of disparate parts provided for him by north carolina samuel a court ashe an early north carolina historian described moore as perhaps most masterful military man furnished by north carolina to war of independence another historian speculated that moore s actions had held promise of greatness moore s strategic command before and during battle of moore s creek bridge has been acclaimed as a major factor in patriot victory there wake forest north carolina chapter of daughters of american revolution and a u s
