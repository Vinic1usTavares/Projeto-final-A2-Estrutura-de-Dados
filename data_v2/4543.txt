it turned out first time i heard track i immediately knew it would be a huge hit track was mixed in september 2008 at ferraro s super sonic scale studio near paris day after her birthday before working on song s individual elements ferraro converted recording sessions from a generic digital audio workstation system to her programme of choice pro tools following this she decided that she would focus primarily on rowland s vocals ferraro told sound on sound that she did add a bass drum sample as she felt that kick was missing something rather than equalise it i added a little bit of my sample to make bd track sound bigger however she did alter two piano elements of song using flex studio tool to widen sound of piano element without delay additionally ferraro used a number of french plug in software to amplify many of track s instruments including violin strings and guitar samples she then moved on to rowland s vocals which were extensively processed including equalization and de then upon completion of her work on song ferraro sent when love takes over to her husband bruno gruel and his elektra mastering suite which is located in same building as super sonic scale studio gruel received song in a standard pro tools format 24 bit 44 1 khz he used several pieces of software to realign all of elements of song particularly bass drums and low synths composition when love

song back to guetta who added his own contributions with frederic riesterer rowland uses a vocal range of f3 to d5 guetta said that kelly s vocals had this whitney houston vibe and nailed it critics

of kelly rowland for one grand uplifting floor filler simon vozick levinson of entertainment weekly agreed calling song most memorable from album and recalling clocks by coldplay to make a showstopper starring kelly rowland michael of musicomh was impressed with both production and vocal work on when love takes over he pointed out rarity in amount of promotion given to song referring to when love takes over being given its own poster on tube he also described song as a euphoric masterpiece backed by at least eight remixes and accompany vocals from destiny s child songbird kelly rowland on hand for a diva masterclass also agreeing with these comments was fraser mcalpine from bbc online who awarded song four out of five stars genius ingredients include a thinly reworked go at piano riff to clocks by coldplay and handclaps and fairy dust is well it s your standard dance pop production actually however he noted that production was tastefully done to make sure that good bits are not spoilt other elements of song such as bed of a skippy beat a breakdown some riffing glassy electronics and a dramatic cinematic bottom end drone were praised mcalpine also praised rowland s appearance on track commenting who she sounded entirely unlike herself so that even she is all buffed up and shiny he described marriage of rowland s vocals and guetta s production by stating that rowland s got a spiralling sky scraping melody to sing too erin martin of popmatters said that when love takes over had euphoric properties martin said song was a classic triumphant dance number and rowland s powerhouse vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come this song just feels good to listen to she also noted that song was central to concept and love spreading message that guetta delivers on album as a whole david balls of digital spy agreed with song s anthem credentials it is further evidence that rowland may no longer be resigned to living in beyonce knowles shadow fusing classic dance beats with a heady emotionally charged vocal it s a world away from mid tempo r b numbers with which she started her solo career in fact this packs a punch from very first listen meaning it could well become one of summer anthems of 2009 however mikael wood of los angeles times was less impressed than other critics simply noting song as a cheesy synthpop makeover of coldplay s clocks wood did however state that it was among guetta s best work and was an example of when dj is most commercial song was nominated for best dance recording award at 52nd grammy awards ceremony it
