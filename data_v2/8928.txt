of him thought that there was no real comparison between two of them i am far too twisted and fantastic a novelist ever to succeed in catching trollope s marvellous normality priestley was less impressed by supposed trollopian side of walpole s work finding some of it formulaic he was more taken with a darker side that he found in writing suddenly it will transform pleasant easy scene he is giving us into transparency behind which are bright stars and red hellfire no matter how jolly and zestful he may appear to be fact remains that he possesses an unusually sharp sense of evil possibly most pervasive influence on walpole was walter scott whose romanticism is reflected in much of later writer s fiction such was walpole s love of scott that he liked to think of himself as latter s

grow inevitably out of those very details joseph conrad said of him we see mr walpole grappling with truth of things spiritual and material with his characteristic earnestness and we can discern characteristics of this acute and sympathetic explorer of human nature in 1928 priestley observed priestley contended that walpole had fulfilled his early potential unlike compton mackenzie gilbert
