hard not to go in a jazz direction while most musical compositions rely on tension and release which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses gradual buildup subtle tension within verses or over course of bridge or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation d angelo s arrangements for voodoo subdivide tension into each of songs moments according to music critic steve mcpherson concept results in no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back can t be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way
