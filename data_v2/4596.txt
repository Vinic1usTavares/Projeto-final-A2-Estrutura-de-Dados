1930 atlantic hurricane season was second least active atlantic hurricane season on record behind only 1914 with only three systems reaching tropical storm intensity of those three two reached hurricane status both of which also became major hurricanes category 3 or higher storms on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale first system developed in central atlantic ocean on august 21 later that month a second storm dominican republic hurricane formed on august 29 it peaked as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph 250 km h third and final storm dissipated on october 21 due to lack of systems that developed only one tropical cyclone second hurricane managed to make landfall during season it severely impacted areas of greater antilles particularly dominican republic before making subsequent landfalls on cuba and u s states of florida and north carolina with less severe effects estimated 2 000 to 8 000 deaths caused by storm in dominican republic alone ranked it as one of deadliest atlantic hurricanes in recorded history no other storms affected any landmasses during year although first storm damaged a cruise ship in open waters season s inactivity was reflected in its low accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 50 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems hurricane one first hurricane of season was first noted in central atlantic ocean on august 21 slowly intensifying system initially moved towards west on august 22 a steamship in vicinity was sustained some structural damage after attaining hurricane strength on august 24 system turned northwestward and reached category 3 intensity on august 25 with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h as it grazed bermuda recurving to northeast a french cruise liner encountered hurricane while it was a category 2 hurricane a large wave struck ship shattering glass on vessel and injuring 40 passengers although still a category 2 hurricane system became extratropical shortly after on august 28 extratropical storm was tracked due east towards azores for a few days while gradually weakening before abruptly turning to north and dissipating hurricane two dominican republic hurricane of 1930 a tropical depression developed well east of lesser antilles on august 29 initially drifting westward storm gradually intensified and became a tropical storm early next day by august 31 system strengthened into a category 1 hurricane next day hurricane entered caribbean sea passing island of dominica as a category 2 hurricane continuing to intensify storm further intensified into a category 3 hurricane on september 2 and then to a category 4 following day around 18 00 utc on september 3 hurricane peaked with winds of 155 mph 250 km h observed by a ship simultaneously storm made landfall near santo domingo dominican republic mountainous terrain of hispaniola rapidly weakened system to a tropical storm early on september 4 moving westward over caribbean sea storm failed to re strengthen before making landfall in western cuba with winds of 40 mph 65 km h around midday on september 6 thereafter system entered gulf of mexico and curved northeastward at 09 00 utc on september 9 storm again made landfall near bradenton florida with winds of 45 mph 75 km h later that day storm weakened to a tropical depression while crossing florida upon emerging into atlantic ocean on next day system re intensified into a tropical storm while located offshore south carolina storm re attained hurricane status early on september 12 hurricane then brushed outer banks of north carolina before heading out to sea storm further strengthened to category 2 intensity heading eastward but weakened to a tropical storm early on september 16 following day storm deteriorated further to a tropical depression and late on september 17 depression dissipated southwest of azores while crossing lesser antilles hurricane brought powerful winds and heavy rainfall to islands on dominica crops suffered severe damage all vessels at harbor sank killing two people winds on puerto rico left mostly minor damage to plantations and rainfall was generally beneficial in dominican republic three districts of santo domingo were destroyed with half of city leveled by hurricane damages in city were an estimated 50 million 1930 usd red cross estimated 2 000 people perished in city with an additional 8 000 injured however actual death toll may never be known and historians estimate hurricane left between 2 000 and 8 000 fatalities haiti experienced crop damage due to storm in florida damaging rainfall was observed over southeastern hillsborough county with measured press reports indicated damage to highways and bridges and crops were inundated damage reached approximately 75 000 after passing outer banks of north carolina as re intensifying hurricane power outages occurred across region buildings at cape lookout were severely damaged tropical storm three final storm of season developed in bay of campeche on october 18 at tail end of a frontal boundary although cool air advection was occurring off united states coast warm air around system allowed tropical storm to intensify moving to northeast system reached peak intensity as a high end tropical storm with winds of ultimately cool air advection eventually took a toll on storm causing it to quickly weaken by 06 00 utc on october 21 storm dissipated see also list of tropical cyclones list of atlantic hurricane seasons references external links monthly
