and pleasantville passed through center of kykuit estate of rockefeller family and was designed to handle 1 900 cars per day actual volume of traffic on roadway was much higher as actual average annual daily traffic reached upwards of 5 000 vehicles per day as a result rockefeller family looked into having route realigned as early as 1932 family suggested that a new highway be built along northern end of estate in 1965 rockefeller unveiled plans for potantico expressway a connector from to be constructed hudson river expressway ny 9a to taconic state parkway some opposition to idea arose on grounds that new highway would only benefit rockefeller estate and not residents nonetheless construction began on potantico expressway now known as phelps way in 1969 when highway was

completed in 1978 at which time new york state department of transportation nysdot concluded that traffic would never become heavy enough along ny 117 to bring about a need for a bypass however state continued to keep abreast of situation and eventually performed a second study in 1983 unlike first study this one found traffic along highway to be on rise as a result state began making plans to construct a bypass that would divert truck traffic away from katonah over next three years nysdot proposed a total of nine different routings for bypass route selected by town of bedford would begin at harris road and head north and east to saw mill parkway which it would merge into an exception would then be made to allow commercial traffic on parkway between katonah bypass and i 684 routing of highway projected to cost 8 7 million equivalent to in was approved in november 1987 in october 1990 nysdot accepted a low bid of 8 5 million equivalent to in for project clearing way for construction to begin on bypass by following month katonah bypass opened and became part of a realigned ny 117 portion of bedford road from harris road to ny 35 is now maintained by town of bedford major
