half sister to other ships of class ship spent her career with channel squadron and occasionally served as a flagship northumberland was placed in reserve in 1890 and became a training ship in 1898 she was converted into a coal hulk in 1909 and sold in 1927 although ship was not scrapped until 1935 design and description minotaur class armoured frigatesironclad is all encompassing term for armoured warships of this period armoured frigates were basically designed for same role as traditional wooden frigates but this later changed as size and expense of these ships forced them to be used in line of battle were essentially enlarged versions of ironclad with heavier armament armour and more powerful engines they retained broadside ironclad layout of their predecessor but their sides were fully armoured to protect 50 guns they were designed to carry their plough shaped ram was also more prominent than that of achilles parkes pp 60 61 northumberland was long between perpendiculars and had a beam of and a draught of ship displaced and had a tonnage of 6 621 tons burthen ballard p 241 her hull was subdivided by 15 watertight transverse bulkheads and had a double bottom underneath engine and boiler rooms ship was considered a steady gun platform able to maintain her speed in a seaway and satisfactory in manoeuvre parkes pp 60 67 she was authorized a crew of 705 officers and enlisted men but actually carried 800 men propulsion thumb left model of her engines northumberland had a two cylinder trunk steam engine made by john penn and sons driving a single propeller using steam provided by 10 rectangular fire tube boilers it produced a total of during ship s sea trials on 15 september 1868 and northumberland had a maximum speed of ballard pp 28 246 47 ships normally carried of coal but had a maximum capacity of parkes p 64 enough to steam at silverstone p 157 originally designed with three masts northumberland was fitted with five masts until her 1875 79 refit when two were removed and she was re rigged as a barque parkes p 66 northumberland only made under sail parkes p 63 mainly because ship s propeller could only be disconnected and not hoisted up into stern of ship to reduce drag worst speed of any ironclad of her era ballard p 38 admiral george a ballard described minotaur class ships as dullest performers under canvas of whole masted fleet of their day and no ships ever carried so much dress to so little purpose ballard p 26 armament thumb left northumberlands gun deck showing her eight inch guns unlike her half sisters northumberland was

3 pounder hotchkiss guns and six machine guns were later added chesneau kolesnik p 10 armour unlike her half sisters entire side of northumberlands hull was not covered with wrought iron armour to compensate for additional weight of her armament only her battery was protected above main deck ship was fitted with a complete waterline armour belt that tapered from at ends to amidships armour extended below waterline sides of battery were long and it was protected by 5 5 inch armour on all sides including transverse bulkheads fore and aft of guns two forward chase guns on upper deck were also protected by armoured bulkheads but stern chase guns on that same deck were entirely unprotected armour was backed by of teak ship also had a conning tower protected by 4 5 inch armour plates

its shipyard in millwall london she was altered while on building slip after sir edward reed succeeded isaac watts as chief constructor unlike her half sisters ship spent five years on stocks before she was ready to be launched partially due to frequent changes in design although northumberland was much closer to completion additional weight caused her stick for an hour on slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air threatening to buckle ship efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into water on next spring tide failed but use of pontoons on 17 april 1866 proved successful her builders went into bankruptcy while ship was being launched and seized northumberland as a company asset once she was in water eight months passed before admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out ship she was commissioned in october 1868 and completed on 8 october for a cost a total of ps444 256 ballard pp 39 240 parkes pp 64 65 thumb left

she could be visually distinguished from her half sisters whose yards were white during this time she helped her half sister tow a floating drydock from england to madeira where it would be picked up by and and taken to bermuda ships departed nore on 23 june 1869 loaded down with of coal stowed in bags on their gun decks and transferred floating dock 11 days later after an uneventful voyage she was anchored at funchal madeira on christmas day 1872 when a storm parted her anchor chain and ship drifted onto ram bow of ironclad northumberland was seriously damaged below waterline with one compartment flooded though she was able to steam to malta for repairs ballard p 41 while her half sister normally flagship of channel squadron was refitting in 1873 75 agincourt normally flagship of
