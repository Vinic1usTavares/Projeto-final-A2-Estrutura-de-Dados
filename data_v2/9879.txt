typhoon vera also known as was an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone that struck japan in september 1959 becoming strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on country storm s intensity resulted in catastrophic damage of unparalleled severity and extent and was a major setback to japanese economy which was still recovering from world war ii in aftermath of vera japan s disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed and typhoon s effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking country vera developed on september 20 between guam and chuuk state and initially tracked westward before taking a more northerly course reaching tropical storm strength following day by this point vera had assumed a more westerly direction of movement and had begun to rapidly intensify and reached its peak intensity on september 23 with maximum sustained winds equivalent to that of a modern day category 5 hurricane with little change in strength vera curved and accelerated northward resulting in a landfall on september 26 near shionomisaki on honshu atmospheric wind patterns caused typhoon to briefly emerge into sea of japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore honshu for a second time movement over land greatly weakened vera and after reentering north pacific ocean later that day vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 27 these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days though vera was accurately forecast and its track into japan was well anticipated limited coverage of telecommunications combined with lack of urgency from japanese media and storm s intensity greatly inhibited potential evacuation and disaster mitigation processes rainfall from storm s outer rainbands began to cause flooding in river basins well in advance of storm s landfall upon moving ashore honshu typhoon brought a strong storm surge that destroyed numerous flood defense systems inundating coastal regions and sinking ships damage totals from vera reached us 600 million equivalent to us billion in number of fatalities caused by vera remain discrepant though current estimates indicate that typhoon caused more than 5 000 deaths making it one of deadliest typhoons in japanese history it also injured almost 39 000 people and made around 1 5 million people homeless relief efforts were initiated by japanese and american governments immediately following typhoon vera due to inundation caused by typhoon localized epidemics were reported including those of dysentery and tetanus spread of disease and blocking debris slowed ongoing relief efforts due to unprecedented damage and loss of life following vera national diet passed legislation in order to more efficiently assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters this included passage of disaster countermeasures basic act in 1961 which set standards for japanese disaster relief including establishment of central disaster prevention council meteorological history origin of typhoon vera can be traced back to a diffuse area of low pressure first incorporated into surface weather analysis early on september 20 at time disturbance was situated between guam and chuuk state though joint typhoon warning center jtwc did not classify incipient system as a tropical cyclone japan meteorological agency jma analyzed disturbance to be a tropical depression as early as 0000 utc that day initially depression tracked westward but transiently shifted to a more northerly course on september 21 late that day a reconnaissance airplane dispatched by jtwc to analyze disturbance failed to reach its center due to engine failure however data collected from storm s periphery was sufficient enough for warning center to classify depression as a tropical storm at 1800 utc that day despite flight data jma had already determined system to have been of at least tropical storm intensity six hours earlier as a result of reclassification tropical storm was designated name vera by jtwc at this point tropical cyclone began to take a more westerly course early on september 22 an aircraft fix located vera 175 km 110 mi north northeast of saipan throughout course of day periodic reconnaissance flights into storm indicated that vera had begun to rapidly intensify by 1800 utc later that day data analysis concluded that tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity rapid intensification continued into following day as typhoon s maximum sustained winds and barometric pressure quickly rose and fell respectively concurrently vera s size grew to a point at which it spanned 250 km 155 mi across at 0600 utc following day vera achieved its minimum estimated barometric pressure at 895 mbar hpa 26 43 inhg this indicated a 75 mbar hpa 2 22 inhg pressure drop in preceding 24 hours upon reaching its minimum pressure vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a category 5 highest classification possible on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale typhoon s winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200 utc on september 23 when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305 km h 190 mph upon peaking in wind speed vera was located 645 km 400 mi northeast of guam tropical cyclone s ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures vera only maintained peak intensity for roughly twelve hours but still remained a powerful tropical cyclone with very little change in strength typhoon tracked northwestward throughout september 24 due to influence of a nearby high pressure area vera began to gradually curve and rapidly accelerate northward towards japan at 0900 utc on september 26 vera made its first landfall on honshu just west of shionomisaki at time typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 260 km h 160 mph and a barometric pressure of 920 mbar hpa 27 17 inhg vera traversed japanese island rather quickly at a speed 61 km h 38 mph and emerged into sea of japan at 1530 utc that day despite its short stint over land terrain greatly weakened tropical cyclone tracking into a westerly wind flow vera was forced eastward resulting in a second landfall near sakata honshu with an intensity equivalent to that of a category 1 hurricane vera re emerged into north pacific ocean late on september 26 having weakened due to advection of cold air in addition to continued land interaction at 0600 utc on september 27 jtwc analyzed typhoon to have weakened to tropical storm intensity warning center discontinued its periodic monitoring of system as vera had begun to transition into an extratropical cyclone consequently jma officially reclassified system as an extratropical storm at 1200 utc that day vera s extratropical remnants continued to persist and track eastward for next two days before jma last noted storm at 1200 utc on september 29 impact despite being well forecast and tracked throughout its duration typhoon vera s effects were highly disastrous and long lasting in addition to storm s intensity severe damage and large death tolls were partially attributed to a lack of urgency from japanese media in advance of vera s landfall though estimates for damage costs indicated totals in excess of us 261 million equivalent to us billion in other damage estimates suggested that damage costs were as high as us 600 million equivalent to us billion in death tolls also remain unclear but reports generally indicated that around 5 000 people were killed with hundreds of other persons missing in addition to dead nearly 40 000 people were injured and an additional 1 6 million people were rendered homeless countrywide approximately 834 000 homes were destroyed and roughly 210 000 ha 520 000 ac of agricultural fields were damaged damage wrought by vera made it deadliest typhoon in japanese history succeeding 1934 muroto typhoon vera was also third deadliest natural disaster in japan during 20th century only behind great hanshin earthquake in 1995 and great kanto earthquake in 1923 well in advance of vera s landfall heavy rainfall ahead of typhoon occurred across tokai region of japan starting on september 23 when storm reached peak intensity over open waters in nagoya rainfall totals reached 10 cm 4 in in other parts of tokai region nearly 20 cm 8 in of rain was reported precipitation caused flooding along several river basins in swath of rain steady rainfall occurred throughout vera s passage of honshu though worst of rain induced flooding occurred well after typhoon s initial landfall in kawakami nara a landslide killed 60 people after crushing 12 homes most of damage associated with vera was a result of highly destructive storm surge at coast typhoon s intensity resulted in a strong storm surge that inundated low lying coastal regions in ise bay storm surge heights were greatly enhanced due to curvature of land and bay s shallow depth which allowed water to be easily driven length of bay towards coast in addition storm passed area at high tide water levels began to rise prior to vera s landfall and peaked during typhoon s first traversal of honshu highest storm surge measurement was observed in port of nagoya where water levels peaked above normal intense storm surge easily engulfed or breached earthen levees and other flood prevention mechanisms around ise bay however these coastal dykes still remained partially unfinished and were seriously impacted by vera s storm surge only newly installed flood mitigation systems along southern portion of bay were able to withstand wave action offshore waves sunk 25 fishing boats with thousands of other ships grounded or missing in total damage was reported to 7 576 vessels in addition to damaged craft numerous oyster rafts were also lost with losses totaling us 6 million also 75 million individual pearl oysters were lost to waves resulting in us 10 million in additional losses resulting inundation caused by vera s storm surge submerged areas around periphery of bay for extended periods of time with some low lying areas remaining underwater in excess of four months due to failure of multiple flood mitigation systems in quick succession coupled with narrow coverage of telecommunications exacerbated by vera s strong winds many persons in affected regions had very little time to evacuate nagoya was one of worst impacted cities by vera and as a result of storm surge and wind its harbor was put out of service in under three hours effects of typhoon s storm surge there were further worsened by destruction of lumber yards in nagoya harbor which set loose large quantities of logs that caused considerable damage to structures release of logs also hampered relief efforts following typhoon s passage citywide 50 000 homes were severely damaged by flood waters and 1 800 other residences were washed away off of their foundations total damage to crops was estimated at us 30 million rice crops sustained heavy impacts with 150 000 tons 135 000 tonnes of rice lost in addition to crop damage us 2 5 million worth of fruits and us 4 million worth of vegetables were lost collapse of a single apartment home in city buried 84 people under debris a similar incident in naka ibaraki buried roughly 300 people beach houses were destroyed and large swaths of nearby cropland were heavily damaged in addition to storm surge nagoya experienced sustained winds of about 145 km h 90 mph with gusts reaching as high as 260 km h 160 mph downing power lines and causing power outage southeast of nagoya in handa aichi around 300 people were killed after vera s waves engulfed more than 250 homes casualties throughout aichi totaled 3 168 and roughly 59 000 people were injured based on an enumeration conducted in march 1960 on western side of ise bay in mie prefecture 1 233 people were killed with approximately 5 500 others sustaining injuries approximately 95 of nagashima was submerged underwater nearby suffered a similar fate as 80 of city proper was flooded there 58 people were killed and 800 others were displaced towns of and were also wiped out by flood inundation further inland in nagano prefecture strong winds unroofed numerous homes united states air force s tachikawa airfield near tokyo sustained significant damage from typhoon with damage costs totaling in excess of us 1 million aftermath thumb right 250px an american hss 1 helicopter and japanese model 44a helicopter evacuating affected civilians alt black and white image of a large group of refugees in flood waters below two helicopters in immediate aftermath following typhoon vera japanese government established a disaster headquarters in tokyo and allocated resources to aid impacted areas government also set up central japan disaster relief department in nagoya due to large estimated damage cost of vera s impacts japanese parliament was forced to introduce a supplementary national budget to cover losses beginning on september 27 refuge shelters were opened and local government agencies assisted in rescuing stranded civilians on september 29 japan self defense forces began to take part in relief effort united states lieutenant general robert whitney burns ordered all available servicemen stationed in japan to take part in typhoon relief efforts was dispatched to nagoya to assist in relief efforts there in nagoya flood waters contaminated drinking water greatly reducing clean water supplies despite rapid sanitation and disinfection work disease epidemic broke out in parts of city over 170 cases of dysentery were reported along with other cases of gangrene and tetanus in addition to water shortage food rationing which had been prompted due to food shortages caused by vera resulted in hunger issues for impacted populations as a result of breaches in flood defenses around ise bay seawater continued to pour into inundated areas after vera s passage slowing down repair efforts one breach spanning 150 km 93 mi across required 5 000 personnel 32 000 sandbags and bulldozers dispatched by japanese ministry of defense to relieve water flow in aichi s ama district reconstruction efforts for levees roadways and infrastructure lasted until end of december 1959 due to losses sustained by pearl industry as a result of typhoon japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30 in 1959 with production losses of 40 expected in 1960 monetary losses to industry were expected to eclipse us 15 million causing japanese pearl costs to hike up by 20 furthermore effects of vera on country s pearl industry were expected to persist for two to three years disaster relief and mitigation reformation unprecedented destruction caused by vera prompted japanese parliament to pass legislation in order to more efficiently assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters in october 1959 a special parliamentary session enacted several measures coordinated by various government ministries and provided subsidiaries to persons effected by vera and other natural disasters in japan from august and september of that year a long lasting legislation prompted by vera s effects was 1961 passage of disaster countermeasures basic act widely regarded as cornerstone of legislation on disaster risk reduction in japan act established central disaster prevention council which was set to coordinate disaster risk reduction legislation also mandated an annual disaster prevention plan to be submitted to japanese parliament yearly finally act established september 1 as a national disaster prevention day in addition to legislative reform breaching of coastal flood defense systems during vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms in nagoya regulation was created for coastal construction and their heights development of flood defenses in ise osaka and tokyo bays was also set into motion heights of such defense systems were based on worst case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by typhoon see also 1934 muroto typhoon typhoon yancy 1993 strong typhoon that caused considerable damage in kyushu typhoon nancy 1961 similarly
