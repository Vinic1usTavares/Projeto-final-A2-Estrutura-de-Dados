yorktown or virginia campaign was a series of military maneuvers and battles during american revolutionary war that culminated in decisive siege of yorktown in october 1781 result of campaign was surrender of british army force of general charles earl cornwallis an event that led directly to beginning of serious peace negotiations and eventual end of war campaign was marked by disagreements indecision and miscommunication on part of british leaders and by a remarkable set of cooperative decisions at times in violation of orders by french and americans campaign involved land and naval forces of great britain and france and land forces of united states british forces were sent to virginia between january and april 1781 and joined with cornwallis s army in may which came north from an extended campaign through southern states these forces were first opposed weakly by virginia militia but general george washington sent first marquis de lafayette and then anthony wayne with continental army troops to oppose raiding and economic havoc british were wreaking combined american forces however were insufficient in number to oppose combined british forces and it was only after a series of controversially confusing orders by general sir henry clinton british commander in chief that cornwallis moved to yorktown in july and built a defensive position that was strong against land forces he then faced but was vulnerable to naval blockade and siege british naval forces in north america and west indies were weaker than combined fleets of france and spain and after some critical decisions and tactical missteps by british naval commanders french fleet of paul de grasse gained control over chesapeake bay blockading cornwallis from naval support and delivering additional land forces to blockade him on land royal navy attempted to dispute this control but admiral thomas graves was defeated in key battle of chesapeake on september 5 american and french armies that had massed outside new york city began moving south in late august and arrived near yorktown in mid september deceptions about their movement successfully delayed attempts by clinton to send more troops to cornwallis siege of yorktown began on september 28 1781 in a step that probably shortened siege cornwallis decided to abandon parts of his outer defenses and besiegers successfully stormed two of his redoubts when it became clear that his position was untenable cornwallis opened negotiations on october 17 and surrendered two days later when news reached london government of lord north fell and following rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations these culminated in treaty of paris in 1783 in which king george iii recognized independent united states of america clinton and cornwallis engaged in a public war of words defending their roles in campaign and british naval command also discussed navy s shortcomings that led to defeat background by december 1780 american revolutionary war s north american theatres had reached a critical point continental army had suffered major defeats earlier in year with its southern armies either captured or dispersed in loss of

before 1779 when a raid destroyed much of state s shipbuilding capacity and seized or destroyed large amounts of tobacco which was a significant trade item for americans ward p 867 virginia s only defenses consisted of locally raised militia companies and a naval force that had been virtually wiped out in 1779 raid militia were under overall direction of continental army general baron von steuben a prickly prussian taskmaster who although he was an excellent drillmaster alienated not only his subordinates but also had a difficult relationship with state s governor thomas jefferson steuben had established a training center in chesterfield for new continental army recruits and a factory in westham for manufacture and repair of weapons and ammunition lockhart p 238 french military planners had to balance competing demands for 1781 campaign after a series of unsuccessful attempts at cooperation with americans leading to failed assaults on newport rhode island and savannah georgia they realized more active participation in north america was needed however they also needed to coordinate their actions with spain where there was potential interest in making an assault on british stronghold of jamaica it turned out that spanish were not interested in operations against jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected british attempt to reinforce besieged gibraltar

in a separate dispatch sent later de grasse also made two important requests first was that he be notified at cap francais of situation in north america so that he could decide how he might be able to assist in operations there and second was that he be supplied with 30 pilots familiar with north american waters british planning for 1781 thumb left upright 1 1 general sir henry clinton general clinton never articulated a coherent vision for what goals for british operations of coming campaign season should be in early months of 1781 grainger p 29 part of his problem lay in a difficult relationship with his naval counterpart in new york aging vice admiral marriot arbuthnot both men were stubborn prone to temper and had prickly personalities due to repeated clashes their working relationship had completely broken down in fall of 1780 clinton had requested that either he or arbuthnot be recalled however orders recalling arbuthnot did not arrive until june 1781 until then according to historian george billias two men could not act alone and would not act together billias pp 267 275 arbuthnot was replaced by sir thomas graves with whom clinton had a somewhat better working relationship billias p 277 british presence in south consisted of strongly fortified ports of savannah georgia and charleston south carolina and a string of outposts in interior of those two states ketchum p 95 although strongest outposts were relatively immune to attack from patriot militia that were their only formal opposition in those states smaller outposts as well as supply convoys

men out on raiding and foraging expeditions local militia were called out but they were in such small numbers that british presence could not be disputed this did not prevent raiding expeditions from running into opposition as some did in skirmishing at waters creek in march maxwell pp 24 27 200 when news of arnold s activities reached george washington he decided that a response was necessary he wanted french to send a naval expedition from their base in newport but commanding admiral chevalier destouches refused any assistance until he received reports of serious storm damage to part of

supply depot there clary p 306 while von steuben retreated to point of fork present day columbia virginia where militia and continental army trainees had gathered with supplies pulled back before

supply depot in a brief skirmish on june 5 von steuben s forces numbering about 1 000 suffered 30 casualties but they had withdrawn most of supplies across river simcoe who only had about 300 men then exaggerated size of his force by lighting a large number of campfires this prompted von steuben to withdraw from point of fork leaving supplies to be destroyed by simcoe next day clary p 307 lafayette in meantime was expecting imminent arrival of long delayed reinforcements several battalions of pennsylvania continentals under brigadier general anthony wayne had also been authorised by congress for service in virginia in february however wayne had to deal with aftereffects of a mutiny in january that nearly wiped out pennsylvania line as a fighting force and it was may before he had rebuilt line

williamsburg on june 25 lafayette was away at bird s tavern that day lafayette learned that simcoe s queen s rangers were at some remove from main british force so lafayette sent some cavalry and light infantry to intercept them this precipitated a skirmish at spencer s ordinary where each side believed other to be within range of its main army hallahan p 135 allied decisions while lafayette arnold and phillips manoeuvred in virginia allied leaders washington and rochambeau considered their options on may 6 concorde arrived in boston and two days later washington and rochambeau were

discussed what steps to take next grainger p 38 they agreed that pursuant to his orders rochambeau would move his army from newport to continental army camp at white plains new york they also decided to send dispatches to de grasse outlining two possible courses of action washington favored idea of attacking new york while rochambeau favored action in virginia where british were less well established washington s letter to de grasse outlined these two options rochambeau in a private note informed de grasse of his preference ketchum p 139 lastly rochambeau convinced de barras to hold his fleet in readiness to assist in either operation rather than taking it out on expeditions to north as he had been ordered grainger p 41 concorde sailed from newport on june 20 carrying dispatches

north through a little used channel in bahamas ketchum p p 245 british decisions movement of french army to new york area caused general clinton a great deal of concern letters written by washington that clinton had intercepted suggested that allies were planning an attack on new york beginning in june he wrote a series of letters to cornwallis containing a confusing and controversial set of ruminations suggestions and recommendations that only sometimes contained concrete and direct orders wickwire p p 44 some of these letters were significantly delayed in reaching cornwallis complicating exchange between two on june 11 and 15 apparently in reaction to threat to new york clinton requested cornwallis to fortify either yorktown or williamsburg and send any troops he could spare back to new york grainger p 43 cornwallis received these letters at williamsburg on june 26 he and an engineer inspected yorktown which he found to be defensively inadequate he wrote a letter to clinton indicating that he would move to portsmouth in order to send troops north with transports available there wickwire pp 339 340 thumb left upright 1 1 brigadier general anthony wayne on july 4 cornwallis began moving his army toward jamestown ferry to cross broad james river and march to portsmouth lafayette s scouts observed motion and he realised british force would be vulnerable during crossing he advanced his army to green spring plantation and based on intelligence that only british rear guard was left at crossing sent general wayne forward to attack them on july 6 in reality earl had laid a clever trap crossing only his baggage and some troops to guard them he sent deserters to falsely inform lafayette of situation in battle of green spring general wayne managed to escape trap but with significant casualties and loss of two field pieces cornwallis then crossed river and marched his army to suffolk clary pp 309 312 cornwallis again detached tarleton on a raid into central virginia tarleton s raid was based on intelligence that supplies might be intercepted that were en route to general greene raid in which tarleton s force rode in four days was a failure since supplies

countermanded previous ones in most direct terms clinton ordered him to establish a fortified deep water port using as much of his army as he thought necessary clinton took this decision because navy had long been dissatisfied with new york as a naval base firstly because sand bars obstructed entrance to hudson river damaging hulls of larger ships and secondly because river often froze in winter imprisoning vessels inside harbour arbuthnot had recently been replaced and to show his satisfaction at this development clinton now acceded to navy s request despite cornwallis s warning that chesapeake s open bays and navigable rivers meant that any base there will always be exposed to sudden french attack it was to prove a fatal error of judgement by clinton since need to defend new facility denied cornwallis any freedom of movement nevertheless having inspected portsmouth and found it less favourable than yorktown cornwallis wrote to clinton informing him that he would fortify yorktown middleton war of american independence pp 279 81 wickwire pp 349 351 lafayette was alerted on july 26 that cornwallis was embarking his troops but lacked intelligence about their eventual

might take his whole fleet he was aware of number of pilots de grasse had requested for example he assumed that de grasse would not leave french convoy at cap francais and that part of his fleet would escort it to france as admiral had done previous year larrabee p 174 rodney made his dispositions accordingly balancing likely requirements of fleet in north america with need to protect britain s own trade convoys sixteen of his twenty one battleships therefore were to sail with hood in pursuit of de grasse to chesapeake before proceeding to new york rodney who was ill meanwhile took three other battleships back to england two as merchant escorts leaving his remaining two in dock for repairs hood was well satisfied with these arrangements telling a colleague that his fleet was equal fully to defeat any designs of enemy let de grasse bring or send what number of ships he might in aid of barras what neither rodney or hood knew was de grasse s last minute decision to take his entire fleet to north america thus ensuring a french superiority of three to two in battleship strength blissfully unaware of this development hood eventually sailed from antigua on august 10 five days after de

negotiators pointing out that defenders had in both instances acted with valor larrabee p 269 second issue concerned disposition of loyalists in british camp this issue was finessed with addition of a
