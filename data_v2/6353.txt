buffeted electropop noting its timed beats synthesised horns and playful vocal jousting scott lowe of ign said song featured an intriguing jazzy beat layered over pounding bass others panned song s sound and lyrics saying williams lampoons by sounding like baha men after five too many rails and that lyrics were about as shallow and trite as an inflatable kiddy swimming pool but less fun remix

otherwise tiresome track tom breihan of village voice called remix pretty great compared to horrible hammering of original song he criticized west s lyrics saying he was back to talking about girls on his verse again without any of humane warmth he used to sometimes bring song was number 32 on rolling stones list of 100 best songs of 2008 in response to positive reception from listeners williams
