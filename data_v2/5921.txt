traps laser defence mechanisms and security robots all of which kill astronaut on contact resulting in loss of one of his five lives these defences must be shut down with objects obtained from gravity boxes in order to progress as player has no weapon to directly attack robots with jet pack enables astronaut to travel more quickly but has a limited supply of nitro fuel should this fuel run out then astronaut will lose a life spaceship contains points at which jet pack can be refuelled though these can be difficult to locate plot crew of obsidian have temporarily abandoned vessel in order to allow it to pass through a black hole obsidian s internal systems are capable of withstanding black hole but station cannot shield its human inhabitants from gravitational forces crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded intending to return to obsidian when both vessels have passed through black hole a radiation storm has damaged obsidian s engine protection systems and erased its flight path leaving station drifting towards black hole where it will be destroyed only one member of crew has skills necessary to return to obsidian and prepare it to pass through black hole this is game s player character astronaut is forced to contend with obsidian s re activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed space station s internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active once player has restored power reactivated obsidian s engines and reset station s flight path there is a limited time to teleport back to smaller shielded craft before obsidian s engines carry astronaut through black hole without being shielded development obsidian is first game developed by tony warriner one of four founders of
