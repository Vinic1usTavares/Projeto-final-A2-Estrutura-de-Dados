history predecessor roads and state road construction thumb right md 7 westbound at white hall road in elkton rough alignment of what is now md 7 in baltimore and harford counties existed by 1695 as a rudimentary road baltimore county ordered that road be widened to in width to allow easy passage for carts and for bridges to replace ferries at numerous creeks along route in 1717 route from baltimore to elkton became part of a new overland post road between philadelphia and williamsburg highway between baltimore and havre de grace was maintained as a turnpike baltimore and havre de grace turnpike by 1825 this turnpike later became known as baltimore and philadelphia turnpike and after collection of tolls had ceased on highway philadelphia road or post road final ferry along route to be eliminated was susquehanna river crossing first vehicular bridge was a converted railroad bridge built by pennsylvania railroad in 1873 replaced with current amtrak bridge immediately to north in 1904 and converted into a tolled vehicular bridge owned by several citizens of harford and cecil counties in 1910 maryland state roads commission purchased bridge in 1923 and removed tolls in 1928 in 1926 commission double decked bridge to increase bridge s capacity when maryland state roads commission laid out a proposed state road system in 1909 two sections of philadelphia road were included from eastern city limit of baltimore then at elwood avenue east to rossville in baltimore county and from perryville to elkton highway was paved as an wide tarred macadam road from elwood avenue to herring run in 1910 remainder of road from herring run to rossville was completed in concrete by 1921 in cecil county philadelphia road was paved with a wide macadam surface from eastern town limit of north east to western town limit of elkton in 1913 highway was paved in concrete from perryville to principio creek and in macadam from there through charlestown in 1914 state road was paved in macadam from charlestown to north east including cecil avenue within latter in 1915 section of state road through charlestown which is now md 267 was bypassed with a concrete road that remained on north side of pennsylvania railroad by 1921 section of post road between bel air avenue in aberdeen and former racetrack in havre de grace much of which is now md 132 was paved under state aid system as a wide macadam road by 1911 first section of gap between rossville and aberdeen was filled with a concrete road from bradshaw to winters run by 1921 remainder of highway in baltimore county and section from winters run to bynum run were paved in concrete by 1923 final piece of philadelphia road in harford county was completed as a concrete road from bynum run to aberdeen in 1926 highway was paved in concrete along main street and delaware avenue through elkton with exception of a gap at west end of town by 1923 gap between elkton and delaware state line was filled in 1925 gap at west end of elkton was left in inferior condition in anticipation of a grade separation of pennsylvania railroad this grade separation and its approaches was completed in 1929 completing us 40 which had been assigned to length of philadelphia road in 1927 improvements and construction of pulaski highway improvements to us 40 began shortly after its designation highway was widened to in width from baltimore to rosedale and from aberdeen to havre de grace and to between rosedale and aberdeen by 1930 us 40 was also widened to from perryville to delaware state line by 1934 cecil county section of highway was widened again with a pair of shoulders in 1937 and 1938 u s highway was relocated to its present alignment through aberdeen to eliminate a pair of crossings of pennsylvania railroad between 1930 and 1933 old highway south of railroad tracks became an extension of md 22 however very high levels of traffic due to being main highway between baltimore and philadelphia led to calls for highway to be expanded to in width along its entire length by 1934 thumb left former md 7 eastbound on main street in elkton approaching md 268 rather than widen existing road further maryland state roads commission decided to build a new philadelphia road later known as pulaski highway as a divided highway on a new alignment between baltimore and aberdeen and to expand newly relocated highway through aberdeen to havre de grace to a four lane divided highway new us 40 was started in 1935 and completed in 1938 original philadelphia road between baltimore and aberdeen became first section of md 7 next sections of old highway to be bypassed were in havre de grace and perryville when thomas j hatem memorial bridge and its approaches opened in august 1940 replacing double decked converted railroad bridge portions of old highway on either side of river became additional sections of md 7 construction on new philadelphia road in cecil county began in 1938 and was completed in 1941 transfer of us 40 to its new alignment resulted in addition of two more sections of md 7 from west of charlestown through north east to west of elkton and through elkton despite bypassing of original philadelphia road improvements continued to be made to md 7 state highway was widened with dual shoulders from baltimore city limit to rossville in 1938 md 7 was widened through havre de grace in 1953 and through elkton in 1954 highway was relocated and became a divided highway on both sides of its intersection with md 543 in riverside concurrent with construction of md 543 s
