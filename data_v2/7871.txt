krustyland homer gives kids 50 to enjoy themselves and he decides to spend quality time with marge production thumb upright staff member matt selman wrote episode food wife was written by executive producer of simpsons matt selman writing process began around september 2010 according to selman episode mainly revolves around homer and marge competing about who is perceived as most fun by bart and lisa a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real life episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs selman said in an interview with new york magazine s grub street publication that foodie culture is just a world that i always thought was funny and fascinating idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating but as something that you are so passionate about that you re kind of bragging about it i m one who discovered this particular korean pork neck soup restaurant and you can kind of claim that as yours blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that i always thought was inherently funny and when i write simpsons episodes i try to start with a world i think is funny and think what s a good story we can tell in that world using characters that we have describing himself as sort of a foodie selman has said that food is constantly on his mind and that he particularly likes reading food critic jonathan gold s reviews in la weekly he told la weeklys squid ink food blog that he likes foodies despite making fun of them in food wife he commented that on show he has often taken something that i love found one little weird bad thing about it and harped on that giving foodies as an example and writing you can make fun of them for being pretentious or snobby or taking fun out of eating that you d rather photograph something than taste it is a funny nuance of phenomenon that it s more about sticking your flag in something than actually enjoying it we kind of make fun of foodies but in real life we actually love them selman was pleased with finished result of episode he noted in interview with grub street that marge starting to blog about food does not sound inherently exciting but episode itself is actually very exciting and i m super thrilled with way it s turned out selman thinks a strong thing about episode is fact that despite homer s love for food homer is not one that becomes a foodie as one might expect he explained that this is because although homer loves eating he s kind of a blue collar kind of guy who doesn t like foreign food weird food savoring food food blogging about it photographing it he just wants to be stuffed all time cultural references selman wanted to include things in episode that only really hard core foodies would have any idea what we were talking about this was like a love letter to foodie culture food references featured in episode include jokes about sauce and sous vide cooking referrals to chefs wylie dufresne frank bruni and ruth reichl a mention of soup pho from vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly and inclusion of el chemistri owner who is based on spanish chef jose andres known for using molecular gastronomy selman has commented that food produced with help of molecular gastronomy lends itself to comedy quite nicely there s a dish at el chemistri for instance called regret waiter cries into your soup when he serves it human tear is final ingredient fictional character swedish chef is also seen in episode and scene where meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating apple pie is a reference to pixar film ratatouille which was written and directed by former simpsons consultant brad bird in addition to foodie culture food wife parodies video game industry and references games such as god of war assassin s creed half life bioshock call of duty dig dug driver san francisco halo lego harry potter years 1 4 lego star wars medal of honor madden nfl q bert resident evil revelations shaun white snowboarding and origins in addition it also references movie wargames with video game company in episode homer bart and lisa visit a video game convention called expensive electronic entertainment expo e4 which is a reference to electronic entertainment expo e3 that is presented annually in united states by entertainment software association this marked first time that family visited a video game convention in simpsons selman and other staff members on show had previously visited e3 during release of simpsons video games such as simpsons game while appearing on gametrailers tv with geoff keighley on november 11 2011 selman commented that we ve been to so many and we ve been pushed around and knocked around and seen so many pr guys talk about how hard it was working on their game we ve seen how expensive food is and how nuts it is and bloggers and photos and just noises we had to do it on show in episode homer and his children want to see unveiling of a new console called zu which is a reference to nintendo s wii u console as he and children make their way through crowded convention to get to unveiling screen turns into a first person shooter game through eyes of homer he uses and a fire extinguisher as weapons to get forward according to selman inspiration for this came from fact that if you ve been to e3 you know it s insane it s super crowded it s super loud and walking through it feels like a video game like a nightmarish first person video game of bloggers and nerds you just want to get thing that you want to get to guest appearances tim heidecker and eric wareheim stars and creators of american sketch comedy television series tim and eric awesome show great job guest starred in episode as foodies and fois garth respectively these two characters are among foodies that marge bart and lisa meet at ethiopian restaurant in episode they rhyme a hip hop song that according to selman is all bragging about how awesome and cool you are as a foodie it was co written by duo and was inspired by song empire state of mind selman has commented that in animated tv shows whenever you re trying to show people having fun doing their new thing in this case marge and children creating content for their blog it just kind of becomes a boring montage and we ve done so many montages on simpsons over 25 years it s like oh god no more montages so we were like why not do a silly rap song rapping is sort of inherently boastful and there s something about being a foodie that s inherently boastful it s like boastfulness links those things so tim and eric perform a food rap song in show an extremely silly rap song and name is intentionally silly blogging a food blog american chef anthony bourdain guest starred in episode as himself selman wanted him on show because he is a big fan and he thinks marge would have a liking for him bourdain s appearance was cut short because episode ended up being too long and as a result his bad boy persona is not fully explored selman told squid ink in addition to bourdain guest stars in episode include chefs and media personalities gordon ramsay and mario batali as themselves these three all appear in marge s dream when asked by digital spy about his appearance ramsay said that i grew up watching simpsons and love that they re foodies and joked that for god s sake i had to promise marge a spot on masterchef to get on bloody show he concluded that episode is a definite swing for fences and i think it hits its mark completely scenes at video game convention were praised by anthony severino of game revolution as well he commented that writers nailed it everything from massive displays long lines and even look of los angeles convention center was spot on best was how they portrayed people with vip passes you know those things that we journalists get as douches who think they re better than regulars in his review of food wife hitfix s alan sepinwall commended it for stay ing true to characters of course kids would consider homer to be fun dad on those occasions when he s actually making an effort and of course marge would feel jealous of this and if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing she also recognizes it immediately feels guilty throughout meal and then heads off to save day complete with a great homage to climax of ratatouille sepinwall also praised episode for being packed with great jokes such as heidecker and wareheim s hip hop song and scenes at video game convention where screen turns into a first person shooter game similarly childs of a v club praised episode as funny and well observed giving it a b grade and cited hip hop song as highlight of episode he also praised bourdain batali and ramsay and stated that he wished bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in episode childs further wrote that best thing about this episode is that it doesn t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out of character character moments down viewers throats it sticks to basics family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still current fad i say still current because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities i don t think that it has been overdone everywhere response from food critics reception of food wife from food critics has been mixed to positive before episode aired robert sietsema of village voice disapproved of it for being outdated he commented that this show should have been done say two or three years ago when food blogging was hot by now many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out migrated to paying gigs and concept of food blog has been co opted by every major media outlet rendering real food blogs old fashioned kind where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things or wandered hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness nearly obsolete sietsema also criticized scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date since molecular gastronomy is by now long past its prime chris shott a food critic for washington city papers young hungry column and blog wrote negatively about character that owns el chemistri and is a parody of jose andres he commented that for one thing character seems far more subdued than kooky wild eyed power drill wielding cook we saw on conan recently satire here involving a deconstructed caesar salad of foams gels and airs is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send up of andres over top personality food critic katharine shilcutt of houston press criticized episode for giving what she thought was an inaccurate depiction of foodies as people that are tacky snotty slightly racist hoarders of food experiences that you gather like rare gems and patronizingly hold over other people s heads shilcutt added that she found it upsetting that what she believes to be moral of episode is that educated passionate people are elitists it reduces all hard work that people put into creating good honest food into a joke and not a terribly funny one there was no balance in episode between smug arrogant obnoxious foodies and those who have a genuine guileless interest in food and all its important permutations in our lives other food critics have written positively about food wife lesley of la weeklys squid ink blog listed her ten favorite quotes from episode placing entire hip hop song about foodies and food blogging at top she commented that plenty of insider jokes at foodies expense season episode so was it as funny to a non food world person as it was to someone who could identify each culinary personality in marge s dream safe to say yes it is still simpsons after all for whole episode is entirely quotable we re sure it will be in food blogosphere for years to come laine doss a food blogger for miami new times and new times broward palm beach commented that she loved lisa simpson s list of cutest vegetarians that appears on blog which included paul mccartney russell brand and edward cullen doss as well as elizabeth gunnison of esquires eat like a man blog also commended hip hop song references external links food wife at simpsons com category
