gate pandon gate and sand gate it also had seventeen towers as well as several smaller turrets and postern gates town wall was kept in good repair whilst there was a threat of invasion from scottish

remains are west walls on western side of city construction town wall was constructed during 13th and 14th centuries to repel scottish invaders newcastle is about from river tweed which marks border between england and scotland as it did then at that time there was a power struggle between england and scotland that eventually led to wars of scottish independence scottish kings were always ready to take advantage of any weakness in english rule to invade north of england an example of this is david i of scotland who took advantage of civil war between stephen and matilda to invade northumberland in three successive years 1136 8 in treaty of durham 1139 david s son henry was given earldom of northumberland newcastle was not included in this grant but scots ignored this clause and occupied newcastle until 1157 although town had a strong castle built by robert curthose in 1080 and improved by henry ii between 1172 and 1177 it did not provide sufficient protection for local merchants properties and so it was decided that a fortified town wall was needed a special tax or murage was levied by borough to pay for construction murus being latin for wall it was first levied in 1265 so it can be assumed that construction began soon after that date payment of murage continued for next hundred years so construction was probably not finished until at least mid 14th century plans for route of wall changed somewhat during construction in original plan castle was to be included in wall as a strongpoint however castle was set on high ground above river bank and there were strong objections to this route as it would miss out area by river where many of principal burgesses lived leaving their residences without protection route was therefore changed so that wall turned southward at neville tower and ran down to river a similar adjustment to route was made to east of city in 1299 village of pandon was formally incorporated as part of city and so wall made a sharp turn to east to skirt around pandon until it reached river from pandon wall ran westward along river separating town from quay here wall was pierced by a number of water gates that allowed access to river for loading and unloading of ships in 1616 it was ordered that these gates were to be closed at night to prevent servants from throwing rubbish into river one or two were left open to allow seamen to return to their ships but these were watched all night when completed wall was approximately 3 kilometres 2 mi long at least 2 metres 6 5 ft thick and up to 7 6 metres 25 ft high it had six main gateways and seventeen towers as well as several smaller turrets and postern gates towers projected out from walls and were within of each other so that attackers trying to scale walls were
