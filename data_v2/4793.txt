clapton elaborated in a 1988 rolling stone magazine interview music writers covach and boone describe riff as blues derived which uses a minor blues pentatonic scale with an added flattened fifth note or common blues scale song follows a blues chord progression i iv i during first eight bars brown had a difficult time writing lyrics that fit riff after an all night session bruce played it on a standup bass while lyricist pete brown was staring out window slowly he started to write it s getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes which is used in first verse later to break up rhythm clapton wrote a refrain which also yielded song s title it consists of eight bar sections using three chords when key shifts to v chord i v viiiiii viiiiii a bootleg recording from ricky tick club in london before cream recorded song in studio shows sunshine of your love with a beat common to rock for period cream drummer ginger baker compared it to uptempo hey now princess another bruce brown composition cream recorded in march he said that he advised bruce to slow it down and came up with distinctive drum pattern which emphasises beats one and three typical rock drumming favours beats two and four and is known as backbeat however bruce and recording engineer tom dowd dispute baker s claim which they say he only made much later dowd later explained recording cream performed their first american concerts in new york city in 1967 robert stigwood group s manager booked them for a murray k package show at rko manhattan theatre from 25 march to 2 april 1967 when it was finished stigwood arranged for a recording session with ahmet ertegun at atlantic studios bruce and brown had a number of new songs in various stages of development and entered studio on 3 april initially ertegun assigned dowd to work with trio dowd had worked with many of biggest jazz and rhythm and blues musicians in 1950s and 1960s however cream was his first exposure to extreme volume levels group arrived at atlantic with their concert setup of multiple marshall amplifiers each 100 watts dowd was surprised by amount of equipment accompanying trio they recorded at ear shattering level everyone i d worked with before was using fender about 20 watts or twins about 80 watts six and seven piece bands that didn t play as loud as this three piece did ertegun brought in producer felix pappalardi who he believed could work as a go between with group and dowd they began with strange brew tales of brave ulysses and sunshine of your love ertegun previewed demos and was unhappy expecting more blues based material that was found on fresh cream jerry wexler ertegun s atlantic records partner reportedly went as far as to call it psychedelic hogwash however booker t jones producer and keyboardist of booker t m g s and otis redding both whose stax recordings at time were distributed by atco parent atlantic gave sunshine of your love their wholehearted approval differences were smoothed over by time cream returned in may 1967 to finish recording songs for disraeli gears with pappalardi and dowd work continued on sunshine of your love for his guitar solo clapton used a sound known as woman tone on his 1964 gibson sg standard author mitch gallagher describes it as a smooth dark singing sustaining sound it is one of best known examples of woman tone and quotes melody from perennial pop standard blue moon by using song s major pentatonic scale clapton provides a contrast with riff s blues scale a writer for rock and roll hall of fame describes this as creating a balance between sun and moon baker plays much of song on tom toms described as sounding african schumacher and native american shapiro covach and boone note he concentrates on lower tom sounds and uses an articulation
