devotion a central practice in buddhism refers to commitment to religious observances or to an object or person and may be translated with sanskrit or pali terms like saddha garava or puja central to buddhist devotion is practice of buddhanussati recollection of inspiring qualities of buddha although buddhanussati had been an important aspect of practice since early period of buddhism its importance was amplified with arising of mahayana buddhism specifically with pure land buddhism many forms of devotion were developed to recollect and connect with celestial buddhas especially amitabha most buddhists use ritual in pursuit of their spiritual aspirations common devotional practices are receiving a blessing making merit making a resolution prostrating making offerings chanting traditional texts and pilgrimage moreover many types of visualizations recollections and mantras are used in buddhist meditation in different traditions to devote oneself to a buddha or a teacher often politically motivated practice of self immolation is a less common aspect of devotion in some buddhist communities buddhist devotional practices can be performed at home or in a temple in which images of buddhas bodhisattvas and enlightened disciples are located buddhist devotion is practiced more intensively on uposatha observation days and on yearly festivals which are different depending on region and tradition definition left thumb 160x160px head of a buddha term devotion in context of buddhism is defined by sri lankan scholar as fact or quality of being devoted to religious observances or a solemn dedication to an object or a person it is covered in pali language by terms such as pema affection saddha faith or belief serene confidence bhatti faith and garava respect pema is often used in initial attraction a student feels for his spiritual teacher saddha is deeper although still considered an initial step on spiritual path saddha and garava might inspire a layperson to ordain as a monk whereas saddha and pema may help a devotee to attain a good afterlife destination bhatti in early buddhism has meaning of faithful adherence to buddhist religion but in later texts term develops meaning of an advanced form of devotion apart from these terms term puja is also used for expressions of honor worship and devotional attention puja is derived from vedic root puj meaning to revere to honor according to pali studies scholar m m j in theravada pali canon it did not have meaning of ritual offering yet it did include honoring through physical verbal and mental ways term puja originated with dravidian culture in which it may have been used for a ritual or an element of ritual procedure and these ritual connotations may have affected buddhism at a later period according to anthropologist william douglas however root puj had a ritual meaning from early buddhist period although in traditional texts devotional acts are sometimes not considered part of path to enlightenment itself they are considered a way to prepare oneself for development of this path devotion is expressed through three doors of action body speech and mind it is regarded as a form of giving which is done for both one s own benefit and that of other in many buddhist societies devotional practices are engaged in because of this life benefits healing exorcism of malevolent spirits because of karmic pursuits accumulating good karma for next lives to come and because devotee would like to attain nirvana history in early buddhism it was a common practice to recollect qualities of buddha known as buddhanussati in period of arising of mahayana buddhism there was a growing sense of loss in buddhist communities with regard to passing away of buddha and a growing desire to be able to meet him again these developments led to arising of faith based forms of buddhism such as pure land buddhism in which practice of buddhanussati involved celestial buddhas such as amitabha buddha devotional practices became commonplace as new techniques were developed to recollect qualities and magnificence of celestial buddhas such as visualization and chants in buddhist devotion triple gem that is buddha his teaching and his community are mostly honored however this does not mean that deities have no role in buddhist devotion they do but are usually put on a subordinate level with buddha at top of spiritual hierarchy in some buddhist societies devotional life has significantly been influenced by pre buddhist devotion to deities and spirits in modern times buddhist devotion has changed in many ways traditional days of observance can no longer be maintained in same way due to introduction of a seven day workweek and chants and other practices have been abridged or standardized to adapt to modern society goods offered in devotion have been commercialized nevertheless devotional practices still continue to exist and evolve today most buddhists use ritual in pursuit of their spiritual aspirations symbols thumb symbols for triple gem have been used throughout buddhist history including wheel of dhamma 227x227px devotion to triple gem is mostly expressed toward buddha image however other symbols have also been used throughout buddhist history including lotus flower wheel of dhamma bodhi tree and stupa sometimes devotees also pay honor to foot prints believed to have been left behind by gautama buddha or a previous buddha practices buddhism regards inner devotion as more important than outer ritual however devotion does have an important place in buddhism devotion is developed through several practices expressed through physical movement speech and mind buddhist devotion is not only direct to buddha but also to buddha s teaching and inanimate objects considered sacred such as stupas hemispherical structures containing relics or buddhist texts sutras are buddhist texts seen as body of dharma or body of buddha an important idea in buddhist devotional practice is that good qualities of mind can be developed by association with someone or something linked to high spiritual attainment in burmese buddhism devotion to buddha is seen to bear fruits not because buddha is seen to respond to devotion but rather because of spiritual power inherent in his words or relics and because of merit of worship itself in theravada buddhism devotional ceremonies can be classified as ceremonies for making merit doing good deeds e g offerings to monks ceremonies to ward off danger e g chanting certain buddhist texts and ceremonies adapted from folk religion almost all lay practices are focused on making merit and gaining a personal benefit is therefore an important part of buddhist devotion in mahayana buddhism it is common to combine several devotional practices in one three fold or seven fold ceremony in threefold ceremony practitioners will confess their wrongdoings and rejoice in goodness that others have done thirdly either merits are dedicated to other living beings or buddhas are requested to keep on teaching for benefit of world in seven fold series all four of these practices are also engaged in plus an obeisance and an offering are given and buddhas are requested to not yet leave world to go to final nirvana these ceremonies whether three or sevenfold often precede a meditation session several series are also known which also include going for refuge upholding five ethical precepts and reminding oneself of aim of enlightenment for all living beings ceremonies are described in several mahayana sutras among which avatamsaka sutra and gandavyuha blessing thumb replica of an image at sanchi gate at chaitya bhoomi which shows a devotion scene involving a buddhist stupa in buddhism ceremonies are meant to provide a blessing a buddhist practitioner may engage in devotional practices to ask for blessings from a buddha or enlightened being monks and nuns are also believed to be able to convey spiritual power by giving a blessing through chanting a blessed object or some other means spiritual power of monastics is considered to come from their ordination lineage and virtue in expressing faith and devotion to a buddha or other spiritually advanced being devotees may also ask for repentance to help free themselves from retribution of bad karma or as an exercise for self improvement sometimes a distinction is made between direct visible help a buddha gave to a disciple for example by giving encouragement and hidden powers that a buddha had and still has which he also uses to help living beings these hidden powers can refer to psychic powers or it can also refer to power gained when a practitioner invokes buddha s name merit making and resolve merit is an energy that can be accumulated through merit making practices often performed with people who are considered to have spiritual power to give blessings like monastics this energy can also be directed at a goal chosen through a resolve often made such a resolve may be focused on this worldly goals such as health intelligence protection from harm but also goals that are less mundane such as rebirth in heaven rebirth in a pure land and enlightenment throughout history these resolves have often been recorded on materials like stone it is also believed that merit can be transferred to other living beings to help them or transferred to a deity who is expected to help in return finally it is believed merit can help to weaken effects of bad karma prostration right thumb prostration is done as an expression of humility and an acknowledgement of other s spiritual experience in buddhism prostration is performed in several situations buddhists may prostrate for images of gotama buddha and in mahayana buddhism also to other buddhas and bodhisattvas devotion towards bodhisattvas is focused on their compassion their skill and extraordinary powers apart from that lay devotees may prostrate for a stupa or a bodhi tree a tree of same type that buddha became enlightened under but also to a monastic or sometimes a religious teacher of some kind they may also prostrate to their parents or to their elders monastics will prostrate for a monk ordained earlier but female monastics are expected to prostrate to all male monastics regardless of date of ordination prostration is done as an expression of humility and an acknowledgement of other s spiritual experience it is usually done three times to pay respect to buddha dharma and samgha prostration is done by holding hands in front of chest and bringing them to different parts of upper body to indicate paying respect by three gates of action or to indicate spiritual realization of truth by a buddha realized through body speech and mind after that one either bows with elbows and head onto ground or by fully one s entire body apart from such threefold prostrations prostrations may also be done continuously as a form of repentance or as part of ritual of circumambulating walking around a stupa or other holy place finally sometimes a pilgrimage is completely or partly done by prostrating oneself forward at a more basic level respect may be shown by a gesture of clasped hands held against chest and raising hands to one s head or chin depending on position and level of respect at which other person is offering left thumb buddhist offering incense to an image another important practice is giving of offerings out of respect and humility to a buddha image or other artifact this is often combined with chanting buddhists may offer flowers as a symbol of growth or incense to remind themselves of odor of sanctity of buddha candles and lights may also be offered symbolizing dispelling of darkness of ignorance in mahayana buddhism a set of seven offerings is often given in which first two offerings represent hospitality and other five senses such an offering indicates respect through one s entire being as represented by five senses when an offering is given in a temple devotees will normally take off their shoes wash object to be offered approach image or stupa holding their hands in anjali and perform actual offering after which they prostrate offering of flowers and other offerings and care that is given to a holy place are not only signs of respect but they also are meant to change environment of devotee in a place where buddha would be at home offerings given to monastic community are also considered a form of devotion and offerings of food are often given to buddha image first after which offerings are given to monks for their breakfast or mid day meal recitation left thumb recitation of traditional texts is encouraged in many buddhist traditions recitation of traditional texts is encouraged in many buddhist traditions a very basic form that is very important is recitation of three refuges of which every phrase is repeated three times this is called taking refuge and it is done by a naming buddha dharma and samgha as refuges or recollections can also be chanted as well as a review of five precepts protective chantings are also widespread many forms of protective chanting exist in buddhism among which well known sutta whereas some of these chants are used to ward of specific dangers such as that during childbirth or meant for specific occasions such as weddings others are considered to be beneficial in a more general sense they are believed to affect only life of practitioner who recites them with a mind of faith they are considered to bring benefits to mental health and well being and are a form of practicing loving kindness in thought moreover they are considered to speed up fruits of good karma please devas deities and are expressions of truth of buddha s teachings in mahayana buddhism mantras and dharanis are also used which include heart sutra and mantra om mani padme hum dharanis are often summaries of teachings that function like mnemonic aids besides these there are also chantings in homage to amitabha in pure land buddhism chantings in homage to lotus sutra in nichiren buddhism and chantings in homage of bodhisattva avalokitesvara in east asian and tibetan mahayana buddhism in nichiren buddhism lotus sutra is honored through a seven syllable mantra title of sutra which is engraved on a plaque called this plaque is central focus of nichiren devotion and chanting mantra in honor of sutra is considered of great benefit to practitioner in tibetan and other forms of mahayana buddhism name of avalokitesvara is called upon through om mani padme hum mantra which is done by using praying wheels by printing mantra on prayer flags and carving it on stones and other materials but this mantra is not only form of chanting which is preserved in ritual ways other mantras and buddhist verses are also kept in form of tiny scrolls kept in ornaments amulets and even tattoos chanting of buddhist texts is most widespread mental cultivation practice for lay people it is believed to help overcome hindrances and negative emotions in mind and cultivate positive ones buddhist chants are reflections on good spiritual qualities of three refuges or an enlightened teacher and aspirations of spiritual perfection furthermore chanting texts is considered a way to manifest healing power of buddhist teaching in world and to benefit and protect nation and world in early buddhism recitation of texts was done mainly for its mnemonic purpose in a time period when religious texts were not written down later on even though writing became widespread recitation was still continued out of devotion and to commit teachings to memory out of respect some elements of chanting in buddhism such as monotonous style still indicate its original mnemonic nature although much chanting is done in ancient ritual languages such as sanskrit or pali chants in vernacular languages also exist a common pali chant starts with and is often chanted to introduce a ceremony in many buddhist traditions prayer beads are used during chanting apart from being a tool to count number of recitations chanted in some traditions beads are a symbol of buddhist faith moreover in pure land buddhism beads are a reminder of buddha amitabha s greatness and one s own limited capacities compared to him apart from chanting in some traditions offerings of music are given in honor of triple gem consisting of traditional music performed by specialists or just ritual music that accompanies chanting recitation of texts need not always be in form of ritual chanting in tibet it is considered meritorious to invite monks to read from buddhist texts sometimes for days on end devotion can also be expressed in lofty forms of everyday speech as in verbs used when talking about a buddha image in some southeast asian languages meditation thumb in many buddhist traditions faith is attributed an important role in preparation process for meditation practice in many buddhist traditions faith is attributed an important role in preparation process for meditation practice faith is often mentioned hand in hand with moral discipline which practitioners require to improve their mindfulness and energy this mindfulness and energy will then help practitioners move forward in meditation practice culminating in wisdom and understanding more specifically in theravada meditation manual called visuddhimagga several personality types are distinguished among them faith type each personality type requires its own approach in meditation practice people of faith type have some similarities with greedy personality type but differ in that they cling to what is beneficial and wholesome for this type several are recommended which means recollection of examples are recollection of qualities of triple gem recollection of benefits of moral discipline or giving or reflection on good qualities of devas in texts such as visuddhimagga devotion to triple gem was developed into several forms of meditation buddhanussati and respectively in these recollections practitioners reflect on attributes of triple gem following stock formulas found in many places in early pali scriptures recollection is believed to lead practitioner to joy inner peace and concentration sometimes practitioners internalize a buddha image as a mental image used in meditation in mahayana buddhism especially in pure land buddhism faith based meditations can also be found five recollections are used to remind oneself of goodness of amitabha buddha first three represent body speech and mind practitioners honor amitabha buddha through physical action e g by prostrating through speech by chanting in praise of him and by resolving to be reborn with him in pure land fourth recollection is a series of visualizations similar to faith based meditations from visuddhimagga and descriptions in pali canon in these visualizations practitioners imagine amitabha buddha pure land and after that themselves being reborn there fifth recollection is practice of skillful means to help others to achieve rebirth in pure land as well apart from these visualizations chant in honor of amitabha buddha can also be recited in a meditative way silently in one s mind or through rhythm of one s breath pure land meditations were also practiced in tibetan buddhism although there was less focus on amitabha buddha some nyingma masters did teach amitabha visualizations furthermore in kagyu tradition a technique was taught which was believed to help cross over to a pure land at time of death called pho ba left thumb buddha amitabha 200x200px there are also devotional visualization meditations in tantric buddhism as can be found in tibetan korean and japanese buddhism these practices differ from pure land visualizations in that apart from a buddha teacher guru is very important in process and a form of meditation directed towards guru is also taught practitioners often take refuge in their spiritual teacher who symbolizes triple gem furthermore they often take refuge in a yidam tibetan which buddhist studies scholar peter harvey translates as tutelary deity this can be a buddha a bodhisattva or a deity by focusing on exemplary aspects of one s teacher who is also visualized in meditation one develops faith in practice furthermore practitioner needs to go through an initiation ritual in which guru transmits knowledge on a particular yidam and a mantra visualization practice and sometimes ritual gestures that are appropriate for that deity unlike pure land visualizations there are many deities to choose from mantra is regarded to express nature of yidam and gestures are considered to evoke appropriate states of mind moreover visualization techniques and mantra syllables are believed to actually evoke deity recalled and incorporate deity in one s being using these practices devotee is believed to be guided by yidam to transform his faults for example anger to a parallel kind of wisdom harvey when incorporating yidam into one s being devotee is actively imitating activities associated with that yidam and this is believed to speed up attainment of buddhahood there are several other tantric devotional meditation forms including visualizing one s lineage of teachers and prostrating for them and imagining one s teacher as a buddha in shingon buddhism a visualization meditation is often practiced called in this practice done by both monastics and lay people devotees invite buddha to attend meditation and visualize a letter a as a mystical symbol of voidness and origin of all existence devotion can also be expressed through walking meditation which is very clearly seen in pure land tradition pure land devotees may practice walking meditation continuously for ninety days on end devotees walk around an image of amitabha buddha visualizing him and chanting his name breaks are only taken for bodily functions practice was first proposed by chinese writer pilgrimage thumb sanchi stupa a traditional pilgrimage place in india pilgrimage has been described by scholars as summit of all devotional practices in buddhism according to early texts it is advocated by buddha himself he suggests to pay respect to four places that is place where he is born place where he has first attained enlightenment bodh gaya place where he has given his first formal teaching and finally place where he has attained to his physical death indeed to dispel any doubt about usefulness of such pilgrimage buddha states that he accepts in advance all gifts presented to memorial places such as or stupas and places of pilgrimage such offerings and pilgrimage are therefore considered just as fruitful after he has died as when he was still alive pilgrimage to these four sites in india especially to bodh gaya has been popular in ancient times and is now popular again though on a much larger scale than before among four sites bodh gaya is considered by many to be most important buddha is believed to have realized truth there that lies at foundation of buddhism alt monk meditating in front of a large tree with an ancient monument behind it left thumb according to early buddhist scriptures buddha himself recommends to go for pilgrimage to place where he attained enlightenment that is bodh gaya other places were later added particularly in other countries where pilgrimage to original sites would be daunting in traditional buddhist countries such as sri lanka myanmar and tibet bodhi trees ancient relics and other holy places are also visited as part of pilgrimages in 11th century japan an institutional system was developed called in which various parts of japan s geography came to be regarded as symbols of buddhist teaching or to stand for certain bodhisattvas or important historical figures in japanese buddhism numerous pilgrimage routes were developed to honor these sites as narratives about them were written down and monasteries and shrines were established on them in tibetan buddhism many pilgrimage guides have been written with practical instructions for pilgrim but also to describe mystical vision which accompanies pilgrimage buddhists might go on pilgrimage for several reasons to gain merit to remind themselves of buddha s life to themselves with spiritual power of pilgrimage places and its artifacts as a promise made to a in exchange for favors to gain protection from devas that protect pilgrimage places or to bring harmony to their family furthermore pilgrims might want to dedicate good karma of trip to their ill or deceased relatives but often pilgrimage is simply done to enjoy nature or cultural settings to escape city life or out of nostalgia for past just like pilgrimages in any other religion pilgrimage gives devotees chance to remove themselves from their everyday social economic position in society and to become part of another kind of community characterized by a new ambiguous status in some buddhist countries pilgrimages must be done on foot sometimes pilgrims also perform ascetic or devotional practices such as having a cold bath as part of visits or prostrating along path pilgrimages are sometimes done in certain periods such as in sri lanka on days of observance or in certain seasons and in tibetan buddhism as scheduled by a twelve year cycle furthermore in modern times buddhist pilgrimage has often been done as a political statement against certain regimes examples of well known pilgrimage sites are temple of tooth in sri lanka shwe dagon temple in myanmar mount wutai and mount tai in china kumano shrine in japan and stupa in nepal other practices another form of devotional respect is to three times around a buddha image or holy place keeping it to right traditionally it is recommended to do this clockwise with right shoulder facing image or place and if possible bared holy place which is circumambulated can be a temple a monastery a mountain or a city this custom is also symbolic for sun moving around central cosmic mountain and is practiced in groups at yearly festivals as well as at funerals it is usually performed on foot but sometimes in a vehicle one practice that has been more controversial than most devotional practices in buddhism is practice of self immolation in buddhist teaching human body is regarded as without intrinsic value but becomes valuable depending on how it is used practice of self immolation is based on this idea according to which abandoning body in doing good deeds is regarded as a form of heroism although practice seems to go against buddhist concept of middle way buddhist teaching does emphasize dealing with natural urges of body thumb self immolation of thich quang duc during buddhist crisis in vietnam leftthe practice became more common in china during fourth until tenth century ce with japan following suit in kamakura period practice was first described in twenty third chapter of lotus sutra in which bodhisattva set his own body on fire as a supreme offering to a buddha apart from these indian origins practice may have been preceded by indigenous practices to conjure up rain regarded by some as a highly developed form of doing good devotees burnt parts of their body such as an arm or a finger in honor of sutra or hoping to be reborn in a pure land burning oneself fully as an act of devotion also known as was a highly respected practice in china at time and was often organized as a public event attended by emperors and officials during vietnam war buddhist monks used self immolation as a way to express political dissent when monk thich quang duc performed self immolation in 1963 this was widely featured in international press reports this contributed to us government eventually withdrawing from supporting president diem who suppressed buddhism self immolation became more and more subject of criticism from eight century ce onward from confucianists state officials and also from buddhist monks themselves in 21st century ce practice has become uncommon nevertheless up until 1990s and 2000s vietnamese monks were still reported to practice self immolation and chinese and korean monks still offered their fingers burning them places thumb sign adorning grand entrance of buddha tooth relic temple in singapore although almost all devotional practices can be done in one s own home it is custom to meet in local temple on festivals and days of observance buddhist temples often contain dormitories for monastics who meditate and study there and lead devotional practices at temple theravada zen and chan buddhist temples usually only have an image of gautama buddha in main room perhaps combined with images of his close disciples sariputra and maudgalyayana in mahayana buddhist temples more diversity can be found including different heavenly buddhas bodhisattvas and sometimes a series of disciples disciples that have achieved personal enlightenment buddhist temple usually contains a room for meetings meditations or preaching and may contain a stupa with relics or buddhist texts or a bodhi tree this type of room in a temple is called or buddha s dwelling place whereas dormitories for monastics are called or sangha s dwelling place in chinese japanese and korean temples room with stupas and relics is often a separate hall from teaching hall and there is usually a separate hall with buddha images as well in modern mahayana temples in west however temple s structure is often simplified last of all in vajrayana temples iconic devotional paintings called can be found as well as mandalas which picture vajrayana cosmology thumb it is common in buddhist temples to take off one s shoes or change them stupas and buddha images may be donated by a single supporter or by a community of devotees motivated by merit making motives in most buddhist traditions buddha images are regarded as more than just representations but as actually imbued with a spiritual power connected to three refuges and faith of devotee as reflected in consecration ceremonies and legendary accounts similarly relics are also widely honored because they are seen as an embodiment of buddha believed by some scholars to be a buddhist invention devotion to relics brings buddhism from a distant age and place closer to home also some buddhists believe relics have supernatural abilities such as ability to reproduce themselves temples with well known relics such as temple of tooth in sri lanka are worshipped by thousands of people per day and well known relics often provide both religion as region with a cultural identity stupas that contain relics are not just honored for relics however by some buddhists they are also seen as symbolizing state of enlightenment buddhist temples may be built in a place deemed sacred following principles of country s sacred geography or because of a pilgrimage route it is common in buddhist temples to take off one s shoes or change them in ancient times shoes were a status symbol and taking them off was therefore an expression of humility it might also have been done to keep temple grounds clean another custom is to put buddha image on highest spot in room and devotees will prevent raising their head higher than image or point their feet at image festivals and observance days thumb vesak ceremony held in borobudur indonesia all buddhist traditions have festivals during which devotion is practiced many of these are buddhist in origin others are a response to pre buddhist cultural traditions agricultural year cycle certain national deities or important events in local history in many theravada countries traditional new year is celebrated mid year during which certain buddhist customs are observed this includes ceremonies for reflection on misdeeds and resolving to do good and release of animals other important festivals are vesak puja day and vesak is day that celebrates birth enlightenment and final enlightenment after death of buddha gautama in some countries however these three events are celebrated as separate days in east asian countries many of these festivals are also celebrated but other festivals with pre buddhist origins are held as well combined with buddhist elements an example of this is ghost festival on which is recollected that maudgalyayana dedicated good karma to his deceased mother out of gratitude to her this festival was a response to confucian ideals of filial piety some buddhist festivals honor a certain dharma text for example thai festival of thet is dedicated to recitation of jataka a story about kingship and merit making apart from festivals in theravada buddhism there are also observance days following ancient indian lunar calendar uposatha days are observed by more strict devotees who will go to their local temple to give food take upon themselves five or eight precepts listen to teachings and meditate in other traditions there are also monthly or bimonthly weekly or daily observances moreover monastic rains retreat vassa is for many devotees a time to focus more on chanting and meditation see also alms
