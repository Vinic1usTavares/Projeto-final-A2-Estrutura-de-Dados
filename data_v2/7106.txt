spasim is a 32 player 3d networked space flight simulation game and first person space shooter developed by jim bowery for plato computer network and released in march 1974 game features four teams of eight players each controlling a planetary system where each player controls a spaceship in 3d space in first person view two versions of game were released in first gameplay is limited to flight and space combat and in second systems of resource management and strategy were added as players cooperate or compete to reach a distant planet with extensive resources while managing their own systems to prevent destructive revolts spasim is considered along with maze war to be one of joint ancestors of first person shooter genre due to uncertainty over which game was created first game was developed in 1974 at university of illinois at urbana champaign bowery was assisted in second version by fellow student frank canzolino bowery encountered plato system of thousands of graphics terminals remotely connected to a set of mainframe computers that january while assisting a computer art class he was inspired to create original game by multiplayer plato action game empire and second version by concept of positive sum games spasim was potentially first 3d first person video game with title contested by maze war at one point bowery offered a reward to any person who could offer proof that spasim was not first he also claims that spasim was direct initial inspiration for several other plato games including airace 1974 and panther 1975 gameplay thumb right screenshot of gameplay screen at top shows player s view of a space station while bottom half of screen displayed details about ship s position and direction spasim is a multiplayer space flight simulation game in which up to 32 players fly spaceships around 4 planetary systems players are grouped into teams of up to 8 players with 1 team per system players add their names to rosters of four teams named and lasers each with a different type of spaceship from star trek players control their ships in first person in a 3d environment with other ships appearing as wireframe models there is no hidden line removal implemented on models meaning that models appear see through and player can see wireframe of back of an object as well positions of planets and other players relative to player update once a second players can fire phasers and torpedoes to destroy other players ships spasim was intended to include an educational component players enter instructions to move their spaceships using polar coordinates e g altitude and azimuth along with acceleration while their position in space is given in cartesian coordinates players can switch their perspective between their ship their starting space station and torpedoes they have launched in addition to changing angle and magnification zoom of their camera all controls are entered via single key text inputs gameplay of original version of spasim is focused on space flight and combat an updated version of game was released a few months after initial release that added strategy and resource management each team s planet has resources population levels and standard of living players spend their planet s supply of anti entropy on powering their spaceship or managing their planet teams compete or cooperate in order to gain enough resources to reach a far distant planet mismanaging a team s resources or over reliance on combat causes dissatisfaction on players planets and can lead to a planetary proletariat revolt which greatly reduces planet s population and resources development thumb a plato terminal with attached keyboard in 1981 game was developed by jim bowery in early 1974 for university of illinois at urbana champaign s plato computer network which by 1970s supported several thousand graphical terminals distributed worldwide running processes on nearly a dozen different networked mainframe computers bowery started working on game titled spasim as a contraction of space simulation as a student in january 1974 while assisting professor leif brush with first computer art class at university brush showed bowery and class a plato graphics terminal in lindquist center on campus and bowery intrigued signed up for an individual studies course to assist professor bobby brown who ran lab with this terminal bowery learned to program on computer helped by other users such as john developer of empire 1973 and charles miller who later made moria 1975 bowery was inspired by multiplayer and graphical nature of empire a space action game to create something in same vein taking code for displaying a 3d vector graphics perspective previously written by don lee and ron resch he designed 3d versions of ships from empire and began adding more features to game including weapons inspired by star trek first version of spasim subtitled an investigation of holographic space was launched in march 1974 a few months later bowery set out to rewrite game with assistance of metallurgy student frank canzolino at first pair optimized 3d graphics of game but bowery inspired by concept of positive sum games or cooperative games decided to delete entire game code from mainframe and start over building in strategy and resource management elements into base game instead of adding them on top bowery designed new version to penalize over reliance on combat and incentivize cooperation as part of a philosophical stance on what he believed actual space expansion would require second version of spasim was developed over course of three days and pair released it in july 1974 bowery released occasional updates to game until he graduated afterwards it was maintained by steve lionel who added a tutorial on navigating in polar coordinates legacy bowery claims that spasim had quite a following on plato network and that there was a late night cult that was devoted to game though emphasis in second version of strategy over combat cut playerbase in half spasim is potentially first 3d first person game ever made at one point bowery had a standing offer of 500 to any person who could find proof of an earlier such game or 200 for an earlier game that mathematically modeled population versus resource availability and included space resources other possible contender for title is maze war a maze game which ran on two connected computers at nasa in 1973 and was expanded to a full multiplayer game some time in 1974 spasim is considered along with maze war to be one of joint ancestors of first person shooter genre due to uncertainty over relative release dates according to bowery initial release of spasim inspired silas warner one of developers of empire to use bowery s code in turn to develop flight simulator game airace for plato system in 1975 which then lead to first another flight simulator and then tank driving game panther later that year spasim has also been cited as a spiritual of elite 1984 and
