impala aepyceros melampus is a medium sized antelope found in eastern and southern africa sole member of genus aepyceros it was first described to european audiences by german zoologist hinrich lichtenstein in 1812 two subspecies are recognised common impala and larger and darker black faced impala impala reaches at shoulder and weighs it features a glossy reddish brown coat male s slender lyre shaped horns are long active mainly during day impala may be gregarious or territorial depending upon climate and geography three distinct social groups can be observed territorial males bachelor herds and female herds impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti predator strategy browsers as well as grazers impala feed on monocots dicots forbs fruits and acacia pods whenever available an annual three week long rut takes place toward end of wet season typically in may rutting males fight over dominance and victorious male courts female in oestrus gestation lasts six to seven months following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover calves are suckled for four to six months young males forced out of all female groups join bachelor herds while females may stay back impala is found in woodlands and sometimes on interface ecotone between woodlands and savannahs it inhabits places close to water while black faced impala is confined to southwestern angola and kaokoland in northwestern namibia common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in gabon and southern africa international union for conservation of nature iucn classifies impala as a species of least concern black faced subspecies has been classified as a vulnerable species with less than 1 000 individuals remaining in wild as of 2008 etymology

described by german zoologist martin hinrich carl lichtenstein in 1812 in 1984 palaeontologist elisabeth vrba opined that impala is a sister taxon to given its resemblance to hartebeest a 1999 phylogenetic study by alexandre of national centre for scientific research paris and colleagues based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses showed that impala forms a clade with suni neotragus moschatus this clade is sister to another formed by bay duiker dorsalis and klipspringer oreotragus oreotragus an rrna and b nuclear sequence analysis in 2003 also supported an association between aepyceros and neotragus following cladogram is based on 1999 study up to six subspecies have been described although only two are generally recognised on basis of mitochondrial data though morphologically similar subspecies show a significant genetic distance between them and no hybrids between them have been reported a m melampus lichtenstein 1812 known as common impala it occurs across eastern and southern africa range extends from central kenya to south africa and westward into southeastern angola a m bocage 1879 known as black faced impala it is restricted to southwestern africa occurring in northwestern namibia and southwestern angola according to vrba impala developed from an alcelaphine ancestor she noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms impala has continued in its basic form for at least five million years several fossil species have been discovered including a from pliocene of ethiopia oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than modern form but otherwise very similar in all aspects to latter this implies that impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times its gregarious nature variety in diet positive population trend defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with tick feeding oxpeckers could have played a role in preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour description thumbnail upright alt a grooming male at serengeti national park close view of a male with characteristic lyre shaped horns white tail and several black markings impala is a medium sized slender antelope similar to kob or grant s gazelle in build head and body length is around males reach approximately at shoulder while females are tall males typically weigh and females sexually dimorphic females are hornless and smaller than males males grow slender lyre shaped horns long horns strongly ridged and divergent are circular in section and hollow at base their arch like structure allows interlocking of horns which helps a male throw off his opponent during fights horns also protect skull from damage glossy coat of impala shows two tone reddish brown back and tan flanks these are in sharp contrast to white underbelly facial features include white rings around eyes and a light chin and snout ears long are tipped with black black streaks run from buttocks to upper hindlegs bushy white tail long features a solid black stripe along midline impala s colouration bears a strong resemblance to gerenuk which has shorter horns and lacks black thigh stripes of impala impala has scent glands covered by a black tuft of hair on hindlegs sebaceous glands concentrated on forehead and dispersed on torso of dominant males are most active during mating season while those of females are only partially developed and do not undergo seasonal changes there are four nipples of subspecies black faced impala is significantly larger and darker than common impala melanism is responsible for black colouration distinctive of black faced impala is a dark stripe on either side of nose that runs upward to eyes and thins as it reaches forehead other differences include larger black tip on ear and a bushier and nearly 30 longer tail in black faced impala impala has a special dental arrangement on front lower jaw similar to toothcomb seen in strepsirrhine primates which is used during allogrooming to comb fur on head and neck and remove ectoparasites ecology and behaviour thumbnail alt an impala mid air during a leap impala can leap up to impala is diurnal active mainly during day though activity tends to cease during hot midday hours they feed and rest at night three distinct social groups can be territorial males bachelor herds and female herds territorial males hold territories where they may form harems of females territories are demarcated with urine and faeces and defended against juvenile or male intruders bachelor herds tend to be small with less than 30 members individuals maintain distances of from one another while young and old males may interact middle aged males generally avoid one another except to spar female herds vary in size from 6 to 100 herds occupy home ranges of mother calf bond is weak and breaks soon after weaning juveniles leave herds of their mothers to join other herds female herds tend to be loose and have no obvious leadership allogrooming is an important means of social interaction in bachelor and female herds in fact impala appears to be only ungulate to display self grooming as well as allogrooming in allogrooming females typically groom related impalas while males associate with unrelated ones each partner grooms other six to twelve times thumb left an impala stotting social behaviour is influenced by climate and geography as such impala are territorial at certain times of year and gregarious at other times and length of these periods can vary broadly among populations for instance populations in southern africa display territorial behaviour only during few months of rut whereas in eastern african populations territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season moreover territorial males often tolerate bachelors and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of year a study of impala in serengeti national park showed that in 94 of males territoriality was observed for less than four months impala is an important prey species for several carnivores such as cheetahs leopards and lions antelope displays two characteristic can jump up to over vegetation and even other impala covering distances of up to other type of leap involves a series of jumps in which animal lands on its forelegs moves its hindlegs mid air in a kicking fashion lands on all fours stotting and then rebounds it leaps in either manner in different directions probably to confuse predators at times impala may also conceal itself in vegetation to escape eye of predator most prominent vocalisation is loud roar delivered through one to three loud snorts with mouth closed followed by two to ten deep grunts with mouth open and chin and tail raised a typical roar can be heard up to away scent gland secretions identify a territorial male impalas are sedentary adult and middle aged males in particular can hold their territories for years parasites thumb impala have a symbiotic relationship with oxpeckers common ixodid ticks collected from impala include amblyomma boophilus decoloratus ixodes rhipicephalus appendiculatus and r in zimbabwe heavy infestation by ticks such as r appendiculatus has proved to be a major cause behind high mortality of ungulates as they can lead to tick paralysis impala have special adaptations for grooming such as their characteristic dental arrangement to manage ticks before they engorge however extensive grooming needed to keep tick load under control involves risk of dehydration during summer lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of teeth a study showed that impala adjust time devoted to grooming and number of grooming bouts according to seasonal prevalence of ticks impala are symbiotically related to oxpeckers mikula p j albrecht t p 2018 large scale assessment of mutualistic associations between african birds and herbivorous mammals using internet photos peerj 6 https doi org 10 peerj 4520 which feed on ticks from those parts of antelope s body which animal cannot access by itself such as ears neck eyelids forehead and underbelly impala is smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated in a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite presence of other animals such as coke s hartebeest grant s gazelle thompson s gazelle and topi a possible explanation for this could be that because impala inhabits woodlands which can have a high density of ticks impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of body surface another study showed that oxpeckers prefer ears over other parts of body probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation lice recorded from impala include damalinia aepycerus d elongata linognathus aepycerus and l in a study a medication against parasites was found to have an effect on boophilus decoloratus and linognathus species though not on damalinia species in a study of impala in south africa number of worms in juveniles showed an increase with age reaching a peak when impala turned a year old this study recorded worms of genera such as and some of these showed seasonal variations in density diet thumbnail alt a herd grazing in maasai mara impala browse as well as graze either may predominate depending upon availability of resources diet comprises monocots dicots forbs fruits and acacia pods whenever available impala prefer places close to water sources and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce an analysis showed that diet of impala is composed of 45 monocots 45 dicots and 10 fruits proportion of grasses in diet increases significantly to as high as 90 after first rains but declines in dry season browsing predominates in late wet and dry season and diets are nutritionally poor in mid dry season when impala feed mostly on woody dicots another study showed that proportion in diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males impala feed on soft and nutritious grasses such as tough tall grasses such as heteropogon contortus and themeda triandra are typically avoided impala on periphery of herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in centre a foraging individual will try to defend patch it is feeding on by lowering its head a study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75 5 of day in late dry season decreases through rainy season and is minimal in early dry season 57 8 reproduction thumbnail alt males lock horns in a mating fight two males fighting for dominance males are sexually mature by time they are a year old though successful mating generally occurs only after four years mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females females can conceive after they are a year and a half old oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours and occurs every 12 29 days in non pregnant females annual three week long rut breeding season begins toward end of wet season typically in may growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before breeding season resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality glands are heavier testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors and neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during rut mating tends to take place between full moons right thumb sounds of rutting male rutting males fight over dominance often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another they walk stiffly and display their neck and horns males desist from feeding and allogrooming during rut probably to devote more time to garnering females in oestrus male

from her male flicks his tongue and may nod vigorously female allows him to lick her vulva and holds her tail to one side male tries mounting female holding his head high and clasping her sides with his forelegs mounting attempts may be repeated every few seconds to every minute or two male loses interest in female after first copulation though she is still active and can mate with other males gestation lasts six to seven months births generally occur in midday female will isolate herself from herd when labour pain begins perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic a single calf is born and is immediately concealed in cover for first few weeks of its birth fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother s herd calves are suckled for four to six months young males forced out of group join bachelor herds while females may stay back distribution and habitat thumb right alt a herd in tanzania impala inhabit woodlands impala inhabits woodlands due to its preference for shade it can also occur on interface ecotone between woodlands and savannahs places close to water sources are preferred in southern africa populations tend to be associated with mopane and acacia woodlands habitat choices differ senegal woodlands are preferred in wet season and a savannahs in dry season another factor that could influence habitat choice is vulnerability to predators impala tend to keep away from areas with tall grasses as predators could be concealed there a study found that reduction of woodland cover and creation of shrublands by african bush elephants has favoured impala population by increasing availability of more dry season browse earlier woodland which has now declined due to elephants provided minimum browsing for impala newly formed capparis shrubland on other hand could be a key browsing habitat impala are generally not associated with montane habitats however in kwazulu natal impala have been recorded at altitudes of up to above sea level historical range of impala spanning across southern and eastern africa has remained intact to a great extent although it has disappeared from a few places such as burundi range extends from central and southern kenya and northeastern uganda in east to northern kwazulu natal in south and westward up to namibia and southern angola black faced impala is confined to southwestern angola and kaokoland in northwestern namibia status of this subspecies has not been monitored since 2000s common impala has a wider distribution and has been introduced in protected areas in gabon and across southern africa threats and conservation thumb right impala tracks international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn classifies impala as a species of least concern overall black faced impala however is classified as a vulnerable species as of 2008 fewer than 1 000 were estimated in wild though there are no major threats to survival of common impala poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to decline of black faced impala as of 2008 population of common impala has been estimated at around two million according to some studies translocation of black faced impala can be highly beneficial in its conservation around a quarter of common impala populations occur in protected areas such as okavango delta botswana masai mara and kajiado kenya kruger national park south africa and serengeti national parks and selous game reserve tanzania luangwa valley zambia and zambezi valley zimbabwe rare black faced impala has been introduced into private farms in namibia and etosha national park population densities vary largely from place to place from less than one impala per square kilometre
