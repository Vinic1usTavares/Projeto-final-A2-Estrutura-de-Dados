together by alan bishop and released by ipecac recordings crime and dissonance features work ranging from later 1960s to early 1980s and contains scores taken from films of several different genres collection focuses on morricone s lesser known soundtrack work with ipecac founder mike patton consciously wishing to distance it from similar compilations released on october 18 2005 crime and dissonance has been met with favorable reviews by critics album has attracted comments on morricone s experimental and innovative compositional style often in contrast to spare sounding westerns he is known for production crime and dissonance a collection of ennio morricone s film scores from 1970s was conceived as a follow up to dagored releases morricone 2000 and morricone 2001 however that label abandoned project and mike patton of ipecac recordings decided to release it instead morricone had no input in project instead track listing was assembled by alan bishop bishop had previously assembled morricone 2000 and morricone 2001 collections as well all three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period spanning late 1960s to early 1980s but concentrating primarily on early 1970s bishop had been given a list of films whose scores were available to use in collection he set about compiling two disc set from there however final song on album an eleven minute section from soundtrack to un uomo da was not included in list of available material project was delayed for some time while bishop waited for record label sugar music to license song patton founder of ipecac recordings has described his admiration for morricone s writing feeling that composer turned what could be banal surface style pop into really deep orchestrated tense and compelling music patton considers morricone to be one of his favorite composers and wanted compilation to serve as a fitting tribute he felt it was imperative for crime and dissonance to focus on morricone s lesser known work as it had to compete with a large back catalogue of similar compilations to this end patton and bishop focused on morricone s more experimental work which patton has compared to music of brazilian tropicalia group os mutantes patton has praised bishop s work on project calling him a big morricone scholar and has described crime and dissonance as one ipecac releases he is most proud of crime and dissonance features liner notes written by composer john zorn who had previously reinterpreted morricone s work on album big album s title reflects range of genres covered by films whose scores have been included with collection gathering music from horror suspense mafia and period movies including several pieces taken from dario argento s giallo film l uccello dalle di cristallo however album itself only lists titles of films omitting context in which music was originally presented and leaving compositions to speak for themselves track listing reception crime and dissonance

flowed into one another well and noted range of genres collection represented danny of roanoke times has commented on wide variety of styles collection contains adding that it proves morricone always delivered something interesting stylus magazine cameron macdonald rated album an a finding that kitsch mass market appeal of morricone s better known western scores made crime and dissonance a more relevant record however macdonald felt that album s second disc was weaker of two finding that slapstick nature of some of its pieces seemed out of place dave gurney of tiny mix tapes rated crime and dissonance three and a half out of five calling it a group of morricone s most uncompromising works however gurney questioned target audience of collection believing that it would not be likely to appeal to casual listeners while not presenting much new material for dedicated morricone collectors an anonymous review for stranger described album as proof that there s much more to maestro than his revered spaghetti western work for sergio leone review highlighted range of genres present in collection calling end result a deluge of otherworldly endlessly fascinating sounds see also ipecac
