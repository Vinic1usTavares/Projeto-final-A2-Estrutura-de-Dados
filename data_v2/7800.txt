book of taliesyn is second studio album by english rock band deep purple recorded only three months after shades of deep purple and released by tetragrammaton records in october 1968 just before their first us tour name for album was taken from 14th century book of taliesin structure of album is similar to that of their first with four original songs and three rearranged covers although tracks are longer arrangements more complex and sound more polished than on shades of deep purple music style is a mix of psychedelic rock progressive rock and hard rock with several inserts of classical music arranged by band s keyboard player jon lord deep purple s american record label aimed for a hippie audience which was very influential in us at time but chart results of album and singles were not as high as expected this setback did not hinder success of three month us tour when band played in many important venues and festivals and received positive feedback from audiences and press deep purple were still an underground band which played in small clubs and colleges in united kingdom largely ignored by media and public british record company emi did not release book of taliesyn until june 1969 on new underground prog rock sub label harvest records and album did not chart even release of new single emmaretta and new dates in uk in summer 1969 did not increase album sales or popularity of deep purple in uk perception of album has changed in later years and it has been reviewed more favourably background deep purple were booked for a long tour in united states starting in october 1968 as a result of unexpected success in us and canada of their first album shades of deep purple fronted by hit single hush thompson p p 4 single released in june had reached no 4 in us singles chart and no 2 in canada and was main reason of their sudden popularity overseas situation was quite opposite at home where band had been heavily criticized by media and audiences thompson pp 44 47 in july band and crew relocated from west sussex to london bloom p 114 their management rented a house at 13 second avenue acton vale which was used as living quarters and to prepare for upcoming us tour when they were not away for gigs or promotion guitarist ritchie blackmore went to live there with his german fiancee babs hardie executives at tetragrammaton records deep purple s american label thought it would be more profitable to have a new album to promote during us tour besides already successful shades of deep purple thompson p 47 moreover eight tracks recorded in may for deep purple s debut album and performed live in british gigs of july and august were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in us for these reasons they were pushed back into studio just a couple of months before tour began even though their debut album had not been released in united kingdom yet composition and recording request of record label to record a new album only three months after their debut found band unprepared because intense activity after release of shades of deep purple had left very little time for writing and rehearsing new songs thompson p 47 48 under pressure musicians eventually came up with four lengthy original compositions but to fill up new album they reworked and expanded three cover songs following again example of american band vanilla fudge which many band members admired first was kentucky woman a hit single for neil diamond in 1967 which deep purple performed live at a bbc session in august thompson p 48 though written by diamond deep purple s version musically leans toward style of mitch ryder s recording of devil with a blue dress on second cover was river deep mountain high a single released by ike tina turner in 1966 finally 1965 beatles song we can work it out was chosen after paul mccartney himself had reportedly expressed appreciation for deep purple s version of help on first of august 1968 deep purple entered de lane lea studios in kingsway london with producer derek lawrence and sound engineer brian who had both worked on their previous album tetragrammaton s advance of 250 000 had been used to book two weeks in studio a time which covered songwriting rehearsals and recording sessions bloom p 115 time was granted in larger amount than for making of shades of deep purple in may feeding band s ambition of coming up with better original material than their previous effort deep purple recorded shield and anthem on first day on first song ian paice plays a complex drum pattern which sounds like a repeated clash of glass objects while second one required a string quartet for baroque style interlude in middle bloom p 116 following days they proceeded with composition and recording of exposition we can work it out and of original track listen learn read on on 19 august they concluded these sessions with recording of kentucky woman and of heavy and up tempo instrumental wring that neck which came out from a tight collaboration between blackmore and bass player nick simper name wring that neck comes from a phrase band used when they were playing live describing bassist or guitarist really bursting at their instruments to create a hard noise i e squeezing or wringing neck of guitar another instrumental called playground was written and recorded on 18 august but lyrics were never completed and it was eventually discarded river deep mountain high was always intended as final track so its recording was postponed until other tracks were finished musicians perfectionism required extra time to complete track and it was taped only on 10 october a long time after planned deadline for studio recording mixing was supposed to be overseen by band members but their schedule in october was so tight that lawrence did it without them robinson p 6 this dismayed band at first but sound turned out cleaner heavier and more polished than on their debut tapes were mixed in both mono and stereo but mono tapes were trashed as neither tetragrammaton nor emi deep purple s british label had any use for them release thumb left 200px original american river deep mountain high single cover from 1969 album was released in united states in october 1968 just in time for tour american label insisted on changing title of instrumental wring that neck considered too violent to hard road track was used as b side of single kentucky woman issued in december 1968 book of taliesyn reached no 54 in us chart and no 48 in canadian chart single peaked at no 38 in us and received much airplay bloom p 120 but did not replicate success of hush in an attempt to improve sales of album a shorter and heavily edited version of river deep mountain high was released as a single exclusively in united states and canada in february 1969 with listen learn read on as b side it reached no 53 and no 42 respectively in two countries and was not a success charting lower than kentucky woman robinson p 7 album was distributed in canada in 1968 and japan in june 1969 by polydor records emi delayed release of album in uk to june 1969 after band had come back from us and set up a proper tour of their home country thompson p 50 by that time band had already recorded and released their third album deep purple in us and recorded a single with a new line up robinson p 10 book of taliesyn was first release by harvest records a new sub label which emi executives had devised as an outlet for british underground progressive rock groups thompson p 63 kentucky woman with wring that neck as b side was only single released in uk in december 1968 but it was retired after only six weeks robinson p 8 just as had happened with shades of deep purple year before both album and single received little promotion and were widely overlooked selling much less in uk than overseas book of taliesyn was reissued many times all over world often in a set with two other albums recorded by mk i line up besides original issues most significant version of album is remastered cd edition of 2000 by emi which contains previously unreleased recordings taken from sessions of august and december 1968 and from tv shows appearances as bonus tracks all songs were digitally remastered by peter mew at abbey road studios in london other notable re releases of album include a white vinyl collector s edition issued in 2015 for a record store day musical style musical style of book of taliesyn is a mix of progressive rock psychedelic rock and hard p 49 and different observers think that in this album band is more mature and in greater control of its own means of expression robinson p 5 critics highlight how compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album deep purple biographer dave thompson writes that a dark mood permeates book of taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock citing influences of american band doors in original tracks written for this album influence of keyboard player jon lord s classical music upbringing is felt strongly in all tracks but this time he was not main person responsible for songwriting and arrangements which are considered by critics deep purple s first real group effort lord s interest in mixing rock and classical music would culminate in late 1969 with his concerto for group and orchestra suite but he already defined deep purple as a symphonic rock band in a 1968 interview nick simper complained about lord s excessive influence in composition and arrangements in a 1983 interview which he said resulted in a lack of direction for band anthem is perhaps band s deepest venture into classical music on a regular studio album with its baroque style interlude reminiscent of a bach fugue written by lord and performed using mellotron and string quartet a similar approach can be found on king crimson s debut album released a year later rearranged excerpts from second movement of beethoven s symphony no 7 and tchaikovsky s ouverture fantasy romeo and juliet are in instrumental intro exposition while river deep mountain high is introduced by notes of also sprach zarathustra written in 1896 by richard strauss and very popular after its inclusion in film 2001 a space odyssey screened earlier in 1968 wring that neck and kentucky woman show more traces of heavier music that band would embrace in their 70s albums with mk ii line up blackmore s guitar work is generally praised by critics however in a recent interview guitarist defined album as lame and remembered that he had not yet found his own style of guitar playing at time of recording lyrics written by band s singer rod evans are very functional to music and marketing deep purple s record label was building up for american hippie audience evans took inspiration for fantasy themed listen learn read on which contains lyrical reference to album s title from 14th century welsh manuscript book of taliesin a collection of poems attributed to 6th century poet taliesin title and cover art of album were also inspired by manuscript instead psychedelia and its rituals play a large part in lyrics of shield simper thinks that evans lyrics are far better than anything has ever been written in other line ups in deep purple cover art cover art and sleeve notes convey tetragrammaton s decision to aim album at vast american hippie audience which was very influential in us at time notes in particular were written in a mystical tone evoking bard taliesyn as a spiritual guide and comparing listening to songs to an exploration in band members souls original cover was drawn in pen ink and color by british illustrator and author john vernon lord who coincidentally appears to share same name as deep purple s keyboard player book of taliesyn was only record cover john vernon lord ever designed and according to artist s recent retrospective book drawing upon drawing original artwork was never returned in his book john vernon lord remembers assignment received from his agency saxon artists fee for job was ps30 minus 25 for agent john vernon lord was until recently professor of illustration at university of brighton touring deep purple arrived in california on 15 october p 117 and their first public appearance on american soil was at dating game tv show on abc on 17 october they were first rock band to perform on show thompson p 53 where jon lord was one of contestants next two days band played live in us for first time as supporting act of cream in their goodbye tour thompson p 54 concerts were held at inglewood forum near los angeles california in front of more than 16 000 people each night recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as inglewood live in california next gig at san diego was last one supporting cream whose management apparently did not appreciate cheerful reaction of audience to deep purple and dropped them bloom p 118 after a week of forced stop their american manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included san francisco international pop festival and venues on west coast thompson p 55 this opportunity was very useful for young musicians who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on road thompson p 56 this was particularly true for blackmore who developed and extended his guitar solos incorporating more improvisations tour was a success and deep purple s popularity in us received another boost from a tv appearance at playboy after dark alongside hugh hefner on 23 october 1968 band had become a much requested act and more dates were added on east coast till end of year including a two nights gig at fillmore east with creedence clearwater revival and james cotton blues band and christmas holiday shows at famous electric circus club in new york in late december band managers tony edwards and john booked some studio time in new york to record a new single after relative failure of kentucky woman and river deep mountain high bloom p 121 band recorded cover of ben e king s song oh no no no and tried lay lady lay by bob dylan and glory road by neil diamond without satisfying results record label did not publish those p 57 and a surviving take of oh no no no can be heard only in 2000 remastered edition of book of taliesyn band returned in england on 3 january 1969 and went straight into de lane lea studios to record new songs bloom p 123 recording sessions were interspersed with gigs and lasted from january to march most of songs ended up in their eponymous album which would be released by tetragrammaton in us only in june 1969 deep purple debuted new single emmaretta new material and new takes on songs from their released albums at bbc sessions for top gear radio show on 14 january song hey bop a re bop played at those sessions would later become painter starting on first of february band went on tour in denmark and uk with gigs in colleges and small clubs in an interview band commented that in comparison with what they earned in america they were actually losing a couple of thousand pounds every night they played in britain thompson p 58 last uk gig was on 22 march and on 1 april 1969 band was again on tour in us despite lack of a new album to promote it was at this time that blackmore and lord decided to change deep purple s musical style veering towards straight hard rock which led to evans and simper s dismissal in july when book of taliesyn was finally released in uk in june 1969 a few more dates in band s home country were added to promote album release even if mk ii line up with new members ian gillan and roger glover was already rehearsing and recording new material in secret thompson p 62 songs from this album were performed regularly by mk i line up exceptions were exposition we can work it out and anthem whose complex arrangements could not be easily reproduced in a live setting mk ii formation performed kentucky woman in their first shows but dropped it from set list together with few other songs from first three albums in favour of new material only instrumental wring that neck remained a staple of deep purple s performances for a couple of years working as a frame for blackmore and lord s long improvisations and coming back in set list of current line up in 2000s reception deep purple s albums and singles were almost completely ignored in uk a fact that puzzled american reporters in an interview simper tried to explain their lack of success in their home country saying that british audience was more interested in a fancy presentation than music and that blues rock was becoming very big at time in england john peel head of top gear radio show who had met band in 1968 and had great expectations for book of taliesyn was not too pleased with final result american reviewers were enthusiastic of deep purple s live performances and lack of a new successful single apparently did not ruin positive perception of band in us to point that they were often addressed as an american band band members even thought about transferring their residence to united states but abandoned idea when they learned that 21 year old paice could be drafted for vietnam war modern reviews of album go from positive to mixed joe viglione of allmusic compares deep purple s production to vanilla fudge s underlining how two bands covered songs from same authors and used similar arrangements he writes that on book of taliesyn deep purple veered more towards progressive rock than their american counterparts combining meaningful lyrics and innovative musical passages on contrary popmatters criticizes spinal lyrics and lack of hit material on album with exception of wring that neck considered perhaps first real deep purple composition blogcritics reviewers stress how original material and wring that neck in particular stands test of time well however greg finds jon lord s classical leanings a bit too much on tracks like exposition and anthem where they threaten to derail proceedings canadian journalist martin popoff in his collector s guide to heavy metal described album s sound as a mix of hard rock and psychedelic rock usually associated with bands such as mad river and 13th floor elevators he found book of taliesyn very similar in structure and just a bit darker more bombastic and theatrical than its predecessor and considered song shield a buried gem
