line 2 bloor danforth is a subway line in toronto subway system operated by toronto transit commission ttc it has 31 stations and is in length it opened on february 26 1966 and extensions at both ends were completed in 1968 and again in 1980 line runs primarily a few metres north of bloor street from its western terminus at kipling avenue to prince edward viaduct east of castle frank road after which street continues as danforth avenue and line continues running a few metres north of danforth avenue until just east of main street where it bends northeasterly and runs above grade until its eastern terminus slightly east of kennedy road on eglinton avenue subway line is closed nightly for maintenance during which blue night network bus routes provide service along route most travelled part of line is located in old toronto s midtown area known as yorkville in this area subway connects to line 1 yonge university at and yonge stations towards east where line runs parallel to danforth avenue it serves areas such as greektown also known as danforth and east danforth it then runs through a short stretch of east york to its eastern terminus in scarborough where it connects to line 3 scarborough to west of yorkville line continues along bloor street serving many communities such as annex bloor west village a short stretch in york and kingsway and islington etobicoke city centre areas in etobicoke where it terminates at kipling avenue name when bloor danforth line second subway line in city opened in 1966 it necessitated renaming first subway line to yonge line unofficially subway lines were already numbered but in october 2013 ttc announced plans to give lines an official number to help riders and visitors to navigate system new signage reflecting this change began being installed in march 2014 with and being first two stations updated subway was formerly internally known as route 601 toronto transit commission scheduled service summary board period commencing sunday july 21 1991 since mid 2010s it is publicly referred to as line 2 bloor danforth history pre subway era thumb 250px construction of prince edward viaduct in 1916 whose lower deck now carries bloor danforth line earliest mention of rapid transit along bloor danforth line s route was made in a 1910 report that was prepared by an american firm of transit consultants this study had been commissioned by a special commission which included city controller horatio clarence hocken and mayor of toronto joseph oliver in their final report consultants suggested that prince edward viaduct which spans don river valley should include a lower deck for a future subway lower deck was built but first plan for a line to use it was not made until june 15 1933 when ttc published a report which suggested construction of a subway and an expressway broadly following bloor street and danforth avenue estimated cost of project was but plan was not implemented plans for a somewhat longer route running east to west from victoria park avenue to humber river were proposed by toronto planning board in december 1943 although report did not include during fall of 1911 city of toronto put out a tender for construction of concrete tubes to carry a subway however when cost of subway was put to a referendum construction of subway tunnels was rejected before subway was built bloor streetcar line operated along route between jane street and luttrell avenue located near shoppers world danforth paired pcc streetcars or multiple units mus operated from 1950 to opening of subway line in 1966 ttc favoured this route because prince edward viaduct made it easier to build a subway across don valley and streetcar that ran along route was filled with passengers travelling from east york and scarborough to provide relief to this streetcar line and to make it easier to expand into suburbs line was built under bloor street and danforth avenue subway construction thumb 250px greenwood avenue fill area that would eventually become greenwood subway yard thumb plaque at kennedy station commemorating extension of line during period after world war ii rapid development created a need for more public transit a referendum on whether a subway should be constructed along yonge street was held on january 1 1946 and this proposal received majority support opening of yonge subway in 1954 resulted in another plan by ttc for a bloor danforth line this time without an expressway costing line was approved but was not built in 1950s there was intense debate over where second toronto subway line would run as it would affect how bus routes in toronto s suburbs would operate there were two main plans while both shared same route at outer ends ttc favoured a route that continued eastwards from christie station to pape station this plan was championed by ttc chairman allan lamport and also included an extension of yonge line from union station northwards to meet new line at st george station other plan which was proposed by city s planning department and endorsed by metro toronto chairman fred gardiner had a large u shaped diversion in centre from christie it ran south to queen street west and after following queen street eastwards to pape avenue turned north to rejoin east west route at pape station eastern routing is similar to relief line subway proposal of 2010s and its successor ontario line in 1956 toronto s midtown area was starting to experience growth there was a public debate about two schemes between two chairmen and municipalities that made up metropolitan toronto extension of yonge line along university avenue and east west bloor danforth line extension were authorized on september 5 1958 by ontario municipal board which sought a compromise between involved communities financing of project was controversial for first time financing was to be split between ttc and metro toronto incurring a property tax increase this was opposed by etobicoke long branch new toronto and scarborough who wanted project to be funded solely by ttc battle to stop project went to supreme court of canada university line opened in 1963 and bloor danforth line opened from keele station in west to woodbine station in east on february 26 1966 nine men died during its construction most of line is underground and built using cut and cover method with some sections built using a tunnel boring machine other parts of line are above ground in grade separated rail corridors line was long and ran about north of bloor street and danforth avenue cost of initial section was 200million billion in dollars once line started full operation construction of extensions to bloor danforth line began extensions to islington station in west and warden station in east opened simultaneously on may 11 1968 these were completed at a cost of million in dollars on november 21 1980 line was extended to current terminal stations of kipling station in west and kennedy station in east at a further cost of 110 million million in dollars subway operations upon opening bloor danforth line was well received a survey taken four months later showed that subway was used by 10 000 riders per hour as a result many bus and streetcar routes were either discontinued or shortened various bus and streetcar routes that connected to subway stations allowed line to continue to grow and become more sustainable line carries an average of 503 060 passengers on weekdays during 2015 operating year for first six months of operation subway was operated as a single system with trains from eglinton station running through to either keele or woodbine station while other trains connected latter two points however manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult and practice was abandoned after initial trial period leaving lower bay station abandoned in 1971 metro council insisted that zone fare system be removed to allow residents of suburbs to travel anywhere with a single fare prior to this stations west of and east of were geographically part of zone 2 for fare purposes but subway used a flat fare system so they were treated as being part of zone 1 this created problems when transferring from subway to buses which were in different zones at same location solution was a change in political thinking where subway was seen as a subsidized public service instead of a utility that needed to balance its books on october 15 1976 an arsonist lit a fire on a subway train at christie station fire destroyed four subway cars and some wall tiles and resulted in a section of subway being closed for a few days as a result middle section of christie station has different coloured trim tiles on september 19 2007 station modernization program was started this program would result in making subway system more accessible add new bus and streetcar platforms and improve connections to regional buses and go trains stations kipling station western terminus of line 2 bloor danforth is located near kipling avenue and dundas street west after going east for it meets university segment of line 1 at both and st george stations it also meets yonge street line at yonge station route s eastern terminus is located at kennedy station which is also southern terminus of line 3 scarborough line does not run under bloor street or danforth avenue except at prince edward viaduct otherwise it is offset to north in some areas it runs under parks and parking lots behind businesses on north side of street while other sections run under side streets most stations on bloor danforth line have side platforms at surface some stations are designed to be a part of a shopping area which are located above subway other stations are large facilities on surface that also contain bus and or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place designs thumb left high park station pre 1980 subway stations of bloor danforth line follow a two colour background and trim theme and use unique toronto subway typeface on stations walls tiling theme was influenced by septa s broad street subway in philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to design employed on yonge subway this design consists of two colours for tiles one for main wall tiles and another for trim tiles near ceiling of stations station names on main wall tiles use colour of trim tiles and vice versa except that some of station names of trim tiles are white instead of main wall tile colour for readability this pattern is based on a design similar to stations along university line which follow a regular pattern with some small variances which are result of multiple events one of these tiling variances is located at christie station where some of original tiles were replaced following 1976 arson attack replacement trim tiles were differently coloured due to lack of extra green trim tiles other variations to pattern can be observed at islington and warden stations which both have a tricolour design current terminus stations of kipling and kennedy stations upon initial opening in 1980 resemble second version of union subway station when they opened kipling and kennedy stations were only line 2 stations not to use toronto subway typeface however in late 2017 kipling station was redesigned to use toronto subway typeface as well leaving kennedy station being sole station on line 2 not to use typeface modernization program as stations on line have begun to show signs of aging ttc has initiated a station modernization program aimed at improving accessibility and appearances at several subway stations these modernizations include new and updated wall finishes signage lighting and public art as well as installation of elevators for accessibility needs and stations are first slated for modernization under this project and islington will also be modernized under larger capital projects aimed at greater accessibility and reconstruction of bus loading platforms construction of a second access route at broadview station was completed in 2007 this work provided direct access to bus platforms and a new streetcar platform improving traffic control within station victoria park s modernization project was completed between 2008 and 2011 to make station more functional attractive better connected to surrounding community and fully accessible second exit program was also included in station modernization projects after a fire safety audit revealed several at risk stations with only one means of access and egress from subway platform level to street some stations with only one entrance exit received a second means of access egress during major overhauls at stations such as pape and dufferin other stations such as and are scheduled to receive second exits for egress only due to potential for land expropriation and construction of exit structures in residential neighbourhoods this portion of program has become controversial as some houses need to be removed to accommodate these secondary exits however plans to add a second exit for greenwood and woodbine stations have been deferred since late february 2011 due to lack of funding fare collection all types of ttc fares are accepted at staffed subway station entrances presto cards can be purchased and loaded with money or digital monthly ttc passes at automatic fare vending machines which also sell presto 1 ride 2 ride or day pass tickets presto cards and tickets are accepted at all ttc subway station entrances on december 1 2019 all subway station collector booths will be permanently closed and replaced by roaming customer service attendants while customers will still be able to pay their fares by senior or youth ttc tickets tokens or day passes these will no longer be available for purchase at stations and no change will be given to customers who pay cash fares all line 2 stations except chester connect to surface ttc bus or streetcar routes during regular operating hours some connections require proof of payment valid proof of payment includes paper transfers free supplementary tickets obtained at point of entering transit system that allow rider to transfer to another route on a one way continuous direction with no stopovers or backtracking permitted and presto cards which provide unlimited two hour transfers in any direction across ttc network service frequency frequency for this line is 2 3 minutes during peak periods and 4 5 minutes during off peak periods 300 bloor danforth bus provides late night service to area around stations when subway is not in operation this service operates frequently along bloor street and danforth avenue between east west mall and kennedy station via danforth road brimley road eglinton avenue east north south service road crescent and kennedy road on sundays these routes operate through early morning hours because subway starts service at 8 00 a m instead of usual 6 00 a m frequency is 6 30 minutes capacity as of 2016 line 2 was running at capacity with almost 26 000 peak hour riders upgraded signalling would allow for more frequent trains and expand peak hour capacity to almost 33 000 riders by 2031 rolling stock thumb 250px an m1 series subway train one of first trains to operate on bloor danforth line first trains to operate on line 2 were m1 series subway trains which were among first subway trains to be manufactured in canada at time of construction these subway cars were longest in world as a result of camshaft propulsion controls increased speed provided by m series trains and h series trains allowed bloor danforth line to operate efficiently between islington and warden without need for a larger subway fleet as a result g series subway trains were exclusively confined to yonge university line in 1980s as h series trains took over m series trains were only used during rush hour as trains were linked to be made up of vehicles of a single class with introduction of t1 series subway trains which had been used exclusively on yonge university spadina line during their first years of service in late 1990s m1 series trains were retired from service between 1998 and 1999 due to opening of bloor danforth line and additional services that were required a new set of trains were purchased from hawker siddeley group these trains which were a part of h series were similar to m1 series trains with newer features such as electrically operated doors with introduction of t1 series subway trains h1 and h2 trains were retired from service while remaining h4 trains along with some earlier t1 series trains were shifted to bloor danforth line following introduction of toronto rocket subway trains on yonge university and sheppard lines all of t1 series trains were transferred to bloor danforth line where they replaced remaining h4 and h6 series subway trains are now only trains operating on line remaining h 4 trains were retired from revenue service throughout fall of 2011 and last cars were decommissioned on january 27 2012 they were last version of ttc trains that were not equipped with air conditioning systems but instead used ceiling fans they were also last of which to be outfitted with larger orange upholstered bench seating and were mainly used on weekdays most often during rush hour several years before their retirement h 4s also had a similar interior design based on h 2 subway cars h6 series trains which had bright orange doors and panels individual seats along with light brown floors cream walls and brown simulated wood grain panels were retired from service between 2013 and 2014 final run for last h6 series train took place on june 20 2014 in summer of 2016 a few tr trains were used on line 2 because of an air conditioning malfunction in numerous individual t1 cars combined with a hotter than average summer this was after toronto mayor john tory accepted a challenge posted on twitter to ride an overheated t1 train on line 2 during a hot summer day https www cbc ca news canada toronto john tory twitter challenge hot car 1 ttc estimated that t1 fleet s useful life would end in 2026 in 2017 ttc planned to replace t1 fleet with 62 new trains possibly using tr type from bombardier to eliminate time needed to prototype a different model however in march 2019 ttc changed tack and planned to delay purchase of new train sets by refurbishing t1 fleet to extend its life by 10 years cost of refurbishment was estimated at versus 1 required to replace t1 fleet refurbishment would not include installing automatic train control atc equipment on t1 fleet while new train sets would have included this feature and this choice will thus delay implementation of atc on line 2 by 10 years it was concurrently revealed ttc lacked facilities to store and maintain a new fleet as a new kipling which was originally planned to open in mid 2020s was now scheduled to open in 2031 depot most trains that serve bloor danforth line are stored at greenwood yard which opened with first segment of line before yard was built land was occupied by a quarry and a garbage dump due to its location next to canadian national railway tracks it was possible for trains to be delivered directly to subway cn rail tracks were converted to allow for storage of more subway trains as t1 series trains were shifted from yonge university spadina line to bloor danforth line in addition to providing storage for subway trains greenwood yard is also used to maintain vehicles that operate on line 3 scarborough as mccowan yard is only equipped for vehicle storage and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles keele yard is a small facility located between keele station and dundas west station it provides for storage and cleaning of subway trains but not for maintenance since june 18 2017 yard stores and services four trains overnight with remaining yard capacity used to store work equipment ttc is planning to build a new subway yard on site of a former cpr freight yard southwest of kipling station when ttc replaces t1 subway fleet it will need space to store new trains as they are delivered as well as new shops to service them greenwood yard will be inadequate as it is completely full with no room to expand and because its facilities are optimized for two car train sets rather than six car train sets of proposed new fleet estimated cost of new yard was of which only 7million for planning work was included in capital budget as of july 2017 ttc estimated that kipling yard would open in 2031 expansion plans scarborough subway extension scarborough subway extension sse is a proposal to replace line 3 scarborough with an eastward extension of line 2 earlier history in 1983 there was discussion of a rapid transit extension from kennedy to scarborough city centre as multiple types of technologies were examined many politicians requested a subway extension instead of then proposed streetcar line instead a medium capacity rail system known as scarborough rt was built in 2005 toronto city council again proposed to extend line northeastward as a replacement for aging scarborough rt in 2006 this proposal was then altered when scarborough councillors agreed to support plans to refurbish existing line using other light metro options for scarborough using heavy rail rapid transit like rest of toronto subway in scarborough was not yet examined in 2007 mayor david miller included refurbishment of scarborough rt using modern light rail transit as part of his transit city plan during his 2010 mayoralty campaign rob ford denounced idea of light rail transit and instead proposed to replace scarborough rt with an extension of bloor danforth line however on march 31 2011 ford agreed with provincial government that province s agency would replace scarborough rt with an elevated light rail line as part of a proposed eglinton scarborough crosstown line instead in june 2012 idea of a scarborough subway extension was a key part of toronto s proposed transit plan this plan was later rejected by provincial government and mayor rob ford three stop proposal on september 4 2013 province of ontario announced that it would fund two thirds of extension of bloor danforth line from kennedy to scarborough city centre at scarborough centre station federal government of canada would fund remaining one third toronto city council approved extension by a vote of 24 20 on october 8 2013 subway route would extend eastward towards mccowan road via eglinton avenue and danforth road and proceeding north towards intersection of mccowan road and sheppard avenue via scarborough city centre there would be three new stations at lawrence avenue east scarborough town centre and sheppard avenue east city would also raise property taxes annually over next three years digging of extension was expected to begin as early as 2018 with a completion within five years scarborough subway route still in council votes in favour of scarborough subway in december 2014 councillor glenn de baeremaeker one of city s deputy mayors proposed a fourth stop along scarborough subway extension at danforth road and eglinton avenue to reduce station spacing between kennedy station and next stop from about to at that time he was told extra station would add 100million to 150million to cost of extension however a subsequent city staff report indicated that proposed stations at lawrence and sheppard avenues had little development potential nearby and were too close to planned smarttrack stations in may 2018 doug ford during his campaign to become premier of ontario pledged to work on and pay for three stop proposal ttc however is still focusing on building one stop proposal cost of three stop proposal is estimated to be 4 6billion one stop proposal on january 20 2016 city staff issued a proposal to eliminate two of three stops on planned scarborough subway extension and to terminate line 2 bloor danforth at scarborough town centre planned intermediate stop at lawrence avenue would be eliminated along with proposed stretch to sheppard avenue this revised plan would prevent subway from competing for ridership with smarttrack s branch to markham also proposed change was to reduce cost of extension from 3 5billion to 2 5billion where 1billion saved would be used to extend line 5 eglinton east and northwards to university of toronto scarborough however most of 1billion saved was subsequently diverted back to sse to cover additional estimated construction costs for one stop subway city planning staff estimate that peak ridership of one stop extension to be 7 300 in peak hour and peak direction about half of 15 000 peak ridership considered low end to justify a subway with original three stop extension peak ridership estimate was 9 500 to 14 000 however that estimate was reduced to 7 300 because of competition from proposed smarttrack and by elimination of two of three original stops mayor john tory and scarborough councillor glenn de baeremaeker say a peak ridership of 7 300 would still be acceptable as it is still greater than 6 000 peak at terminal station kipling however a toronto star article points out there is only one station within 6 kilometres of scarborough town centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost ridership sse would carry an estimated 31 000 riders per day as compared to 66 355 riders from kipling to jane five stations and 96 660 riders from finch to york mills four stations sse performs better in ridership only against terminal of underperforming sheppard line in june 2016 estimated cost of one stop sse was revised from 2billion to 2 9billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places with new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper an additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete there is also a 300million maintenance cost to keep line 3 scarborough operating until sse s opening resulting in a total project cost of 3 2billion in february 2017 city staff reported that estimated cost of extension will increase by 150million to 3 to build a 34 bay bus terminal at scarborough town centre to be largest bus terminal on ttc system also projection for new riders for extension has been revised downwards to 2 300 per day down from 4 500 new riders estimated in summer of 2016 in march 2017 city staff estimated extension will take six years to construct with an expected opening in second quarter of 2026 project is funded on march 28 2017 city council approved design of extension via mccowan road according to transit advocate steve munro sse will be built to use only automatic train control atc this would preclude operation of t1 subway cars on extension as it would be too expensive to convert t1 cars to atc in april 2019 city staff revised estimates for sse project now known as line 2 east extension to a total of 3 with a completion date now set for end of 2027 and a delayed opening date of 2030 for bus terminal at scarborough centre in addition plans for extension to run atc upon opening were dropped and instead replaced with inclusion of enabling works allowing for atc to be implemented at a later date west to mississauga thumb right proposed western extension towards mississauga ttc s rapid transit expansion study published in 2001 identified three possible western extensions to line first was a link to sherway gardens with a station added at east mall at a later date second included an additional from sherway gardens to dixie road while a further section from dixie road to mississauga city centre which included three stations was considered but rejected due to cost and planning considerations this was replaced by a planned dundas lrt run by going from kipling to hurontario street linking to planned hurontario lrt as part of 2020 transit plan this plan was revived along with jane lrt finch west lrt extensions waterfront and others by feeling congested report by city of toronto in 2013 as an unfunded future rapid transit project which means it will be
