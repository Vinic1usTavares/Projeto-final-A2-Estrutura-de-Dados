special reserve was established on 1 april 1908 with function of maintaining a reservoir of manpower for british army and training replacement drafts in times of war its formation was part of military reforms implemented by richard haldane secretary of state for war which also created territorial force haldane originally intended that militia would provide reserve but opposition from its representatives forced him to abolish it and create special reserve instead only 60 per cent of militia transferred into new reserve and it was consistently under strength particularly in officers reservists enlisted for a six year term of service and had to undergo six months of basic training on recruitment and three to four weeks training annually special reserve was organised into battalions providing a third for each of regular army s 74 two battalion infantry regiments in addition to providing replacements to regular army special reserve was deployed on home defence duties guarding coast and key installations during first world war routine nature of its duties meant that scant attention was paid to it in regimental histories after war special reserve was abolished and militia was resurrected in 1921 to take on its former role no effort was made to restart recruitment and in 1924 new militia s functions were absorbed into supplementary reserve background traditional mistrust of a standing army resulted in a strong tradition of part time military institutions in england and later united kingdom oldest of these english militia traced its origins to military obligations of anglo saxon period and its formal existence can be dated back to first militia statutes of 1558 originally recruited by various means of compulsion british militia had become a voluntary institution by late 19th century and over 950 000 men had served in its ranks between 1882 and 1904 beckett 2011 pp 2 4 militia was alongside yeomanry and volunteer force designed to supplement regular army in defending country against invasion and insurrection and three auxiliary institutions were not liable for service overseas beckett 2008 pp 12 14 they were poorly organised with inadequate equipment and training and operated as discrete institutions integrated neither with each other nor regular army dennis p 8 to make small professional british army better able to cope with increasing commitments of defending empire a series of reforms were begun by edward cardwell in 1871 and completed by hugh childers in 1881 they were designed to foster integration of auxiliary and professional by linking militia and volunteer battalions with regular army regiments and provide means by which army battalions abroad could be reinforced by linked battalions at home chandler pp 187 189 as an example gloucestershire regiment was formed in 1881 by amalgamation of 28th north gloucestershire and 61st south gloucestershire regiments of foot which became new regiment s 1st and 2nd battalions respectively county s two militia battalions royal south gloucestershire militia and royal north gloucestershire militia became regiment s 3rd and 4th militia battalions and 1st city of bristol gloucestershire rifle volunteers and 2nd gloucestershire rifle volunteers became regiment s 1st and 2nd volunteer battalions reforms effectively ended militia s existence as an independent body capable of operating in independent units and it became little more than a source of recruitment into army with 35 per cent of its men enlisting each year reorganisation did little to ease army s manpower problems and as early as 1879 during anglo zulu war there were just 59 regular home battalions supporting 82 abroad chandler p 189 situation became untenable at turn of century when during second boer war strain placed on army severely denuded britain s home defences and forced government to appeal for volunteers to augment regular forces overseas beckett 2011 p 205 nearly 46 000 militiamen served in south africa another 74 000 were enlisted into army and five battalions were deployed as garrison troops on malta st helena and in egypt some 20 000 men of volunteer force were transferred voluntarily into army reserve and sent to south africa and yeomanry provided nucleus of separate imperial yeomanry in which over 34 000 volunteered beckett 2011 pp 200 203hay 2017 pp 175 176 formation experience in south africa prompted further debate about abilities of army to intervene in a major foreign conflict and of auxiliaries which were perceived to have performed poorly during war to support it beckett 2008 pp 26 27 reform efforts of conservative secretaries of state for war william st john brodrick and h o arnold forster foundered in face of opposition from auxiliary interests in government but their successor liberal richard haldane fared better with his efforts he improved army s capability to fight in a major foreign conflict by creating a six division expeditionary force and auxiliary forces were re organised into better trained equipped and integrated territorial force his reforms did not however escape vested interests unscathed and he was forced to make some fundamental compromises before he could be sure of successfully passing territorial and reserve forces act 1907 in parliament his plan to assign 31 000 of militia to expeditionary force allocate a further 56 000 as a reserve for it and transfer remainder into territorial force was met with opposition by militia representatives their intransigence forced haldane to abolish militia altogether and create special reserve as a separate institution to territorial force both of which were established on 1 april 1908 beckett 2011 pp 206 216 special reserve was integrated into regular army s regimental system each of 74 infantry regiments received a 3rd special reserve battalion and 23 regiments also established between them an additional 27 extra reserve battalions reserve battalions were to be 550 strong increasing to 1 500 on mobilisation with arrival of army reservists not immediately required by expeditionary force reserve was given dual role of providing replacement drafts to regiment s regular battalions and supplementing territorial force in home defence it was also haldane s intention that extra reserve battalions would be available for garrison duties in mediterranean or line of communications duties in support of expeditionary force and ambiguous statements he made later suggested that special reserve battalions might also serve overseas reservists were volunteers at least 17 years old who committed to a six year term of service six months full time basic training on enlistment and three to four weeks training annually officers were recruited from a newly created special reserve of officers though also hoped that another of his innovations university based officers training corps otc would be a source of reserve officers they were required to undergo twelve months of basic training later reduced to six and then attend an annual camp and other training schemes as required mitchinson 2005 pp 5 6 14 16 205 some 35 000 former militiamen representing about 60 per cent of militia transferred into special reserve a further 20 000 new recruits were enlisted though 6 100 of them joined army before completing their initial six months training and some 2 000 were quickly rejected on medical grounds many that did pass medical were nevertheless in poor shape physically reserve failed to attract sufficient recruits and it was consistently 16 18 per cent short of its 80 300 establishment because of long training requirement those it did attract tended to be unemployed and young in many cases too young with boys as young as 15 being accepted problem was particularly acute in officer corps only 283 of 18 000 men who had by 1912 graduated from otc had joined leaving special reserve some 50 per cent short in subalterns mitchinson 2005 pp 13 14 2011 p 222 in 1910 haldane established veteran reserve renamed later to national reserve it was recruited from former pre territorial force auxiliaries time expired territorials and ex regular soldiers faced with a shortfall in special reserve of 13 000 in 1914 haldane s successor john seely identified similar number of national reservists who had agreed to be liable for service overseas as means of bringing it up to establishment mitchinson 2005 pp 16 18 19 22 32 first world war thumb special reserve officer memorialised in book bond of sacrifice published in 1917 biographical details demonstrate how provenance of special reserve was rooted in former auxiliary institutions on outbreak of first world war on 4 august 1914 units of special reserve proceeded to their war stations for example day after war was declared 3rd battalion border regiment normally based in north of england occupied positions defending thames and medway at shoeburyness east of london on 8 august 3rd battalion gloucestershire regiment normally based in west of england was guarding royal arsenal at woolwich in london and 3rd battalion essex regiment took up defence duties closer to home at harwich on essex coast simultaneously special reserve battalions began managing not only flow of their own reservists and their regiments re activated army reservists but also assisted with second intake of kitchener s new army which altogether increased battalion strengths to 2 000 men drafts began to be sent to regular battalions 3rd essex battalion for example had already sent 300 men to regiment s 2nd battalion huge increase in numbers led to over crowded depots and 3rd battalion duke of cornwall s light infantry was so overwhelmed that it had to send many men on to other regimental depots special reserve units experienced a high turnover of men in bringing their regular battalions up to strength and once battle had been joined in france replacing casualties mitchinson 2005 p pp 60 68 at one stage in 1914 consideration was given to reinforcing central force mobile element of britain s home defence force with three special reserve divisions but idea was quickly dropped because of transient population of special reserve battalions at any given time mitchinson 2005 p 64 by september 1914 special reserve had provided 35 000 replacements and was becoming so short of trained men that its ability to perform its defence functions was in doubt problem was exacerbated by loss of many of its instructors to new army mitchinson 2005 p 77 in first year of war 3rd battalion queen s own cameron highlanders supplied over 3 800 officers and men in drafts to its regular battalions and similar efforts were made by almost every reserve battalion simkins p 313 field marshal sir john french commander in chief home forces acknowledged great difficulties special reserve faced in performing double duty of training drafts and defending our shores mitchinson 2005 p 182 in 1915 special reserve units began assisting in training of volunteer training corps battalions suffolk volunteers for example received training from instructors of 3rd battalion suffolk regiment and huddersfield volunteers were attached to special reserve battalion of seaforth highlanders mitchinson 2005 p 171 introduction of conscription early in 1916 overwhelmed new army s regiment based system of training new recruits resulting in reorganisation of its training battalions into centralised training reserve in september 1916 special reserve battalions remained responsible for training replacements for their own regular battalions but when they were at full establishment new recruits were sent to training reserve mitchinson 2014 p 2005 p 142 few casualties among special reservists caused by enemy action were as a result of air raids 3rd battalion manchester regiment lost 31 men during a zeppelin raid on cleethorpes in april 1916 and 3rd battalion suffolk regiment suffered a number of fatalities in an air raid at felixstowe in july 1917 and most losses were due to sickness or training accidents after war special reserve was only some 9 000 strong and a committee chaired by general alexander hamilton gordon concluded in july 1919 that it should be abolished by end of year it had effectively ceased to exist routine nature of its wartime duties meant that it received little attention in most post war regimental histories mitchinson 2005 pp 194 195 when territorial force was reconstituted as territorial army in 1921 special reserve was also renamed becoming militia its units retained same role acting as regiments third battalions in provision of a reserve for regular battalions but no effort was made to recruit into it in 1924 its function was absorbed by supplementary reserve which was tasked with providing regular army with specialist technical support in times of crisis beckett 2008 p 97 references bibliography category
