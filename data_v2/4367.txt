1022 when he conspired with general nikephoros xiphias against basil ii who since spring had been engaged in a campaign against georgian king george i two conspirators aimed to overthrow basil and have one of them replace him but issue of who would have precedence was unresolved and would lead to rebellion s quick downfall although xiphias held prestigious post of strategos of anatolic theme and phokas held no office but title of patrikios according to report of contemporary christian arab historian yahya of antioch great numbers of aristocrats flocked to him due to his family s influence provoking xiphias envy thumb right 250px basil ii defeats georgians miniature from madrid skylitzes rebellion of two men was particularly threatening to emperor as it took control over cappadocia and threatened to cut off his rear and leave him stranded between two enemies indeed conspirators are said to have been in contact with george i for that purpose basil first withdrew to safety of fortress of mazdat and according to john skylitzes sent an envoy to rebel leaders aiming to sow distrust between them while according to yahya emperor appointed as new governor of anatolic theme theophylact dalassenos and sent him to suppress revolt whether envoy accomplished his task is unknown but on 15 august 1022 xiphias arranged a meeting with phokas where latter was murdered by one of xiphias servants armenian sources however report rather dubiously that phokas was killed by former king of vaspurakan senekerim hovhannes or his son david or one of their followers severed head was sent to basil who mounted it on a stake and put it on public display at mazdat following death of phokas rebellion collapsed and xiphias was arrested and forced to become a monk released from threat to his rear basil ii swiftly and decisively defeated george i and imposed his terms on him other supporters of uprising were imprisoned and released in 1025 after death of basil ii and succession of his younger brother constantine viii in 1026 however constantine viii accused last surviving member of once great family bardas phokas possibly a son or nephew of nikephoros barytrachelos of plotting
