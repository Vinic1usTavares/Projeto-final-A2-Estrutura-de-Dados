deadliest against national gendarmerie at that time newest police force in mexico in ongoing mexican drug war attack made national headlines and prompted reactions from highest levels of mexican government motives behind ambush remain unclear but many have been proposed including one that suggests that gunmen ambushed police to protect their leader nemesio oseguera cervantes alias el mencho who was reportedly in vicinity over years multiple suspects have been arrested including high ranking members of el mencho s security group and officers from ocotlan s municipal police force authorities believe policemen arrested worked for cjng and aided them during ambush law enforcement presence in ocotlan increased after ambush but violent confrontations between cjng and security forces continued throughout rest of 2015 in jalisco and neighboring states background and possible motives attack was one of deadliest incidents against security forces during presidency of enrique pena nieto 2012 2018 and first and deadliest against national gendarmerie es at that time newest police force in mexico in ongoing mexican drug war 2006 present in addition attack was third deadliest against any part of mexican federal police pf force since 2006 national gendarmerie was created on 22august 2014 by pena nieto to combat crime in mexico all of officers had received training from army and had not been part of any other police force prior to joining cadets were mostly young college educated recruits and they were recruited without previous police training under rationale that this prevented corruption in national gendarmerie s ranks commanders of units were trained by police forces in united states colombia chile spain and france force was initially made up of 5 000 officers and was a subdivision of pf which consisted of roughly 36 000 members when national gendarmerie was created though members were required to have military training national gendarmerie was intended to be a civil police force capable of a rapid response to crime thumb left logo of national gendarmerie a subdivision of mexican federal police since late november 2014 around 300 national gendarmerie officials had been stationed in ocotlan to safeguard borders of jalisco michoacan and jalisco guanajuato and prevent incursion of knights templar cartel a michoacan based criminal group and a rival gang to cjng they conducted patrols after there were reports of cargo theft in region weeks prior to ambush law enforcement officers carried out several covert operations in ocotlan and entire cienega area according to intelligence reports they had information that suspected cjng leader nemesio oseguera cervantes alias el mencho was in area on day of attack police reportedly had information that el mencho was in a meeting in oxnard street in neighborhood where attack occurred investigators believe that cjng carried out attack to restrict mobility of security forces and allow el mencho to escape from area they also suspected that cjng planned attack as a retaliation for attempted crackdowns against el mencho who became one of mexico s most wanted following arrest of servando gomez martinez alias la suspected leader of knights templar cartel besides proposal that pf was in area to apprehend el mencho other sources suggested different motives one version suggests that policemen were in neighborhood investigating a previous attack against local police another account states policemen were heading to a house in centenario street an account cited by a pf official stated that attack was carried out because cjng was moving a large shipment of narcotics to ocotlan and wanted to prevent police from intervening another report suggests that cjng was in area for a meeting with municipal policemen from ocotlan after meeting went wrong policemen called pf as reinforcements and cjng did same with their gunmen when pf reached scene shootout reportedly broke out an account cited by federal government sources suggests that policemen were ambushed after one of senior officers in convoy noticed that a woman was being abused by a man when policemen got out of their vehicles and

with gunmen from beltran leyva cartel on 13july 2009 in la michoacan 12 pf officers were killed by la familia michoacana however attack in ocotlan demonstrated to police that manpower and level of coordination of cjng was greater than they had expected investigators analyzed offensive actions of cjng after ocotlan incident and drew comparisons with their modus operandi during 2015 attack that left 15 pf officers dead in san sebastian del oeste they concluded that in their ambushes against security forces cjng was employing a similar strategy cjng would cut off their victim s vehicles from
