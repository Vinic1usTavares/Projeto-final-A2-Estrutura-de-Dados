j christie d a de juana e eds handbook of birds of world alive lynx edicions barcelona retrieved 26 november 2019 this species mainly breeds in temperate regions of europe and asia most populations are migratory wintering in tropical africa and in southern asia from iran to indian subcontinent but some are resident in northwestern africa it is a bird of open countryside woodland and orchards eurasian wrynecks measure about in length and have bills shorter and less dagger like than those of other woodpeckers their upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks their underparts are cream speckled and spotted with brown their chief prey is ants and other insects which they find in decaying wood or on ground eggs are white as is case with many birds that nest in holes and a clutch of seven to ten eggs is laid during may and june these birds get their english name from their ability to turn their heads through almost 180 degrees when disturbed at nest they use this snake like head twisting and hissing as a threat display this odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft hence to put a jinx on someone taxonomy and etymology eurasian wryneck was first described by carl linnaeus in tenth edition of his systema naturae in 1758 type species came from sweden genus name jynx is from ancient greek name for this bird specific torquilla is medieval latin derived from to twist referring to strange snake head movements bird was used as a charm to bring back an errant lover bird being tied to a piece of string and whirled around english wryneck refers to same twisting movement and was first recorded in 1585 family picidae has four subfamilies picinae woodpeckers picumninae piculets jynginae wrynecks and monotypic nesoctitinae antillean piculet based on morphology and behaviour picumninae was considered to be sister clade of picinae this has now been confirmed by phylogenetic analysis and jynginae are placed basal to picinae nesoctitinae and picumninae jynginae includes one genus jynx and two species eurasian wryneck and red throated wryneck jynx resident in sub saharan africa there are six subspecies of jynx torquilla jynx torquilla chinensis hesse 1911 jynx torquilla himalayana 1959 jynx torquilla mauretanica rothschild 1909 jynx torquilla sarudnyi loudon 1912 jynx torquilla torquilla

body masses by john b dunning jr editor crc press 1992 it is a slim elongated looking bird with a body shape more like a thrush than a woodpecker upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks rump and upper tail coverts are grey with speckles and irregular bands of brown rounded tail is grey speckled with brown with faint bands of greyish brown and a few more clearly defined bands of brownish black cheeks and throat are buff barred with brown underparts are creamy white with brown markings shaped like arrow heads which are reduced to spots on lower breast and belly flanks are buff with similar markings and under tail coverts are buff with narrow brown bars primaries and secondaries are brown with rufous buff markings beak is brown long and slender with a broad base and sharp tip irises are hazel and slender legs and feet are pale brown first and second toes are shorter than others first and fourth toes point backwards and second and third point forwards a good arrangement for clinging to vertical surfaces call of eurasian wryneck is a series of repeated harsh shrill notes quee quee quee quee lasting for several seconds and is reminiscent of voice of lesser spotted woodpecker its alarm call is a short series of staccato tuck s and when disturbed on nest it hisses distribution and habitat thumb right 200px a eurasian wryneck making calls eurasian wryneck has a palearctic distribution breeding range of nominate subspecies includes all of europe from britain to urals in north it reaches arctic circle and range includes spain in southwest in south and east it intergrades with j t tschusii smaller and more reddish brown which is found in corsica italy dalmatia and parts of balkans j t mauretanica also smaller than nominate form light with whitish throat and breast is resident in algeria and morocco and possibly also balearic islands sardinia and parts of sicily j t sarudnyi considerably paler than nominate with fainter markings occurs in urals and then in a wide strip of asia through southern siberia central asia including north western himalayas to pacific coast j t chinensis breeds in eastern siberia and northeastern and central china while j t himalayana breeds in pakistan and northwestern himalayas eurasian wrynecks also inhabit island of sakhalin japan and coastal areas of southern china eurasian wryneck is only european woodpecker to undertake long distance migrations wintering area of european species is located south of sahara in a wide strip across africa extending from senegal gambia and sierra leone in west to ethiopia in east its southern limit extends to democratic republic of congo and cameroon populations from west asia use same wintering areas central and east asian breeding birds winter in indian subcontinent or southern east asia including southern japan during summer bird is found in open countryside parkland gardens orchards heaths and hedgerows especially where there are some old trees it may also inhabit deciduous woodland and in scandinavia it also occurs in coniferous forests behaviour thumb upright eurasian wryneck twisting its neck eurasian wryneck sometimes forms small groups during migration and in its winter quarters but in summer is usually found in pairs it characteristically holds its head high with its beak pointing slightly upwards a mutual display that occurs at any time of year involves two birds perched facing each other with their heads far back and beaks wide open bobbing their heads up and down sometimes head is allowed to slump sideways and hang limply on other occasions when excited head is shaken and twisted about violently when disturbed on nest or held in hand neck contorts and twists in all directions bird sometimes feigns death and hangs limply with eyes closed upright left thumb eurasian wrynecks use their necks in display on returning to breeding area after migration birds set up territories on farmland in switzerland it has been found that old pear orchards with large numbers of ant nests are preferentially selected over other habitats areas used for vegetable cultivation provided useful habitat when they include areas of bare ground on which birds can forage territories are not chosen at random as arriving birds favoured certain areas over others with same territories being colonised first year after year presence of other eurasian wrynecks in vicinity is also a positive influence orchards in general and older ones in particular provide favoured territories probably because dense foliage is more likely to support high numbers of aphids and ground beneath has scant vegetation cover both of which factors increase availability of ants birds main prey despite some territories being consistently chosen over others reproductive success in these territories was no higher than in others limiting factors for such crevice nesting species as eurasian wrynecks are both availability of nesting sites and number of ants and their ease of discovery modern farming practices such as removal of hedges forest patches and isolated trees and increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides are disadvantageous to such birds diet of eurasian wryneck consists chiefly of ants but beetles and their larvae moths spiders and woodlice are also eaten although much time is spent in upper branches of trees bird sometimes perches in low bushes and mostly forages on ground moving around with short hops with its tail held in a raised position it can cling to tree trunks often moving obliquely and sometimes pressing its tail against surface as a prop it does not make holes in bark with its beak but picks up prey with a rapid extension and retraction of its tongue and it sometimes catches insects while on wing its flight is rather slow and undulating breeding thumb eggs of jynx torquilla mhnt nesting site is variable and may be in a pre existing hole in a tree trunk a crevice in a wall a hole in a bank a sand martin s burrow or a nesting box in its search for a safe protected site out of reach of predators it sometimes evicts a previous occupant its eggs and nestlings it uses no nesting material and a clutch of normally seven to ten eggs is laid occasionally five six eleven or twelve eggs average and weigh about they are a dull white colour and partially opaque both sexes are involved in incubation which takes twelve days but female plays greater part both parents feed chicks for about twenty days before they fledge there is usually a single brood status iucn lists eurasian wryneck as being of least concern in its red list of threatened species this is because it has a world population estimated at up to fifteen million individual birds and a very wide geographical range population may be decreasing to a certain extent but not at such a rate as to make bird reach threshold for a more threatened category in continental europe largest populations are in spain italy germany poland romania hungary belarus and ukraine and only in romania is population trend believed to be upward in russia where there are believed to be 300 000 to 800 000 individuals population trend is unknown in united kingdom numbers of bird are on decrease and it is protected under schedule 1 of wildlife and countryside act 1981 and is listed on appendix ii of bern convention it is protected as a migratory species under birds directive in european union in switzerland population has also been decreasing but species has reacted positively to conservation
