zombia antillarum commonly known as zombie palm is a species of palm tree and only member of genus zombia it is endemic to island of hispaniola in greater antilles usually found in dry hilly areas of northern and southern haiti and northwest of dominican republic z antillarum is a relatively short fan palm with clustered stems and a very distinctive appearance caused by its persistent spiny leaf sheaths threatened by habitat destruction in haiti z antillarum is a popular ornamental species due to its distinctive appearance low maintenance requirements and salt tolerance description thumb left details of stem of zombia antillarum showing persistent spiny leaf sheaths zombia antillarum is a small palm which grows in dense multi stemmed clumps with stems up to tall and in diameter individuals bear nine to 12 fan shaped or palmate leaves which are greyish white on lower surface leaf sheaths remain attached to stem after leaf drops off intervening tissue gradually degrades and woody vascular tissue splits forming spines which are characteristic of species inflorescence which is shorter than leaves bears bisexual flowers with 9 12 stamens and a single carpel fruit are white in colour although orange fruited individuals are also known to exist oblong or pear shaped in diameter and bear a single seed flowers and fruit are borne among leaves due to fact that inflorescences are shorter than leaves trees can produce 5000 seeds per year predominantly in july and august species is believed to be wind pollinated taxonomy thumb left descourtilz s original illustration of zombia antillarum from flore medicale des antilles 1821 zombia is a monotypic genus it includes only one species z antillarum earliest description of species is found in work of french physician and botanist michel etienne descourtilz in 1821 he placed it in genus as c antillarum descourtilz m e 1821 flore medicale des antilles ou traite des plantes des colonies francaises et portugaises italian naturalist odoardo beccari independently described species in 1908 placing it in genus coccothrinax as c anomala recognising that it was distinct enough to be placed in its own genus american botanist liberty hyde bailey erected genus zombia in 1931 to accommodate species that descourtilz had described this generated combination z antillarum in selecting a name for genus bailey noted that in 1941 another american botanist orator f cook moved beccari s c anomala to a new genus oothrinax this generated a fourth combination o anomala since descourtilz s description pre dates that of beccari zombia antillarum which is based on descourtilz s description has priority over oothrinax anomala in addition cook s name is invalid since it was never formally described in first edition of genera 1987 natalie uhl and john dransfield placed genus in subfamily coryphoideae tribe and subtribe thrinacinae using harold e moore s 1973 classification of palm family subsequent phylogenetic analyses showed that old world and new world members of thrinacinae were not closely related as a result zombia and related genera were places in their own tribe cryosophileae within this tribe zombia appears to be most closely related to genera coccothrinax and and species thrinax morrisii with remainder of genus thrinax being a sister taxon to this group because of this t morrisii was moved to a new genus in 1960 dominican botanist jose de jesus jimenez almonte described a variety of z antillarum which was distinguished from typical variety by its smaller pear shaped fruits with a dirty yellow colour he named this variety z antillarum var more recent workers have not considered this form distinctive enough to maintain it as a distinct variety evolutionary history angela cano and collaborators concluded that ancestors of cryosophileae and its sister taxon tribe probably evolved in north america during late cretaceous and dispersed to south america by eocene before re invading north and central america during oligocene they concluded that it was more probable that ancestors of zombia colonised caribbean from north or central america rather than from south america common names zombia antillarum is called zombie palm or zombi palm by horticulturists orator f cook coined name haitian cactus palm due to spiny appearance of its trunk in haiti it is usually known as latanye zombi latanier zombi in french zombie fan palm or latanye latanier piquant in french spiny fan palm it is also called latanier savanne or latanier marron latanye or latanier is a common term for fan palms in haiti so these names savanna fan palm and wild fan palm are not specific to this species they are also used for several species of coccothrinax in dominican republic species is called or these are of guano which is used for several species of coccothrinax and thrinax in his 1821 description of species descourtilz used name latanier distribution thumb right base of stem of zombia antillarum showing stem sprouts zombia antillarum is endemic to island of hispaniola in northern haiti is grows along tributaries of trois rivieres between gros morne and port de paix while in south it is found along eastern edge of massif de la between miragoane fond des and fond des blancs species also occurs in northwestern parts of dominican republic between sierra de puerto plata and gaspar hernandez it grows in dry hilly regions at low elevation usually on slopes and ridges but is generally absent from valley bottoms in dominican republic it is found from sea level up to above sea level zombia antillarum is associated with serpentine soils but is also found on calcareous soils in haiti z antillarum grows in association with a variety of other palms including coccothrinax argentea roystonea borinquena sabal and s domingensis in dominican republic it grows in association with pinus occidentalis r borinquena s domingensis and c argentea conservation status although listed as not threatened in 2006 iucn red list a 2007 review of status of west indian palms classified zombia antillarum as vulnerable based on a projected loss of 10 of population over next century in haiti species is threatened by habitat destruction when land is cleared for agriculture seedlings can also be destroyed when browsed by livestock uses plant is a popular ornamental and is valued for its unusual appearance low maintenance requirements small stature and salt tolerance it is recommended for low maintenance landscaping in south florida leaves of z antillarum are used to weave hats make brooms and seeds which have a protein content of 2 8 4 9 are used to feed pigs south of in dominican republic petioles are reportedly used to mix manioc flour for making cassava bread in 1821 michel etienne descourtilz reported that wood was used for snuff boxes and tobacco cases that kernel of seed was used to treat scurvy and that sap had been used by carib amerindians for its powerful properties fabienne taylor and joel c timyan explored connection between zombie palm and beliefs about zombies they found that oil extracted from seeds has been described as a sense activator by one ethnographic source and can be used to awaken a zombie and that a dwelling with thatch made from leaves of plant could prevent zombies from being used to spy on its occupants other sources however were reportedly unaware of this these uses taylor and timyan concluded that references external links category coryphoideae category monotypic arecaceae genera category trees of hispaniola category
