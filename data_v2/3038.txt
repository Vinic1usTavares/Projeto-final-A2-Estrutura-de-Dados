at battle of emmendingen on 19 october 1796 french army of rhin et moselle under jean victor marie moreau fought first coalition army of upper rhine commanded by archduke charles duke of teschen emmendingen is located on elz river in baden wurttemberg germany north of freiburg im breisgau action occurred during war of first coalition first phase of larger french revolutionary wars after a summer of parrying between two sides french were already withdrawing through black forest to rhine in close pursuit austrians forced french commander to split his force so he could cross rhine at three points via bridges at kehl breisach and huningen by mid september though austrians controlled approaches to crossings at breisach and kehl moreau still wanted half his army to approach austrians at kehl rugged terrain at emmendingen complicated fighting making it possible for habsburg force to snipe at french troops and to block any passage toward kehl rainy and cold weather further hampered efforts of both sides turning streams and rivulets into rushing torrents of water and making roadways slippery fighting was fierce two generals died in battle one from each side habsburg success at emmendingen forced french to abandon their plans for a three pronged or even a two pronged withdrawal french continued their retreat through black forest mountain towns to south where armies fought battle of schliengen five days later background initially rulers of europe viewed french revolution as a dispute between french king and his subjects and not something in which they should interfere as revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident they declared interest of monarchs of europe as one with interests of louis xvi and his family this declaration of pillnitz 27 august 1791 threatened ambiguous but quite serious consequences if anything should happen to royal family position of revolutionaries became increasingly difficult compounding their problems in international relations french emigres continued to agitate for support of a counter revolution finally on 20 april 1792 french national convention declared war on austria in this war of first coalition 1792 1798 france

battalions and 16 squadrons but these were well to south and east of freiburg im breisgau still tramping through mountains everyone had been hampered by heavy rains ground was soft and slippery and both rhine and elz rivers had flooded as had many tributaries this increased hazards of mounted attack because horses could not get a good footing johann samuel ersch allgemeine encyclopadie der

first to arrive at french secured high point at waldkirch which commanded neighboring valleys it was considered at time a maxim of military tactics that command of mountains gave control of valleys by 19 october armies faced each other on banks of elz from waldkirch to emmendingen by then moreau knew he could not proceed to kehl along right bank of rhine so he decided to cross rhine further north at breisach bridge there was small though and his whole army could not pass over without causing a bottleneck so he sent only left wing commanded by desaix to cross there archibald alison sir archibald alison 1st baronet history of europe london w blackwood and sons 1835 pp 86 90 at dawn saint cyr french right advanced along elz valley nauendorf prepared to move his habsburg forces down valley seeing this saint cyr sent a small column across mountains to east of main valley to village of located in a side valley he instructed them to attack nauendorf s left and to force him to withdraw from bleibach anticipating this though nauendorf had already posted units on heights along elz valley from which austrian shooters ambushed saint cyr s men on other side of elz valley more habsburg gunmen reached which overlooked waldkirch and from there they could fire down on french force fighting was swift and furious superior austrian positions forced saint cyr to cancel his advance on bleibach and withdraw to waldkirch even there though nauendorf s men continued to harass him and saint cyr retreated another to relative safety of denzlingen fighting went no better for french on their left decaen s advanced guard proceeded forward albeit cautiously austrian marksmen fired down upon column and decaen fell from his horse injured beaupuy took decaen s place with advance guard phipps vol ii pp 380 385 at midday latour abandoned his customary caution and sent two columns to attack beaupuy between malterdingen and hollental val d enfer resulting in a fierce firefight after

franz petrasch who had held approaches since september and this force was no longer available after emmendingen by controlling eastern access to kehl strasbourg crossing petrasch forced moreau to march south any retreat into france would have to occur via bridges at huningen a longer march not at kehl and strasbourg thomas graham 1st baron lynedoch history of campaign of 1796 in germany and
