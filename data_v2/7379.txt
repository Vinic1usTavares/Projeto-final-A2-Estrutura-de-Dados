silverstone p 334 after a visit to devonport she left plymouth on 13 march 1902 bound for yokohama under command of captain at start of russo japanese war mikasa commanded by captain was assigned to 1st division of 1st fleet she participated in battle of port arthur on 9 february 1904 when admiral togo heihachiro led 1st fleet in an attack on russian ships of pacific squadron anchored just outside port arthur togo had expected his surprise night attack on russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and expected to find them badly disorganized and weakened but russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack japanese ships were spotted by cruiser which was patrolling offshore and alerted russian defences togo chose to attack russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage russian ships with his secondary guns splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as japanese and six inch guns inflicted very little significant damage on russian ships who concentrated all their fire on japanese ships with some effect although a large number of ships on both sides were hit russian casualties numbered only 17 while japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before togo disengaged mikasa was hit by two ten inch shells during engagement that wounded seven crewmen forczyk pp 24 41 44 ship participated in action of 13

for port arthur and petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by japanese previous night russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded and makarov was one of 677 killed emboldened by his success togo resumed long range bombardment missions which prompted russians to lay more minefields which sank two japanese battleships following month forczyk pp 45 46 during battle of yellow sea on 10 august mikasa was at head of column of japanese battleships and was one of primary targets of russian ships she was hit twenty times two of which knocked out her aft 12 inch

failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact forczyk pp 48 53 battle of tsushima thumb left mikasa as she appeared in 1905 at battle of tsushima on 27 may 1905 mikasa again led 1st fleet into combat this time against second and third pacific squadrons detached from baltic fleet ship opened fire at battleship russian flagship at 14 10 and was joined by battleship and armoured cruiser shortly afterwards within an hour japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard russian ship badly wounded fleet commander vice admiral zinovy rozhestvensky knocked out her rear twelve inch gun turret and jammed knyaz suvorovs steering so that she fell out of formation during this time mikasa was focus of russian fire as leading ship in japanese column and was hit by 6 twelve inch and 19 six inch shells they did very little damage and togo was able to cross t of russian squadrons knyaz suvorovs steering was later repaired but she blundered between japanese and russian fleets several times later in battle and mikasa fired three torpedoes at her to no avail later in battle ship appears to have fired mostly on battleship although fired shots that caused russian ship s magazines to explode and sink her at 18 04 a twelve inch shell detonated prematurely in barrel of right gun of forward turret disabling gun and knocking out left gun until 18 40 another twelve inch shell had exploded in that same barrel almost two hours earlier but had not damaged gun one six inch gun jammed after firing 19 rounds but only other damage to any of ship s guns was one six inch gun that was disabled by a russian shell of same size that entered through gunport she fired 124 twelve inch shells during battle more than any other ship except 142 in total mikasa was hit more than 40 times during battle
