young lieutenant colonel of 9th cavalry regiment in custine s corps of army of rhine as french revolutionary wars broke out nansouty soon found himself in position of having to take provisional command of whole 9th cavalry regiment as he was most senior chef d lieutenant colonel of regiment when commander colonel badda de bodosalva fell ill at end of may 1792 his regiment was a part of army of rhine and was integrated in general custine s corps which was to march towards palatinate where first military manoeuvres took place as colonel badda de bodosalva died at end of october that year nansouty naturally expected to be appointed commander of regiment in his place however custine appointed more senior lieutenant colonel loubat de bohan as commander of 9th cavalry and despite nansouty s protestations maintained his decision with loubat in command 9th saw action against prussians in an engagement at ober florsheim on 30 march 1793 after a first successful charge nansouty s 1st squadron was counter charged by enemy hussars remaining squadrons under loubat quickly caught up with nansouty s squadron and together they broke enemy corps commander custine was then called up to command army of north but before leaving his command he attempted a last daunting move against habsburg army this required a night march not usually undertaken by cavalry and poorly coordinated manoeuvres of cavalry infantry and artillery this led to total failure of action of 17 may during this action though initial charge of corps cavalry which included 9th successfully took a number of enemy guns however a habsburg counter charge forced them back in disorder which spread panic among ranks of oncoming infantry thoumas pp 6 7 despite this setback a few days later de bohan was promoted to rank of general and nansouty again took provisional command of regiment when general alexandre de beauharnais took command of army of rhine he directed his troops towards mainz some fighting took place near landau and 9th cavalry charged several times just after this event commander of 2nd squadron of regiment invoked provision of an equivocal new law demanding that he be given command of

be posted as sentry an unusual duty for such an elite heavy cavalry unit at daybreak as battle of neresheim opened austrian cavalry charged carabiniers stunning unprepared cavalrymen who fled in panic their precipitate flight spread alarm among ranks of other cavalry regiments who were used to seeing carabiniers a cheval triumph against enemy on every occasion nansouty did his best to stop rout of cavalrymen and to reorganise other panic stricken regiments but morale of cavalrymen remained very low throughout day and nansouty was forced to give ground in front of enemy rather than attempt a risky charge with his demoralised troops this elicited criticism from corps commander general gouvion saint cyr who sent his aide de camp to nansouty with orders to charge which latter did after taking necessary time to deploy his men under his direction four cavalry regiments 2nd and 20th chasseurs a cheval and 2nd and 9th cavalry regiments executed a superb charge which halted advance of

pp 14 15 in 1799 france s political and military situation seemed perilous especially after losses in southwestern germany culminating in battle at stockach by then a colonel nansouty accepted promotion to brigadier general on 29 august and was given command of a heavy cavalry brigade formed by 8th and 9th cavalry regiments later nansouty s brigade was provisionally augmented to four

nicolas davout s iii corps with which it crossed rhine and then danube before rejoining murat s cavalry reserve nansouty had a first opportunity to lead his men into combat at battle of wertingen where his men were noted for their excellent manoeuvring detaching his two carabiniers a cheval regiments which he had to leave with murat nansouty and his reduced division followed emperor at

or artillery support to cavalry attack while murat s cavalrymen were able to cooperate with lannes s infantry and artillery taking immense casualties after a first series of actions against lannes s infantry elements of coalition cavalry withdrew and were reformed by their commanders joined by bagration s own cavalry they set off again this time aiming directly at murat s command centre as austro russian cavalry was closing in on its target they were steadily met by four of nansouty s regiments two carabiniers regiments and 2nd and 3rd cuirassiers sounds of two massed cavalries colliding could be heard some distance away after a brief combat austro russian horsemen broke and were driven off smith pp 56 57 however liechtenstein soon reformed his men and seeing that all french cavalry was positioned on left of caffarelli s infantry division he launched his men against right wing of this division but was instantly met with sustained musket volleys that disorganised his cavalrymen seeing this development nansouty wheeled right with his men and crossed infantry intervals by platoons and then formed his men on two battle lines in front of infantry three charges ensued in brief succession with nansouty skilfully committing 1st and 2nd carabiniers a cheval and 2nd cuirassiers from his first line then 9th cuirassiers and saint germain s brigade from his second line austro russian cavalry was finally broken and repulsed for good thoumas pp 18 19 after another series of well coordinated cavalry and infantry actions murat and lannes were able to force bagration s entire force to withdraw with a loss 2 000 men approximately half of force and 16 guns on french side despite their repeated charges on this day 1st heavy cavalry division registered only relatively minor casualties a testament to skill of its commanders piston s 1st brigade registered 2 killed and 41 wounded la houssaye s 2nd brigade registered 1 man killed and 25 wounded while saint germain s 3rd brigade registered 47 killed and 28 wounded regiment that suffered highest casualty rate was by far 3rd cuirassiers with 44 killed and 27 wounded for a casualty rate of 21 per cent nansouty s charge was rated superb and brilliant in report drawn up by general augustin daniel belliard murat s chief of staff and nansouty was subsequently mentioned in army bulletin for this action and named grand officier de la legion d honneur on 25 december additionally of six colonels in his division three were promoted to brigadier general and three received cross of commandeur de la legion d honneur

nansouty was soon called to replace him taking command of lasalle s light cavalry division and dragoon divisions of klein and milhaud these divisions were placed in first line of army and nansouty although formally placed under overall command of marshal jean de dieu soult had orders to act independently and report directly to emperor if any unforeseen and extraordinary events should occur

towards eylau joining his men in warsaw nansouty diligently led them towards his assigned destination but did not arrive until 13 february 1807 five days after battle of eylau and too late to take part in any action on 14 february nansouty learned of death of his comrade and former commander during revolutionary wars general d hautpoul who had been fatally wounded during heroic cavalry charges at eylau after battle emperor decided that army was to take winter quarters to ensure safety of his outposts he sent murat with a powerful column including nansouty s men with mission of pushing back any enemy they might find a short skirmish involving 1st heavy cavalry division occurred at on 10 march before it was decided that all heavy cavalry would be sent to lower vistula where they were to rest and be reinforced with its ranks replenished after winter actions six regiment division under nansouty numbered on 1 june 1807 no less than 3 257 men it was by far most powerful heavy cavalry

was hastily directed towards town of where marshal michel ney had managed to retreat with his corps after energetically extricating himself from a dangerous situation with surprisingly few losses thoumas p 22 with ney s corps cavalry reserve and guard napoleon moved towards guttstadt where on 9 june he found a large combined arms enemy force murat took lasalle s light horse and nansouty s heavy cavalry and launched a series of charges that drove back enemy force murat continued to press on and pushed enemy into streets of guttstadt where he penetrated with cavalry at nightfall having fought well with his men nansouty was rested next day leaving all action at battle of to espagne s 3rd heavy cavalry division at beginning of june 1807 emperor reassessed his strategic situation and decided that he needed to move northeast in order to prevent bennigsen s russian army from using bridge at friedland to cross alle river if russians managed to cross alle river at friedland they could then move closer to their prussian allies who were based in konigsberg napoleon drew up a plan giving marshal murat two army corps and a powerful cavalry reserve with orders to march on konigsberg while sending rest of troops towards friedland leading thrust towards friedland was marshal jean lannes s reserve corps two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade with grouchy s dragoons and

campaign in poland friedland thumb nansouty s cuirassiers charging at battle of friedland on 14 june 1807 arriving with his corps at friedland on 13 june after nightfall lannes found position already occupied by russian forces very early on 14 june lannes attacked with an almost symbolic force between 11 000 and 13 500 men against might of a massed enemy army of 85 000 his goal was to prevent enemy from crossing alle and to give napoleon enough time to arrive with remainder of his forces nansouty s division arrived on field of battle at friedland after first engagements and was directed towards strategic village of heinrichsdorf this village needed to be held as it protected lannes s communications with rest of napoleon s army grouchy also directed his dragoon division towards village and was shocked to find it in enemy hands and nansouty s men retreating at a trot without even attempting to contain enemy or to cover route that represented corps communication line garnier pp 50 51 in fact nansouty had arrived not long before and had been instructed to place himself at heinrichsdorf without further instructions and without being informed of what was happening on right as russian infantry and cavalry were boldly pressing him he became concerned with his own lines of communication and thus ordered his men back to avoid being cut off thoumas pp 23 24 thumb left napoleon giving orders for an attack at battle of friedland general nansouty had an important role during this battle and is honoured by being depicted alongside emperor on his left in this painting by horace vernet however nansouty s move compromised lannes s entire plan which counted on powerful reinforcements arriving through heinrichsdorf an alarmed lannes immediately sent one of his aides de camp to grouchy urging him to stop enemy from cutting his communications with emperor whatever cost grouchy duly took command of nansouty s leading squadrons ordering them back to their initial position then launched a desperate but successful charge with his own dragoons arriving in streets of village and cutting off its russian defenders grouchy s dragoons became disorganised and were badly positioned following this sudden charge and russian cavalry them but nansouty arrived just in time and french repulsed russian cavalry momentarily securing position garnier pp 51 52 a lively argument ensued between two cavalry commanders grouchy invoked his seniority and position as commander of cavalry and criticised nansouty s earlier decision to withdraw nansouty countered by saying that he had superior experience at handling cavalry when combat resumed quarrel did not prevent nansouty from performing brilliantly under grouchy s command during dramatic series of events that followed having been repulsed earlier russians decided to force position at heinrichsdorf and they assembled a strong infantry force preceded by no less than 60 cavalry squadrons plus around 2 000 cossacks to counter this move grouchy opted for deception luring some of enemy cavalry away from infantry then grouchy charged enemy horse from front simultaneously nansouty hit them from flank and together grouchy and nansouty repulsed them despite numerous charges and countercharges french cavalry maintained upper hand thoumas p 25 27 after arrival of emperor with significant reinforcements time was right for a general counterattack emperor planned his main attack against russian left and he wanted to prevent enemy from transferring reinforcements from their right wing to their battered left to that effect grouchy received orders to incessantly harass enemy before him in order to prevent bennigsen from redeploying them on left wing orders also required grouchy to silence enemy guns pounding french left in this difficult task grouchy was perfectly seconded by nansouty and together they ended to russian cannonade in this sector later grouchy s report expressed admiration for nansouty s actions adding that latter had gloriously repaired his earlier error nansouty was also mentioned in 79th bulletin of grande armee after battle 1st heavy cavalry division joined in pursuit of russian army to nieman river but treaties of tilsit in july soon ended hostilities count of empire first squire and peninsula thumb upright grand aigle de la legion d honneur decoration numerous honours and endowments that general nansouty received following battle of friedland seem to suggest emperor s appreciation and fact that napoleon did not regard early incident during this battle as nansouty s fault on 11 july 1807 general of division nansouty was named grand aigle de la legion d honneur fifth and top rank of this order reserved for greatest general officers pigeard dictionnaire de la grande armee p 368 this also brought an annual revenue of 20 000 francs his first endowment of 12 846 francs was offered on 30 june 1807 and was paid by duchy of warsaw on 23 september he received another 5 882 francs on empire s grand livre a count of empire from 10 march 1808 nansouty was offered two additional endowments one of 25 000 francs paid by kingdom of westphalia and second of 10 000 francs paid by domain in hannover thoumas p 27 he also received an endowment of 100 000 francs for acquisition of a parisian hotel particulier nansouty bought hotel du president in faubourg saint germain a neighbourhood inhabited by new elite of imperial france indeed first rate military figures such as viceroy of italy eugene marshals davout and lannes and generals rapp and legrand also acquired residences in faubourg saint germain tulard vol 2 p 401 gotteri p 198 additionally in 1808 he was offered position of first squire of emperor in napoleon s military household a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30 000 francs and which gained importance when grand squire general armand augustin louis de caulaincourt was sent to saint petersburg as ambassador napoleon allegedly chose nansouty for his elegant manners and education aristocratic posture and talent for administration in his capacity as first squire nansouty thus had to accompany emperor during latter s short campaign in spain from november 1808 to early january 1809 there he was in charge of several administrative tasks linked with managing emperor s stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers emperor s aides de camp had their own aides de camp who were also placed under command of first squire although never very far away from emperor in a campaign that included many battles nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign and in january 1809 he accompanied his master back to france as outbreak of war of fifth coalition was imminent thoumas pp 27 28 war of fifth coalition with a large part of french empire s forces now entangled in bloody peninsular war austrian empire believed that its best opportunity to avenge humiliating defeat of 1805 had finally come austrians were looking to defeat france and regain their former influence in italy and germany in early 1809 austrian war preparations were so intense that napoleon was forced to leave spain and head back to paris to reorganise his main army in germany castle p 7 in spring nansouty was therefore recalled to command of 1st of three heavy cavalry divisions of cavalry reserve placed

take town of eckmuhl from enemy apart from schierling plain terrain at eckmuhl was very uneven and hilly with dangerously steep slopes which made cavalry action here improper yet it was here that one of most memorable cavalry actions of entire napoleonic wars was to take place it all began on slopes next to eckmuhl where a first brief cavalry engagement occurred as bavarian and cavalry encountered and charged austrian cavalry austrians won out and bavarians and wurttembergers retreated and reformed in vicinity of two french heavy cavalry divisions present these two divisions 1st under nansouty 1st and 2nd carabiniers a cheval 2nd 3rd 9th and 12th cuirassiers and 2nd under saint sulpice four regiments strong were placed next to one another forming five lines with their regiments in column one in front of other these men were ordered forward up slope and onto plateau where light cavalry had been repulsed moments earlier arriving on plateau at a gallop cavalry overtook marshal lannes s infantry who admiringly cheered vive les cuirassiers long live cuirassiers and applauded as cavalry galloped past them with their two frontline regiments now deployed in line and with german light cavalry protecting their flanks two heavy cavalry divisions clashed into whatever austrian cavalry they could find on plateau repulsing them with ease this was however only prelude of a much larger cavalry combat thoumas pp 30 31 in order to protect his retreat archduke charles of austria reunited his entire cavalry reserve 44 squadrons in all on either side of ratisbon road thoumas pp 31 32 next to village of pigeard dictionnaire des batailles de napoleon p 266 between 19 00 20 00 in evening napoleon ordered his cavalry to disperse enemy horse from this position in preparation of charge nansouty formed five of his regiments in two lines three regiments in first line and two in second line leaving his remaining regiment with saint sulpice saint sulpice s division was on nansouty s right and it remained formed in regiment column formations while light cavalry was protecting flanks of whole in all french had 48 squadrons and as they advanced they were met by intense artillery fire from austrian batteries and then vigorously charged by gottesheim cuirassier regiment seeing enemy charging nansouty ordered his squadrons forward towards enemy but at a gentle trot then as soon as austrians were at about one hundred paces frontline regiment of carabiniers a cheval halted loaded their carbines and fired a salvo from thirty or forty paces then drew their swords and joined their fellow cuirassiers in an energetic charge as nansouty led saint sulpice followed and despite vigour and determination of austrian cavalry they were repulsed after a brief hand to hand combat coming in support of gottesheim cuirassiers kaiser cuirassier regiment shared same fate with hussars and vincent chevau legers also repulsed a generalised and bloody melee then occurred under moonlight with sabre hits on steel cuirasses producing sparkles in night austrian general andreas von schneller was wounded during this action and general karl wilhelm von stutterheim commanding entire austrian cavalry only just escaped capture austrian cavalry was repulsed and pushed into marshes beyond subsequently retreating towards with bulk of archduke charles s forces retreating towards ratisbon pursuit resumed next day at dawn and was followed by yet another action at battle of ratisbon where austrians tried to delay french pursuit after fierce fighting during which nansouty s and saint sulpice s men successfully charged enemy cavalry three times french captured citadel at ratisbon but saw austrians skilfully retreating nansouty was left at ratisbon with davout to observe

bank of river in what became known as battle of aspern essling french were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out nansouty

done all day long in a desperate attempt to stop austrian attacks on thin french battle line espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved nansouty at once brought forward saint germain s squadrons and charged enemy infantry allowing army to maintain itself on position thoumas p 35 on second day of battle 22 may nansouty received his second cuirassier brigade doumerc s 2nd and 9th regiments during morning having received some reinforcements napoleon sent marshal lannes s corps forward in an attack against enemy line nansouty s and lasalle s cavalry protected infantry columns charging enemy cavalry to clear their path however at around 21 00 in morning news that great bridge over danube had broken making arrival of further reinforcements virtually impossible forced napoleon to call off his attack and order a phased retreat situation of french army was critical with marshal lannes fatally wounded and a great number of losses in men it took all skill of nansouty and other cavalry commanders to contain formidable austrian onslaught in order to allow rest of army to gradually disengage after most of army had safely

first day of battle at wagram and at night they camped behind imperial guard next day 6 july nansouty was at first directed to support davout on french right but when it became clear that latter s sector was not threatened by arrival of enemy reinforcements they were ordered back into reserve in a central position on battlefield not far from village of then as situation on french left rapidly deteriorated they were called into action when napoleon ordered marshal bessieres commander of cavalry reserve to launch his men in a charge against austrians menacing his left with time at essence bessieres opted not to wait for guard cavalry and with his other two heavy cavalry divisions assigned to other sectors of battlefield he decided to lead forward only nansouty s men thoumas p 36 this division was indeed very strong 24 squadrons more than 4 000 men including brigadier general s 1st and 2nd carabiniers a cheval brigadier general doumerc s 2nd and 9th cuirassiers and brigadier general s 3rd and 12th cuirassiers castle p 23 bessieres and nansouty led these men forward through a hail of cannonballs and case shot with carabiniers a cheval at front finding a weaker spot in austrian line they pierced it and stormed past enemy infantry formed in squares grenzer battalion as they went along their way however many of french cavalry did not manage to penetrate through formidable masses of austrian infantry so nansouty was now commanding a much diminished force showing great skill in handling his men nansouty then wheeled right and charged liechtenstein s artillery line however austrian cavalry promptly intervened spearheaded by rosenberg chevaulegers and kronprinz cuirassier regiments which caught carabiniers a cheval in flank and repulsed them pursuing them back to their lines costly repulse of nansouty s division did not dishearten bessieres who was preparing another rapid charge now with support of elements of guard cavalry this charge never came as marshal s horse was killed by a cannonball with bessieres also hit and carried unconscious behind lines arnold p 149 with his commander presumed dead nansouty did not know what emperor s orders were and thus promptly decided to pull back his men to avoid further damage to his already battered division thoumas pp 36 37 thumb during battle marshal bessieres pictured on right was wounded and thought

attack had done much to ease pressure on napoleon s left centre latter s situation remained critical emperor thus launched corps of general jacques macdonald in an attack against austrian right centre pigeard dictionnaire des batailles p 922 macdonald s attack formation formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought was a huge infantry attack column or square comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for napoleonic warfare sokolov pp 224 225 four squadrons of nansouty s carabiniers a cheval were sent to support flank of this attack with rest of his division further back thoumas p 37 realising that his advance is hampered by intense austrian artillery fire macdonald aimed to clear enemy guns before him asking for a cavalry charge from walther s guard cavalry on his right and nansouty s 1st heavy cavalry division on his left with no direct orders from emperor and his commander marshal bessieres out of action walther opted not to move sokolov p 455 while nansouty did send his men forward but having been positioned too far back he arrived only after enemy guns had moved away nansouty s division suffered a very high casualty rate at battle of wagram with more men and horses lost than other two heavy cavalry divisions combined losses in horses were extremely high with 1 141 animals killed or injured while losses in men were also significant despite fact that only carabiniers a cheval really came into contact with enemy overall nansouty s division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded foremost of all highly battered two carabiniers a cheval regiments had no more than 300 horses standing between themselves by end of day for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent with 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties bessieres s charge hastily organised with only division of nansouty through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them had less tactical effect than at aspern essling but it did win napoleon valuable time allowing him to retake initiative in this battle interlude between two campaigns thumb upright cuirasses were adopted in 1810 for both carabiniers a cheval regiments with nansouty suggesting idea general macdonald was very critical of both walther and nansouty for their alleged failure to provide proper cavalry support during his attack macdonald went on to write in his memoirs that he was taken aback by slowness of general nansouty nansouty did charge in end but too late to take advantage of gaping hole that i had pierced in centre of austrian army naulet p 67 a few days after battle of wagram napoleon confronted nansouty over what he saw as being a failure to cooperate with macdonald nansouty responded to emperor s lively reproaches by offering categorical explanations saying that he had not been consulted in placement of his division rendering manoeuvres impossible during that action as napoleon insisted nansouty stood up to him finally retorting after all it is not your majesty at any rate who can teach me to lead cavalry despite this remark nansouty would continue to be given significant commands in coming years it was shortly after this bloody battle that nansouty insisted that carabiniers a cheval be given steel cuirass in a bid to cancel out what he saw as being a state of inferiority of these troops vis a vis their fellow cuirassiers nansouty s initiative was approved and was enforced in 1810 with peace of vienna signed between french empire and austrian empire in october nansouty was ordered to leave command of his division to general bruyeres and retake his position of first squire alongside emperor 17 october 1809 thoumas p 38 however with return of grand squire armand augustin louis de caulaincourt role of first squire was much diminished as a result in 1811 nansouty was given an additional function that of general inspector of cavalry very active in exercising this function he soon became reputed for his strictness and for his detailed knowledge and invaluable experience that he had of this arm nonetheless war was once more not far away and on 19 october 1811 nansouty was called to command of 2nd and 4th cuirassier divisions of observation corps of elbe under command of marshal louis nicolas davout then with reorganisation of grande armee in april 1812 nansouty was named at command of i cavalry corps campaign in russia with outbreak of war with russia in 1812 grande armee included alongside usual combined arms army corps four large cavalry reserve corps commanded respectively by generals nansouty ist montbrun iind grouchy iiird and la tour maubourg corps this innovation has been much criticised after this campaign and in words of marshal marmont it had only merit of presenting an extraordinary spectacle that astonished eye during this campaign nansouty s i cavalry corps was composed of general bruyeres s 1st light cavalry division 7th 8th hussars 16th chasseurs a

little action combating brilliantly in a vanguard action at ostrovno and then briefly at vitebsk an incident involving some of nansouty s light cavalry occurred during combat at vitebsk when 8th hussars and 16th chasseurs a cheval turned and fled before russian light horse this was evidence that division of bruyeres of which they were a part had been much used by always being placed at vanguard of army resulting in loss many of best and bravest troopers despite nansouty s best efforts extremely long and exhausting marches torrential rains and absence of proper fodder took their toll on ist cavalry corps with numbers reduced to half by this time additionally just like other cavalry corps commanders nansouty rarely had all his troops under direct control which led to cavalry being used improperly at times thoumas pp 39 40 with his three divisions reunited on 7 september 1812 nansouty s ist cavalry corps saw action at battle of borodino he was placed on french right in second line behind corps of marshal davout and after murat managed to take two of redoubts on russian left nansouty placed his men on right of this position and then supported advance of right wing of army with russians making an offensive comeback nansouty placed himself at head of heavy divisions of saint germain and valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees this was nansouty s first battle wound and it was serious enough to end his active role during this campaign thoumas pp 39 41 he was transported to moscow following battle and although still wounded on 10 october he was entrusted with mission of commanding convoy that was to take wounded generals and colonels as well as main trophies captured behind lines courcelles p 143 during this mission he was exposed to great danger to famine and extreme cold which impacted his already frail health he was then allowed to return to france and recover from his injury war of sixth coalition remains of french army had completely evacuated russian territory by december 1812 but their defeat sparked anti french sentiments in germany and prussia joined russians forming a sixth coalition hostilities thus continued in early 1813 but nansouty s wound did not yet allow him to return to action so he was offered prestigious position of colonel general of dragoons 16 january in replacement of general louis baraguey d hilliers who had just died of exhaustion thoumas p 41 nansouty s wound was very serious but he had been very lucky bullet that pierced his knee only tore through flesh leaving his kneecap

took part in saxony with chasseurs a cheval and colbert s chevau legers lanciers encountering enemy in several isolated cavalry actions but first serious action came only at battle of dresden where

imperial guard cavalry however guard cavalry was not needed as a whole before epic battle of nations at leipzig placed in reserve at first guard cavalry and artillery had to spring into action at once after napoleon received news of saxon defection with saxons now in coalition camp and firing at soldiers who moments before had been their allies situation of some of french troops became desperate position of general s division placed close to saxon lines was particularly tenuous and napoleon soon came to its aid with nansouty in command of guard cavalry and horse artillery nansouty launched an impetuous charge with some of his regiments grenadiers a cheval dragons and chevau legers and saxons were unable to hold out in this sector however situation changed on 19 october with untimely explosion of a bridge over elster main retreat line for french rearguard which was now blocked in city of leipzig guard cavalry extricated itself from field of battle and was very useful in covering retreat of remaining french forces thoumas p 42 with grande armee in full retreat another dangerous situation occurred on 29 october with bavaria now also in camp of coalition an austro bavarian army of some 45 000 men under general karl philipp von wrede who had fought under command of emperor during previous campaigns tried to block french retreat and delay french force until arrival of rest of coalition forces wrede had means necessary to achieve his goal as he possessed a numerous artillery of about one hundred pieces and a powerful cavalry of 50 squadrons in comparison french forces were much dispersed and only a few units remained cohesive and combat capable mir p 12 during ensuing battle of hanau wrede placed his troops in front of forest of through which he expected that french would retreat he also positioned almost all of his cavalry on left placing it under command of field marshal lieutenant spleny despite his numeric inferiority napoleon sent forward a part of his men against bavarians deployed in forest before him but intervention of foot guards was soon required bavarians had fought alongside french in past and sight of fearsome bearskins of french guardsmen shook their morale and they abandoned their position in forest after a brief fight but with fire of a bavarian grand battery upon them french infantry soon had to stop napoleon positioned general le s artillery in battery and brought in support general drouot with horse artillery of guard as well as other pieces constituting a grand battery of some 50 pieces that was soon able to respond adequately to austro bavarian cannonade nansouty with guard dragoons and lancers was instructed to protect this battery from enemy and thus positioned his men behind guns thoumas p 43 thumb general nansouty his

and many coalition squadrons turned back to safety some of them did manage to get to french guns and crossed battery with guard cavalry immediately countercharging and driving them off with gun line now out of danger nansouty with aid of sebastiani s cuirassiers launched a pursuit of repulsed enemy horse encountering and breaking an austrian cuirassier regiment dragoon regiment and two bavarian chevaulegers regiments all under personal command of field marshal lieutenant franz spleny de then with a manoeuvre resembling that of kellermann at marengo nansouty wheeled his men left and rushed onto enemy infantry breaking them grenadiers a cheval were in thick of fighting and with an offensive comeback of bavarian cavalry they were momentarily in a dangerous situation but were duly rescued by gardes d honneur regiment nansouty then took his entire cavalry and broke remaining enemy squares and cavalry pushing some of these men into kinzig river meanwhile nansouty s action left sebastiani free to silence bavarian grand battery skilfully using saint germain s cuirassier division and exelmans s light division of his corps thoumas pp 43 44 mir pp 16 17 nansouty received a light wound

place in 1814 on french soil under bleak circumstances for french who saw huge coalition armies invade france at beginning of that year during this campaign his command 5 000 horse guards included 1st and 2nd chevau legers lanciers regiments under general edouard colbert chasseurs a cheval under general grenadiers a cheval under general guyot dragons under general letort as well as entire guard horse artillery these men soon saw action on 27 january at battle of brienne here two companies of horse artillery under an officer called marin a veteran of campaigns in italy and egypt and personal favourite of emperor were almost completely destroyed with their guns and commander captured by enemy napoleon was extremely irritated about failure of heavy cavalry of guard to protect these gunners a further loss of cannon of guard artillery occurred at battle of la rothiere a rare battlefield defeat for napoleon here a part of guard cavalry charged and was initially successful against enemy cavalry but faced by steady ranks of russian and prussian guardsmen and with its flank threatened by enemy dragoons it soon had to withdraw leaving behind some of its cannon after rejoining emperor at nansouty took part to battle of montmirail where he was at first instructed to protect artillery he then joined in attack of guard infantry on farm of epine au bois where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry charging home routing these troops and subsequently pursuing fugitives this combined attack of guard resulted in a great number of prisoners and captured enemy guns with nansouty receiving a light wound in process a part of his men then took part to battle of chateau thierry where emperor ordered guard cavalry to make a turning move against enemy left and where nansouty s subordinates general letort and colonel brilliantly broke several enemy squares then on 14 february nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at battle of vauchamps where he supported grouchy in a cavalry action that decided battle charging blucher s men from front nansouty allowed grouchy to magnificently fall behind enemy columns which they both then sabred and crushed with guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit enemy losses reached a staggering 9 000 10 000 casualties with 25 cannons lost emperor was radiant following this battle but by nightfall his mood changed when he found out of loss of some guard horse artillerymen these men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from general guyot one of nansouty s subordinates failing to provide an escort and a guide for them in nansouty s presence a fuming napoleon summoned guyot and then chastised him for repeated losses in cannon during previous battles as well as for various other shortcomings such as failing to properly escort emperor after an angry tirade napoleon promptly axed guyot and announced to nansouty that general exelmans would replace guyot at helm of his old guard heavy cavalry this episode apparently strained relations between emperor napoleon and general nansouty thoumas pp 46 51 thumb napoleon during 1814 military campaign in france painting by jean louis ernest meissonier always in thick of action during this campaign on 24 february nansouty was present near city of troyes negotiations for

village where negotiations were taking place french envoy to armistice talks monsieur de saw this development and found nansouty bitterly protesting against latter s action nansouty responded that emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there but that he had orders to capture position without further delay on 27 february emperor again moved against blucher s prussians leaving a part of his forces near troyes to observe movement of prince of schwarzenberg s austrian army nansouty with guard cavalry accompanied emperor ensuring his protection and clearing

bridge of berry au bac over aisne despite enemy cannonade once across aisne with a few polish lancer platoons nansouty launched a heroic pursuit capturing enemy cannons and munitions and taking a significant number of prisoners among whom was teenage russian prince gagarin thoumas pp 52 56 on 7 march at battle of craonne another incident occurred seemingly indicating that there had been some sort of disagreement between general and emperor as battle was raging general belliard from emperor s staff came to nansouty and told him that he had orders to relieve him of command should his health prevent him from exercising his duties nansouty responded that he was indeed ill but that he was able to retain command although in unusually bad humour after this incident nansouty subsequently led a most brilliant action at craonne he was ordered to cross bogged and broken terrain and climb a steep incline with his cavalry and artillery in order to fall on enemy s right flank managing to bring his cavalrymen on ridge nansouty formed them in line and launched them against enemy pushing back in disorder two russian battalions nansouty was again wounded during this action but this injury was not very serious and he continued to energetically lead his men napoleon then allegedly ordered nansouty to assault a redoubt under most murderous fire nonetheless nansouty ordered his men to halt and advanced alone towards position asked to explain his behaviour he replied that he would not send his men to die in vain and that he would be attacking alone napoleon at once revoked his order courcelles p 145 this was to be last military engagement of nansouty s long career on 8 march on eve of battle of laon nansouty was at nine kilometres from laon where emperor was also present and although circumstances of nansouty s departure are unclear it is certain that he left this village and his command that very day two days later napoleon wrote to his war minister to inform him that general nansouty s health did not allow him to exercise his military duties and that he was authorised to take sick leave in paris general belliard had taken interim command of guard cavalry during battle of laon with general sebastiani subsequently given permanent command bourbon restoration thumb upright left general nansouty portrayed as colonel general of dragoons a position he held between january 1813 and until bourbon restoration having left his command to general belliard on 8 march three days later nansouty was a part of a convoy of several officers heading to paris on road to capital they were attacked by a pulk of cossacks which managed to disperse convoy s escort nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards river aisne reaching riverbanks general got isolated and as he was preparing to cross river on horseback his horse was shot under him throwing general to ground nevertheless he stood up and swam to other bank of river and safety this event as well as his tireless activity during campaign seem to suggest that his health was not main reason of his departure from army it is also unlikely that emperor himself decided to replace him given belliard s tentative approach at battle of craonne and this general s subsequent provisional status as commander after nansouty s departure it is thus more likely that nansouty resigned following his disputes with emperor thoumas p 56 general nansouty arrived in paris and there he remained during bourbon restoration that followed napoleon s abdication he was one of first general officers to swear allegiance to new king of france louis xviii who would bestow a number of honours upon general thoumas p 57 his gesture encouraged many other generals to also swear allegiance to new regime on 12 april 1814 nansouty was named extraordinary commissioner of king in 2nd military division then on 20 april became a member of commission that was in charge of dissolution of napoleon s imperial guard he was given distinction of knight of order of saint louis on 1 june and on 6 july he was called to a command in military household of king of france as captain lieutenant of 1st company of musketeers grey musketeers despite these positions nansouty s financial situation declined severely under restoration general had had a highly honourable behaviour during napoleonic wars and unlike some of his fellow napoleonic generals had drawn no revenues from pillaging he had also been living a lofty and very costly lifestyle which he considered normal for a nobleman such as himself nansouty had been earning a high revenue from his various positions during empire and additionally napoleon was constantly paying high endowments to his best generals napoleonic endowments aside nansouty s salaries during first four months of 1814 had brought him no less than 104 000 francs but under bourbons his dignity as colonel general of dragoons had been suppressed and transformed into an honorific title of inspector of dragoons leaving him with only a 25 000 francs salary as captain lieutenant in king s military household death and resting place by second half of 1814 following his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout europe during last ten years health of general nansouty badly deteriorated he was suffering from his wounds some of which were very recent but above all from war fatigue on his death bed he is recorded to have said i have carefully reflected upon all my action ever since i was born and in all my life i have not done anyone wrong he is also said to have reasserted his christian faith and to have asked that his son be recommended for king s protection as a favour for his services just before passing away he

considerations as a commander general nansouty is reported to have been a man of spirit but also to have had an excessive inclination towards sarcasm which was damaging to his reputation and made him a number of enemies his few months spent in spain in 1808 where he commanded orderly officers of emperor and aides de camp of senior generals of general staff seem to have acquired him an unwanted reputation for mockery on service to such a point that one of his subordinates reported that no one ever knew when he was joking and when he was serious when it came to military matters though nansouty s posture became extremely imposing concise and tough a perfectionist with a keen eye and impeccable knowledge of his arm he was shocked whenever he saw his cavalry manoeuvres mishandled and then he became sarcastic at times even insulting his subordinates however whenever he went too far with his reprimands he was noticeably displeased with himself and remorseful trying to offer reparation to person he had insulted this behaviour seems to have been recurrent thoumas pp 28 29 his mood seems to have been particularly bad during his last days of service in 1814 after he had received a number of light wounds in a short period of time and foremost after he had fallen out with emperor during this period he severely mistreated one of his squadron commanders for not executing his order fast enough and even sacked his chief of staff colonel de la for a minor fault upright thumb general nansouty depicted in horace vernet s painting napoleon at friedland nansouty s character as a proud and independent commander was apparent throughout his career and his assertive nature quite typical of great cavalry commanders of time led to several clashes with his peers at least one such incident almost led to a duel with another senior cavalry commander in front of their men it occurred on 11 july 1809 a few days after battle of wagram and opposed him to general arrighi de casanova commander of 3rd heavy cavalry division both nansouty and arrighi adamantly claimed for their respective troops exclusive rights to use a small farm pond that they had found both men refused to give way and engaged in a heated argument to such a point that they almost came to a duel in order to settle matter in end more senior nansouty won out and just after incident one of arrighi s cuirassiers erected a sign sarcastically saying nansouty s pond arnold p 175 indeed at times his sarcasm was directed even at his superiors with nansouty clashing with more senior grouchy at battle of friedland nevertheless grouchy later recognised that actions of nansouty s division throughout battle were glorious thoumas p 25 in 1809 nansouty famously responded to napoleon s criticism after battle of wagram by saying it is not your majesty at any rate who can teach me how to handle cavalry three years later during campaign in russia when murat king of naples complained to him about lack of resistance of horses nansouty retorted oh yes sire this is because they lack patriotism thoumas p 39 at battle of craonne in 1814 one day before resigning he was recorded to have refused to execute napoleon s order to assault a redoubt a move which he saw as a death sentence to his men instead nansouty told emperor i am going alone there is nothing but death there and i will not lead these brave soldiers to it his behaviour on campaign can only be described as perfectly honourable and at times humane a trait which was illustrated during french revolutionary wars when he spared no effort to protect captured emigres from wrath of revolutionary radicals in army he also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men as a sign a gratitude he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back while on campaign in tyrol he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to local hospitals further evidence of his humanity was care that he displayed for lives and well being of his men whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for sake of glory courcelles pp 146 147 overall as a heavy cavalry commander nansouty was one of best men available during napoleonic wars precise methodical with perfect knowledge of cavalry tactics he was better than any other in preparing his attack dispositions he was however less daring than likes of lasalle montbrun or kellermann which did not prevent him from leading some of most memorable cavalry charges of napoleonic wars thoumas p 13 it has also been said that he reacted with calculated slowness when placed under command of murat his talents for up keeping and training his troops seemed to surpass that of his peers this was illustrated right from start of napoleonic wars with organisation of cavalry reserve in grande armee under marshal murat command of various units of this reserve was given to some of best cavalry commanders available including jean joseph ange d hautpoul louis klein marc antoine de beaumont frederic henri walther louis baraguey d hilliers and edouard jean baptiste milhaud despite fame and quality of these commanders it was nansouty s six regiment division that acquired reputation of being best serviced and most exact in its manoeuvres he was also a commander who had his men continually manoeuvre during a battle believing that this would distract them from danger that they were facing courcelles p 147 nansouty s battlefield talents were demonstrated through superb charges at austerlitz friedland eckmuhl essling borodino hanau montmirail vauchamps or craonne thus contributing to some of most glorious victories of french empire and eliciting comparisons with superb
