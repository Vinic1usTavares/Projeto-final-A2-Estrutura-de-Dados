resented expectation that she be meek and obedient in her marriage charles assured her that husbands have obligations to their wives as wives do to their husbands she came to conclusion that she should marry charles because of a spiritual witness they experienced together i felt that we were in presence of hosts of heaven and a direct incontrovertible testimony was given me that it was will of god and not my will that i should accept this man for my she and charles had six children together before her first child charles s birth lucinda had a premonition that her son would not live very long she told her mother that dress she sewed for him was like a funeral shroud and after baby charles s death at age two she buried him in it lucinda s second child a daughter named rosette also died in infancy dalton often references these lost child infants in her poetry her third child clifford was born on february 18 1875 charles was a joint owner of a store in beaver and also hauled freight to surrounding areas however his income was not sufficient to support his four wives and many children when lucinda s father remarried her sister emma came to stay with her and emma married charles in 1871 in 1876 emma left charles and lucinda as well as lds church and moved to arkansas and then california after charles s death lucinda dalton applied to cancel her temple sealing to charles in 1884 though i know he had many imperfections now brethren say he is unworthy though i know not who appointed them to judge him they urge that i stand in a very insecure position and that for my children s sake as well as my own i ought to marry again dalton feared that by remaining sealed to charles she would forfeit her claim to her children perhaps because charles was a drinker her brethren considered him unworthy of his sealing her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931 feminist views and writings as a child dalton felt jealous of boys for freedom they enjoyed they could travel alone without worrying about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school while girls were in her opinion educated reluctantly one of her teachers thought it would be wasteful for her to study algebra as she already had sufficient education for a housewife as a young woman she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men she saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry few good men arguing that it gave more women opportunity to marry she also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved dalton argued for girls and boys to have equal recreational and educational opportunities and for women to have fair wages dalton advocated exercise for girls including swimming and shooting she believed that women had right to suffrage education property control over their earned money and custody of their children she was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued

like libraries and museums or if time did not permit to enlarge their minds at relief society meetings dalton applied logic of abolitionism to cause of women s freedom she said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race women should not have to be subservient because of their gender she saw victorian ideals for women in marriage as part of that slavish subservience she argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a mormon woman at time and she and elizabeth cady stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws dalton taught for sixty years she taught her pupils energetically in spite of having crude educational resources in 1891 dalton encouraged other women teachers to ask for a raise board of education did give teachers a raise but considered dalton responsible for their petitioning and demanded that she
