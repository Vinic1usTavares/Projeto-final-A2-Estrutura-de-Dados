tennessee episode was written by richard appel who wanted to do an episode that had two things a go to work with your parents day and bart getting a driver s license go to work with your parents day idea appealed to appel because it was something he lost right to do when he went from public school to private school as a child appel considered those days to be his favorites because he didn t have to do anything at his parents job idea of having a driver s license was something that appel dreamed about when he was younger writing staff had never done a spring break episode before so they thought what would lisa and bart do on spring break and came up with road trip plot bill oakley show runner of simpsons at time said that road trips were something that writers liked to write stories about idea of four children going on a road trip was so exciting that they immediately knew they wanted to write it there was a debate over where children would go and fort lauderdale florida was first suggested but writers eventually decided to have them go to a funny unlikely place oakley s show runner partner josh weinstein said that writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on show homer and lisa had not been done too often and they wanted two characters to bond and get closer to each other episode was directed by swinton o scott iii it was difficult to animate because animators had to draw completely new designs for locations outside of springfield such as knoxville car scenes were also difficult to animate at time simpsons was using traditional animation without computers but they had to get one for a scene where camera spins around car from above car was difficult to animate because it had to look real and not boxy like a truck car was based on a 1993 oldsmobile car with rounded edges simpsons animator david silverman said that episode was probably most difficult one scott had to direct on show cultural references bart and his friends use bart s fake license to see r rated 1991 film naked lunch an adaptation of william burroughs s novel dealing with heroin addiction homosexuality and hallucinogens while leaving theater after viewing film nelson muntz remarks i can think of at least two things wrong with that title boys also see an andy williams concert in branson missouri and marquee advertising it outside reads wow he s still got it look magazine with look having been out of business for 25 years when episode first aired on road boys pick up a hitchhiker who is based on hitchhiker in texas chainsaw massacre horror film series principal skinner books a vacation with a parody of america west airlines reception in its original broadcast bart on road finished 63rd in ratings for week of march 25 to march 31 1996 with a nielsen rating of 7 2 retrieved on january 6 2009 episode was fifth highest rated show on fox network that week following x files cops party of five martin and melrose place since airing episode has received positive reviews from television critics authors of book i can t believe it s a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood said that it contains some superb touching character scenes between homer and lisa a fascinating glimpse of marge s insecurities and some nice touches that take it above show s very high average dave foster of dvd times said that bart on road is an episode which is built upon a frankly ludicrous idea which if writers were to stumble upon now we d simply see bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing but here they do give setup a great deal of consideration both on and off screen he thought story was partly believable though opportunity when bart hits road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of foster thinks what saves episode is opportunity to see lisa and homer connect once again displaying what a strong season this is for lisa as we see two share some wonderfully tender moments alongside some genuinely laugh out loud moments dvd movie guide s colin jacobson enjoyed episode and said that he loves children s experiences at their parents jobs adding and when they head out of town fun continues any episode that sends kids to site of world s fair is ok by me jennifer malkowski of dvd verdict considered best part of episode to be when patty and selma explain their job at dmv somedays we don t let line move at all we call those weekdays malkowski concluded her review by giving episode a grade of b john thorpe of central michigan life named it eighth best episode of series robert canning of ign gave episode a score of 9 5 out of 10 calling it outstanding and summarizing his review
