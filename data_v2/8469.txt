dispute soon after song s release ali complained that sneaker pimps were not present during song s final mixing and that they were never issued a master tape she went on to call song crap manson responded by calling sneaker pimps involvement a bit of a favor in a sense because we had already written song and i was interested in finding a girl to sing back up vocals on it and they were asking to be involved i wasn t that familiar with them i thought girl s voice was great when we worked on song i think they were a little upset because there wasn t much for them to do song was already done
