action of 22 august 1795 was a minor naval engagement during french revolutionary wars between a squadron of four british royal navy frigates and two frigates and a cutter from batavian navy engagement was fought off norwegian coastal island of eigeroya then in danish norway opposing forces engaged in protecting their respective countries trade routes to baltic sea war between britain and batavian republic began undeclared in spring of 1795 after admiralty ordered british warships to intercept batavian shipping following conquest of dutch republic by french republic in january 1795 a british squadron of four frigates under command of captain james alms was patrolling entrance to skagerrak in august 1795 when three sails were spotted off norwegian coast to north closing to investigate ships were discovered to be a batavian squadron of two frigates and a small cutter in face of larger british squadron batavian force turned away sailing southeast along norwegian coast

alliantie held out against more powerful stag and was eventually compelled to surrender remainder of batavian squadron escaped due to a fierce rearguard action by frigate argo reaching safety of danish harbour at eigeroya background in winter of 1794 1795 armies of french republic overran dutch republic reforming country into a client state named batavian republic dutch republic was part of coalition against republican france formed in war of first coalition at start of french revolutionary wars and their closest ally in northern europe was great britain chandler p 44 in britain admiralty was alarmed by developments in netherlands particularly seizure of dutch navy by french cavalry units while fleet was frozen into its winter harbour and gave orders that royal navy was to detain dutch merchant and naval ships as a result batavian republic and great britain began an undeclared war in spring of 1795 woodman p 53 in response to threat that batavian fleet posed admiralty established a new british fleet to oppose it admiralty named this force under command of admiral adam duncan north sea fleet fleet was based at yarmouth in east anglia and consisted mainly of older and weaker second line vessels gardiner p 170 duncan was also provided with a number of frigates essential in securing safe movement of baltic trade much of britain s vital naval stores were obtained from scandinavia and trade routes through baltic sea and north sea were vital to maintenance of royal navy one navy squadron that sailed from downs on 8 august 1795 with instructions to cruise off mouth of skaggerak in eastern north sea consisted of four ships 36 gun hms reunion under captain james alms 32 gun hms stag under captain joseph sydney yorke 50 gun hms isis under captain robert watson and 28 gun hms vestal under captain charles white scandinavian trade routes were equally important for batavian navy and to protect their merchant shipping from attack by british frigates batavian authorities also sent a frigate squadron to region consisting of 36 gun frigates alliantie and argo and 16 gun cutter vlugheid on afternoon of 22 august 1795 batavian force was sailing southeast along coast of norway then part of danish norway tacking to port towards land when british squadron was spotted approaching from south gardiner p 183 battle left 360px thumb plan of

made all sail along coastline with intention of sheltering in neutral danish harbour of eigeroya referred to in british sources as or sighting batavian ships to north alms ordered his squadron to give chase soon fastest british ship stag made use of favourable wind to pull ahead of others and at 16 15 succeeded in cutting off rearmost batavian vessel alliantie from its companions although alliantie with its 36 guns was a stronger ship than 32 gun stag its main battery was of only 12 pounder cannon compared to yorke s 18 pounder guns this coupled with presence nearby of rest of british squadron meant that alliantie in words of naval historian william james from first had no chance of success james p 292 despite odds against him batavian captain engaged stag yorke laying his ship alongside alliantie and frigates exchanging broadsides for an hour before batavian captain his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered surrendered at 17 15 while stag and alliantie fought their duel action continued elsewhere with remaining batavian ships making progress eastwards along norwegian coastline with british squadron attempting to cut them off from channel between eigeroya and norwegian mainland in which batavian ships could shelter protected by danish neutrality vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit but argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from reunion and isis replying in kind argo was subsequently found to have been hit thirty times by 24 pounder shot and had much of its sails and rigging torn away requiring extensive repairs eventually batavian persistence paid off and vlugheid and argo successfully escaped into neutral harbour of eigeroya before alms could intercept them aftermath alms sent captured alliantie back to britain under command of lieutenant patrick tonyn of stag and gave despatches to admiralty to lieutenant william of reunion to deliver james p 293 he himself remained at sea with squadron completing their assigned patrol british casualties included four killed and 13 wounded on stag one killed and three wounded on reunion and two wounded on isis only vestal escaped without any damage or casualties batavian casualties in engagement are not known due to failure of alms to record alliantie s losses in his report to admiralty an omission which james criticises him for it is known that argo lost two men killed and 15 wounded in chase clowes p 493 surviving batavian ships remained at anchor in eigeroya channel until spring of 1796 when they successfully returned to netherlands brenton p 93 alliantie was subsequently taken to spithead and purchased for royal navy as frigate hms alliance for which prize money was distributed to crews of british ships shared equally among them sailors on isis alone shared ps240 equivalent of ps as of over ensuing months and years duncan s fleet was largely successful in protecting north sea trade routes from depredations of raiders from batavian ports and in 1797 inflicted a crushing defeat on batavian fleet at battle of camperdown gardiner p 176 meanwhile reaction in batavian republic was one of great indignation in a resolution of september 3 1795 provisionele representanten van het volk van holland dutch representative at danish court christiaan bangeman huygens was ordered to complain about violation of danish neutrality as norwegian danish pilots had already gone aboard dutch ships indicating that those had entered danish territorial waters as resolution noted and to demand that denmark would make representations at court of st james s
