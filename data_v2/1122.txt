rights within society of india like their feminist counterparts all over world feminists in india seek gender equality right to work for equal wages right to equal access to health and education and equal political rights ray fields of protest women s movements in india university of minnesota press minneapolis mn 1999 page 13 indian feminists also have fought against culture specific issues within india s patriarchal society such as inheritance laws history of feminism in india can be divided into three phases first phase beginning in mid 19th century initiated when male european colonists began to speak out against social evils of sati second phase from 1915 to indian independence when gandhi incorporated women s movements into quit india movement and independent women s organisations began to emerge and finally third phase post independence which has focused on fair treatment of women at home after marriage in work force and right to political parity despite progress made by indian feminist movements women living in modern india still face many issues of discrimination india s patriarchal culture has made process of gaining land ownership rights and access to education challenging in past two decades there has also emerged a trend of sex selective abortion to indian feminists these are seen as injustices worth struggling against gangoli 2007 page 2 as in west there has been some criticism of feminist movements in india they have especially been criticised for focusing too much on women already privileged and neglecting needs and representation of

injustices during this period indian feminists were influenced by western debates being conducted about violence against women however due to difference in historical and social culture of india

they also point out matriarchal pre history of indian society and emphasize on fact that there have been periods of indian history that were not patriarchal and communities that were largely female

india is not a singular theoretical orientation it has changed over time in relation to historical and cultural realities levels of consciousness perceptions and actions of individual women and women as a group widely used definition is an awareness of women s oppression and exploitation in society at work and within family and conscious action by women and men to change this situation bhasin

1999 page 14 rise of liberal feminism in west in 1970s focused deeply on demands for equal opportunities in education and employment as well as ending violence against women to a large extent emerging feminist movement in india was influenced by western ideals these called for education and equal rights but also adapted their appeals to local issues and concerns such as dowry related violence against women sati sex selective abortion and custodial rape some indian feminists have suggested that these issues are not specifically indian in nature but rather a reflection of a wider trend of patriarchal oppression of women history according to maitrayee unlike western feminist movement india s movement was initiated by men and later joined by women but feminism as an initiative by women started independently a little later in maharashtra by pioneering advocates of women s rights and education savitribai phule who started first school for girls in india 1848 tarabai shinde who wrote india s first feminist text stri purush tulana a comparison between women and men in 1882 and pandita ramabai who criticized patriarchy and caste system in hinduism married outside her caste and converted to christianity 1880s efforts of bengali reformers included abolishing sati which was a widow s death by burning on her husband s funeral pyre jewels of authority women and textual tradition in hindu india new york oxford up 2002 abolishing custom of child marriage abolishing disfiguring of widows introducing marriage of upper caste hindu widows promoting women s education obtaining legal rights for women to own property and requiring law to acknowledge women s status by granting them basic rights in matters such as adoption 19th century was period that saw a majority of women s issues which came under spotlight and reforms began to be made much of early reforms for indian women were conducted by men however by late 19th century they were joined in their efforts by their wives sisters daughters and other individuals directly affected by campaigns such as those carried out for women s education by late 20th century women gained greater autonomy through formation of independent women s own organisations by late thirties and forties a new narrative began to be constructed regarding women s activism this was newly researched and expanded with vision to create logical and organic links between feminism and marxism as well as with anti communalism and anti etc constitution of india did guarantee equality between sexes which created a relative lull in women s movements until 1970s kumar radha history of doing kali for women new delhi 1998 during formative years of women s rights movements difference between sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles functions aims and desires were different as a result they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also over course of time this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women s movements early 19th century reformers argued that difference between men and women was no reason for subjection of women in society however later reformers were of opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society for example as mothers therefore there was a need for proper care of women s rights with formation of women s organisations and their own participation in campaigns their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light this time argument was for women s rights to speech education and emancipation however image of women with mother as a symbol underwent changes over time from an emphasis on family to creation of an archetypal mother figure evoking deep often atavistic images first

equality and individual rights rise of concept of nationalism and introspection of discriminatory practices brought about social reform movements related to caste and gender relations this first phase of feminism in india was initiated by men to uproot social evils of sati widow immolation napier william 1851 history of general sir charles napier s administration of p 35 london chapman and hall at books google com accessed 10 july 2011 to allow widow remarriage to forbid child marriage and to reduce illiteracy as well as to regulate age of consent and to ensure property rights through legal intervention in addition to this some upper caste hindu women rejected constraints they faced under brahminical traditions however efforts for improving status of women in indian society were somewhat thwarted by late nineteenth century as nationalist movements emerged in india these movements resisted colonial interventions in gender relations particularly in areas of family relations in mid to late nineteenth century there was a national form of resistance to any colonial efforts made to modernize hindu family this included age of consent controversy that erupted after government tried to raise age of marriage for women gangoli 2007 pages 88 89 several indian states were ruled by women during british colonial advance including jhansi rani rani bhopal begum and punjab kaur second phase 1915 1947 during this period struggle against colonial rule intensified nationalism became pre eminent cause claiming indian superiority became tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essential model of indian womanhood similar to that of victorian womanhood special yet separated from public space gandhi legitimized and expanded indian women s public activities by initiating them into non violent civil disobedience movement against british raj he exalted their feminine roles of caring self abnegation sacrifice and tolerance and carved a niche for those in public arena peasant women played an important role in rural of borsad and bardoli women only organisations like all india women s conference aiwc and national federation of indian women emerged women were grappling with issues relating to scope of women s political participation women s franchise communal awards and leadership roles in political parties 1920s was a new era for indian women and is defined as feminism that was responsible for creation of localized women s associations these associations emphasized women s education issues developed livelihood strategies for working class women and also organised national level women s associations such as all india women s conference aiwc was closely affiliated with indian national congress under leadership of mahatma gandhi it worked within nationalist and anti colonialist freedom movements this made mass mobilisation of women an integral part of indian nationalism women therefore were a very important part of various nationalist and anti colonial efforts including civil disobedience movements in 1930s after independence all india women s conference continued to operate and in 1954 indian communist party formed its own women s wing known as national federation of indian women however feminist agendas and movements became less active right after india s 1947 independence as nationalist agendas on nation building took precedence over feminist issues gangoli 2007 page 17 18 women s participation in struggle for freedom developed their critical consciousness about their role and rights in independent india this resulted in introduction of franchise and civic rights of women in indian constitution there was provision for women s upliftment through affirmative action maternal health and child care provision creches equal pay for equal work etc state adopted a patronizing role towards women for example india s constitution states that women are a weaker section of population and therefore need assistance to function as equals thus women in india did not have to struggle for basic rights as did women in west utopia ended soon when social and cultural ideologies and structures failed to honour newly acquired concepts of fundamental rights and democracy post 1947 thumb indira gandhi nee nehru was only child of india s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru she is first and only woman prime minister of india and second longest serving prime minister post independence feminists began to redefine extent to which women were allowed to engage in workforce prior to independence most feminists accepted sexual divide within labour force however feminists in 1970s challenged inequalities that had been established and fought to reverse them these inequalities included unequal wages for women relegation of women to unskilled spheres of work and restricting women as a reserve army for labour in other words feminists aim was to abolish free service of women who were essentially being used as cheap capital feminist class consciousness also came into focus in 1970s with feminists recognizing inequalities not just between men and women but also within power structures such as caste tribe language religion region class etc this also posed as a challenge for feminists while shaping their overreaching campaigns as there had to be a focus within efforts to ensure that fulfilling demands of one group would not create further inequalities for another now in early twenty first century focus of indian feminist movement has gone beyond treating women as useful members of society and a right to parity but also having power to decide course of their personal lives and right of self determination in 1966 indira gandhi became first female prime minister of india she served as prime minister of india for three consecutive terms 1966 77 and a fourth term from 1980 until she was assassinated in 1984 section 53a of code of criminal procedure of indian law 1973 lays down certain provisions for medical

of travancore succession act of 1916 and cochin succession act 1921 while elsewhere in india same community followed indian succession act of 1925 in 1991 kerala high court restricted entry of women above age of 10 and below age of 50 from sabarimala shrine as they were of menstruating age however on 28 september 2018 supreme court of india lifted ban on entry of women it said that discrimination against women on any grounds even religious is unconstitutional state of kerala is often viewed as ideal progressive leader in women s rights movement in india among states kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women s health as well as greater female inheritance and property rights for example a 1998 study conducted by bina agarwal found that while only 13 of all women

revised statutes of 2013 indian law in section also mandates minimum punishment in certain cases for instance if sexual assault inflicts an injury which causes death or causes victim to be in a persistent vegetative state then convicted rapist must be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of at least twenty years and up to remainder of natural life or with a death penalty in case of gang rape

constitutes statutory rape in may 2013 supreme court of india held that two finger test on a rape victim violates her right to privacy and asked delhi government to provide better medical procedures

married woman without permission of her husband prior to november 2018 women were forbidden to climb a court ruling removed prohibition issues despite on paper advancements many problems still remain which inhibit women from fully taking advantage of new rights and opportunities in india there are many traditions and customs that have been an important part of indian culture for hundreds of years religious laws and expectations or personal laws enumerated by each specific religion often conflict with indian constitution eliminating rights and powers women should legally have despite these crossovers in legality indian government does not interfere with religion and personal laws they hold indian society is largely composed of hierarchical systems within families and communities these hierarchies can be broken down into age sex ordinal position kinship relationships within families and caste lineage wealth occupations and relationship to ruling power within community when hierarchies emerge within family based on social convention and economic need girls in poorer families suffer twice impact of vulnerability and stability from birth girls are automatically entitled to less from playtime to food to education girls can expect to always be entitled to less than their brothers girls also have less access to their family s income and assets which is exacerbated among poor rural indian families from start it is understood that females will be burdened with strenuous work and exhausting responsibilities for rest of their lives always with little to no compensation or recognition bhatt ela r we are poor but so many story of self employed women in india new york oxford up 2005 india is also a patriarchal society which by definition describes cultures in which males as fathers or husbands are assumed to be in charge and official heads of households a patrilineal system governs society where descent and inheritance are traced through male line and men are generally in control of distribution of family resources these traditions and ways of indian life have been in effect for so long that this type of lifestyle is what women have become accustomed to and expect indian women often do not take full advantage of their constitutional rights because they are not properly aware or informed of them women also tend to have poor utilization of voting rights because they possess low levels of political awareness and sense of political efficacy women are not often encouraged to become informed about issues due to this political parties do not invest much time in female candidates because there is a perception that they are a wasted investment female to male ratio in india is 933 to 1000 showing that there are numerically fewer women in country than men this is due to several factors including infanticides most commonly among female infants and poor care of female infants and childbearing women although outlawed infanticides are still very common in rural india and are continuing to become even more prominent this is due to fact most especially in rural areas that families cannot afford female children because of dowry they must pay when their daughter gets married like infanticide payment of dowry is also illegal but is still a frequent and prevalent occurrence in rural india chaudhuri maitrayee feminism in india issues in

enforcement of this law has been largely ignored sen amartya many face of gender inequality new republic 17 september 2001 page 40 marriage most of average indian woman s life is spent in marriage many women are still married before legal age of 18 and incidence of non marriage is low in india childbearing and raising children are priorities of early adulthood for indian women thus if they enter workforce at all it is far later than indian men urban indian men reach peak of their labour force participation between ages of 25 and 29 while urban indian women do so between ages of 40 and 44 ray 1999 pages 25 28 because of this women have less time for acquisition of skills and fewer opportunities for job improvements there is a poor representation of women in indian workforce females have a ten percent higher drop out rate than males from middle and primary schools as well as lower levels of literacy than men since unemployment is also high in india it is easy for employers to manipulate law especially when it comes to women because it is part of indian culture for women not to argue with men additionally labour unions are insensitive to women s needs women also have to

down a law making it a crime for a man to have sex with a married woman without permission of her husband clothing another issue that concerns women is dress code expected of them islam requires both men and women to dress modestly this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments there is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes in 2014 an indian family court in mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her

it said that discrimination against women on any grounds even religious is unconstitutional there has been some criticism from dalit groups that indian feminism tends to represent upper caste and upper class hindu women while ignoring and marginalising interests of dalit women debates on caste and gender oppression have been furthered by other backward class members of different political parties arguing in state assemblies that lower caste women s interests are best represented by women from these castes working towards this end women within dalit castes have formed organisations such as all india dalit women s forum and national federation of dalit women and dalit solidarity which focus on gendered implications of caste based violence and oppression such as ways in which dalit women suffer from urban poverty and displacement muslim community hindu and muslim communities in india were treated differently by government in that separate types of concessions were made for each community in order to accommodate their separate religious laws and regulations case of shah bano begun in 1985 was one such example of rajiv gandhi attempting to make concessions for muslim community to in turn secure support for congress shah bano a 73 year old muslim woman was divorced by her husband after forty three years of marriage according to sharia or muslim law her husband was not required to pay her alimony shah bano challenged this decision in supreme court which ultimately ruled in her favour and ordered her husband to pay her a monthly maintenance allowance this caused chaos amongst muslim clerics who denounced judgement and suggested that their religion islam was under attack in country in a fear of losing overall muslim support rajiv succumbed to pressures of conservative from muslims community and his own party and backed muslim women protection of rights on divorce bill which restricts alimony for muslim women only for 90 days after divorce this caused

illiteracy social conservatism economic dependence on men domestic and social violence a wide gap between formal constitutional equality and actual inequality inferiority and subordination of indian women many muslim women reformists are pointing to areas in quran and sunna which address women s rights these reformists also demand for an interpretation of quran to be female friendly and be open minded for an islam which has prioritized women s rights and equality all india muslim women s personal law board regards that muslim personal law is not a true reflection of intention of quran points out several passages in quran which discuss gender equality and even distinguish islam has a religious text which as compared to other religious texts advocates for women s rights one of larger social

sector and nearly 12 5 in industry sector as of year 2000 high illiteracy rates among women confine them to lower paying unskilled jobs with less job security than men even in agricultural jobs where work of men and women are highly similar women are still more likely to be paid less for same amount and type of work as men although government of india has tried to eliminate inequality in workforce women still receive unequal treatment men are more likely to get promotions than women besides for men nature of their jobs often changed with these promotions unlike women who usually only got

and economical challenges for women particularly for working class and lower caste women multinational companies in india have been seen to exploit labour of young underpaid and disadvantaged women in free trade zones and sweat shops and use young lower middle class educated women in call centres these women have few effective labour rights or rights to collective action gangoli 2007 page 13
