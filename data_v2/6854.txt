thumb upright 1 13 map of irish speaking areas of ireland places mentioned in this article are named on map phonology of irish language varies from dialect to dialect there is no standard pronunciation of irish therefore this article focuses on phenomena that pertain generally to most or all dialects and on major differences among dialects detailed discussion of dialects can be found in specific articles ulster irish connacht irish and munster irish irish phonology has been studied as a discipline since late 19th century with numerous researchers publishing descriptive accounts of dialects from all regions where language is spoken more recently irish phonology has been focus of theoretical linguists who have produced a number of books articles and doctoral theses on topic one of most important aspects of irish phonology is that almost all consonants come in pairs with one having a broad pronunciation and other a slender one broad consonants are either velarized that is back of tongue is pulled back and slightly up in direction of soft palate while consonant is being articulated or simply velar e g slender consonants are palatalized which means tongue is pushed up toward hard palate during articulation contrast between broad and slender consonants is crucial in irish because meaning of a word can change if a broad consonant is substituted for a slender consonant or vice versa for example only difference in pronunciation between words cow and alive is that is pronounced with a broad b sound while is pronounced with a slender b sound contrast between broad and slender consonants plays a critical role not only in distinguishing individual consonants themselves but also in pronunciation of surrounding vowels in determination of which consonants can stand next to each other and in behavior of words that begin with a vowel this broad slender distinction is similar to hard soft one of several slavic languages like russian irish language shares a number of phonological characteristics with its nearest linguistic relatives scottish gaelic and manx as well as with hiberno english with which it is in closest language contact history of discipline thumb page 7 title page of die ein beitrag zur erforschung des aran dialect a contribution to study of west irish until end of nineteenth century linguistic discussions of irish focused either on traditional grammar of language issues like inflection of nouns verbs and adjectives or on historical development of sounds from proto indo european through proto celtic to old irish first descriptive analysis of phonology of an irish dialect was which was based on author s fieldwork in aran islands this was followed by a phonetic description of dialect of near glenties county donegal is predominantly a historical account but has some description of modern dialects as well alf published early descriptions of both ulster and munster varieties and for village of torr in for munster and for now extinct dialect of south armagh dialect of on dingle peninsula was described by from 1944 to 1968 dublin institute for advanced studies published a series of monographs each describing phonology of one local dialect for west muskerry in county cork and vicinity first published 1945 for in county galway barna and vicinity for an county waterford for tourmakeady in county mayo for teelin county donegal for erris in county mayo more recent descriptive phonology has been published by for rosguill in northern donegal for and also near glenties for in connemara and vicinity and for dingle peninsula in county kerry research into theoretical phonology of irish began with which follows principles and practices of sound pattern of english and which formed basis of phonology sections of dissertations examining irish phonology from a theoretical point of view include in optimality theory and and in government phonology consonants most dialects of irish contain at a minimum consonant phonemes shown in following chart see international phonetic alphabet for an explanation of symbols consonant is neither broad nor slender consonant phonemes labial coronal dorsal glottal broad slender broad slender broad slender stop voiceless voiced fricative approximant voiceless voiced nasal tap lateral on and broad velar or velarized consonants have a noticeable velar offglide a very short vowel like sound before front vowels which sounds like english w but made without rounding lips ipa symbol for this sound is thus nine and way manner are pronounced and respectively this velar offglide is pronounced with lip rounding like w after labial consonants so yellow is pronounced similarly slender palatal or palatalized consonants have a palatal offglide like english y before back vowels e g thick is pronounced when a broad consonant follows a front vowel there is a very short vowel sound called an onglide just before consonant e g sell is pronounced similarly when a slender consonant follows a back vowel there is an onglide before consonant e g place is pronounced drinking gen is pronounced understanding is and to us is allophones which can be written as or has two basic allophones approximant and velarized voiced labiodental fricative distribution of these allophones varies from dialect to dialect in munster generally only is found and in ulster generally only is found in connacht is found word initially before vowels e g is and in other positions e g saint autumn and hurried remaining labial fricatives are typically labiodental but they as well as fricative allophone of have bilabial allophones in many dialects distribution depends partly on environment are more likely to be found adjacent to rounded vowels and partly on individual speaker among coronals most are alveolar but broad stops and lateral are typically dental and slender coronal fricative is typically slender coronal stops may be realized as alveolo palatal in a number of dialects including tourmakeady erris and teelin slender dorsal stops may be articulated as true palatals or as phoneme has three allophones in most dialects a palatal approximant before vowels besides and at ends of syllables e g nice will be a voiced post palatal fricative before consonants e g sun and an intermediate sound with more frication than but less frication than before e g straightened as in english voiceless stops are aspirated articulated with a puff of air immediately upon release at start of a word while voiced stops may be incompletely voiced but are never aspirated voiceless stops are unaspirated after and e g terror however stops remain aspirated after clitic is e g it s crooked several researchers e g and use transcriptions like etc indicating they consider stops that occur after voiceless fricatives to be devoiced allophones of voiced stops rather than unaspirated allophones of voiceless stops as is actually case in scottish gaelic but this is a minority view fortis and lenis sonorants in old irish sonorants those spelled were divided not only into broad and slender types but also into fortis and lenis types precise phonetic definition of these terms is somewhat vague but coronal fortis sounds those spelled were probably longer in duration and may have had a larger area of contact between tongue and roof of mouth than lenis sounds fortis m was probably a normal while lenis m was a nasalized semivowel perhaps tending towards a nasalized fricative or when palatalized by convention fortis coronals are transcribed with capital letters lenis with lower case some authors such as instead use latin for fortis and greek for lenis thus old irish had four rhotic phonemes four lateral phonemes and four coronal nasal phonemes fortis and lenis sonorants contrasted with each other between vowels and word finally after vowels in old irish for example he shears vs he may carry hazel vs sin stake vs sound word initially only fortis sounds were found but they became lenis in environments where triggered lenition was found mystery vs his mystery provision vs his provision in modern language four have been reduced to two in all dialects having merged as for and nasals some dialects have kept all four distinct while others have reduced them to three or two distinct phonemes as summarized in following table old irish ulster connacht munster rosguill glenties mayo connemara aran dingle peninsula west muskerry word initially elsewhere note and are alveolo palatal consonants as for fortis and lenis m in time lenis version nasalized semivowel or labial fricative came to be pronounced as a regular semivowel or fricative along with nasalization of preceding vowel later loss of between vowels has resulted in phonemically nasalized vowels in some modern dialects see below but these are not robustly maintained in any dialect strong tendency is to eliminate nasalization entirely original nasalized semivowel is still reflected as in spelling however vowels thumb vowel phonemes of connacht irish thumb vowel phonemes of munster irish thumb vowel phonemes of ulster irish vowel sounds vary from dialect to dialect but in general connacht and munster at least agree in having monophthongs and schwa which is found only in unstressed syllables and falling diphthongs and vowels of ulster irish are more divergent and are not discussed in this article vowel backness backness of vowels that is horizontal position of highest point of tongue depends to a great extent on quality broad or slender of adjacent consonants some researchers e g have argued that and are actually allophones of same phoneme as are and as in a vertical vowel system under this view these phonemes are not marked at an abstract level as either front vowels or back vowels rather they acquire a specification for or backness from consonants around them in this article however more traditional assumption that are four distinct phonemes will be followed descriptions of allophones in this section come from pronunciations therefore reflect munster accent of dingle peninsula unless otherwise noted however they largely hold for other munster and connacht accents as well close vowels four close vowel phonemes of irish are fully close and and near close and their exact pronunciation depends on quality of surrounding consonants is realized as a

back while end point ranges from to above lamb strike nasalized vowels in general vowels in irish are nasalized when adjacent to nasal consonants for some speakers there are reported to be minimal pairs between nasal vowels and oral vowels indicating that nasal vowels are also separate phonemes these generally result from an earlier nasalized semivowel historically lenited version of that has since been lost however contrast is not robust in any dialect most published descriptions say that nasal vowels are present in speech of only some usually older speakers potential minimal pairs include those shown in table below nasal vowel oral vowel spelling pronunciation gloss spelling pronunciation gloss doubt yarn ford luck in phrase in front of opposite righteous sorrow hound pairs of shears two people autumn genitive limit hands day shooting generous poison genitive washing oar genitive saying in addition where a vowel is nasalized because it is adjacent to a nasal consonant it often retains its nasalization in related forms where consonant is no longer nasal for example nasal of mother is replaced by in phrase his mother but vowel remains nasalized similarly in snow vowel after is nasalized while in snow gen is replaced by in some northern dialects but nasalized vowel remains phonotactics most interesting aspects of irish phonotactics revolve around behavior of consonant clusters here it is important to distinguish between clusters that occur at beginnings of words and those that occur after vowels although there is overlap between two groups word initial consonant clusters thumb upright 1 36 a summary of two consonant clusters available in non mutation environments thumb upright 1 36 a summary of two consonant clusters available in mutation environments irish words can begin with clusters of two or three consonants in general all consonants in a cluster agree in their quality i e either all are broad or all are slender two consonant clusters consist of an obstruent consonant followed by a liquid or nasal consonant however labial may not be followed by a nasal examples from include milking fine button law usual idiot slice snow poker and long for in addition and may be followed by a voiceless stop as in purse and story further cluster occurs in word women and a few forms related to it three consonant clusters consist of or plus a voiceless stop plus a liquid examples include rumpus scream flash fun and streak one exception to quality agreement is that broad is found before slender labials and for some speakers in connemara and dingle before as well examples include berries scythe dependent inspire and story in environment of an initial consonant mutation there is a much wider range of possible onset clusters for example in a lenition environment following occur tasted broke practiced bent stuck acted slipped swam reached in an environment following are found flower years you would break warp bridge ladder you would dress you would leave you would act in donegal mayo and connemara dialects but not usually on aran islands coronal nasals can follow only respectively in a word initial cluster after other consonants they are replaced by hill women liking long for under lenition become as expected in these dialects but after definite article an they become snow snow lenited form snow gen post vocalic consonant clusters and epenthesis thumb clusters subject to epenthesis like word initial consonant clusters post vocalic consonant clusters usually agree in broad or slender quality only exception here is that broad not slender appears before slender coronals two people trade doors handle advice a cluster of or followed by a labial or dorsal consonant except voiceless stops is broken up by an vowel abrupt blue mistake certain service anger dark bold dove pleasant sparrow venom a name for ireland name mind animal there is no epenthesis however if vowel preceding cluster is long or a diphthong wrinkle term insight duty there is also no epenthesis into words that are at least three syllables long firmament throat dandelion carmelite phonological processes vowel initial words vowel initial words in irish exhibit behavior that has led linguists to suggest that vowel sound they begin with on surface is not actually first sound in word at a more abstract level specifically when a clitic ending in a consonant precedes a word beginning with vowel consonant of clitic surfaces as either broad or slender depending on specific word in question for example n of definite article is slender before word wonder but broad before word age wonder gen vs age one analysis of these facts is that vowel initial words actually begin at an abstract level of representation with a kind of empty consonant that consists of nothing except information broad or slender another analysis is that vowel initial words again at an abstract level all begin with one of two semivowels one triggering and other triggering of a preceding consonant lengthening before fortis sonorants where reflexes of old irish fortis sonorants appear in syllable final position in some cases only in word final position they trigger a lengthening or diphthongization of preceding vowel in most dialects of irish details vary from dialect to dialect in donegal and mayo lengthening is found only before rd rl rn before rr except when a vowel follows and in a few words also before word final ll for example top tall inch spinning wheel yonder in connemara aran islands and munster lengthening is found generally not only in environments listed above but also before nn unless a vowel follows and before m and ng at end of a word for example word hole is pronounced in all of these regions while grip is pronounced in connemara and aran and in munster because vowels behave differently before broad sonorants than before slender ones in many cases and because there is generally no lengthening except by analogy when sonorants are followed by a vowel there is a variety of vowel between different related word forms for example in dingle head is pronounced with a diphthong but genitive singular of same word is pronounced with a long vowel while plural meaning heads is pronounced with a short vowel this lengthening has received a number of different explanations within context of theoretical phonology all accounts agree that some property of fortis sonorant is being transferred to preceding vowel but details about what property that is vary from researcher to researcher also repeated in argue that fortis sonorant is tense a term only vaguely defined phonetically and that this tenseness is transferred to vowel where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and or diphthongization argues that triggering consonant is associated with a unit of syllable weight called a mora this mora then shifts to vowel creating a long vowel or a diphthong expands on that analysis to argue that fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root that is bottom of tongue is pushed upward during articulation of consonant and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement devoicing where a voiced obstruent or comes into contact with is absorbed into other sound which then becomes voiceless in case of devoicing is to devoicing is found most prominently in future of first conjugation verbs where sound is represented by letter f and in formation of verbal adjectives where sound is spelled th for example verb sweep ends in voiced consonant but its future tense will sweep and verbal adjective swept have voiceless consonant sandhi irish exhibits a number of external sandhi effects i e phonological changes across word boundaries particularly in rapid speech most common type of sandhi in irish is assimilation which means that a sound changes its pronunciation in order to become more similar to an adjacent sound one type of assimilation in irish is found when a coronal consonant one of d l n r s t changes from being broad to being slender before a word that begins with a slender coronal consonant or from being slender to being broad before a word that begins with a broad coronal consonant for example deceive ends with a broad ll but in phrase it deceived me ll has become slender because following word starts with a slender coronal consonant consonant n may also assimilate to place of articulation of a following consonant becoming labial before a labial consonant palatal before a palatal consonant and velar before a velar consonant for example nn of one becomes in a lame one and in a one a voiced consonant at end of a word may become voiceless when next word begins with a voiceless consonant as in he bent where b sound of bent has become a p sound before voiceless s of stress general facts of stress placement an irish word normally has only one stressed syllable namely first syllable of word in ipa transcription a stressed syllable is marked with symbol to left of syllable examples include left past tense of leave and dishonor however certain words especially adverbs and loanwords have stress on a noninitial syllable e g only tobacco in most compound words primary stress falls on first member and a secondary stress marked with falls on second member e g spent bog some compounds however have primary stress on both first and second member e g a terrible lie in munster stress is attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in second or third syllable of a word e g girl request in now extinct accent of east mayo stress was attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in same way as in munster in addition stress was attracted to a short vowel before word final ll m or nn when that word was also final in its utterance for example horse was pronounced in isolation or as last word of a sentence but as in middle of a sentence nature of unstressed vowels in general short vowels are all reduced to schwa in unstressed syllables but there are some exceptions in munster if third syllable of a word is stressed and preceding two syllables are short first of two unstressed syllables is not reduced to schwa instead it receives a secondary stress e g scythe man also in munster an unstressed short vowel is not reduced to schwa if following syllable contains a stressed or e g art gather in ulster long vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened but are not reduced to schwa e g girl gallon processes relating to x voiceless velar fricative spelled is associated with some unusual patterns in many dialects of irish for one thing its presence after vowel triggers behavior atypical of short vowels for another and its slender counterpart interchange with voiceless glottal fricative in a variety of ways and can sometimes be deleted altogether behavior of ax in munster stress is attracted to in second syllable of a word if it is followed by provided first syllable and third syllable if there is one contains a short vowel examples include lame and chips however if first or third syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong stress is attracted to that syllable instead and before is reduced to as normal e g listen wether in ulster unstressed before is not reduced to schwa e g cattle interaction of x and c with h in many dialects of irish voiceless dorsal fricatives and alternate with under a variety of circumstances for example as lenition of and is replaced by before back vowels e g i would give drove in munster becomes after a vowel e g twenty in ring becomes at end of a monosyllabic word e g fear in some ulster dialects such as that of tory island can be replaced by e g not and can even be deleted word finally as in greedy in other ulster dialects can be deleted before as well e g seven samples following table shows some sample sentences from aran dialect he was looking out window when i went past he wouldn t see a hole through a ladder i e he s very near sighted i am wet

but often i m not very welcome i have heard tell that we ll have a wet summer this year but it seems to me that that story is strange are potatoes as good as he said irish spoken in munster isn t same as our irish first eight chapters of peadar ua laoghaire s autobiography mo fein at wikisource include recordings of text being read by a native speaker of muskerry munster irish comparison with other languages scottish gaelic and manx many of phonological processes found in irish are found also in its nearest relatives scottish gaelic and manx for example both languages contrast broad and slender consonants but only at coronal and dorsal places of articulation both scottish gaelic and manx have lost distinction in labial consonants change of etc to etc is found in manx and in most scottish dialects evidence from written manuscripts suggests it had begun in scottish gaelic as early as sixteenth century and was well established in both scottish gaelic and manx by late 17th to early 18th century lengthening or diphthongization of vowels before fortis sonorants is also found in both languages stress pattern of scottish gaelic is same as that in connacht and ulster irish while in manx stress is attracted to long vowels and diphthongs in noninitial syllables but under more restricted conditions than in munster manx and many dialects of scottish gaelic share with ulster irish

exception of correspond to vowel phones of irish irish stops are common realizations of english phonemes hiberno english also allows where it is permitted in irish but excluded in other dialects of
