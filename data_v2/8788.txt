banksia paludosa commonly known as marsh or swamp banksia is a species of shrub in plant genus banksia it is native to new south wales australia where it is found between sydney and batemans bay with an isolated population further south around eden there are two recognised subspecies nominate of which is a spreading shrub to 1 5 m 5 ft in height and subsp astrolux is a taller shrub to 5 m 16 ft high found only in nattai national park native mammals such as brown antechinus and sugar glider are important pollinators of b paludosa several species of honeyeaters visit flower spikes as do ants and european honey bee response to bushfire depends on subspecies subspecies paludosa regenerates from underground lignotubers while plants of subspecies astrolux are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in plant canopy b paludosa is sometimes seen in cultivation with dwarf forms being registered and sold description two subspecies of banksia paludosa are identical in foliage and flower and differ only on their size habit and response to bushfire banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa is most commonly encountered as a spreading multistemmed shrub generally under 1 5 m 5 ft high or rarely 2 m 7 ft in heathland habitats such as nadgee or barren grounds nature reserves it may not exceed 1 m 3 ft in height at an exposed area such as green cape it is reduced further to a 30 cm 12 in prostrate shrub this subspecies has a woody base known as a lignotuber which begins developing in first year of life banksia paludosa subspecies astrolux is a more open non lignotuberous shrub which reaches 5 m 16 ft high bark and foliage is rough and covered in multiplication signs although new growth is covered in fine hair stems are generally less than 2 cm 0 8 in in diameter and may be red or yellow when young leaves are alternate or whorled along stems and spear to egg shaped lanceolate to obovate in shape they measure 4 13 cm 1 6 5 2 in long and 1 3 cm 0 4 1 2 in wide leaf margins are entire or have occasional serrations leaf undersurface is white with a midrib flowering occurs over autumn and winter april to july and flower spikes known as inflorescences arise from stems that are three or more years old cylindrical in shape they are composed of a central woody spike or axis from which a large number of compact floral units arise perpendicularly to it and are generally 3 2 4 cm 1 3 1 8 in wide and 7 13 cm 2 8 5 2 in high individual flowers are more openly spaced than those of other banksias and this is especially evident in late bud this coupled with tall thin shape of flower spike makes species quite distinctive flower spikes are pale to golden brown in bud and open to a more gold colour after anthesis variations are seen one form having a grey limb in bud and plants with particularly tall flower spikes have been recorded near huskisson at jervis bay as with most banksias in anthesis opening of individual buds proceeds up flower spike from base to top acropetal process from bud to finishing of flowering takes six to eight weeks as they age flower spikes fade to grey with old flowers remaining for years up to 60 woody follicles develop on each spike known in this stage as an infructescence narrow and elliptic they measure long high and wide some follicles open spontaneously but most remain closed until burnt by bushfire each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to seeds measuring in length seed is obovate and composed of a dark brown wide membranous wing and sickle shaped falcate seed proper which measures long by wide seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges and often glistens resulting seedling first grows two asymmetrical obovate cotyledon leaves measuring long by wide which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear first pairs of leaves are oppositely arranged on stem have 3 4 teeth on their margins and are narrowly obovate in shape they are around and each following pair of leaves is slightly larger cotyledons of banksia paludosa b marginata and b integrifolia are very similar in appearance foliages of larger shrubs of both banksia paludosa subspecies resemble those of banksia conferta subsp penicillata but latter has a wider inflorescence and buds are more crowded in appearance on inflorescence before anthesis banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to b oblongifolia but latter has a prominent midrib on leaf underside new growth is covered in rusty fur and old spikes are bare of flowers latter grows on dryer rocky soils while former grows in wetter sandy soils taxonomy banksia paludosa was first described by robert brown in his 1810 on proteaceae of jussieu and named banksia paludosa in 1870 george bentham demoted it to a variety of b integrifolia coast banksia but in 1981 alex george restored it to species rank its specific epithet is derived from latin noun palus marsh but is somewhat misleading as it more often grows on sandstone ridges and heathland its common names marsh banksia and swamp banksia echo its scientific name placement within banksia current taxonomic arrangement of genus banksia is based on botanist alex george s 1999 monograph for flora of australia book series in this arrangement b paludosa is placed in banksia subgenus banksia because its inflorescences take form of banksia s characteristic flower spikes section banksia because of its straight styles and series salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical in a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 kevin thiele placed it in newly described subseries integrifoliae within series salicinae however this subgrouping of salicinae was not supported by george b paludosa s placement within banksia may be summarised as follows genus banksia subgenus isostylis subgenus banksia section oncostylis section coccinea section banksia series grandes series banksia series crocinae series prostratae series cyrtostylis series tetragonae series bauerinae series quercinae series salicinae b dentata b aquilonia b integrifolia b plagiocarpa b oblongifolia b robur b conferta b paludosa b marginata b canei b saxicola since 1998 american botanist austin mast and co authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae which then comprised genera banksia and dryandra their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from george s taxonomic arrangement banksia paludosa resolves as closest relative or sister to three subspecies of b integrifolia in 2007 mast and thiele rearranged genus banksia by merging dryandra into it and published b subg spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons thus b subg banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement b paludosa is placed in b subg spathulatae subspecies two subspecies are recognised more widespread subspecies paludosa is a lignotuberous shrub to 1 5 m 5 ft high while subspecies astrolux a rare plant known only from starlight trail in nattai national park is a non lignotuberous shrub which reaches 5 m 16 ft high latter was first recorded by contributors brian walters and kevin mills for banksia atlas mapping project in mid 1980s they initially thought plants were banksia conferta subsp penicillata until they observed flower spikes typical of b paludosa subspecies was initially termed nattai river form of b paludosa until it was formally named by george who coined its species name from ancient greek aster star and latin lux light a translation of place it was found hybrids with banksia marginata and b integrifolia have been recorded at nadgee nature reserve where all three species occur a study of an area of extensive hybridization between b robur and b oblongifolia at barren grounds nature reserve revealed some plants with morphology suggestive of b paludosa in their parentage and requiring further investigation distribution and habitat thumb left distribution of banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa is in green and subspecies astrolux in orange both subspecies of banksia paludosa are endemic to new south wales nominate subspecies paludosa is found from glen davis through to sydney region and then south to ulladulla on south coast with a separate population in vicinity of eden just north of victorian border it occurs inland as far as on southern tablelands it was collected in 1966 from hat head on mid north coast by lawrie johnson but has not been found there since despite field work in area this record aside northernmost historical coastal record is from what is now centennial park and la perouse in sydney s eastern suburbs where it is now locally vanished subspecies astrolux is restricted to nattai national park in southern highlands both subspecies grow in nutrient poor well drained sandstone soils in open woodland with trees such as sydney peppermint eucalyptus piperita silvertop ash e sieberi grey gum e punctata narrow leaved stringybark e red bloodwood corymbia gummifera and smooth barked apple angophora costata and in heathland with species such as dwarf banksia banksia oblongifolia coral heath epacris microphylla and dagger hakea hakea ecology thumb right woody base known as a lignotuber of banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa with many stems arising and buds new south wales banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa is a slow growing shrub which regenerates from bushfire by resprouting from its lignotuber after fire plants take around three years to flower significantly but are flowering well by five years afterwards flowerhead numbers dwindle by fourteen years post bushfire plants are estimated to live to around 60 years of age seedlings also appear from seed dispersed after bushfire all banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to nutrient poor conditions of australian soils particularly lacking in phosphorus flower spikes of b paludosa are unable to self pollinate and require pollinators to set seed a 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing pollen from one plant is well mixed among other plants in locale nonflying mammals are important pollinators in heathland habitat with brown antechinus antechinus a frequent visitor to flower spikes sugar glider petaurus breviceps is another mammal pollinator bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at flowers include red wattlebird anthochaera carunculata yellow faced honeyeater lichenostomus chrysops white eared honeyeater l crescent honeyeater phylidonyris pyrrhoptera new holland honeyeater p novaehollandiae and eastern spinebill acanthorhynchus tenuirostris insects recorded visiting flower spikes include european honey bee and ants cultivation banksia paludosa was first introduced into cultivation in england in 1805 species was grown at kew cambridge botanic gardens woburn abbey loddiges nursery in hackney john miller s nursery in bristol and george hibbert s garden at clapham common it was also grown in villa san donato in italy in collection of anatoly 1st prince of san donato b paludosa is cultivated in australian gardens and does best with a sunny aspect and good drainage in soils with a ph from 5 5 to 7 5 slow growing it flowers in 6 to 10 years from seed it can be propagated by seed which take around two weeks to germinate or cutting low growing coastal dwarf forms which grow to 60 cm 2 ft are also commercially available and should be propagated by cutting to preserve features noting flower spikes to be rather dull plant author john wrigley has described species as not a spectacular garden plant although its foliage has been described as attractive a form from jervis bay with large orange flower spikes was deemed by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast alf salkin to have horticultural potential
