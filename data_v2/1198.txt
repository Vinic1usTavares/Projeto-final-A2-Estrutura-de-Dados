thumb upright 2 flowers would converge to a single coloration in a few generations if inheritance blended characteristics of two parents blending inheritance is an obsolete theory in biology from 19th century theory is that progeny inherits any characteristic as average of parents values of that characteristic as an example of this a crossing of a red flower variety with a white variety of same species would yield pink flowered offspring charles darwin s theory of inheritance by pangenesis with contributions to egg or sperm from every part of body implied blending inheritance his reliance on this mechanism led fleeming jenkin to attack darwin s theory of natural selection on grounds that blending inheritance would average out any novel beneficial characteristic before selection had time to act blending inheritance was discarded with general acceptance of particulate mendelian inheritance during development of modern genetics after 1900 history thumb upright 1 5 diagram of charles darwin s pangenesis theory every part of body emits tiny particles gemmules which migrate to gonads and contribute to fertilised egg and so to next generation theory implied that changes to body during an organism s life would be inherited as proposed in lamarckism and that inheritance would be blending darwin s pangenesis charles darwin developed his theory of evolution by natural selection on basis of an understanding of uniform processes in geology acting over very long periods of time on inheritable variation within populations one of those processes was competition for resources as thomas malthus had indicated leading to a struggle to survive and to reproduce since some individuals would by chance have traits that allowed them to leave more offspring those traits would tend to increase in population darwin assembled many lines of evidence to show that variation occurred and that artificial selection by animal and plant breeding had caused change all of this demanded a reliable mechanism of inheritance pangenesis was darwin s attempt to provide such a mechanism of inheritance idea was that each part of parent s body emitted tiny particles called gemmules which migrated through body to contribute to that parent s gametes their eggs or theory had an intuitive appeal as characteristics of all parts of body such as shape of nose width of shoulders and length of legs are inherited from both father and mother however it had some serious weaknesses firstly many characteristics can change during an individual s lifetime and are affected by environment blacksmiths can develop strong arm muscles during their work so gemmules from these muscles ought to carry this acquired characteristic that implies lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics secondly fact that gemmules were supposed to mix together on fertilisation implies blending inheritance namely that offspring would all be intermediate between father and mother in every characteristic that directly contradicts observed facts of inheritance not least that children are usually either male or female rather than all intersex and that traits such as flower colour often re emerge after a generation even when they seem to disappear when two varieties are crossed darwin was aware of both these objections and accordingly had strong doubts about blending inheritance as evidenced in his private correspondence in a letter to t h huxley dated november 12 1857 darwin wrote thumb blending inheritance leads to averaging out of every characteristic which as engineer fleeming jenkin pointed out would make natural selection impossible if blending were mechanism of inheritance in a letter to alfred wallace dated february 6 1866 darwin mentioned conducting hybridization experiments with pea plants not unlike those done by gregor mendel and like him obtaining segregating varieties effectively disproving his theory of pangenesis with blending blending inheritance was also clearly incompatible with darwin s theory of evolution by natural selection engineer fleeming jenkin used this to attack natural selection in his 1867 review of darwin s on origin of species jenkin noted correctly that if inheritance were by blending any beneficial trait that might arise in a lineage would have blended away long before natural selection had time to act evolutionary biologist richard dawkins commented that blending inheritance was wrong as it implied that every generation would be more uniform than one before and that darwin should have said as much to jenkin problem was not with natural selection but with blending and in dawkins s view darwin should have settled for saying that mechanism of inheritance was unknown but certainly non blending replacement by mendelian inheritance thumb right a punnett square for one of mendel s pea plant experiments self fertilization of f1 generation shows that inheritance is particulate not blending blending inheritance was dismissed by eventual widespread acceptance after his death of gregor mendel s theory of particulate inheritance which he had presented in experiments on plant hybridization 1865 in 1892 august weismann set out idea of a hereditary material which he called germ plasm confined to gonads and independent of rest of body soma in weismann s view germ plasm formed body but body did not influence germ plasm except indirectly by natural selection this contradicted both darwin s pangenesis and lamarckian inheritance mendel s work was rediscovered in 1900 by geneticist hugo de vries and others soon confirmed that same year by experiments by william bateson mendelian inheritance with segregating particulate alleles came to be understood as explanation for both discrete and continuously varying characteristics see also aristotle s biology incomplete dominance notes references sources category classical genetics
