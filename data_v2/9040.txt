across nation regardless of team standings or playoff implications yankees red sox games are some of most watched mlb games each season outside of baseball rivalry has led to violence between fans along with attention from politicians and other athletes background since before start of american revolution boston and new york city have shared a rivalry as cities for more than a century after its founding boston was arguably educational cultural artistic and economic power in united states boston s location as closest american port to europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades during this time period new york was often looked down upon as upstart over populated dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean boston in 19th century however new york s economic power outpaced boston s fueled by possession of terminus of erie canal which spurred massive growth in manufacturing shipping insurance and financial services businesses another factor was its more rapid population expansion in comparison to that of boston driven by growth of these industries by new york s popularity as an immigration port of entry and enhanced by a larger population base even prior to construction of canal on eve of revolution new york with 30 000 people had nearly twice population of boston with about 16 000 by start of 20th century original dynamic centered on boston had completely shifted as new york particularly wall street became focus of american capitalism cities even played two different versions of early baseball massachusetts game as it was called was played on a field with four bases and with home plate in middle whereas new york game popularized by new york knickerbocker club was played on a diamond with three bases new york game spread throughout nation after american civil war and became foundation for modern game of red sox early success thumb left babe ruth prior to his trade to yankees red sox were one of most successful teams in baseball from 1901 to 1918 they won inaugural world series in as boston americans team changed its name to red sox in 1908 and four more between and in 1901 yankees then known as baltimore orioles played in maryland for two seasons before moving north two teams had their first meeting in baltimore on april 26 1901 inaugural year of american league on may 7 1903 both teams played for first time after franchise moved to new york and became highlanders in reference to playing games in washington heights neighborhood of manhattan game was marked by a fight when boston pitcher george winter was knocked down boston would eventually go on to win pennant and inaugural 1903 world series 1904 season featured teams facing each other on opening day later in season highlanders led by pitcher jack chesbro in his record setting 41 game winning season met boston americans in season s final game to decide american league pennant winner chesbro threw a wild pitch in top of ninth inning allowing winning run to score from third base and boston won game and pennant new york giants who had already clinched national league pennant refused to play in 1904 world series because of a perception of junior circuit as being inferior and because of alleged animosity between american league founder and first president ban johnson and hierarchy of giants owner john t brush and his team s hall of fame coach player manager john mcgraw thus there was no world series that year not until 2004 would red sox again defeat yankees in a title deciding game on april 11 1912 highlanders debuted their pinstripes in a game against boston by then known as red sox nine days later boston opened fenway park with a game against highlanders who had left their home field of hilltop park to play in newly rebuilt polo grounds soon thereafter in 1913 team dropped nickname highlanders in favor of yankees six years later chicago cubs scored two runs off of babe ruth in game 4 of series snapping his then record world series scoreless inning streak at innings red sox won game 3 2 and went on to capture their fifth series title their third in four years and fourth in seven years yankees would however receive one notable moment of glory against red sox during this era on april 24 1917 yankees pitcher george threw a no hitter at fenway park first in ballpark s history and first in yankees history babe ruth sold to yankees thumb right harry frazee owner of red sox sold ruth to yankees this began curse of bambino upright in 1916 harry frazee purchased red sox on credit for 500 000 despite ruth s success with red sox owner and broadway producer frazee lost his patience with ruth who had threatened to hold out in lieu of a larger contract and become a distraction after red sox finished sixth in american league in 1919 frazee needing money to finance a broadway musical often said to be no no nanette success of that 1925 play is actually what paid off loan however ruth was sold to yankees in 1919 and no no nanette was produced by frazee in 1925 frazee received 125 000 and a loan of 300 000 secured on fenway park for ruth despite ruth having set record for home runs with 29 in 1919 this began a series of deals with yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for red sox while yankees began their dynasty ruth s arrival in new york simultaneously launched yankees dynasty while ravaging red sox while red sox five world series titles were a record at time 1918 would be team s last championship for 86 years meanwhile ruth s home run hitting prowess anchored yankees line up which became known as murderers row in late 1920s yankees reached world series seven times during ruth s new york years winning four this abrupt reversal of fortunes for red sox marked beginning of supposed curse of bambino but it was not ruth deal alone that reversed fortunes of both clubs frazee also sold many other players to yankees robert w creamer reported that loan was made and relations between two clubs continued to be cordial with frazee sending player after player to yankees over next few seasons for more and more cash this was no accident frazee and yankees owner jacob ruppert were friends and american league president ban johnson s attempts to drive frazee out of game had caused five teams loyal to johnson to make no deals with red sox as long as frazee owned club leaving only yankees and white sox as trading partners when white sox reputation was destroyed in black sox scandal frazee s only option for trades was to deal with yankees red sox soon became a baseball disaster area finishing dead last nine times in eleven seasons among others wally schang everett scott carl mays waite hoyt joe bush and sam jones went from sox to yankees in next one to three years along with ed barrow former red sox manager who became yankees general manager and empire builder for first quarter century of yankees dynasty scott a former red sox team captain actually took reins as yankee captain from ruth when he arrived and in doing so became only player in history to be named captain for both teams curse of bambino from 1920 through 2003 yankees won 26 world series championships and 39 pennants compared to only four pennants for red sox in every year that red sox won pennant 1946 1967 1975 and 1986 they lost world series 4 3 leaving them with no world series titles during this time red sox finished second in standings to yankees on twelve occasions in 1938 1939 1941 1942 1949 1977 1978 and every year from 1998 to 2003 during 84 year period yankees finished with a better regular season record than red sox 66 times leading one sportswriter to quip that yankees rivalry with red sox was much like rivalry between a hammer and a nail yankees finished second in standings to red sox twice in 1986 and 1995 1920s and 1930s first yankees dynasty just two years after ruth s sale he went on to have a record setting season one of greatest in major league history for a batter this propelled yankees to win their first pennant and face their cross town rival ruth got hurt during series and yankees eventually dropped last three games losing series 5 3 to giants in last ever best of nine series both yankees and giants would play in 1922 world series as well a series that would be yankees last in two teams shared

his accomplishment williams lost al mvp race to yankees joe dimaggio who holds record for a hitting streak with 56 straight games with a hit williams later reminisced about his rivalry with dimaggio saying dimaggio was greatest all around player i ever saw his career cannot be summed up in numbers and awards it might sound corny but he had a profound and lasting impact on country both teams

yogi berra and deal fell through joe dimaggio s younger brother dom would play for red sox his entire career during 1940s red sox won 15 games in a row in 1946 they were unstoppable and were in first

were at yankee stadium during a weekend in september 1990 yankees fans started to chant 1918 to taunt red sox reminding them of last time they won a world series each time red sox were at yankee

they were at stadium on june 6 1990 before a yankees red sox game at fenway park yankees fired bucky dent as their manager making fenway park scene of his worst moment as manager although he had his greatest moment as a player there red sox fans felt retribution as dent was fired on their field while players on yankees including former red sox catcher rick cerone and mattingly felt dent was used as a scapegoat dan shaughnessy criticized steinbrenner for firing dent in boston and said he should have waited until yankees got to baltimore to fire dent he said that if dent had been fired in seattle or milwaukee this would have been just another event in an endless line of george s jettisons but it happened in boston and nightly news had its hook he also said that firing was only special because it s first time a yankees manager was purged on ancient indian burial grounds of back bay 1993 season saw long time red sox fan favorite wade boggs defect to yankees after eleven seasons with boston later in september 1993 yankees defeated boston at yankee stadium via a last moment reprieve trailing 3 1 mike stanley s apparent fly out with two outs in ninth was nullified by a fan running onto field prior to pitch being thrown umpire had called time and when play resumed stanley singled yankees would rally to score three runs and win on a mattingly single yankees 1980s demise and downfall continued into early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994 when they finished with best record in american league in a season that was prematurely halted by 1994 95 major league baseball strike which left new york sports fans disappointed that mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year at that time he led active players in both games played and at bats without participating in a postseason game throughout october news media added to embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in world series would have been played that year yankees and red sox would have finished season against each other at fenway park both managers buck showalter of yankees and butch hobson of red sox who made their managerial debuts against each other were fired as a result of or during strike strike was harbinger of 1995 season for yankees although red sox jumped out to a fast start and finished season in first place yankees were not serious contenders for division title with yankees clinching inaugural american league wild card on last day of season yankees and red sox reached post season in same season for first time before postseason began mattingly contemplated about first ever playoff series in rivalry saying that would be pretty cool it wouldn t hurt rivalry any there d be a few deaths just kidding both teams lost in separate alds series with red sox being swept by cleveland indians and yankees losing in five games to seattle mariners for yankees loss led to another post strike fallout both showalter and general manager gene michael were fired as a result of loss similarly firing of showalter as yankees manager and loss in 1981 world series were fallouts from strike that year in fact 1981 strike was antecedence to yankees demise and downfall of 1980s and 1990s and strike in 1994 was part of that demise 1996 2003 yankees dominance and first postseason meetings late 1990s yankees dynasty a year
