lutetium is a chemical element with symbol lu and atomic number 71 it is a silvery white metal which resists corrosion in dry air but not in moist air lutetium is last element in lanthanide series and it is traditionally counted among rare earths lutetium is sometimes considered first element of 6th period transition metals although lanthanum is more often considered as such lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by french scientist georges urbain austrian mineralogist baron carl auer von welsbach and american chemist charles james all of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in mineral ytterbia which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium dispute on priority of discovery occurred shortly after with urbain and welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by published research of other naming honor went to urbain as he had published his results earlier he chose name lutecium for new element but in 1949 spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium in 1909 priority was finally granted to urbain and his names were adopted as official ones however name cassiopeium or later cassiopium for element 71 proposed by welsbach was used by many german scientists until 1950s lutetium is not a particularly abundant element although it is significantly more common than silver in earth s crust it has few specific uses lutetium 176 is a relatively abundant 2 5 radioactive isotope with a half life of about 38 billion years used to determine age of minerals and meteorites lutetium usually occurs in association with element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions dota tate is used for radionuclide therapy see nuclear medicine on neuroendocrine tumours lutetium has highest hardness of any lanthanide at 890 1300 mpa characteristics physical properties a lutetium atom has 71 electrons arranged in configuration xe 4f145d16s2 when entering a chemical reaction atom loses its two outermost electrons and single 5d electron lutetium atom is smallest among lanthanide atoms due to lanthanide contraction and as a result lutetium has highest density melting point and hardness of lanthanides chemical properties and compounds lutetium s compounds always contain element in oxidation state 3 aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying with common exception of iodide soluble salts such as nitrate sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization oxide hydroxide fluoride carbonate phosphate and oxalate are insoluble in water lutetium metal is slightly unstable in air at standard conditions but it burns readily at 150 degc to form lutetium oxide resulting compound is known to absorb water and carbon dioxide and it may be used to remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water slow when cold and fast when hot lutetium hydroxide is formed in reaction lutetium metal is known to react with four lightest halogens to form trihalides all of them except fluoride are soluble in water lutetium dissolves readily in weak acids and dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing colorless lutetium ions which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules average being lu h2o 8 2 3 2 lu 3 h2so4 2 lu3 3 so 3 h2 isotopes lutetium occurs on earth in form of two isotopes lutetium 175 and lutetium 176 out of these two only former is stable making element monoisotopic latter one lutetium 176 decays via beta decay with a half life of 3 years it makes up about 2 5 of natural lutetium to date 32 synthetic radioisotopes of element have been characterized ranging in mass from 149 973 lutetium 150 to 183 961 lutetium 184 most stable such isotopes are lutetium 174 with a half life of 3 31 years and lutetium 173 with a half life of 1 37 years all of remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than 9 days and majority of these have half lives that are less than half an hour isotopes lighter than stable lutetium 175 decay via electron capture to produce isotopes of ytterbium with some alpha and positron emission heavier isotopes decay primarily via beta decay producing hafnium isotopes element also has 42 nuclear isomers with masses of 150 151 153 162 166 180 not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer most stable of them are lutetium 177m with a half life of 160 4 days and lutetium with a half life of 142 days these are longer than half lives of ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes except lutetium 173 174 and 176 history lutetium derived from latin paris was independently discovered in 1907 by french scientist georges urbain austrian mineralogist baron carl auer von welsbach and american chemist charles james in a footnote on page 498 james mentions that carl auer von welsbach had announced presence of a new element er g which is undoubtedly same as here noted article to which james refers is c auer von welsbach 1907 uber die elemente der i teil on elements of ytterbium group 1st part monatshefte fur chemie und verwandte teile wissenschaften monthly journal for chemistry and related fields of other sciences 27 935 946 they found it as an impurity in ytterbia which was thought by swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium scientists proposed different names for elements urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium whereas welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium after aldebaran and cassiopeia on page 191 welsbach suggested names for two new elements ich fur das an das thulium erbium sich in dem teile dieser abhandlung mit yb ii bezeichnete element die benennung aldebaranium mit dem zeichen ad und fur das zweite in dieser arbeit mit yb i bezeichnete element das letzte in der reihe der seltenen die benennung cassiopeium mit dem zeichen cp i request for element that is attached to thulium or erbium and that was denoted by yb ii in above part of this paper designation aldebaranium with symbol ad and for element that was denoted in this work by yb i last in series of rare earths designation cassiopeium with symbol cp both of these articles accused other man of publishing results based on those of author international commission on atomic weights which was then responsible for attribution of new element names settled dispute in 1909 by granting priority to urbain and adopting his names as official ones based on fact that separation of lutetium from marignac s ytterbium was first described by urbain after urbain s names were recognized neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium until 1950s some german speaking chemists called lutetium by welsbach s name cassiopeium in 1949 spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium reason for this was that welsbach s 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure while urbain s 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium this later misled urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72 which he named celtium which was actually very pure lutetium later discrediting of urbain s work on element 72 led to a reappraisal of welsbach s work on element 71 so that element was renamed to cassiopeium in german speaking countries for some time charles james who stayed out of priority argument worked on a much larger scale and possessed largest supply of lutetium at time pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953 occurrence and production thumb monazite found with almost all other rare earth metals but never by itself lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements its principal commercial source is as a by product from processing of rare earth phosphate mineral monazite ce la which has concentrations of only 0 0001 of element not much higher than abundance of lutetium in earth crust of about 0 5 mg kg no lutetium dominant minerals are currently known main mining areas are china united states brazil india sri lanka and australia world production of lutetium in form of oxide is about 10 tonnes per year pure lutetium metal is very difficult to prepare it is one of rarest and most expensive of rare earth metals with price about us 10 000 per kilogram or about one fourth that of gold crushed minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earths thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed after that solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of main components cerium whose oxide is insoluble in hno3 several rare earth metals including lutetium are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization lutetium is separated by ion exchange in this process rare earth ions are onto suitable ion exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen ammonium or cupric ions present in resin lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous lucl3 or by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal 2 lucl3 3 ca 2 lu 3 cacl2 applications because of production difficulty and high price lutetium has very few commercial uses especially since it is rarer than most of other lanthanides but is chemically not very different however stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation hydrogenation and polymerization applications lutetium aluminium garnet has been proposed for use as a lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography additionally a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet ggg which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices cerium doped lutetium lso is currently preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography pet lutetium aluminium garnet is used as a phosphor in led light bulbs aside from stable lutetium its radioactive isotopes have several specific uses suitable half life and decay mode made lutetium 176 used as a pure beta emitter using lutetium which has been exposed to neutron activation and in lutetium hafnium dating to date meteorites synthetic isotope lutetium 177 bound to a somatostatin analogue is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors indeed lutetium 177 is seeing increased usage as a radionuclide in tumor therapy and bone pain research indicates that lutetium ion atomic clocks could provide greater accuracy than any existing atomic clock lutetium tantalate is densest known stable white material density 9 81 g cm3 and therefore is an ideal host for x ray phosphors only denser white material is thorium dioxide with density of 10 g cm3 but thorium it contains is radioactive precautions like other rare earth metals lutetium is regarded as having a low degree of toxicity but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless for example lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and compound irritates skin lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested similarly to other rare earth metals lutetium has no known biological role but it is found even in humans concentrating in bones and to a lesser extent in liver and kidneys lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature element is least abundant in human body of all lanthanides human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content so it is not known how much average human takes in but estimations show amount is only about several micrograms per year all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic but insoluble ones are not see also references category chemical elements
