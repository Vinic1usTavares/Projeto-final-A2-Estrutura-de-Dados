hurricane gordon developed during a fourteen day period along an erratic persistent and highly unusual path hurricane formed near panama in southwestern caribbean on november 8 1994 as a tropical depression it brushed nicaragua and spent several days in waters off country s coast strengthening slightly into a tropical storm gordon wound its way north into greater antilles despite warm waters persistent wind shear prevented significant strengthening executing a slow turn to north and then northwest gordon made two more landfalls on eastern jamaica and eastern cuba while delivering tremendous rains to western hispaniola as gordon made its fourth landfall crossing florida keys it interacted with a cyclone in upper troposphere and a series of cyclonic lows which lent storm some sub tropical characteristics after a few days as an unusual hybrid of a tropical and a subtropical system in gulf of mexico storm re claimed its fully tropical form and made yet another landfall this time across florida peninsula and continued into atlantic ocean in atlantic gordon rapidly strengthened to a category 1 hurricane gordon s characteristic wandering briefly brought it near north carolina but ultimately storm headed south weakening into a minor tropical storm before making its sixth and final landfall on florida s east coast hurricane gordon was seventh named storm and third hurricane of 1994 atlantic hurricane season although it never made landfall as a hurricane in its meandering course storm included six separate landfalls four as a tropical storm and two as a tropical depression three of its landfalls were in u s state of florida formation during first week of november 1994 a large area of disturbed weather accumulated just north of panama over southwestern caribbean sea a tropical wave passed through area and gave it mild convection a second wave passed through area on november 6 and introduced cyclonic circulation to disturbance over next two days system gradually organized and sparked a deep convection off nicaragua s southeast coast this organization with initial maximum sustained winds of 30 mph 45 km h was designated tropical depression twelve moving northwest storm began to slowly strengthen and its upper level outflow became favorable to further development spots of convection flared on morning of november 9 banding features appeared as its center made landfall on northeastern nicaraguan coast near puerto cabezas a full day later a trough to storm s northwest over gulf of mexico moved depression offshore to northeast and over warm waters of western caribbean sea fueled by these warm waters on night of november 9 it strengthened into tropical storm gordon with 40 mph 65 km h winds lacking firm movement because of weak steering currents gordon meandered north northeast in presence of mild west southwesterly wind shear unable to strengthen under adverse conditions by november 11 a trough prodded gordon to north northeast at 8 mph 13 km h and it strengthened by 6 mph 9 km h as it moved through central caribbean sea trough continued steering gordon bending it eastward towards jamaica on afternoon on november 12 despite warm waters gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper tropospheric shear hindered development disorganized upper level circulation and reduced its winds to 40 mph 65 km h through greater antilles thumb gordon during its hybrid tropical sub tropical stage with a frontal band dropping rain over haiti november 13 was an active day for tropical storm gordon trough over southern florida and gulf of mexico continued to push gordon eastward towards jamaica in pre dawn hours storm clipped eastern edge of island leaving 7 44 in 18 9 cm of rainfall southwesterly wind shear kept storm from developing beyond 45 mph 75 km h but neither shear nor landfall significantly disrupted cyclone s organization accelerating gordon turned towards northeast continued shear prevented upper level development needed for typical cyclonic organization but a strong lower level circulation had formed its sustained winds were still only 40 mph 65 km h but as system approached eastern cuba a gust of 120 mph 192 km h was reported center crossed near guantanamo bay and storm dumped heavy rainfall as it passed over eastern portion of island even heavier rain fell in haiti to west where 22 94 in 58 27 cm of rain was recorded at camp perrin meanwhile broad scale circulation that was covering most of caribbean sea of which tropical storm gordon was only a part was interacting with an upper tropospheric trough near straits of florida this trough strengthened broad upper level cyclone which in turn strengthened gordon and spawned several other low level circulations in western caribbean sea when gordon crossed eastern cuba national hurricane center determined that it had become most dominant of these low level systems and had absorbed their meteorologist jose fernandez partagas voiced minority opinion that gordon s circulatory center had dissipated over cuba and that a low pressure system near bahamas was now dominant system which would have meant demise of tropical storm gordon and emergence of a new tropical storm while possible this view was not accepted by official hurricane summaries by nightfall of november 13 gordon had not only made two landfalls and survived interactions with three competing systems but also in assimilating bahamian low had gained cool central core typical of a subtropical cyclone deep layered cyclone within which gordon was embedded steered storm west northwest south of turks and caicos and bahamas on november 14 a large ridge of high pressure near u s mid atlantic coast increased pressure gradient around storm so although its sub tropical elements namely a lack of deep convection precluded a core of strong winds immediately around storm s nucleus strong winds were supported outside storm s circulatory center these winds inched up to 50 mph 85 km h but did not strengthen any further ridge continued to steer hybrid tropical subtropical storm gordon west northwestward past western bahamas this brought southern portion of storm s circulation over northern cuba while strengthening northern circulation produced 60 mph 90 km h winds near palm beach storm s fourth landfall occurred on november 15 when gordon passed over florida keys near key west florida storm then continued west over lower keys and into straights of florida where storm s center began to warm and deep convection signaled return of gordon s purely tropical characteristics second florida landfall and peak strength thumb hurricane gordon near peak intensity on november 18 at 13 08 utc steering currents remained weak giving storm a chance to fully re develop its deep convection while immobile at sea during this time tropical storm gordon began to spawn tornadoes as storm center was well offshore most were probably unreported but six tornadoes touched down on florida coast four of tornadoes were rated f0 on fujita scale two were rated f1 and one was given an f2 rating with estimated wind speeds of 113 157 mph 181 253 km h after stalling offshore for almost a day a mid to upper tropospheric trough over central u s slowly pulled tropical storm gordon northward then north northeastward towards florida s west coast storm made landfall between ft myers and naples with 50 mph 85 km h winds eastward component of storm s movement increased and gordon moved northeastward onto florida peninsula at 10 mph 17 km h storm barely weakened as it crossed landmass keeping its 50 mph 85 km h winds crossing peninsula in a mere six hours storm continued to pick up speed early on november 17 back over open ocean storm s central pressure began to fall improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was pulling at core of deep convection when on november 17 gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph 120 km h winds and was upgraded to a category 1 hurricane third florida landfall and demise shortwave trough that had been steering gordon across florida moved ahead of storm and its influence was replaced by a mid tropospheric ridge over eastern united states under influence of this new ridge storm which had been speeding northeast at 25 mph 40 km h turned to north late on november 17 hurricane s loop continued and as it moved to a west northwesterly heading gordon briefly threatened north carolina s outer banks before stalling offshore once again in presence of weak steering currents once again gordon lost strength and slipped back to tropical storm status with 70 mph 110 km h winds on november 18 about 90 mi 150 km off outer banks gordon began a southward drift away from north carolina coast in its brush with mid atlantic states gordon dropped 2 5 in 5 13 cm with a maximum of 5 25 in 13 3 cm recorded at norfolk virginia warm waters improved its organization but this did not result in stronger winds and storm continued to weaken strong upper level winds battered storm from northwest they sheared away gordon s upper level convection while polluting storm with colder and drier air that weakened its lower level convection a high pressure system over central united states drifted east and added a westward component to gordon s southward motion pulling storm southwest towards florida persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced storm s winds to below tropical storm force and on morning on november 20 gordon became a tropical depression high pressure system over continent continued pulling depression towards west until it made its final landfall near cape canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph 45 km h between its three floridian landfalls hurricane gordon dumped 5 10 in 13 25 cm of rain on florida with a station at cooperstown recording 16 1 in 40 9 cm storm moved northward across florida northeastward across georgia and finally merged with a frontal system over south carolina track and forecasting gordon s track was likened to hurricane dawn in 1972 national hurricane center described storm as a complex system which followed an unusual erratic path over western caribbean sea and islands florida and southwestern atlantic due to path agency had difficulties in forecasting gordon and forecast errors were 10 to 30 above average of previous decade see
