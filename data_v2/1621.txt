did a great job on multiplayer in metroid prime 2 focus was centered on single player portion of game which was considered to be core strength of franchise art director todd keller declared graphics to be focused in both texture detail and variety with every single texture being hand made and trying to make every room its own custom stage during development nintendo ead team involved with corruption suggested retro to turn hypermode into core of game saying it would enhance tension as it made players powerful but if used excessively would lead to a game over retro initially disagreed

and themes dark and scary until very end when uplifting music is played during credits corruption is first metroid game to feature a significant amount of voice acting compared to previous games in
