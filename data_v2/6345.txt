world map in a variety of ways including by foot car chocobo train and airship field map consists of controllable 3d characters overlaid on one or more 2d pre rendered backgrounds which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests battle screen is a 3d model of a location such as a street or room where turn based fights between playable characters and cpu controlled enemies take

minigame called triple triad thumb left a battle against x an early boss zell will summon shiva when blue bar that has replaced his atb is drained alt three characters in a battle with a monster which resembles a mechanical spider a gray menu at bottom of image shows characters health and bars representing time left until they can act for final fantasy viii hiroyuki ito designed a battle system based on summoned monsters called guardian forces abbreviated in game as gf assigning junctioning a gf onto a character allows player to use battle commands beyond attack with main weapon such as magic gf to have a junctioned gf perform an action and item previous final fantasy titles provided each character with a limited pool of magic points that were consumed by each spell in final fantasy viii spells are acquired drawn either from enemies in battle draw points distributed throughout environments or by refining items and cards spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character and are consumed one by one when used characters can also junction equip these spells onto their statistics such as strength vitality and luck for various bonuses provided character has junctioned a guardian force junction system s flexibility affords player a wide range of customization these expanded mechanics for summons were a departure for series in previous titles summons were relegated to a single action during battle junction system also acts as a substitute for armor and accessories which were used in earlier games to modify character statistics moreover where earlier titles required weapons to be equipped and tailored to character each major character in final fantasy viii features a unique weapon which can be upgraded affecting its appearance power and limit break as in final fantasy vii characters in final fantasy viii have unique abilities called limit breaks which range from powerful attacks to support spells while characters in final fantasy vii receive limit breaks after incurring significant damage in final fantasy viii limit breaks become available only at low health hit points under normal circumstances magic spell aura increases probability of limit breaks appearing regardless of a character s remaining hit points while various status afflictions can prevent limit breaks they are similar to desperation attacks of final fantasy vi albeit more frequent final fantasy viii also introduced interactive elements to complement limit break animations these interactive sequences which vary between character weapon and limit break range from randomly selected magic spells to precisely timed button inputs successfully completing an interactive sequence increases potency of limit break thumb right an example of navigation on field map alt an overhead shot of three figures running through a jungle like setting a metal door and wire fences are visible above them final fantasy viii features an experience point exp system quite different from previous titles essentials remain unchanged characters gain exp after defeating enemies which are typically encountered randomly throughout game s environments earning a set amount of exp causes character to gain a level which increases their overall statistics while previous titles feature an exp curve that increases with each level e g getting to level 2 requires 200 exp level 3 requires 400 etc characters in final fantasy viii gain a level after accumulating a flat rate of 1000 points enemy levels are based on party s average level in most rpgs enemy levels remain stagnant some bosses have level caps to prevent main quest from becoming too difficult higher level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage may have additional special attacks and carry additional magic spells allowing for junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed bonuses imparted by level gain game s unique exp and level system allows a player to grind to maximum level 100 before even beginning plot though this will result in far more powerful enemies in addition to gaining levels guardian forces earn ability points ap after battles which are automatically allocated to special abilities that guardian forces can learn when a guardian force has learned an ability that ability becomes available for any character or character party as is case with field abilities these abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently refine magic spells from items receive stat bonuses upon leveling up access shops remotely and use additional battle commands story setting and characters most of final fantasy viii is set on an unnamed fantasy world setting is highly european in design and

and rinoa share a kiss under moonlight development development of final fantasy viii began in 1997 during english language translation of final fantasy vii as with much of production of final fantasy vii series creator and veteran hironobu sakaguchi served as executive producer working primarily on development of final fantasy spirits within and leaving direction of final fantasy viii to yoshinori kitase shinji hashimoto was assigned to be producer in sakaguchi s place while game and battle system were designed by kitase and hiroyuki ito respectively one of development difficulties encountered was having three real time characters exploring an environment at same time card game triple triad was conceived and implemented by programmer yasui concept was derived from trading cards which is a popular hobby in some parts of japan triple triad was meant to keep player s interest during long stretches without cutscenes originally it was simply about collecting cards but yasui considered this too disconnected from main game and begged for inclusion of an ability to transform cards into items game s total development costs were approximately y 3 billion which equated to around 16 million without inflation staff consisted of about 180 people following turbulent development of final fantasy vii there was a shake up of square s localization process final fantasy viii was first title to have extensive communication between japanese and north american teams during process lead translator richard honeywood wrote a text parser that would automatically convert text from english ascii to shift format required by game engine s compiler streamlining translation process dramatically game was first major project of alexander o smith who would later earn acclaim for his work on vagrant story smith stated that due to a lack of communication with development team they were surprised that an it employee used gameshark to access text files for localizing to western audiences translation was finished by september 1999 game s european release was delayed due to necessary graphical changes cited example was removal of a nazi like uniform visual design thumb from left tetsuya nomura s designs of selphie rinoa and quistis from beginning kitase knew he wanted a thematic combination of fantasy and realism to this end he aimed to include a cast of characters who appeared to be ordinary people character designer and battle visual director tetsuya nomura and art director yusuke naora strove to achieve this impression through inclusion of realistically proportioned characters a departure from super deformed designs used in previous title additionally naora attempted to enhance realism of world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in game and use of motion capture technology to give game s characters lifelike movements in game s full motion video sequences fmv sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people with total cinematic run time being estimated at over an hour approximately 20 minutes longer than fmv sequences in vii motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement but team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture a major challenge was technical advances made since release of vii and aim for more realistic characters a major issue with cutscenes was having real time character models moving across environments within an fmv in an interview with famitsu naora described that game was generally designed to be a bright fresh final fantasy main reason was that team had dealt extensively with dark and weird imagery with vii designers felt a need to invert atmosphere of previous games in series which had feelings of light emerging from darkness this decision was easy for developers to make because most of them had worked on final fantasy vii and felt that a new direction was acceptable world designs were also developed with knowledge that most of staff were now used to computer graphics which was not case with final fantasy vii developers also noted that with final fantasy viii they attempted to mix future real life and fantasy as part of a theme desired by kitase to give game a foreign atmosphere various designs were given to its locations using style of internationally familiar places while also maintaining a fantasy atmosphere inspiration ranged from ancient egyptian and greek architecture to city of paris france to an idealized futuristic european society flags were also given to some factions their designs based on group s history and culture to maintain a foreign atmosphere characters of game were designed to have predominantly european appearances first final fantasy viii character created was squall desiring to add a unique angle to squall s appearance and emphasize his role as central character nomura gave him a scar across his brow and bridge of his nose as there was not yet a detailed history conceived for character nomura left explanation for squall s scar to scenario writer kazushige nojima squall was given a gunblade a fictional revolver sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism similar to a his character design was complemented by a fur lining along collar of his jacket incorporated by nomura as a challenge for game s full motion video designers additionally some designs nomura had previously drawn but had not yet used in a final fantasy game were incorporated into final fantasy viii these were designs of edea fujin and raijin latter two had originally been designed for use in final fantasy vii but with inclusion of turks characters in that game it was felt that fujin and raijin were unnecessary nomura had designed edea before development of final fantasy vii based on style of yoshitaka amano for guardian forces nomura felt they should be unique beings without clothes or other human like concepts this was problematic as he did not want them to become actual monsters so he took great care in their design leviathan was first gf created as a test and included in a game demo after it received a positive reaction from players nomura decided to create remaining sequences in a similar fashion story development plot of final fantasy viii was conceived by kitase with stories for characters provided by nomura and actual scenario written by nojima during game s pre production nomura suggested game be given a school days feel nojima already had a story in mind in which main characters were same age their ideas meshed taking form as garden military academies nojima planned that two playable parties featured in game squall s present day group and laguna s group from past would be highly contrasted with one another this idea was conveyed through age and experience of laguna s group versus youth and naivete of squall s group nojima has expressed that dynamic of players relationships with protagonist is important to him both final fantasy vii and final fantasy viii feature reserved quiet protagonists in form of cloud strife and squall with final fantasy viii however nojima worked to give players actual insight into what character was thinking a direct contrast with his handling of final fantasy vii which encouraged player to speculate other media in march 1999 one month after game s release final fantasy viii ultimania was published a book that features an in depth guide to final fantasy viii and interviews with developers an origami book was released in november 1999 on september 22 1999 a cd rom titled final fantasy viii desktop accessories was released it contains desktop icons computer wallpapers screensavers and an e mail application it additionally features a stand alone edition of triple triad minigame which allowed players to compete against one another via a local area network also in 1999 ballroom dance scene of final fantasy viii was featured as a technical demo for playstation 2 in 2000 a pc version was released for windows this port featured smoother graphics enhanced audio and inclusion of chocobo world a minigame starring boko a chocobo featured in one of side quests in final fantasy viii for most north american and european players pc version of game was only means of playing chocobo world as game was originally designed to be played via pocketstation a handheld console never released outside japan in 2009 final fantasy viii was added to playstation store on playstation network on december 18 2012 game was re released as part of final fantasy 25th anniversary ultimate box japanese package an upscaled pc version was announced on may 17 2013 and was released on steam on december 5 2013 a playstation 4 version hd version could be in a development after release of final fantasy vii and final fantasy ix for playstation 4 fans also requested a physical disc hd remaster release just like final fantasy xii zodiac age with updated character polygon models of final fantasy viii music regular series composer nobuo uematsu wrote soundtrack for final fantasy viii he tried to base songs on emotional content of scenes in which they would be played asserting that expressing emotions he desired was more important than improving skills i think it will be a shame if we won t be able to cry as we play our own game he could not determine a character s emotions solely based on plot instead using images of appearance and attire it s important to know when their emotions are at their height but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish ending dialog maeda yoshitake 1999 final fantasy viii original soundtrack limited edition digicube when ign music stated that music of final fantasy viii was very dark and perhaps influenced by plot of game uematsu said atmosphere of music varies depending on story line of course but it s also my intention to put various types of music into one game absence of character themes found in previous two games was due to uematsu finding those of final fantasy vi and final fantasy vii ineffective uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a highlight in game but he found final fantasy viii only focused on squall leonhart and rinoa heartilly as a couple resulting in eyes on me theme original soundtrack was released on four compact discs by digicube in japan on march 10 1999 and by square ea in north america as final fantasy viii music collection in january 2000 it was republished worldwide by square enix on may 10 2004 an album of orchestral arrangements of selected tracks from game was released under title final fantasy viii on november 19 1999 by digicube and subsequently published on july 22 2004 by square enix pieces were arranged and conducted by shiro hamaguchi for a live orchestra a collection of piano arrangements performed by shinko ogata was released under title piano collections final fantasy viii by digicube on january 21 2000 and subsequently re published by square enix on july 22 2004 score is best known for two songs liberi fatali a latin choral piece that is played during introduction to game and eyes on me a pop song serving as game s theme performed by chinese singer faye wong near end of production of final fantasy vii developers suggested to use a singer but abandoned idea due to a lack of reasoning based on game s theme and storyline however nobuo uematsu thought a ballad would closely relate to theme and characters of final fantasy viii this resulted in game s developers sharing countless artists eventually deciding on wong uematsu claims her voice and mood seem to match my image of song exactly and that her ethnicity fits international image of final fantasy after negotiations were made eyes on me was recorded in hong kong with an orchestra song was released as a cd single in japan and sold over 400 000 copies setting record for highest selling video game music disc ever released in that country at time liberi fatali was played during 2004 summer olympics in

for next generation rating it four stars out of five and stated that a great game but from square from whom we routinely expect brilliance a merely great game is something of a letdown reviews of gameplay have been mixed ign felt that it was weakest aspect of game citing its guardian force attack sequences as incredibly cinematic but tedious sentiments echoed by electronic gaming monthly they also regarded battle system as intensely complicated yet refreshingly innovative and something that rpg fanatics love to obsess over official u s playstation magazine claims that game s junction system is a major flaw due to repetitive stocking of spells while video game magazine edge commented that battle system consists of a bewildering number of intricate options and techniques that most gamers will relish gamespot praised game s battle system commenting that possibilities for customization with junction system are immense in general final fantasy viii has been compared favorably to its predecessors though questioning game s lack of voice overs for its characters game revolution praised its storyline and ending for their part edge labeled final fantasy viii a far more accomplished game than ffvii on other hand magazine also felt that game s length left its story unable to offer consistently strong dialogue and sub plots additionally it found some of story s plot twists not suitably manipulated and prepared leaving it hard not to greet such moments with anything but indifference overall edge considered final fantasy viii to be yet another outstanding edition of squaresoft s far from final fantasies summarizing it as aesthetically astonishing rarely less than compelling and near peerless in scope and execution electronic gaming monthly offered similar comments stating that game s character development is best of any rpg s and that final fantasy viii is pinnacle of its genre ugo com stated that while no other game in series had stirred controversy that final fantasy viii had and that it was flawed final fantasy viii was a daring groundbreaking game decidedly most original console style rpg ever created in 2002 ign named it seventh best title for playstation placing higher on list than final fantasy vii publication felt that final fantasy viii improved on strengths of its predecessor pc port received mixed reception maximum pc praised full motion video sequences as phenomenal adding that while gameplay took getting used to they enjoyed teamwork emphasized by it and that game s visual presentation added to its appeal gamespy stated that while game was not a huge leap forward from previous title its gameplay and visual appeal worked for its benefit though that on a computer pre rendered backgrounds appeared blurry and controls at time difficult with a keyboard gamespot criticized game for not taking advantage of capabilities afforded to computers at time describing playstation version as both looking and sounding superior and recommending that title was not worth buying period for pc ugo com also described port as inferior to its original counterpart adding that its presentation was in turn detrimental to reception game received as a whole computer gaming world praised some of changes made to game in light of previous titles and inclusion of triple triad sub game though heavily criticized port as lazy and
