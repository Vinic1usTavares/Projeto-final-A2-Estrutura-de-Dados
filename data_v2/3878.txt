from existing science fiction magazines of day most of which were in pulp format it had no interior illustrations no letter column and text in a single column format which in opinion of science

spivak thumb lawrence spivak in 1960 alt head shot of a man in a suit wearing glasses left first magazine dedicated to fantasy weird tales appeared in 1923 it was followed in 1926 by amazing stories first science fiction sf magazine by end of 1930s genre was flourishing in united states nearly twenty new sf and fantasy titles appearing between 1938 and 1941 ashley 2000 pp 237 255 these were all pulp magazines which meant that despite occasional high quality story most of magazines presented badly written fiction and were regarded as trash by many readers in 1941 ellery queen s mystery magazine appeared edited by fred dannay and focusing on detective fiction magazine was published in digest format rather than pulp and printed a mixture of classic stories and fresh material ashley 2000 pp 20 21 dannay attempted to avoid sensationalist fiction appearing in pulps and soon made magazine a success marks 2008 p 105 in early 1940s anthony boucher a successful writer of fantasy and sf and also of mystery stories got to know dannay through his work on ellery queen radio show boucher also knew j francis mccomas an editor who shared his interest in fantasy and sf by 1944 mccomas and boucher became interested in idea of a fantasy companion to ellery queen s mystery magazine and spoke to dannay about it dannay was interested in idea but paper was scarce because of world war ii following year boucher and mccomas suggested that new magazine could use ellery queen name but dannay knew little about fantasy and suggested instead that they approach lawrence spivak owner of mercury press which published ellery queen s mystery magazine in january 1946 boucher and mccomas went to new york and met with spivak who let them know later in year that he wanted to go ahead at spivak s request they began acquiring material for new magazine including a new story by raymond chandler and reprint rights to stories by h p lovecraft john dickson carr and robert bloch spivak initially planned first issue for which boucher and mccomas were proposing title fantasy and horror for early 1947 but repeatedly delayed launch because of poor newsstand sales of digest magazines he also suggested that it should be priced at 35 cents an issue which was higher than original plan to provide a financial buffer against poor sales marks 2008 pp 106 107 in may 1949 spivak suggested a new title magazine of fantasy and in august a press release announced that magazine would appear in october marks 2008 p 107 on october 6 1949 spivak boucher and mccomas held a luncheon at waldorf astoria in new york city to commemorate 100th anniversary of death of edgar allan poe and to launch a new fantasy anthology periodical marks 2008 p 108 invitees included carr basil rathbone and boris karloff first issue published by fantasy house a subsidiary of american mercury sold 57 000 copies which was less than spivak had hoped for but in november he gave boucher and mccomas go ahead for another issue title was changed to magazine of fantasy science fiction almost always abbreviated to f sf by both fans and science fiction historians to reflect contents sales of second issue were strong enough for spivak to commit further and magazine s future became more assured despite difficulties caused by fact that both boucher and mccomas lived on west coast whereas magazine s publishing offices were in new york marks 2008 pp 108 109 publishing schedule moved to bimonthly with december 1950 issue clareson 1985 p 391 pay rate for early issues was two cents per word or 100 for short pieces which was competitive with astounding science fiction leading sf magazine of day del rey 1979 p 170 mccomas 1982 pp 7 13 by 1953 rates had changed to three and a half cents per word for stories under 3 000 words de camp 1953 p 113 in 1951 mccomas who had a full time job in sales on top of his role as editor of f sf was forced to reduce his workload for health reasons marks 2008 p 110 boucher then did most of reading and editing while mccomas reviewed results and occasionally vetoed a story in august following year schedule switched to monthly in 1954 spivak sold his shares in mercury press to his general manager joseph ferman ashley 2005 p 21 that year also saw mccomas s departure his health had deteriorated to point where he had to give up editing post completely and gordon van gelder thumb gordon van gelder in 2007 alt head shot of a man at a microphone in 1957 ferman launched a companion magazine venture science fiction which was intended to focus on more action oriented fiction than f sf de larber 1985 p 705 boucher was unable to take on extra work so robert p mills who had been managing editor for f sf became venture s editor with boucher in an advisory role ashley 2005 p 170 later that year ferman sold ellery queen s mystery magazine to bernard davis who was leaving ziff davis to start his own publishing venture ferman retained f sf though boucher departed and mills became editor of f sf while remaining managing editor of queen s magazine de larber 1985 p 380 ashley 2005 p 171 mills stayed for over three years leaving at end of 1961 to spend more time working as a literary agent and ferman replaced him with avram davidson whose name first appeared on masthead with april 1962 issue ashley 2005 p 217 joseph ferman s son edward had worked for magazine as an editorial assistant in 1950s but left in 1959 to gain experience elsewhere he returned in 1962 and worked under davidson as managing editor ashley 2007 p 89 in 1963 ted white later editor of amazing stories became assistant editor and stayed with magazine until 1968 ashley 2007 p 72 davidson gave up editor s chair in late 1964 in order to have more time to write and was initially replaced by joseph ferman who handed over control to his son edward from may 1965 though masthead did not reflect change till 1966 ashley 2005 p 219 four years later younger ferman took over from his father as publisher as well and moved editorial and publishing offices to his house in cornwall connecticut his wife audrey was business manager and andrew porter was an assistant editor in early 1970s ferman contacted sol cohen owner of amazing stories and fantastic stories two competing sf magazines about purchasing them both ferman was considering combining them into a single magazine and publishing them alongside f sf but cohen decided to keep both titles ashley 2007 p 84 in 1969 an issue of f sf was priced at 50 cents by end of 1970s price had gone up to 1 25 although page count also rose from 128 to 160 pages ashley 2007 pp 86 87 circulation did not suffer but rose from 50 000 to over 60 000 partly because of subscription drives through publishers clearing house and perhaps also because magazine s quality remained consistent throughout decade ashley 2007 p 326 in ashley s words f sf delivered goods month after month schedule was reliable format remained unchanged and editor remained same from 1965 throughout next two decades and more ashley 2007 p 88 ashley 2007 p 386 ferman managed to keep circulation above 50 000 and sometimes above 60 000 during 1980s when most other magazines were losing subscribers ashley 2016 p 441 he turned over editorship to kristine kathryn rusch in 1991 and by mid 1990s circulation began to fall again in 1997 gordon van gelder took over as editor and from february 2001 issue was publisher as well having bought magazine from ferman john joseph adams was van gelder s assistant editor from 2001 until december 2009 van gelder was unable to arrest decline in circulation which by 2011 was down to less than 15 000 van gelder reduced publication frequency to bimonthly increasing page count and price charles coleman finlay guest edited july august 2014 issue and was hired in 2015 as full time editor beginning with march april 2015 issue contents and reception boucher mccomas mills and davidson boucher and mccomas s original goal for new magazine was to imitate formula that had made ellery queen s mystery magazine successful classic reprints along with quality fiction that avoided excesses of pulps initial proposal called for magazine to include fantasy but not science fiction even before launch editors found they were having trouble deciding exactly where boundary lay so when in february 1949 joseph ferman spivak s general manager asked them to add sf to lineup as a way to broaden readership they were happy to comply first issue included only one story that could be called science fiction theodore sturgeon s is a happy beast it also included reprints from slick magazines by writers such as richard sale and guy interior layout was quite different from existing fantasy and sf magazines there were no interior illustrations and text was printed in a single column instead of two as was usual elsewhere there was a book review column but no letters page according to sf historian mike ashley this set f sf apart giving it air and authority of a superior magazine ashley 2005 pp 21 22 logo design and layout were work of mercury press s art director george salter whose background was in book design rather than in pulp magazines salter remained with magazine until 1958 he was responsible for many of surreal early covers these gave way to work by other artists but his design for f sf remained intact for decades and in ashley s opinion consistency of appearance has been one of major selling points of magazine ashley 2007 p 10 when second issue appeared with title revised to include science fiction there was no announcement of change and not much more science fiction than in first issue damon knight contributed one example not with a bang which knight has described as his first fully professional story knight 1997 pp 10 12 next issue included richard matheson s first sale born of man and woman widely considered one of finest stories f sf ever published over next few years several writers became strongly associated with magazine including margaret st clair reginald bretnor miriam allen deford and zenna henderson and boucher was also able to attract some of best known established names such as arthur c clarke fritz leiber and ray bradbury fletcher pratt and l sprague de camp began their s bar series of stories in first issue of f sf and manly wade wellman published first of his john balladeer stories in december 1951 issue focus was on short fiction serials and novels were mainly avoided one exception was ward moore s bring jubilee an alternative history set in a world where south wins american civil war ashley 2005 p 24 boucher bought a canticle for leibowitz from walter m miller who had been unable to sell it elsewhere and printed it in april 1955 issue it was first story in series that would become novel of same name and has since become recognized as a classic of genre a controversial article by astronomer r s richardson titled day after we land on mars appeared in december 1955 issue richardson commented that an exploration of other worlds would require men stationed on a planet to be openly accompanied by women to relieve sexual tensions that develop among normal healthy males responses by poul anderson and miriam allen deford appeared in f sf following year deford argued that richardson was assuming that women were not people in same way as men and controversy has since been cited as part of long debate within genre about image of women in science fiction carter 1977 p 193 larbalestier 2002 pp 135 137 in 1958 f sf won its first hugo award for best magazine and when mills became editor that year he maintained high standards boucher had set winning award again in 1959 and 1960 mills continued to publish a broad range of material without limiting magazine to particular subgenres ashley cites john collier robert arthur allen drury and ray bradbury all authors with mainstream reputations who appeared in f sf in 1960 as evidence of magazine s diversity daniel keyes had been unable to sell flowers for algernon until mills bought it in 1959 it went on to win several awards and according to clute and nicholls is arguably most popular sf novel ever published rogue moon a novel about a deadly artifact left by aliens on moon is often considered algis budrys s best novel it appeared in 1960 and following year saw brian aldiss s hothouse first in that series ashley 2005 pp 215 216 budrys later said that what he described as cuteness of early f sf school of editing and its open contempt for accomplishments of school had resulted in buckets and buckets of froth but more favorably liberal arts concepts in what had been almost exclusively a b s field zenna henderson s stories of people a group of refugee humanoid aliens hiding on earth were published through 1950s and 1960s and became a central feature of magazine according to sf critic john clute boucher published damon knight s country of kind described by ashley as one of his most potent stories from fifties in 1956 and same year under pseudonym grendel reginald bretnor began a series of punning stories known as that lasted until 1964 ashley 2007 pp 329 330 at end of 1950s during mills tenure as editor robert heinlein s starship troopers was serialized in f sf under title starship soldier this was intended to be a juvenile novel but was rejected by scribner s for being too violent it won hugo award in novel category following year and proved to be one of heinlein s most controversial books dolman 1997 p 196 left thumb one of mel hunter s series of robot covers which began in 1955 this example is from july 1957 issue among cover artists in first decade sf historian and critic thomas clareson singles out early astronomical scenes by chesley bonestell as being most notable these were among first to replace george salter s surreal artwork on cover kelly freas and ed emshwiller two of most popular artists in sf field also contributed covers during 1950s weinberg 1988 p 101 weinberg 1988 p 123 mel hunter began contributing covers with november 1953 issue and in october 1955 began a long running series of covers that depicted a robot survivor of a nuclear holocaust engaging in human activities amidst desolation watering a flower playing with toys or reading a store catalog for example weinberg 1988 p 153 hardy 1978 p 133 a regular book review column appeared titled recommended reading it was signed simply editors until mccomas ceased to be one of co editors after which boucher used his own name according to clareson column long remained most catholic appraisal of field because of variety of works reviewed clareson 1985 p 381 boucher did not review his own fiction in column though on at least one occasion he listed a new book of his telling reader comments eagerly welcomed in this case you are reviewer marks 2008 p 140 when boucher left he was succeeded by damon knight as book reviewer alfred bester took over in 1960 and remained in role until avram davidson became book reviewer when he took editorial chair clareson 1985 pp 380 381 isaac asimov had begun a series of science articles for venture science fiction in january 1958 and when venture was cancelled mills brought science column over to f sf column which according to asimov he enjoyed writing more than any of his other works ran for decades without interruption helping to contribute to a long standing feeling of consistency and continuity in f sf s format and contents avram davidson who became editor in 1962 had sold his first story to f sf in 1954 though he was better remembered for golem which appeared in march 1955 issue ashley 2005 p 111 under davidson more work appeared by non english speaking writers such as hugo correa herbert franke and shin ishi hoshi notable stories he acquired for f sf include terry carr s first sale who with devil in 1962 and roger zelazny s a rose for ecclesiastes in november 1963 he published two author special issues

as samuel delany and roger zelazny hard science fiction stories by gregory benford and john varley fantasies by sterling lanier and tom and horror by charles l grant and stephen king mid 1960s saw an increase in diversity of stories appearing elsewhere in field magazines like new worlds and science fantasy published material that previously could only have appeared in f sf sf author christopher priest writing in 1978 commented that many writers later considered part of new wave soon found a natural home for their work in f sf priest 1978 p 168 in ashley s view rest of field was starting to catch up to f sf s open mindedness but this did not lead to a drop in f sf s quality end of 1960s saw ferman printing some old fashioned material such as john christopher s novel about miniaturization little people alongside much of roger zelazny s early output and anarchic and often indefinable stories by r a lafferty harvey jacobs and others in 1968 piers anthony s early novel sos rope was serialized anthony had won a competition sponsored in part by f sf ashley 2005 pp 268 270 harlan ellison and james tiptree jr were frequent contributors in 1970s tiptree contributing some of her best known stories such as and i awoke and found me here on cold hill s side and women men don t see ellison s many stories in f sf included in 1973 which won a hugo award and is five in 1977 which won

novel of martian colonization man plus also won a nebula judith merril took over book review column on davidson s departure and was followed by james blish in 1970 and algis budrys in 1975 with frequent contributions from other reviewers such as joanna russ and gahan wilson ashley 2007 p 90 in 1965 wilson began contributing cartoons and continued to do so regularly until 1981 ferman set a humorous competition for readers in november 1971 issue and thereafter ran two or three similar competitions every year ashley 2016 p 4 these were later collected in a 1996 anthology titled oi robot title taken from a competition to add a single letter to a well known work of sf easton 2006 p 47 a film review column first in magazine since charles beaumont s science screen and william morrison aka joseph s live theater column science stage in latter 1950s conducted by samuel r delany commenced in 1969 baird searles contributed column between 1970 and 1984 among later reviewers ellison was one of most popular and columns from his first four years were collected as harlan ellison s watching in 1989 isaac asimov s science fiction magazine was launched in 1977 and from 1983 under of shawna mccarthy and later gardner dozois it began to publish more mature material becoming a more direct competitor to f sf s market niche authors such as lucius shepard james blaylock and john crowley whose work was a natural fit for f sf were selling to asimov s as well launch of omni in 1978 also had an impact for almost every year in 1970s stories published in f sf won more award nominations and were selected for more year s best anthologies than other magazines in 1980s that was no longer true as asimov s took over leading role and omni sometimes pushed f sf into third place ashley 2007 p 87 ashley 2016 p 35 ferman was still able to acquire some highly regarded material such as lost boys by orson scott card and by mike resnick when omni rejected george r r martin s monkey treatment and gardner dozois s down among dead men which were dark fantasy ferman acquired both ashley 2016 pp 39 40 along with these regular columns ferman occasionally published articles such as science fiction and university a feature in may 1972 issue that included contributions from darko suvin thomas clareson and philip klass ashley 2007 p 292 f sf won hugo award for best magazine for four consecutive years from 1969 through 1972 when award was changed to best professional editor initially this category was dominated by ben bova editor of analog but ferman won it for three more years at start of 1980s ashley 2016 p 2 some of artists who had provided covers for early issues of f sf including chesley bonestell ed emshwiller and alex schomburg were still contributing their work into late 1970s and many of regular writers from early years such as reginald bretnor ron goulart and hilbert schenck continued to appear in f sf into 1980s a newer group including joanna russ and r a lafferty had become regulars more recently ashley 2016 pp 5 8 some established writers such as thomas disch published their more unusual work in f sf ashley 2016 p 7 and there were also writers such as felix c whose unusual stories were described by ferman as a step ahead of most sf writers or perhaps he s marching in a different direction ashley 2016 p 9 in ashley s opinion ferman managed to balance work of these eccentric writers so that they never distorted contents yet kept magazine on edge newer writers who began to appear regularly in 1980s included bruce sterling who published his early shaper stories in f sf beginning with swarm in 1982 ashley 2016 p 10 stephen king s dark tower series had begun in 1979 in f sf and four more stories appeared over next three years before being collected as a novel in 1982 grant 1997 p 537 and michael shea and bob leman contributed horror and weird fiction regularly in 1980s ashley 2016 pp 10 12 despite increased competition from omni and isaac asimov s science fiction magazine ferman managed to keep f sf s reputation for quality intact throughout 1980s ashley 2016 p 91 it was not as distinct from its competition as it had once been but it retained an idiosyncratic individuality in ashley s words ashley 2016 p 230 after ferman under kristine kathryn rusch f sf began to publish more dark fantasy and horror stories such as night we buried road dog by jack cady which won a nebula award when rusch took over as editor isaac asimov had been writing science column for over three decades and algis budrys had been contributing a book review column since 1975 in 1992 asimov died and budrys departed science column ran for 399 consecutive issues ending in february 1992 asimov s widow janet asimov wrote another essay for december 1994 issue based on her conversations with her husband before his death and a final essay appeared in january 1996 containing material from book yours isaac asimov a lifetime of letters science column continued to appear written by bruce sterling and gregory benford among others and john kessel took over book reviews robert succeeded kessel with some overlap in 1994 and 1995 asimov s maintained its dominance of field through 1990s though rusch published well received material such as martian child by david gerrold and last summer at mars hill by elizabeth hand rusch won one hugo award as editor during her five years at f sf in 1994 van gelder printed more fantasy and less hard science fiction than had rusch and in ashley s opinion he was able to restore some of magazine s distinctiveness as a result of switch to bimonthly in 2009 with resulting higher page count in each issue magazine began to publish longer stories assessment f sf quickly established itself as one of leading magazines ashley describes it as bridging attitude gap between slick magazines and pulps and argues that it made genre more respectable fantasy side of magazine attracted writers who had been regular contributors to weird tales and unknown two of best known fantasy pulps and in ashley s opinion it soon found a middle ground between those pulp traditions and fantasy written for slicks ashley 1997 p 610 it was known as most literary of science fiction and fantasy magazines and it published most diverse range of material in a 1978 review of new wave sf christopher priest agreed that f sf has a bias for literary work and added that it has been a sort of new wave of its own ever since its inception from 1950s f sf was regarded as one of big three science fiction magazines along with astounding science fiction and galaxy science fiction ashley 2005 p 202 ashley 2007 p 11 in a review of a 1952 issue james blish writing as william atheling jr commented that much of magazine to that point was wonderfully written and that boucher s and mccomas s editorial acumen made f sf very readable but that on occasion a well written sophisticated but unoriginal science fiction story might be accepted by f sf because it was not a specialist sf magazine atheling 1967 pp 26 29 at end of 1950s kingsley amis described it as most highbrow of science fiction magazines amis 1960 p 126 and gary k wolfe later said that f sf along with galaxy defined tenor of 1950s wolfe 2003 p 100 in 1966 judith merril argued that it was boucher and mccomas who made a place in genre for writers such as charles beaumont mildred edgar pangborn and many others who in her opinion had virtually stopped writing until necessary new magazine came along aldiss wingrove 1986 p 269 in 2007 ashley commented that f sf had been most consistently enjoyable magazine of last 50 years ashley 2007 p 91 in his view a key reason for magazine s appeal was that its roots were in literary tradition with lawrence spivak its first publisher inheritor of h l mencken s american mercury which had been successful and widely respected as a literary review unlike most of its competitors f sf had no connection to pulp magazine era and its editors had always intended to appeal to readers of books rather than of magazines ashley also cites f sf s broad editorial policy which allowed magazine to carry a wider range of fiction than its competitors in 2014 gary westfahl praised creative editors of 1980s and 1990s such as gardner dozois and gordon van gelder but added that such editors were no longer most important figures in field westfahl 2014 p 87 bibliographic details thumb f sf s circulation from 1962 to 2007 p 480 as of march 2017 editorial succession is as follows anthony boucher j francis mccomas fall 1949 august
