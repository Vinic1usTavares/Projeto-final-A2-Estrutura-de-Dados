sinclair c5 is a small one person battery electric technically an electrically assisted pedal cycle it was culmination of sir clive sinclair s long running interest in electric vehicles although widely described as an electric car sinclair characterised it as a vehicle not a car sinclair had become one of uk s best known millionaires and earned a knighthood on back of highly successful sinclair research range of home computers in early 1980s he hoped to repeat his success in electric vehicle market which he saw as ripe for a new approach c5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called c1 after a change in law prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers sinclair developed c5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by lotus cars it was intended to be first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles but in event planned development of follow up c10 and c15 electric cars never got further than drawing board on 10 january 1985 c5 was unveiled at a glitzy launch event but it received a less than enthusiastic reception from british media its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by consumer and motoring organisations vehicle s limitations a short range a maximum speed of only a battery that ran down quickly and a lack of weatherproofing made it impractical for most people s needs it was marketed as an alternative to cars and bicycles but ended up appealing to neither group of owners and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch within three months of launch production had been slashed by 90 sales never picked up despite sinclair s optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by august 1985 out of 14 000 c5s made only 5 000 were sold before its manufacturer sinclair vehicles went into receivership c5 became known as one of great marketing bombs of postwar british industry and a notorious example of failure despite its commercial failure c5 went on to become a cult item for collectors thousands of unsold c5s were purchased by investors and sold for hugely inflated prices as much as ps5 000 compared to original retail value of ps399 enthusiasts have established owners clubs and some have modified their vehicles substantially adding monster wheels jet engines and high powered electric motors to propel their c5s at speeds of up to design right thumb c5 with left side of body shell removed showing pedals chassis drive chain battery and electric motor right thumb c5 seen from rear

be propelled via bicycle style pedals located at front of cockpit maximum speed of an unmodified c5 is at rear of vehicle is a small luggage compartment with a capacity of 28 litres 1 cu ft sinclair c5 a new power in personal transport sinclair vehicles promotional brochure january 1985 as c5 does not have a reverse gear reversing direction is done by getting out picking up front end and turning it around by hand c5 is powered by a 12 volt lead acid electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4 100 revolutions per minute it is coupled with a two stage gear drive that increases torque by a factor of 13 without which motor would not be able to move vehicle when a person is on board however motor is vulnerable to overheating torque increases as load on vehicle increases for instance by going up too steep a gradient sinclair s tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 8 and could manage a 1 in 7 14 slope using pedals as speed of motor reduces current flow through its windings increases drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed this would very quickly burn motor out if sustained so motor s load is constantly monitored by c5 s electronics if it stalls under full load electronics disable motor after 4 seconds while if it is under heavy load around 80 or 90 amps it trips after two or three minutes a heat sensitive resistor inside motor warns driver if vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects motor after a short time and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on motor if an excessive temperature is reached strip distorts and power is disconnected although it was usually billed as an electric vehicle c5 also depends significantly on pedal power vehicle s battery is designed to provide 35 amps for an hour when fully charged or half that for two hours giving c5 a claimed range of a display in cockpit uses green amber and red leds to display state of battery charge segments are extinguished one after other to indicate how much driving time is left last light indicates that only ten minutes of power are left after which motor is switched off and driver is left to rely on pedals another display indicates via green amber and red leds how much current is being used c5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current indicated by green leds is being used when lights are red motor is under a high load and driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown c5 was initially sold at a cost of ps399 but to keep cost under ps400 mark a number of components were sold as optional accessories dale p 170 these included indicator lights mirrors mud flaps a horn and a high vis mast consisting of a reflective strip on a pole designed to make c5 more visible in traffic sinclair s c5 accessories brochure noted that british climate isn t always ideal for wind in hair driving and offered a range of to keep c5 drivers dry in vehicle s open cockpit other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries sinclair c5 accessories sinclair vehicles promotional brochure 1985 history origins sir clive sinclair s interest in possibilities of electric vehicles originated in late 1950s during a holiday job for electronics company fifteen years later in early 1970s he was head of his own successful electronics company sinclair radionics based in st ives in cambridgeshire he tasked one of his employees chris curry later a co founder of acorn computers to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design sinclair took view that an electric vehicle needed to be designed from ground up completely rethinking principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model he believed that motor was key to design sinclair and curry developed a wafer thin motor that was mounted on a child s scooter with a button on handlebars to activate it research got no further however as sinclair s development of first slimline pocket calculator sinclair executive and its successors took precedence no further work on electric vehicles took place for most of rest of 1970s early development c1 it was not until late 1979 that sinclair returned to electric vehicle development around christmas that year he approached tony wood rogers an ex radionics employee to carry out consultancy work on a preliminary investigation into a personal electric vehicle brief was to assess options for producing a one person vehicle which would be a replacement for a moped and would have a maximum speed of although wood rogers was initially reluctant he was intrigued by idea of an electric vehicle and agreed to help sinclair vehicle was dubbed c1 c standing for clive he built a number of prototypes to demonstrate various design principles and clarify final specifications dale p 152 a specification of c1 emerged by end of year it would address short distance transportation needs with a minimum range of on a fully charged battery this reflected official figures showing that average daily car journey was only while average moped or pedal cycle journey was just users were envisaged as being housewives urban commuters and young people who might otherwise use cycles or mopeds to travel electric vehicle would be safer more weather proof and would offer space to carry items it would be easy to drive and park and for driver to enter or exit and it would require minimum maintenance vehicle would be engineered for simplicity using injection moulded plastic components and a polypropylene body it would also be much cheaper than a car costing ps500 now ps at most dale p 152 3 one area of development that sinclair purposely avoided was battery technology electric vehicles powered by lead acid batteries had once actually outnumbered internal combustion engine vehicles in 1912 nearly 34 000 electric cars were registered in u s however efficiency of internal combustion engines greatly improved while battery technology advanced much more slowly leading to petrol and diesel driven vehicles dominating market adamson kennedy p 184 by 1978 out of 17 6 million registered vehicles on britain s roads only 45 000 were electric vehicles in day to day use and of those 90 were burton p 101 sinclair chose to rely on existing lead acid battery technology avoiding great expense of developing a more efficient type his rationale was that if electric vehicle market took off battery manufacturers would step up to develop better batteries dale p 154 wood rogers recalls development programme moved to university of exeter in 1982 where c1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel it was recognised at an early stage that vehicle would have to be aerodynamic although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for vehicle s efficiency by march 1982 basic design of c1 had been established sinclair then turned to an established motor design company ogle design of to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering however ogle s approach was not to sinclair s liking they tackled project as one of car design and focused more and expensively on aerodynamics rather than cycle technology around which c1 was based weight of vehicle increased to over far more than sinclair s desired specification by march 1983 sinclair and wood rogers had decided to stop c1 programme dale p 155 wood rogers comments that ogle were convinced that c1 would be a flop telling sinclair that it would not be fast enough that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that battery was not good enough to meet steadily escalating development costs of vehicle sinclair decided to raise capital by selling some of his own shares in sinclair research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles a ps12 million deal was reached in march 1983 of which ps8 3 million was used to fund establishment of new sinclair vehicles company adamson kennedy p 187 sinclair recruited barrie wills a veteran former employee of delorean motor company to lead sinclair vehicles as its managing director although wills initially expressed scepticism about viability of an electric vehicle his twenty five years in motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was never going to happen sinclair managed to convince him that project would work in 1984 sinclair vehicles new head office was established in coventry in west midlands an area with a long established link with motor industry dale p 160 project s prospects were boosted by changes in british government s approach to electric vehicles in march 1980 it had abolished vehicle excise duty for electric vehicles and by start of 1983 department of transport was working on legislation that would introduce a new category of vehicle electrically assisted pedal cycle this had a number of significant advantages from sinclair s point of view such a vehicle would be exempt from insurance and vehicle tax and user would not need a driving licence or a helmet all of which were required for mopeds legislation which was passed in august 1983 was prompted by a lobbying campaign by manufacturers such as raleigh who wanted to sell electric bicycles sinclair realised that his electric vehicle design could easily be adapted to meet new legislation as electrically assisted pedal cycle category was so new there were no existing vehicles on market that would meet standards prescribed by new legislation however it imposed a number of restrictions that limited performance of any vehicle that would qualify under new standards maximum legal speed of vehicle would be limited to only it could not weigh any more than including battery and its motor could not be rated at any more than 250 watts dale p 156 despite these limitations vehicle was seen as only first step in a series of increasingly ambitious electrical cars sinclair intended it to prove viability of electric personal transport hope was that just as sinclair had found with home computers like hugely successful zx81 and zx spectrum an affordable electric vehicle could unleash pent up demand for a market that did not previously exist however sinclair performed no market research to ascertain whether there was actually a market for his electric vehicle as director of primary contact advertising agency commented in january 1985 project continued all way to prototype stage purely on convictions of sir clive development and design of c5 with sinclair s new specifications in hand ogle worked on a three wheeled design dubbed c5 which bore similarities with earlier three wheeled bond bug another ogle design vehicle s handlebar steering was brainchild of wood rogers who decided at outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver to get in and out easily a serious safety disadvantage he comments that putting bars at driver s sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural burton p 103 a prototype was presented to 63 families in a b c1 and c2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that controls were correctly positioned this was only external research carried out on c5 in autumn of 1983 wills brought in lotus cars to finish vehicle s detailing build prototypes and test rigs carry out testing and take forward programme to production development of c5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy with testing carried out at motor industry research association s proving ground in leicestershire further aerodynamic refinements were carried out in exeter with development of new body shells which produced further reductions in vehicle s drag however it was felt that something was lacking in design and a 23 year old industrial designer gus desbarats was brought in to refine shell s appearance dale p 157 he had won a sinclair sponsored electric vehicle design competition at royal college of art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in house car design studio at sinclair s metalab in cambridge of which he became first employee it was not only desbarats first project but as he later said day one of my working life when he turned up at sinclair s premises he was taken aback when he saw c5 for first time as he had been expecting a proper electric car he said later that he thought concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality there were no instruments nowhere to put anything and no security features desbarats told sinclair that design would have to be redone from scratch asking what we were doing about visibility rear view mirrors range indications it was far too late for this however all key design decisions had already been made desbarats told sinclair that he would need four months to revisit design and was given eight weeks instead he created styling that was used for final production model of c5 with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently desbarats was also responsible for creation of high vis mast accessory as he felt uncomfortable being so close to ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him he later described his contribution as convert ing an ugly pointless device into a prettier safer and more usable pointless device gray p 93 right thumb c5 s electric motor which drives left hand rear wheel chassis of c5 consists of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at rear it lacks a separate suspension system instead relying on chassis structure having enough torsional flex its motor was produced in italy by a subsidiary of dutch company philips although it was later famously said that c5 was powered by a washing machine motor adamson kennedy p 189 motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan lotus provided gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns c5 s electronics were produced by metalab a sinclair spin off wheels were assembled from tyres made in taiwan and wheels from italy oldham batteries provided a lead acid battery developed for sinclair that could manage more than 300 charge discharge cycles that had originally been specified bodywork was made from two injection moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers j j harvey of manchester made moulds provided shells and ici supplied raw material according to rodney dale upper shell mould was one of largest if not largest injection mouldings of its type in uk possibly even in world manufacturing process reflected sinclair s ambition for c5 production line a single mould set was capable of producing up to 4 000 parts every week two parts of shell were joined together by wrapping a tape around joint aligning them on a jig pressing them together and passing an electric current through tape to heat and melt it same process was used to make front and rear bumper assemblies of austin maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete although sinclair had considered producing c5 at delorean plant at in northern ireland which had one of europe s most advanced automated plastic body manufacturing facilities this was not to be as delorean motor company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in plant s closure instead work of assembling c5 was given to hoover company in spring of 1983 welsh development agency wda approached hoover to ask them if they would be interested becoming principal subcontractor for sinclair who are working on an electric car and as a by product of research have designed an electrically assisted bicycle they are looking for a subcontractor to whom they can entrust assembly proposal suited all sides wda was keen to support hoover washing machine factory at merthyr tydfil situated in economically depressed south wales valleys hoover was enticed by sinclair s projections of sales of 200 000 units a year increasing to 500 000 sinclair saw hoover s plant and expertise as a good match for their fabrication techniques a contract was signed within a few months dale p 161 production distribution and support c5 was produced in great secrecy in a separate part of hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities at first work was carried out by a small team of people in a sealed room but as production ramped up hoover installed two production lines in building connected to main factory by a tunnel a rolling testing stand was located at end of production line to test each completed c5 for faults a mechanical arm simulated weight of a person weighing and vehicle s brakes were tested under load at end of process c5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks around ps100 000 was spent to set up factory dale p 162 distribution centres were set up in hayes in middlesex preston in lancashire and oxford to handle c5s dale p 163 hoover arranged for 19 of its service offices around uk responsible for maintaining customers vacuum cleaners and washing machines to also maintain c5s and provide spare parts dale p 167 c5 s major consumable item battery was to be supported by 300 branches of comet and woolworths hoover trained its engineers to produce c5s and tested its manufacturing processes by assembling dismantling and re assembling 100 c5s full production began in november 1984 and by early january 1985 over 2 500 c5s had been manufactured dale p 166 each production line could produce 50 vehicles an hour and hoover were capable of producing up to 8 000 c5s per week launch right thumb alexandra palace where c5 s launch was staged on 10 january 1985 news of sinclair s c5 project came as a surprise when it became public and attracted considerable interest as well as scepticism economist reported in june 1983 that carmakers were startled but cautious about sinclair s prospects as one competitor put it if it were anyone but sinclair we d say he was bonkers economist asked can a man who has made a fortune out of calculators and computers and could double it on flatscreen televisions be that crazy and wondered whether he was making a ghastly mistake a prediction that industry insiders thought was likely c5 was launched on 10 january 1985 at alexandra palace in north london event was staged in sinclair s usual glitzy style with women handing out press packs and a variety of promotional giveaways magazines hats t shirts key rings sun visors badges mugs bags and even a c5 video game dale p 168 vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling six c5s driven by women dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes drove around arena and lined up side by side dale p 165 sinclair announced launch of a ps3 million three month long advertising print and television advertising campaign c5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of ps399 and would subsequently be sold via high street stores sinclair issued a glossy sales brochure characterising vehicle as a part of an ongoing exercise in cutting giants down to size turning impersonal tyrants into personal servants brochure highlighted sinclair s achievements in producing affordable pocket calculators home computers and pocket televisions and declared with c5 sinclair vehicles puts personal private transport back where it belongs in hands of individual photographs accompanying text showed housewives and teenagers driving c5 to shops railway stations and sports fields in words of technology writers ian adamson and richard kennedy a blue sky suburbia exclusively populated by electric trikes and their drivers adamson kennedy p 192 press was given an opportunity to try out c5 but this proved to be as adamson and kennedy put it an unqualified disaster adamson kennedy p 193 a large number of demonstration machines did not work as assembled journalists soon discovered sunday times called c5 a formula one bath chair its reporter had travelled five yards outdoors when everything went and this motorised plastic lozenge rolled to a halt with all stationary decisiveness of a mule guardian s reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes while your computer found that c5 could not cope with slopes at alexandra palace 250 watt electric motor which drives one of back wheels proved incapable of powering c5 up even gentlest slopes without using pedal power tricycle was soon making a plaintive peep peep noise signalling that engine had overheated even distinguished former racing driver stirling moss ran into problems when he tried out c5 on roads around alexandra palace canadian newspaper globe and mail reported that while he had started out well a jaunty smile on his face as he braved some of worst exhaust fumes in world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath he ran into problems when he reached a hill it was at this point that he realised battery had gone dead on a cold and foggy london day great man was visibly sweating timing and location of launch event in middle of winter on top of a snow and ice covered hill later prompted criticism even from sinclair executives who admitted off record that spring conditions might have been better for a vehicle with so little protection from british climate financial times called it worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious road going vehicle sinclair s biographer rodney dale describes it as a calculated or miscalculated risk pointing out that production was already underway details were beginning to leak out to press and launch could hardly have been held up until possibility of a bright spring day he justified choice of january as being necessitated by a need to release c5 as soon as possible lest erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good rob gray offers an alternative explanation that launch date had been brought forward because sinclair s development funds were running low gray p 92 reviews it soon became apparent that c5 faced more serious problems with public perception than merely a botched launch event media reactions to c5 were generally negative when first reviews appeared over following days as financial times observed few hardy journalists who ventured out on roads returned shivering and dubious about c5 s abilities in such harsh conditions a common concern was that it was simply too vulnerable in traffic your computer commented that a periscope would be handy if you intended driving c5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level guardian s motoring correspondent wrote of her grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic on a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel is silent and low down it disappears below a car driver s sight line when pulling up alongside prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic dwarfed by heavy lorries buses and cars is worrying their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic another guardian writer wrote that he would not want to drive c5 in any traffic at all my head was on a level with top of a juggernaut s tyres exhaust fumes blasted into my face even with minuscule front and rear lights on i could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above ground would see me sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing c5 s industrial designer gus desbarats in a c5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an austin mini to illustrate that c5 driver s seated position was actually higher than that of a mini driver dale p 164 as teenagers were among target audiences for c5 some commentators also raised prospect of in adamson and kennedy s words packs of 14 year olds terrorising neighbourhood in their customised c5s secretary of cyclists touring club raised prospect of kids us ing them in a pretty wild way they may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down sinclair dismissed such concerns i have qualms about seven year olds riding bicycles on open road but i have far fewer qualms about a 14 year old driving one of these teenagers interviewed by guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a c5 commenting that while it was fun to drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles sinclair s claims to have revolutionised electric vehicle were dismissed by many reviewers your computer called c5 more of a toy than ideal solution for all types of local journey which brochure claims guardian s motoring correspondent also characterised it as a delightful toy daily telegraph described it as a cleverly designed fun machine that can hardly be regarded as serious everyday all weather transport while engineer viewed it as a smashing big boy s toy tough enough to take teenage thrashing and possibly a serious vehicle for fit adults to nip out in for sunday papers on plus side c5 s handling characteristics were praised by reviewers guardian called it very easy to master once you have become familiar with under thigh handlebar steering and semi recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle type pedals daily mirror described arrangement as surprisingly easy to master although it cautioned that on full speed and on full lock it s very easy to tip it onto two wheels daily express motoring correspondent wrote that he found c5 stable comfortable and easy to handle verdict from motoring organisations road safety groups and consumer watchdogs was decidedly negative and probably sealed c5 s fate british safety council bsc tested c5 at sinclair vehicles headquarters in warwick and issued a highly critical report to its 32 000 members sinclair was furious and announced that he would sue bsc and its chairman james tye for defamation although nothing came of it adamson kennedy pp 194 5 after tye told press i am shattered that within a few days 14 year old children will be allowed to drive on road in this doodle bug without a licence without insurance and without any form of training several years later tye was happy to take responsibility for c5 s failure describing himself as man entirely to blame for failure of sinclair c5 sales history right thumb driving a sinclair c5 despite problems of press launch day a more positive response was expected from 20 000 members of public who attended remaining two days of launch event to try out c5 on alexandra palace test track sinclair reported day after event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers and it expected that all 2 700 units from first production run would be sold by following monday setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout c5 s short commercial life this prediction was wildly optimistic less than 200 were sold during alexandra palace event however sales picked up as mail order forms which had been sent to all of sinclair s computer customers were returned with fresh orders within four weeks 5 000 c5s had been sold c5 s users were an eclectic group they included holiday camps who wanted c5s to rent to campers british royal family princes william and harry each had one to drive around kensington palace before they were old enough to drive sir elton john who had two magician paul daniels who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around bbc television centre car park sir arthur c clarke who had two shipped out to his home at colombo in sri lanka and mayor of scarborough michael pitts who swapped his official daimler for a c5 burton p 105 however as times reported some of early buyers were disappointed by vehicle s limitations citing its slowness its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills which led some people to return their c5s and ask for a refund although c5 reached retail stores at start of march 1985 sales had tailed off sinclair resorted to hiring teams of teenagers to drive around london in c5s to promote vehicle at a cost to company of ps20 a day similar teams were established in manchester birmingham and leeds company denied that it was a marketing campaign a spokesman told times that we haven t done tests on inner city roads that is what team is doing marketing is not prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin off sinclair was reported to be surprised at lack of demand and blamed press for a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting matters did not improve retail chain comet acquired 1 600 c5s but nine months later most were still unsold adamson kennedy p 199 adding to sinclair s problems production of c5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that plastic moulding attached to gearbox was impairing performance of their vehicles 100 hoover workers were shifted from c5 production line to work on replacing faulty mouldings on returned vehicles barrie wills admitted that sinclair was also taking opportunity to adjust stocks in light of c5 s poor sales when production resumed a month later it was at only 10 of previous level with 90 of workers being transferred back to washing machine production lines only 100 c5s were now being produced a week down from original 1 000 over 3 000 unsold c5s were piled up in storage at hoover factory with additional unsold stock in 500 retail outlets nationwide sinclair tried to put a brave face on it admitting that sales have not been entirely up to expectations but claiming to be confident of a high level of demand for vehicle a spokesman told media that we expect a rapid rise in sales now that weather is improving possible sales opportunities were explored in mainland europe asia and united states with sinclair claiming that he had found very big levels of interest hoover were sufficiently persuaded to allow sinclair to divert 10 of their employees to modify c5s for overseas export bid to sell c5 abroad failed dutch national transport service told sinclair that c5 was not suitable for dutch roads without improvements to its braking system addition of more reflectors and inclusion of high vis mast as part of basic package most of other ten countries that sinclair inquired of demanded similar changes c5 s reputation received a further battering when major consumer organisations published sceptical evaluations automobile association questioned many of sinclair s claims in a report published at start of may it found that range of vehicle was typically only about 10 miles 16 km rather than promised by sinclair and reported that c5 s battery ran flat after only on a cold day c5 s running speed was more usually around than claimed while its running costs compared unfavourably to that of a petrol driven honda moped stability general and especially safety of c5 were questioned and aa suggested that high vis mast should be included as part of standard package it concluded consumers association published a critical report on c5 in june issue of its magazine which concluding that vehicle was of only limited use and represented poor value for money all three of c5s that it tested broke down with a major gearbox fault and their high vis masts snapped longest run between battery charges was only and a more realistic achievable range was 5 10 miles 8 16 km it also echoed aa s concerns about c5 s safety and omission of high vis mast from standard package magazine also called c5 too easy to steal adamson kennedy p 197 hardly surprising considering that while a security lock could be used to prevent it being driven away c5 was light enough that a would be thief could simply pick it up and carry it off as summer of 1985 continued sales of c5 remained far below sinclair s predictions only 8 000 had been sold by july in middle of that month advertising standards authority ordered sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for c5 after finding that company s claims about safety and speed of c5 either could not be proved or were not justified retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of c5s by drastically cutting vehicle s price comet first reduced price to ps259 90 but by end of year was selling c5s with a complete set of accessories for only ps139 99 65 less than initial price adamson kennedy p 200 production was terminated in august 1985 by which time 14 000 c5s had been assembled cashflow problems caused by paucity of sales caused relations to break down between sinclair vehicles and hoover in june 1985 hoover obtained a writ against sinclair for unpaid debts of over ps1 5 million relating to work carried out over previous eight months it did not actually serve writ but entered negotiations with sinclair in mid august it publicly announced that it was ceasing production of c5 a sinclair spokesman told media that halt in production was due to a shortage of certain components which are unable to be re ordered while a financial settlement is pending once this has been concluded production is envisaged to recommence demise of sinclair vehicles right thumb an abandoned sinclair c5 in fife scotland production did not recommence and hoover production line remained closed permanently on 19 september 1985 sinclair vehicles changed its name to tpd limited with a direct subsidiary named sinclair vehicles sales limited continuing to sell c5s tpd only lasted until 15 october when it was placed into receivership receivers announced that 4 500 c5s had been sold by sinclair vehicles with another 4 500 remaining in company s hands ps7 75 million was reportedly owed to creditors of which ps7 million was owed to sir clive sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in project hoover was not among creditors as sinclair had managed to settle dispute on terms that neither company would reveal on 5 november tpd was formally liquidated at a creditors meeting it was revealed to anger of creditors that sinclair had taken out a ps5 million debenture to cover money that he had put into company ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering ps1 million left outstanding primary contact marketing agency used by sinclair to promote c5 was left with biggest unpaid bill of nearly ps500 000 last of unsold c5s were bought for ps75 each by ellar surplus goods ltd of liverpool which planned to sell 1 000 of them to an egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1 500 were intended to be sold in uk many reasons have been suggested for failure of sinclair vehicles and what dale calls jigsaw of c5 s disappointment one of receivers of sinclair vehicles john suggested that sinclair had taken wrong tack with its marketing of c5 it was presented as a serious transport when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product an up market plaything ellar s director maurice took exactly this tack when he purchased sinclair vehicles remaining stock saying that his company would market them as a sophisticated toy if you were a little boy wouldn t you want your parents to get you one this christmas his strategy was notably successful ellar sold nearly 7 000 c5s at up to ps700 each far more and at a higher price than sinclair had ever managed some commentators attributed c5 s failure to problems with sinclair s marketing strategy only a year after demise of sinclair vehicles globe and mail newspaper called it one of great marketing bombs of postwar british industry andrew p marks of paisley college of technology criticises sinclair s marketing strategy as confused c5 promotional brochure depicts it as a leisure vehicle showing boys in c5s at a football pitch women in c5s on a suburban road and so on while text suggests that c5 is a serious substitute for a car he concludes that c5 was poorly defined appearing to be trying to grasp at two different markets but was unable to appeal to either and so failed to take off fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake in marks view as it meant that no physical inspection of product could be made before purchasing it this was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made c5 a much more risky purchase design researcher and academic nigel cross calls c5 a notorious example of failure and describes its basic concept as wrong he points out that marketing research for c5 was carried out after vehicle s concept had already been decided he notes that it appears to have been intended mainly to aid promotion rather than to guide development gus desbarats c5 s industrial designer attributes vehicle s flawed concept to sinclair operating in a bubble and believes that sinclair failed to understand difference between a new market computing and a mature one transport where there were more benchmarks to compare against gray p 91 he comments that experience of working on c5 convinced him of need for industrial designers such as himself to get involved early in innovation process shaping basic configurations never again being satisfied to simply decorate a fundamentally bad idea sinclair himself said in 2005 that c5 was early for what it was people reacted negatively and press didn t help it was too low down and people felt insecure hence it got bad press sam dawson of classic and sport car magazine described c5 as incredibly fun to drive suggesting that safety concerns could have been addressed if it wasn t for fact that it was already doomed as a national joke he noted disconnect between media s expectations of a serious electric car and reality of c5 which he called just a fun way of getting around professor stuart cole of university of south wales comments that c5 suffered from design of roads and attitudes of time which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles in days before unleaded petrol your face would have been at height of every exhaust pipe and drivers weren t used to having to consider slower moving cyclists but with more cycle lanes better education and workplaces providing showers etc world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to car and hopefully will become even more so in future legacy sinclair s other electric vehicles sinclair envisaged producing follow up vehicles such as c10 a two seater city car and c15 a three seater capable of travelling at adamson kennedy p 198 as wills put it at launch event we re developing a family of traffic compatible quiet economic and pollution free vehicles for end of 80s c5 was described as baby of family c10 was intended to be a city car capable of carrying two passengers at up to in a roofed but open sided compartment with two wheels at front and one at back wood rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of a 1960s italian sinclair built a full scale mock up of it according to wood rogers it looked great i specified open sides to keep cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too design is strikingly similar to modern renault electric vehicle wood rogers comments that you could put c10 into production today and it would still look contemporary burton p 102 at time of c5 s launch sinclair described c15 as having a futuristic design with an elongated tear drop shape a lightweight body made of self coloured polypropylene and a single possibly roller type rear wheel it would have been launched at 1988 international motor show in birmingham following a development programme costed at ps2 million unlike relatively conventional technology used in c5 sinclair intended to use sodium sulphur batteries with four times power to weight ratio of lead acid batteries to give c15 much greater speed and range over on a single charge it would have had approximately same dimensions as a conventional small car measuring long high and wide however it could only have worked if sodium sulphur batteries had realised their promise in event they did not project could not continue due to thermal problems neither c10 nor c15 ever left drawing board although sinclair went on to produce more but much smaller electric vehicles including sinclair in 1992 whose sales were affected by aftermath of c5 c5 debacle did lasting damage to reputation of subsequent evs in uk which media routinely compared to c5 it was not until a highly regarded manufacturer toyota launched a serious and well received vehicle in 1990s prius that c5 jinx was finally laid to rest burton pp 106 7 in 2017 sir clive s nephew grant sinclair presented what he called an updated version of sinclair c5 called iris from flop to cult right thumb c5 enthusiasts gather at brooklands museum right thumb a heavily modified c5 fitted with a jet engine despite its lack of commercial success when it was first released c5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in later years collectors began purchasing them as investment items reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price one such investor adam harper bought 600 c5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987 he sold all but four within two years selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation he also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from road as c5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax according to harper c5s could be resold for as much as ps2 500 more than six times original retail price by 1996 a special edition c5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than ps5 000 to collectors c5 owners began modifying their vehicles to achieve levels of performance far beyond anything envisaged by sinclair adam harper used one c5 as a stunt vehicle driving it through a tunnel of fire and adapted another to run at aiming to break a world land speed record for a three wheeled electric vehicle and british record for any type of electric vehicle he said later up to 100 mph it s like you re running on rails it s really stable then at about 110 to 120 mph it starts getting tricky at that point if a tyre blew up or something happened you would be surely dead as quoted in 1987 guinness book of records under battery powered vehicle john w owen and roy harvey travelled 919 miles 1479 km from john o groats to land s end in a sinclair c5 in 103 hr 15 min on 30 apr 4 may 1985 8 9 mph average chris crosskey an engineer from abingdon set a record for longest journey completed on a c5 on a trip to glastonbury away i nearly died of exhaustion and tried three times to drive one from land s end to john o groats a distance of another engineer adrian bennett fitted a jet engine to his c5 while plumber and inventor colin furze turned one into a 5 ft 1 5 m high monster with wheels and a petrol engine capable of propelling it at john otway regularly uses a c5 in his stage show and publicity see also list of motorized trikes references external links videos sir clive sinclair on c5 bbc news
