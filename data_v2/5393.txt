self contained community close enough to rail network to allow its residents to commute to work in line with principles of artizans company s founder william austin no public houses were built within estate and there are still none today as a result of london s rapid expansion during early 20th century and particularly after area was connected to london underground in 1932 noel park became completely surrounded by later developments in 1965 it was incorporated into newly created london borough of haringey and in 1966 it was bought by local authority and taken into public ownership

at time area was well served by railways palace gates line opened in 1878 to serve nearby alexandra palace had an intermediate station at green lanes immediately adjacent to site in question connor ss

these prejudices exist on part of poor as well as on part of other class london newspaper 1896 05 28 quoted in welch p 35 except for corner houses houses were built in pairs each sharing a porch with its neighbour for many of smaller fourth and fifth class houses doors were aligned at right angles to facade of house so as not to open directly adjacently to their neighbours all houses were designed with at least one parlour and with kitchen scullery and toilet in separate rooms at rear of house first class houses also had toilets upstairs welch p 28 in line with design principles of time

house alt a brightly painted red house with a tall pointed tower situated on a crossroads however poor workers at whom noel park development was aimed found themselves unable to afford railway tickets issuing of cheap early morning workman s fares on great eastern railway s lines further east in tottenham stamford hill and walthamstow had led to overcrowding on trains and large numbers of poor workers moving to areas many of them displaced by construction of ger s liverpool street station in city of london and rehoused by company connor p v william birt general manager of ger was strongly against extending policy of workmen s fares stating that to issue them from green lanes would do us a very large amount of injury and would cause same public annoyance and inconvenience as exists already upon stamford hill and walthamstow lines and that no one living in noel park could desire to possess same class of neighbours as residents of stamford hill have in neighbourhood of st ann s road olsen p 290 in 1884 a deputation led by lord shaftesbury was made to great eastern railway and great northern railway proposing that for trains due to arrive in central london prior to 8 am third class tickets should be sold at a fare of 3d providing return journey was not made before 4 pm by may 1885 both railways had adopted this policy however delays and uncertainty caused by fares dispute had discouraged prospective tenants leaving large numbers of properties vacant and causing further building work to slow considerably welch p 21 in 1887 construction work was temporarily suspended

gladstone avenue is original 1913 walsham how mission hall building however pictorial evidence of 1913 building at time of construction and 1920 ordnance survey map suggests that original building is that sited off road opposite junction with road a short distance south of current shropshire hall with latter being a later construction noel park s relative geographic isolation led to formation of large numbers of clubs and societies using two mission halls for a wide range of activities including large numbers of sporting societies welch p 41 due to temperance views of artizans company s directors no public houses were built in noel park a situation which remains case today brian harrison pubs and wolff p 183 20th century early 20th century expansion in 1905 g j earle artizans company

in 1904 great northern city railway underground railway had opened running from city of london to a terminus at finsbury park station followed in 1906 by great northern piccadilly brompton railway gnp br from western suburbs through central london to finsbury park approximately south of noel park both were prevented from expanding further north by a legal agreement with great northern railway giving gnr a veto on any expansion of underground railways into areas within which they would compete with gnr croome p 26 this led to serious congestion at finsbury park as passengers from expanding suburbs changed from buses and trams to gn cr and gnp br and in june 1923 a petition of 30 000 signatures calling for extension of one of underground lines northwards was delivered to ministry of transport london and north eastern railway lner successor to gnr was compelled by ministry of transport to waive veto or proceed with its own electrification in november 1925 lner abandoned its electrification scheme in 1929 incoming second labour government initiated a policy of direct subsidy for major infrastructure projects and in 1930 underground electric railways company of london

trickle following ending of passenger services goods yard was closed on 7 december 1964 site of goods yard was used for construction of a large apartment block known as sandlings and noel park wood green railway station was converted into commercial premises before being demolished in early 1970s to become site of eastern section of wood green shopping city transfer to local authority control in 1952 artizans labourers general dwellings company was renamed artizans and general properties company ltd combination of a taxation system biased against private property developments and legal restrictions on raising rents made company s traditional model unprofitable and it began to divest itself of its original low rent developments and instead to sell vacant houses on estates and to reinvest in non low rent housing and commercial property especially in united states and canada where depreciation before tax was permitted in 1966 ownership of four original london estates shaftesbury park queen s park noel park and court was transferred to respective local authorities as council housing in case of noel park newly created london borough of haringey which purchased 2 175

high road around shopping city which would have necessitated demolition of much of western section of noel park however diversion scheme was abandoned leading to current unusual situation in which road runs directly through shopping centre cherry pevsner note that noel park was spared worse damage by abandonment of proposed road cherry pevsner p 594 in 1980 housing act 1980 gave council tenants right to buy their homes in light of this a group of 1500 properties in area was given conservation area status and plumbe s northern section of estate was granted article four direction by michael heseltine secretary of state for environment preventing any alterations to external appearances of properties without planning permission in recognition of its architectural and historic interest st mark s church was meanwhile grade ii listed however these measures have not been consistently enforced and noel park has been cited in a report by english heritage as a prominent example of failure of conservation areas throughout 1980s and early 1990s estate was home of a large squatter community mostly made up of young punks from ireland wales scotland and outside london which greatly enlivened area but also led to many legal and other conflicts with haringey council who ironically had left so many of properties empty in first place many of these were later to move to down estate in manor
