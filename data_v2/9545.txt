century anglo saxon chronicle around four hundred years after his time aelle is recorded as being first bretwalda or britain ruler though there is no evidence that this was a contemporary title aelle s death is not recorded and although he may have been founder of a south saxon dynasty there is no firm evidence linking him with later south saxon rulers 12th century chronicler henry of huntingdon produced an enhanced version of anglo saxon chronicle that included 514 as date of aelle s death but this is not secure henry of huntingdon historia anglorum ed greenway sources section p lxxxvi henry

of aelle s life and existence as it was during least documented period in english history of last two millennia for example james campbell writes natural vice of historians is to claim to know about past nowhere is this claim more dangerous than when it is staked in britain between ad 400 and 600 anglo saxons p 20 welch anglo saxon england p 9 as chronicle was a product of west saxon court and is concerned with glorifying royal ancestry of alfred great manipulation of royal genealogies in this and other sources to enhance claims of present rulers was common literary formulas associated with

century britain had been roman for over three hundred and fifty years amongst enemies of roman britain were picts of central and northern scotland and gaels known as scoti who were raiders from ireland also vexatious were saxons name roman writers gave to peoples who lived in northern part of what is now germany and southern part of jutland peninsula saxon raids on southern and eastern shores of england had been sufficiently alarming by late 3rd century for romans to build saxon shore forts and subsequently to establish role of count of saxon shore to command defence against these incursions roman control of britain finally ended in early part of 5th century date usually given as marking end of roman britain is 410 when emperor honorius sent letters to british urging them to look to their own defence britain had been repeatedly stripped of troops to support usurpers claims to roman empire and after 410 roman armies never returned hunter blair an introduction pp 1 14 campbell et al anglo saxons pp 13 16 sources for events after this date are extremely scarce but a tradition reported as early as mid 6th century by a british priest named gildas records that british sent for help against barbarians to aetius a roman consul probably in late 440s no help came subsequently a british leader named is supposed to have invited continental mercenaries to help fight picts who were attacking from north leaders whose names are recorded as hengest and horsa rebelled and a long period of warfare ensued invaders angles saxons jutes and frisians gained control of parts of england but lost a major battle at mons badonicus location of which is not known some authors have speculated that aelle may have led saxon forces at this battle while others reject idea out of hand british thus gained a respite and peace lasted at least until time gildas was writing that is for perhaps forty or fifty years from around end of 5th century until midway through sixth hunter blair an introduction pp 13 16 campbell et al anglo saxons p 23 shortly after gildas s time anglo saxon advance was resumed and by late 6th century nearly all of southern england was under control of continental invaders hunter blair roman britain p 204 gives twenty five years from 550 to 575 as dates of final conquest early sources thumb 250px right a page from a manuscript of anglo saxon chronicle aelle s name spelled elle can be seen in two of entries at end of page last entry on page for 488 refers to events in kent and does not mention aelle there are two early sources that mention aelle by name earliest is ecclesiastical history of english people a history of english church written in 731 by bede a northumbrian monk bede mentions aelle as one of anglo saxon kings who exercised what he calls imperium over all provinces south of river humber imperium is usually translated as overlordship bede gives a list of seven kings who held imperium and aelle is first of them other information bede gives is that aelle was not a christian bede mentions a later king as first to enter kingdom of heaven second source is anglo saxon chronicle a collection of annals assembled in kingdom of wessex in c 890 during reign of alfred great chronicle has three entries for aelle from 477 to 491 as follows translations are michael swanton s anglo saxon chronicle p 14 from a text of chronicle except that frank m stenton s translation anglo saxon england pp 17 18 of part has been substituted to keep andredes leag and andredes cester in text for subsequent explanation 477 aelle and his 3 sons cymen and and cissa came to land of britain with 3 ships at place which is named cymen s shore and there killed many welsh and drove some to flight into wood called andredes leag 485 here aelle fought against welsh near margin of s burn 491 here aelle and cissa besieged andredes cester and killed all who lived in there there was not even one briton left there chronicle was put together about four hundred years after these events it is known that annalists used material from earlier chronicles as well as from oral sources such as sagas but there is no way to tell where these lines came from swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp xviii xix it should also be noted that terms british and welsh were used interchangeably as welsh is saxon word meaning foreigner and was applied to all native romano british of era swanton anglo saxon chronicle p 14 three of places named may be identified cymen s shore ora in original is believed to be located at what is now a series of rocks and ledges in english channel off selsey bill on south coast known as owers nima sailing directions english channel owers p 43 kelly anglo saxon charters vi charters of selsey p 3 p 12 and p 118 it has been suggested that ower is derived from word ora that is found only in placenames where jutish and west saxon dialects were in operation mainly in southern england gelling placenames in landscape pp 179 180 it is possible that stretch of low ground along coast from southampton to bognor was called ora shore and that district names were used by various coastal settlements cymens ora being one of them wood called andredes leag is weald which at that time was a forest extending from north west hampshire all through northern sussex andredes cester is thought to be saxon shore fort built by roman rebel in late 3rd century at pevensey castle just outside town blair roman britain p anglo saxon england pp 17 19 some believe andredes cester may have been an imperial stronghold somewhere else as henry of huntingdon described place as a fortified city and gave a very full account of siege which is inconsistent with geography of ancient pevensey and little archaeological evidence of sustained settlement there huntingdon ed greenway historia anglorum history of english people pp 92 93 also in his britannia william camden suggests that it could be kent camden britannia vol 2 ch 20 section 40

aelle once more under year 827 where he is listed as first of eight bretwaldas or britain rulers list consists of bede s original seven plus egbert of wessex swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp 60 61 there has been much scholarly debate over just what it meant to be a bretwalda and extent of aelle s actual power in southern england is an open question hunter blair an introduction pp 201 202 campbell et al anglo saxons pp 53 54 it is also noteworthy that there is a long gap between aelle and second king on bede s list ceawlin of wessex whose reign began in late 6th century this may indicate a period in which anglo saxon dominance was interrupted in some way earlier sources than bede exist which mention south saxons though they do not name aelle earliest reference is still quite late however at about 692 a charter of king s which styles him king of south saxons kirby earliest english kings pp 20 21 charters are documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and which would be witnessed by kings who had power to grant land they are one of key documentary sources for anglo saxon history but no original charters survive from earlier than 679 hunter blair roman britain pp 14 15 campbell et al anglo saxons pp 95 98 there are other early writers whose works can shed light on aelle s time though they do not mention either him or his kingdom gildas s description of state of britain in his time is useful for understanding ebb and flow of anglo saxon incursions procopius a byzantine historian writing not long after gildas adds to meagre sources on population movement by including a chapter on england in one of his works he records that peoples of britain he names english british and frisians were so numerous that they were migrating to kingdom of franks in great numbers every year hunter blair roman britain p 164 although this is probably a reference to britons emigrating to armorica to escape anglo saxons they subsequently gave their name to area they settled as brittany or la petite bretagne lit little britain evidence from place names in sussex early dates given in anglo saxon chronicle for colonization of sussex are supported by an analysis of place names of region strongest evidence comes from place names that end in ing such as worthing and angmering these are known to derive from an earlier form ending in hastings for example derives from which may mean followers or dependents of a person named although others suggest heavily romanised region may have had names of gallo roman origin derived from hunter blair roman britain pp 176 178 from west of selsey bill to east of pevensey can be found densest concentration of these names anywhere in britain there are a total of about forty five place names in sussex of this form but personal names either were not associated with these places or fell out of use this does not necessarily mean that saxons killed or drove out almost all of native population despite slaughter of britons reported in chronicle entry for 491 however it does imply that invasion was on a scale that left little space for british these lines of reasoning cannot prove dates given in chronicle much less details surrounding aelle himself but they do support idea of an early conquest and establishment of a settled kingdom hunter blair an introduction p 22 reign thumb 250px right a map of south eastern england showing places visited by aelle according to anglo saxon chronicle and area of modern dates given by anglo saxon chronicle are accurate to within half a century then aelle s reign lies in middle of anglo saxon expansion and prior to final conquest of britons it also seems consistent with dates given to assume that aelle s battles predate mons badonicus this in turn would explain long gap of fifty or more years in succession of bretwaldas if peace gained by britons did indeed hold till second half of 6th century it is not to be expected that an anglo saxon leader should have anything resembling overlordship of england during that time idea of a pause in anglo saxon advance is also supported by account in procopius of 6th century migration from britain to kingdom of franks procopius s account is consistent with what is known to be a contemporary colonization of armorica now brittany in france settlers appear to have been at least partly from dumnonia modern cornwall and area acquired regions known as and campbell et al anglo saxons p 22 it seems likely that something at that time was interrupting general flow of anglo saxons from continent to britain stenton anglo saxon england p 12 dates for aelle s battles are also reasonably consistent with what is known of events in kingdom of franks at that time clovis i united franks into a single kingdom during 480s and afterwards and franks ability to exercise power along southern coast of english channel may have diverted saxon adventurers to england rather than continent it is possible therefore that a historical king named aelle existed who arrived from continent in late 5th century and who conquered much of what is now sussex he may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of anglo saxon groups fighting for territory in britain at that time this may be origin of reputation that led bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern britain fletcher who s who p 17 battles listed in chronicle are compatible with a conquest of sussex from west to east against british resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years his area of military control may have extended as far as hampshire and north to upper thames valley but it certainly did not extend across all of england south of humber as bede asserts kirby earliest english kings p 55 historian guy halsall argues that as aelle immediately preceded late sixth century king ceawlin as bretwalda it is far more likely that aelle dates to mid sixth century and that chronicle has moved his dates back a century in order to provide a foundation myth for sussex which puts it chronologically and geographically between origins of kingdoms of kent and wessex halsall worlds of arthur p 71 death and burial aelle s death is not recorded by chronicle which gives no information about him or his sons or south saxons until 675 when south saxon king was baptized it has been conjectured that as saxon war leader aelle may have met his death in disastrous battle of mount badon when britons halted saxon expansion alec hamilton barr in saxon sussex arundel press bognor regis p 21 if aelle died within borders of his own kingdom then it may well have been that he was buried on highdown hill with his weapons and ornaments in usual mode of burial among south saxons highdown hill is traditional burial place of kings
