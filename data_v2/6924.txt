thumb upright 1 5 amputation of thigh by a railway surgery team c 1898 railway surgery was a branch of medical practice that flourished in 19th and early 20th centuries it concerned itself with medical requirements of railway companies depending on country it included some or all of general practice for railway staff trauma surgery as a result of accidents on railways occupational health and safety medico legal activities regarding compensation claims against company and occupational testing railway surgery was especially well developed in us with formal professional organisations and scholarly journals one of reasons for this was that us railways were particularly dangerous with a high number of casualties from crashes and an even higher number of workers hurt in industrial accidents another reason was that many us routes passed through areas with little or no existing medical infrastructure in europe railways were safer and infrastructure was generally already in place duties of railway surgeons in europe mostly involved investigations into accidents and resulting claims arising from passengers in india railways also faced a lack of existing medical infrastructure and like us had to build it from scratch indian railways still maintains a network of hospitals by middle of 20th century railway surgery had lost its separate identity growth of other industries and improving rail safety meant that railways no longer stood out as a leading cause of injuries likewise industrial medicine and health and safety became a concern for all industries there was no longer a need for an industry specific branch of medicine function thumb head on collision on bay of quinte railway 1892 primary purpose of railway surgeons was to attend to many injuries of staff and passengers on railways railway surgeons were also responsible for assessing medical claims against their companies and providing routine medical examinations of employees and applicants aldrich 2001 pp 255 256 270 273 railway surgeons were keen to establish their profession as a separate discipline with unique problems for instance textbook railway surgery published in 1899 spends a whole chapter on claim that crushing injuries from heavy moving equipment on railways are of a kind not found in other industries herrick pp 18 22 railway surgeons were generally not well paid while a chief surgeon or consultant surgeon might attract a good salary ordinary doctors working out on lines were not well rewarded traumatic injuries thumb left upright amputation at shoulder from textbook railway surgery herrick p 182 rail crashes were common in 19th century with many deaths and broken bones aldrich 2001 p 255 in europe majority of injuries were due to collisions hence passengers rather than employees formed bulk of injured for instance in britain accidents on line such as crushing between wagons and being struck by trains accidents suffered mostly by railway staff were noted as only third most common class of injury in 1887 bond p 294 in us railways were significantly more dangerous aldrich 2006 p 2 counterintuitively this led to staff injuries being by far greatest proportion in 1892 us railroads reported 28 000 injuries to workers compared to 3 200 for passengers most dangerous role was brakeman whose job included coupling and uncoupling wagons most frequent injury was brakeman being crushed between wagons while carrying out this task herrick p 6 one third of all railway injuries to staff were crushed hands or fingers herrick p 154 number of deaths and injuries grew rapidly as century progressed in us first death occurred in 1831 there were 234 deaths in 1853 year in which there were eleven major crashes aldrich 2006 p 2 in 1890 there were 6 335 deaths and 35 362 injuries friedman p 353 and by 1907 it had reached its peak at nearly 12 000 deaths aldrich 2006 pp 2 3 in england an early railway death was william huskisson member of parliament for liverpool killed during opening of liverpool and manchester railway in 1830 fletcher pp 6 7 in uk as a whole deaths and injuries grew much less dramatically than us there were 338 passenger deaths and injuries in 1855 and 435 in 1863 but at same time passenger numbers were increasing from about middle of this period rate of injury started to go down with improving safety 2 85 per million passengers in 1855 to 2 12 in 1863 fletcher p 63 a similar picture of low rates pertained in other european countries such as france prussia belgium and germany fletcher pp 49 50 many injuries required amputation for instance in 1880 baltimore and ohio railroad reported 184 crushed limbs including 85 fractures and fifteen amputations aldrich 2001 pp 276 277 need to perform amputations and other surgery may be why railway surgeons were named surgeon rather than doctor or physician while traumatic injuries were not most frequent ailment they had to deal with that was infectious diseases it did distinguish them from typical general practitioners other influences may have been comparison to ship s surgeons in age of sail and greater status and pay of surgeons aldrich 2001 pp 257 277 first aid kits and training were introduced at instigation of charles dickson of canadian st john ambulance association and backed by many railway surgeons one railway surgeon reported that his fatality rate following amputation more than halved after first aid was introduced there was some opposition to first aid through fear that it eroded professional status of doctors and that local contract railway surgeons would lose fees they would otherwise have accrued for work aldrich 2001 pp 285 287 however by world war i first aid kits on trains had become widespread aldrich 2001 pp 285 287 as twentieth century progressed rail safety improved dramatically so much so that by 1956 president of association of surgeons of chesapeake and ohio railway when asked if he saw a lot of accident cases at company hospital could reply yes i see a lot of accidents from highway and t he primary purpose of our group has all but passed out of picture gilmer pp 423 424 discipline of railway surgery had been folded into more general discipline of trauma surgery rutkow 1988 p 106 railway spine thumb upright john eric an important function of railway surgeons was to control costs of claims against their companies leading to conflicts of interest regarding treatment of their patients for instance chief surgeon of missouri pacific railroad proudly boasted that he kept claims in region of 14 35 dollars whereas claims against another railroad were nearly 600 dollars on average company medical staff were also expected to help achieve political aims with expert evidence in some cases chief surgeons were appointed purely on basis of their relationship to important politicians aldrich 2001 pp 266 270 fraudulent claims were a big concern for railway companies sometimes these were entirely contrived accidents by confidence tricksters more commonly however they were exaggerations of results of a genuine accident in 1906 railway surgeon willis king claimed that 96 of claimants were actually malingering dembe p 229 one common claim that was hotly debated by railway surgeons was condition known as railway spine over a hundred papers were published on subject in medical literature for period 1866 1890 dembe p 230 in this condition patient reports cerebral symptoms such as headache or loss of memory but there is no visible damage to spine it was first described by danish british surgeon john eric erichsen erichsen believed condition was physiological due to inflammation of spinal cord he compared it to meningitis which had similar symptoms and a similar cause others such as herbert w page surgeon to london and north western railway argued that it was psychological or else like arthur dean bevan 1918 president of american medical association outright faked railway surgeons were generally skeptical of condition and disliked implication that there was an injury peculiar to railways british surgeon edwin morris described term as most reprehensible morris p 48 bevan claimed to have cured one patient in ten minutes by standing him up and speaking to him forcefully in britain a number of major train crashes led to parliament passing an act which compelled rail companies to pay compensation to victims of accidents a large proportion of thousands of resulting claims were for railway spine in a five year period in 1870s english railway companies paid ps2 2 million 11 million in claims for railway spine brown p 424 following a similar law in germany 78 of claims in period 1871 1879 were for back injury claims for railway spine had subsided by 1900 from 1890 there were more claims for psychosomatic conditions such as hysteria and neurasthenia of george miller beard rather than physiological conditions such as railway spine even erichsen himself agreed that his original cases were actually traumatic neurasthenia however medical concern remained over these emotional damage claims regarding malingering and false claims health and safety railway companies pioneered disciplines of industrial medicine and occupational safety and health they were first organisations to give physical examinations to prospective employees motivation was partly to prevent fraudulent claims for pre existing conditions but also to improve rail safety baltimore and ohio railroad in 1884 was first to do this and had a particularly thorough examination they rejected 7 of applicants colour blindness tests were introduced for all employees in most us railway companies in 1880s because of need for correct signal recognition hearing tests were also implemented aldrich 2001 pp 273 274 colour blindness tests were a result of 1875 rail accident in sweden accident was investigated by holmgren who concluded that crash was a result of colour blindness of driver vingrys cole pp 369 375 holmgren created a test for use in transportation industry based on matching coloured skeins of yarn however holmgren s test was disliked by employees and there were many complaints of unfairness many companies preferred to test with lamps and flags but this led to conflict with railway surgeons who were concerned that non professionals were administering medical tests aldrich 2001 pp 273 275 holmgren s identification of colour blindness as cause of swedish crash has also been disputed mollon et al pp 178 194 railway companies increasingly improved health of their employees with preventative measures against disease vaccination schemes were introduced sanitation aboard trains became an issue as did quality of water supplies in 1920s cotton belt railroad succeeded in cutting hospitalization due to malaria of its workers from 21 5 to 0 2 they did this with a program that included suppressing mosquito populations preventative quinine treatment education and blood tests aldrich 2001 pp 279 286 world view railway surgery was particularly well developed in us in nineteenth and early twentieth centuries early american railroads passed through vast thinly populated regions with little possibility of finding local medical care at same time american railways were uniquely dangerous accident rates were far higher than european railways that together with difficulty in retaining skilled staff and risk of legal action by injured passengers resulted in american railway companies developing medical infrastructure and organisations to a degree that was not seen elsewhere aldrich 2006 pp 2 37 40 difference in risk between us and europe was largely driven by economics with their higher population densities and shorter routes european countries carried more freight per mile of track than in us to be profitable american railways needed to be built and run more cheaply this led to a host of safety issues american railways were poorly signalled compared to british railways in us there were no signal boxes instead signalling was largely responsibility of staff on board trains rails were laid on thin beds and badly secured leading to many derailments most tracks in europe were double tracks whereas in us they were usually single track poor control of single track rails led to many collisions there was no fencing on american tracks leading to many collisions with people and animals aldrich 2006 pp 10 20 certainly railway companies in other countries had railway surgeons in australia and canada railway surgeons were appointed during construction of major lines in remote regions british companies employed railway surgeons as consultants however only in us were railway surgeons employed in such large numbers and as such an organised discipline aldrich 2001 pp 254 255 india is perhaps closest to us in widespread use of railway surgeons which continues to this day but there they never seem to have organised themselves as a discipline with professional associations until 2000s united states thumb left sofie herzog only female railway surgeon ever appointed in us construction of railways in us began in 1828 becoming significant by 1840 by 1900 railways were largest us industry employing over a million far more than any other dangerous occupation aldrich 2006 p 2 many thousands of injuries occurred on these railroads throughout 19th century from 1850 until world war i american railroad companies developed their own medical arrangements in order to retain workers care for their passengers and injured third parties and avoid legal action earliest example of a company railroad surgeon was james p p 36 on baltimore and ohio railroad in 1834 but practice did not become widespread until 1850s by end of 1850s most companies had some kind of medical service legal claims for compensation in nineteenth century under tort laws were weaker than under twentieth century compensation laws railroad workers majority of injuries were not usually able to claim nor were trespassers on railway property passengers however were able to claim but payments were low and few victims got anything compared to modern standards nevertheless large number of crashes still led to a substantial number of legal actions friedman pp 355 367 these organisations pioneered industrial medical care and predated provision of medical care in manufacturing industries although some mining companies did so railway surgery was an important sector of medical profession by world war i railway organisations employed 14 000 doctors some 10 of us total railway surgery operated outside of american medical association ama which railway surgeons were not permitted to join many in medical profession opposed company doctors altogether on grounds of ethical conflict between needs of patient and needs of company ama also disliked practice of doctors bidding for local contracts with railway companies as this also introduced commercial pressures early medical arrangements on railroads were informal philadelphia reading railroad in particular had no formal contracts as late as 1870s this led to many disputes over payment by 1880s however all railroads had more formal arrangements they appointed a salaried chief surgeon and larger ones had salaried regional surgeons as well local doctors were paid according to fixed fees under contract in west lack of existing medical facilities led to employee funded hospitals first of these was set up by central pacific railroad around 1867 and modelled on us marine hospital service it was funded by a fixed deduction from all employees except chinese employees who were excluded from service a different kind of arrangement was mutual benefit society first of these was set up by baltimore ohio railroad in 1880 following great railroad strike of 1877 other railroads started to follow this model partly because of its effect of dampening industrial strife by world war i about 30 around two million of railroad workers were members aldrich 2001 pp 257 263 288 by 1896 there were twenty five railway hospitals run by thirteen different railway companies between them they treated 165 000 patients annually some of these hospitals became important teaching hospitals and generally they were all well financed and well equipped rutkow 2010 p 110 after world war i railway surgery began to decline as a separate discipline it lost its political influence in 1930s during great depression as industry including railroads reduced their involvement in health care for their workers rutkow 2002 p 624 at same time accident risks were steadily falling between 1890 and 1940 risks for passengers and workers fell by 90 and 80 respectively aldrich 2006 p 4 great britain thumb upright 0 7 thomas bond railway surgeon to great western railway first inter city railway passenger service in world was liverpool and manchester railway opened in 1830 mcintyre brown p 73 by 1860 uk had 10 000 miles of track and employed 180 000 people fletcher p 1 despite being pioneer british railways and european railways in general were much safer than american lines and consequently had fewer injuries although early injury rates were still high by modern standards aldrich 2006 pp 2 10 40 furthermore british lines did not pass through vast thinly populated regions medical infrastructure was already well developed in country railway companies still employed surgeons page at london and north western has already been mentioned another example is thomas bond who was retained as surgeon by both great eastern and great western railways however bond s function for railways was primarily as medico legal consultant regarding injury claims rather than practical surgery times obit he did however treat injured of an overturned train on which he was himself a passenger bond s last major work for railways was investigations in connection with slough rail accident of 1900 lancet obit bond also wrote a lengthy article on railway injuries for heath s dictionary of practical surgery there is a similar picture with james o fletcher surgeon to manchester sheffield and lincolnshire and great northern railways who wrote book railways in their medical aspects fletcher s book discusses numerous cases where he examined or treated patients post surgery and discusses medico legal issues at length however he does not cite a single example of his own or railway colleagues emergency surgery fletcher 1867 first dedicated accident and emergency a e service in britain was associated with building of manchester ship canal 1887 1894 rather than railways however civil engineer in charge thomas a walker had a background in railway construction around world particularly in canada where he had experience of employing british navvies he was also responsible for construction of district railway in london walker predicted correctly that there would be a high incidence of accidents during canal construction he had a chain of a e hospitals and first aid stations built and staffed along route to service 17 000 workers these were linked to construction sites by purpose built railways service was financed by compulsory worker contributions in total there were 3 000 injuries and 130 deaths during construction liz mcivor workers canals making of a nation first

service opened between mumbai and thane in 1853 srinivasan et al p xiv as in many parts of us there was no pre existing medical infrastructure medical facilities had to be entirely provided by railways themselves this along with other social needs led to establishment of railway colonies to house railway workers and their families for instance railway colony of jamalpur was established in 1862 bear p 5 by 1869 one railway surgeon and four assistants were employed at jamalpur by east indian railway company to cover 800 inhabitants of colony and over 200 miles of railway line this section had around 200 accidents per year to deal with but that was not their only duty they also acted as general practitioners for colony including attending at childbirth ind med gaz 4 p 58 by 1956 railways had established 80 hospitals and 426 dispensaries additionally mobile railway surgeons served railway staff posted along line madan p 228 this infrastructure of railway colonies medical staff and hospitals is still maintained by railways a major example of a railway colony is colony at kharagpur west bengal established 1898 1900 bear p 4 it serves one of largest railway workshops in india desai et al p 56 a major example of a railway hospital is southern railway headquarters hospital at chennai southern railway also maintain divisional hospitals such as divisional railway hospital

fairly late development in railway surgery period in us a hospital car came into use on several railways that could be coupled to a train to transport surgeon and staff to scene of an incident along with all required equipment it contained an operating theatre and a number of beds for patients in a recovery room hospital cars significantly improved outcomes for victims herrick pp 15 17 these mobile hospitals were forerunner of us army s mobile army surgical hospitals rutkow 2010 pp 110 111 indian railways introduced lifeline express hospital train in 1991 its purpose was to serve needs of rural poor in india in 2007 a modernised hospital train new lifeline express replaced it darpan p 376 september 2007 journals and organisations from 1880s onwards specific societies were formed for railway surgery first of these was surgical society of wabash formed in 1881 and organised by chief surgeon of wabash railroad inaugural meeting had only twenty two attendees with two papers presented this was soon followed by many other company centred organisations pennsylvania railroad organisation was prime mover in forming national association of railway surgeons nars in 1888 inaugural meeting had two hundred attendees and by 1891 membership had grown to nearly a thousand aldrich 2001 p 265 however nars was short lived dying out in 1920s as industrial expansion caused railways to no longer be unique in their medical needs nevertheless there were still practising railway surgeons for some time after this rutkow 2010 pp 112 113 also in 1891 journal railway age began a column on railway surgery including proceedings of nars editor r harvey reed was a charter member of nars but left to form more exclusive american academy of railway surgeons two organisations remained rivals until 1904 when they merged to form american association of railway surgeons aars railway surgeon was launched in 1894 and took over from railway age as official journal of nars but it also carried articles from american academy it was official journal of nars 1894 1897 of international association of railway surgeons 1897 1904 and of aars 1904 1929 changing names and affiliations of railway surgeon
