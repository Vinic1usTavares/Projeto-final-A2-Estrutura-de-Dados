ha k in xook also known as ruler 6 was an ajaw of piedras negras an ancient maya settlement in guatemala he ruled during late classic period from 767 780 ad ha k in xook was a son of itzam k an ahk ii and he ascended throne following death of his brother yo nal ahk iii ha k in xook s reign ended with either his death or his abdication in favor of his brother k inich yat ahk ii archaeologists and mayanists have not arrived at a clear consensus ha k in xook left behind several monuments including stelae at piedras negras and a stone fragment from el porvenir in addition a stone seat known as throne 1 and erected by k inich yat ahk ii records either death or abdication of ha k in xook biography reign of piedras negras thumb upright 1 7 throne 1 of piedras negras which details transfer of power from ha k in xook to his successor k inich yat ahk ii right 250px ha k in xook who has also been referred to as ruler 6 clancy 2009 pp 140 141 was likely son of itzam k an ahk ii based on a translation of stela 23 pitts 2011 pp 157 161 according to both simon martin and nikolai grube as well as scott johnson ha k in xook s name translates to water sun shark his name notably does not feature a turtle glyph a feature found in all previous rulers of piedras negras as well as his successor clancy 2009 p 141 he ascended throne on february 14 767 ad 9 16 16 0 4 7 k an 17 pop in long count following death of his brother yo nal ahk iii sharer traxler 2005 p 428 mayanist tatiana proskouriakoff had initially overlooked ha k in xook s reign as she mistakenly assigned title ruler 6 to a sajal or lesser maya leader of la mar based on a misreading of stela 16 not much is known about either ha k in xook or his predecessor yo nal ahk iii which led flora clancy to refer to both their reigns as shadowy clancy 2009 p 135 james l fitzsimmons argues that politically ha k in xook was a weak leader who like yo nal ahk iii before him erected only a handful of monuments and did not enforce his power beyond existing piedras negras hegemony fitzsimmons 2010 p 154 according to stone monuments that he did raise ha k in xook s reign was comparatively quiet as only notable event recorded was burial of a contemporary sajal at san ignacio belize el cayo according to zachary nathan nelson reign of ha k in xook was also relatively free from war as none of his extant stelae show representation of captives and records do not indicate any sort of bellicose action in region during his reign nelson 2005 p 35 death or abdication ha k in xook s reign ended on march 24 780 ad 9 17 9 5 11 10 19 sip but reason why it ended has been a topic of debate throne 1 when translated notes that ha k in xook abandoned transferred rulership yaktaaj ajawlel martin grube 2000 p 151 which american mayanist stephen d houston interprets to mean that he abdicated so that his brother k inich yat ahk ii could take throne mayanist david stuart also noted that wording on throne implies a more active event on ruler s part but that lose might be more neutral as far as an interpretation goes zender n d however yaktaaj ajawlel is same wording found on a monument zoomorph g at quirigua guatemala which details death of ajaw k ak tiliw chan yopaat in ad 785 martin grube 2000 p 222 this is possible evidence that rather than abdicating ha k in xook died in 780 ad and k inich yat ahk ii took up rule later adding to this hypothesis is testimony on throne 1 which notes that k inich yat ahk ii later remembered ha k in xook in some way and that new king may have even wept at ha k in xook s memory according to anthropologist oswaldo chinchilla clancy 2009 p 152 regardless k inich yat ahk ii took up throne on may 31 781 ad 9 17 10 9 4 1 k an 7 in almost a year after ha k in xook s reign officially ended despite this lengthy gap there is no evidence that anyone ruled piedras negras in interim monuments stelae ha k in xook raised up several stelae including stelae 13 18 and 23 stela 23 erected in ad 767 was first to be raised and it served as king s accession monument clancy 2009 pp 145 146 this stela details a utz passing of torch fitzsimmons 2009 p 152 ceremony for itzam k an ahk ii and when translated reads ruler 6 ha k in xook child of ruler 4 itzam k an ahk ii acceded to rulership seemingly proving that ha k in xook was indeed offspring of itzam k an ahk ii this stela originally featured carvings on all four of its sides but at some point in past it tipped over and crumbled mostly only stela s base and parts of a panel featuring feet of two individuals remain today erected in ad 771 stela 13 was ha k in xook s second monument and features only extant carving of ajaw according to o neil it captures essence of period ending celebration this tall stela retains elements of other niche stelae but it also shows innovations and differences from standard style o neil 2014 p 142 it depicts king dispersing incense similar to iconography found on piedras negras stelae 2 and 32 clancy has argued that iconography on stela revolves around three motifs divination quest and accession motif that had been introduced in iconography of piedras negras by k inich yo nal ahk iiis shown via act of ha k in xook dispersing incense stela also features ha k in xook wearing a headdress composed of three knots and forehead scrolls projecting water lily jaguar and flexible rectangular emblem made of a thick net and a jaguar pelt it has been postulated that this headdress was inspired by a similar headdress featured on stela 5 clancy 2009 p 143 clancy argues that this headdress is a representation of royal theme of quest due to its iconographic similarity to other stelae at piedras negras clancy 2009 p 144 not much remains of king s final monument stela 18 which was raised in ad 775 stela is heavily eroded but archaeologist sylvanus morley claimed that it expressed a calendar round date of 6 ahaw 13 k ayab corresponding to a long count date of 9 17 5 0 0 or dec 27 775 which is within ha k in xook s reign stelae 13 and 18 were discovered by teoberto maler in 1901 near pyramid o 13 stela 13 was possibly erected on a terrace reached by pyramid s main stairway and stela 18 lies in a row on plaza in front of aforementioned stairway weeks et al 2005 p 23 pyramid o 13 was most likely burial place for itzam k an ahk ii and was revered by ha k in xook yo nal ahk iii and k inich yat ahk ii as a dynastic shrine martin grube 2000 p 150 stela 23 unlike others was erected at very base of pyramid o 12 other as mentioned before throne 1 details either death or abdication of ha k in xook after fall of piedras negras was not constructed by king himself but rather by his successor k inich yat ahk smashed likely by piedras negras s enemies although it has since been reconstructed in addition to on site remains and relics an artifact known as el porvenir fragment was its name el porvenir and bears name of ha k in xook 2004 p 215 references
