battle of chongju 29 30 october 1950 took place during united nations command un offensive towards yalu river which followed north korean invasion of south korea at start of korean war battle was fought between australian forces from 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar and 17th tank brigade of korean people s army kpa for control of chongju north korea and surrounding area after detecting a strong kpa armoured force equipped with t 34 tanks and su 76 self propelled guns on a thickly wooded ridgeline astride line of advance australians launched a series of company attacks with american m4 sherman tanks and aircraft in support despite heavy resistance kpa were forced to withdraw and australians captured their objectives after three hours of fighting that evening kpa were strongly reinforced attacking australian southern flank manned by d company 3 rar and partially penetrating their perimeter after two hours of fighting assault was repulsed and kpa subsequently launched a furious assault against a company 3 rar on northern position which also failed amid heavy losses following day australians advanced to high ground overlooking chongju killing and capturing a number of kpa in skirmishes that afternoon town itself was cleared by remaining elements of 27th british commonwealth brigade without opposition kpa casualties during fighting were heavy while australian losses included their commanding officer lieutenant colonel charles green who was wounded in stomach by artillery fire after battle and died two days later background military situation korean war began early in morning of 25 june 1950 following surprise invasion of republic of korea by its northern neighbour communist democratic people s republic of korea dprk numerically superior and better equipped kpa crossed 38th parallel and rapidly advanced south easily overcoming inferior republic of korea army rok in response united nations un decided to intervene on behalf of south korea inviting member states to send forces to restore situation as a consequence american ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent south koreans from collapsing however they too were under strength and poorly equipped and by early august had been forced back by kpa to an enclave around pusan known as pusan perimeter key us allies britain canada and australia also committed forces although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in us under diplomatic pressure british agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in july and would later dispatch a second brigade as crisis worsened canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade although first battalion would not arrive until december 1950 a total of 21 un member states eventually contributed forces thumb right alt colour photograph of an airfield three single seat piston engined propeller aircraft sit in foreground as a number of personnel work on machines

sometimes significant part in un forces which was initially led by general douglas macarthur forces deployed in japan as part of british commonwealth occupation force formed basis of australian response with p 51 mustang fighter bombers from no 77 squadron raaf flying their first missions on 2 july while frigate and destroyer were also committed to naval operations during this time 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar which had been preparing to return to australia prior to outbreak of war remained in japan however on 26 july australian government announced that it would also commit understrength and poorly equipped infantry battalion to fighting following a period of preparation training and re equipment began immediately while hundreds of reinforcements were hastily recruited in australia as part of k force they soon began arriving to fill out battalion battalion s commanding officer lieutenant colonel floyd walsh was subsequently replaced by lieutenant colonel charles green an officer with extensive operational experience fighting japanese in new guinea during second world war green took over from walsh due to latter s perceived inexperience on 23 september 1950 3 rar embarked for korea concentrating at pusan on 28 september there it joined british 27th infantry brigade a garrison formation hurriedly committed from hong kong by british as situation deteriorated around pusan perimeter in late august to bolster us eighth army under lieutenant general walton walker commanded by brigadier basil coad brigade was renamed 27th british commonwealth brigade and consisted of 1st battalion argyll and sutherland highland regiment 1 ashr 1st battalion middlesex regiment 1 mr and 3 rar under strength two british battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks while brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment and had no integral artillery support for which it would rely entirely on americans until 16th field regiment royal new zealand artillery arrived in january 1951 as such with a strength of nearly 1 000 men addition of 3 rar gave brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing australians to work within a familiar organisational environment rather than being attached to a us formation also under command of brigade were a number of us army units including 155 mm howitzers from 90th field artillery battalion m4 sherman tanks from 89th tank battalion and a company from 72nd combat engineer battalion prelude opposing forces thumb left alt a map showing a peninsula with us forces moving

assault at inchon and breakout from pusan perimeter on southern tip of korean peninsula a steady advance began driving north koreans northwards towards 38th parallel 27th british commonwealth brigade was airlifted from taegu to kimpo airfield north of seoul on 5 october however its vehicles had to move by road driving and did not arrive until 9 october it was subsequently attached to us 1st cavalry division under command of major general hobart r gay on 16 october brigade took over from us 7th cavalry regiment as vanguard of un advance into north korea its axis intended to take it through kaesong kumchon and ri to sariwon then through to north korean capital of pyongyang although kpa had suffered heavily in preceding weeks they continued to resist strongly while a lack of accurate maps and narrowness of roads made rapid movement difficult for advancing un forces during this time 3 rar had a platoon of american m4 sherman tanks attached and a battery of field guns in direct support 27th british commonwealth brigade subsequently moved from kumchon with argylls capturing sariwon on 17 october killing 215 kpa and taking many prisoners for loss of one man killed and three wounded brigade then passed to command of us 24th infantry division on 21 october under overall command of major general john h church while us 1st cavalry division remained in pyongyang to complete its capture 27th british commonwealth brigade was subsequently ordered to seize chongju consequently brigade continued to advance north with little respite and on 22 october australians fought their first major action at yongju killing 150 kpa and capturing 239 of brigade s 800 prisoners for loss of seven men wounded intending to defeat kpa and bring war to a close un forces pushed towards yalu river on chinese border resistance continued to be met as brigade crossed chongchon river however and they now moved towards pakchon on 24 october macarthur had removed all restrictions on movement of his forces south of yalu river and prepared for final phase of un advance defying a directive of us joint chiefs of staff and risking chinese intervention in support of north korea on afternoon of 25 october a platoon from 3 rar was fired on by two companies of kpa as they crossed taeryong river to conduct a reconnaissance of west bank and although they were subsequently forced to withdraw australians took 10 prisoners with them acting as forward elements of brigade that evening green sent two companies across river to establish defensive positions and they subsequently broke up a frontal assault on their positions with mortars while kpa were in process of forming up sixty kpa supported by a t 34 tank then attacked forward australian companies at kujin early following morning resulting in australian losses of eight killed and 22 wounded however kpa suffered heavy casualties including over 100 killed and 350 captured and australians subsequently succeeded in defending bridgehead after kpa withdrew intelligence indicated that british and australians were facing kpa 17th tank brigade equipped with 20 tanks which was preparing a last line of defence at chongju away although kpa had suffered heavy casualties during previous fighting on taeryong river coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics advancing in shorter bounds and clearing high points en route among kpa dead was commanding officer of reconnaissance unit of 17th tank brigade lieutenant colonel kim in sik who was carrying a number of marked maps and documents see on 27 october middlesex continued advance and was involved in a sharp fight in hills west of river near village of ni with war considered all but over 27th british commonwealth brigade continued to pursue kpa towards chongju over next three days however advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from kpa infantry dug in with tanks and self propelled guns in support as they approached yalu river on manchurian border battle fighting around chongju 29 october 1950 3 rar took over as lead battalion of 27th british commonwealth brigade on 29 october from chongju at 10 00 a united states air force usaf lt 6g mosquito light spotter aircraft reported a large kpa formation consisting of a battalion sized force of 500 600 infantry supported by several tanks and at least two self propelled guns positioned on a thickly wooded ridgeline around chongju astride line of advance these positions were noted as being well constructed camouflaged and dug in with kpa occupying positions on forward slopes on both sides of road airstrikes were called in and eight sorties were undertaken by usaf f 80 shooting stars which rocketed strafed and kpa positions on ridgelines by 14 00 pilots claimed to have destroyed seven t 34 tanks and two su 76 self propelled guns as well as causing many casualties among kpa forces these claims proved optimistic however with only a few hours of daylight remaining green then planned a battalion attack with two companies forward under command of major walter brown d company was subsequently ordered to attack kpa positions on left of road followed by a company commanded by captain william chitts which would attack right meanwhile preparatory fire from 155 mm howitzers of 90th field artillery battalion and 3 inch mortars from support company 3 rar began to fall on kpa positions at 14 30 d company launched an assault against ridge south of road with two platoons of sherman tanks in support from d company us 89th tank battalion one tank platoon led attack followed by other carrying infantry from 10 platoon d company under command of lieutenant david mannett 10 platoon made a right flanking assault along road while 11 and 12 platoons attacked ridge frontally across paddy fields meeting stronger resistance than expected however attackers came under heavy fire and one of sherman tanks was knocked out by an armour piercing round that hit its turret however with american tanks providing vital close support to infantry 10 platoon successfully secured its objective allowing it to take kpa in enfilade and to provide fire support to assault thus despite strong opposition remainder of d company gained high ground by 16 30 with earlier airstrikes having been ineffective d company had been opposed by a number of t 34 tanks and su 76 self propelled guns however bulk of these were destroyed by shermans during assault another tank had been knocked out by well directed fire at point blank range from a bren light machine gun by private john stafford which caused armoured vehicle s auxiliary fuel tanks to ignite resulting in its ammunition exploding stafford was subsequently awarded us silver star for his bravery thumb right 220px a

this time without support of sherman tanks australians again came under heavy fire from kpa however they quickly overcame defenders and ridge was secured by 17 30 during fighting for northern position three kpa t 34 tanks dug in on ridgeline had been destroyed by australians at short range with m20 3 5 inch bazookas which now proved to be effective anti armour weapons despite difficulties experienced in their use at kujin several days before during day s fighting a total of 11 t 34 tanks and two su 76 self propelled guns had been destroyed by australian infantry and american tanks contrary to reports of their destruction by usaf airstrikes earlier in day expecting a counter attack green then ordered b company forward to occupy positions along road in between positions held by d and a companies while battalion headquarters moved in behind b company with c company held in reserve at rear with support company after conducting a limited resupply of forward companies australians hastily began to dig in kpa subsequently brought up substantial reinforcements and soon after dark they moved against d company on southern flank preparatory fire by artillery mortars and machine guns began at 19 00 following which a battalion sized ground assault was launched weight of counter attack fell on 10 platoon d company with mannett holding his platoon s fire until kpa were only away before engaging killing 32 men mannett was later awarded military cross for his leadership during initial assault and subsequent defence of ridgeline regardless kpa succeeded in overrunning parts of australian position before they were finally repulsed following counter attacks by 11 and 12 platoons during two hours of fierce fighting a number of kpa also succeeded in penetrating perimeter and they moved behind d company from where they fired on 3 rar headquarters contact was subsequently lost with d company and was not regained until kpa were forced to withdraw by headquarters company under captain ben o dowd which then cleared depth positions at 21 30 focus of kpa counter attack shifted to northern flank launching a heavy assault against a company this effort also failed however being repulsed as chitts called in indirect fire from support company mortars and american howitzers to within of forward australian positions kpa finally withdrew at 22 15 though a su 76 self propelled gun continued to fire sporadically into australian positions until 23 00 clearance of town 30 october 1950 following morning australians remained in position and at daybreak they found more than 150 kpa dead within 3 rar defensive position coad subsequently brought middlesex forward to secure his northern flank while 3 rar moved forward to talchon river taking up positions in hills overlooking chongju by 11 00 during advance australians had clashed with a number of kpa stragglers killing 12 and capturing 10 in skirmishes it became clear that organised resistance had ceased however with successful australian assault and subsequent defence of its objectives day before breaking kpa locally in north middlesex pushed forward to riverbank while in afternoon argylls forded river with two platoons of shermans meanwhile aerial reconnaissance reported presence of kpa tanks to west of chongju regardless that afternoon argylls encountered no further opposition as they entered and cleared ruined and burning town securing it by 17 00 brigade then moved into divisional reserve for us 24th infantry division with church ordering us 21st infantry regiment to take its place in lead in order to give british and australian infantry a much needed respite tanks and infantry of 21st infantry regiment subsequently moved through brigade 27th british commonwealth brigade adopted tight security that evening due to threat of kpa infiltration for added protection while in reserve 3 rar headquarters had been sited on reverse slope of a hill overlooking talchon river with rifle companies occupying forward slope of ridgeline to west and a spur line which thrust towards river bank around dusk at 18 10 on 30 october six high velocity shells likely from a kpa self propelled gun or tank hit area five of shells landed on forward slope while sixth cleared crest and detonated to rear of c company position after hitting a tree in his tent on a stretcher after 36
