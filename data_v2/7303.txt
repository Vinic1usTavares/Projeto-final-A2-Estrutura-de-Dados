through overlong arrangements of inconsequential songs from annoyingly vocoder treated revolver early to throwaway dance cut celebration at end will leave listeners wondering why so many substantial hits were given only a nod if anything at all a review by kevin taft in online website edge on net was overall negative taft noticed that madonna s vocals were altered and mixed so much that it sounded disembodied and did not match singer s lips he was shocked to find that audio cds also contained badly mixed songs reviewer explained that choice to have backing track turned down so low doesn t help much either in fact it makes it sound as if madonna is on a cabaret stage with a five piece band for six months it took madge to edit her concert one would wish she got her vocals to match her lips however taft commended overall show and technical brilliance accompanying it mastering issues in an online chat with website reddit madonna addressed concerns regarding mastering issues with dvd and blu ray in europe saying that she was horrified about glitches and her record label was solving it she concluded by saying that i spent 6 months editing and doing sound mix for dvd last thing i want to hear is that fans aren t getting fruits of my labor on september 23 2013 interscope records announced that they were recalling all blu ray discs issued in us after hearing continuous reports
