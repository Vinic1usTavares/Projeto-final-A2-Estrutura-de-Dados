feige russo brothers paul bettany daniel bruhl robert downey jr chris evans tom holland paul rudd elizabeth olsen jeremy renner anthony mackie sebastian stan and emily vancamp at london premiere chris evans as steve rogers captain america leader of a faction of avengers against regulation a world war ii veteran who was enhanced to peak of human physicality and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in modern world director anthony russo described captain america s character arc in film as taking him from most ra ra company man to someone who is a somewhat willing propagandist to an insurgent at end of film unlike comics civil war film was never going to kill rogers as directors thought that was an easy ending more difficult and more interesting place to leave a family fight is can these important relationships ever be repaired is this family broken permanently evans training regimen to get in shape for role included weight lifting which consisted of classic bodyweight and bodybuilding stuff gymnastics and while staying away from cardio based exercises along with a high protein diet his costume in film received subtle changes to all details and cut as well as its color becoming a combination of stealth suit from winter soldier and avengers age of ultron suit robert downey jr as tony stark iron man leader of a faction of avengers in support of regulation a self described genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention anthony russo said that stark s egomania allowed writers to bring him to a point in his life where he was willing to submit to an authority where he felt it was right thing to do joe russo added that because of visions stark saw in age of ultron he now has a guilt complex which drives him to make very specific decisions calling his emotional arc very complicated downey s personal trainer eric oram stated that trick to pitting rogers against stark is to show iron man using minimum force necessary to win fight marvel initially wanted downey s part to be smaller but downey wanted stark to have a more substantial role in film s plot variety noted that downey would receive 40 million plus backend for his participation as well as an additional payout if film outperformed winter soldier as marvel would attribute that success to downey s presence scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff black widow an avenger allied with stark formerly a highly trained s h i e l d spy anthony russo noted her torn allegiances in film saying her head is with tony s side of things but her heart is with cap in a lot of ways johansson added that romanoff is looking to strategize her position putting herself in a place where she is able to let powers that be fight it out in order for her to have a better perspective of what s really going on describing her character s situation after events of avengers age of ultron johansson said i think that widow s past will always haunt her she s trying to move forward she s trying to pick up pieces of her life she also said that romanoff is at a point in her life where she can make choices herself without having others have a hand in decision process on continuation of relationship between romanoff and rogers from winter soldier joe russo said that they wanted to test it by having romanoff point out to rogers mistakes team have made and convince him that it might not be as black and white as he sees it and that avengers must find a way to work within system so that they aren t disbanded sebastian stan as bucky barnes winter soldier a physically enhanced brainwashed assassin allied with rogers his best friend who reemerged after being thought to be killed in action during world war ii this portrayal is an amalgam of barnes and winter soldier with stan saying here s guy when you merge two this is what came out to me he s never really going to be bucky barnes again there s going to be recognizable things about him but his path through experiences of winter soldier is always going to be there haunting him because of this character has more lines in film than in winter soldier anthony mackie as sam wilson falcon an avenger allied with rogers a former trained by military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack wilson is aided by a robotic drone named redwing discussing relationship between wilson and rogers mackie said with falcon and cap what s so great is there s a mutual respect there s a soldier respect what s great about captain america civil war is you get to see their relationship grow adding he respects and admires cap because cap earned his rank as opposed to sitting in an office and just delegating orders joe russo stated that inclusion of barnes to rogers side forces wilson to question dynamic and relationship he has with rogers going forward don cheadle as james rhodey rhodes war machine a close personal friend of tony stark s and an avenger allied with stark an officer in u s air force who operates war machine armor cheadle called rhodes appearance in film a bit more intense and pivotal compared to his previous appearances jeremy renner as clint barton hawkeye a master archer allied with rogers a retired avenger and s h i e l d agent on barton s reasons for joining rogers side renner said cap was first guy who called let s just get job done so i can get home to family along with feeling an obligation to side with scarlet witch since her brother pietro maximoff quicksilver sacrificed himself to save barton in avengers age of ultron on how he and barton fit into marvel cinematic universe renner said i m happy to be ensemble i m not scratching or clawing to do a solo movie by any means i think barton s a utility guy that can bounce around into other people s universes a little bit chadwick boseman as t challa black panther prince of african nation of wakanda allied with stark who gains enhanced strength by ingesting heart shaped herb producer kevin feige explained that character was included because we needed a third party we needed fresh eyes who wasn t embedded with avengers and who has a very different point of view than either tony or steve t challa is in beginning phases of taking on black panther mantle and appears in more than a cameo with a full arc and character journey with his own conflict and his own people that he s looking out for boseman did not audition for role instead having a discussion about what marvel wanted to do and how i saw it and what i wanted to do t challa is torn between needing to live up to traditions and legacy of his father and wakanda and how things need to happen in present boseman developed wakandan accent himself and used it during entire production whether he was on camera or not while wakandan language was based on xhosa language which boseman was taught by john kani who plays t challa s father t chaka black panther costume is a combination of a practical costume and visual effects featuring a mesh weave similar to chainmail costume designer makovsky called black panther costume difficult since you needed sort of a feline body but it s hard and practical at same time you needed a feeling of some sort of ethnicity in there but of a world wakanda we weren t really creating yet so you didn t want to go too far and say too much about that world additionally makovsky felt creating t challa s royal look was a bit of a challenge avoiding african robes after learning actual african royalty are generally educated in west and get dressed in savile row boseman has a five picture deal with marvel paul bettany as vision an android and avenger allied with stark created using artificial intelligence j a r v i s ultron and mind stone because vision was only created in previous film age of ultron bettany said you see my character get born he must be both omnipotent and yet totally naive at same time and experiencing world in real time and his place in it is he going to be a force of good or a force of evil bettany also said he was interested in exploring what it means to be human and what love is with character as only way one can guarantee one s loyalty is love this is exhibited in connection vision begins to form with wanda maximoff with bettany commenting they both have these new burgeoning powers that they don t understand i think he s worried that they re both dangerous so he feels this real connection with her as vision has ability to create a projected disguise he chooses to dress similarly to howard stark s attache edwin jarvis elizabeth olsen as wanda maximoff scarlet witch an avenger allied with rogers she can engage in hypnosis and telekinesis according to olsen character is coming into her own and starting to understand and have conflict with how she wants to use her abilities as such maximoff s costume was relatively casual and more clothes based than superhero based according to makovsky since russos believed maximoff was not a full fledged avenger yet when asked about relationship between her character and vision compared to comics olsen said you learn a little bit more about what connects scarlet and vision in this film and i think there s some really sweet moments between paul and i and it s more about how they relate to one another and their similarities just based on their superpowers paul rudd as scott lang ant man a former petty criminal allied with rogers he acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength rudd s suit is streamlined and more high tech than one seen in ant man ant man director peyton reed had discussed character and way that ant man production had shot certain sequences with russo brothers saying as we were doing ant man and we were in post and they were getting ready to head out to atlanta to do civil war we had a lot of conversations it s important because there s this continuity that has to happen in this universe on decision to have lang grow in size to become giant man in airport battle feige said it was just a great idea to turn tide of battle in a huge shocking unexpected way we have a lot of ideas for ant man and wasp none of which are contingent upon revealing giant man so we thought this would be fun unbelievable unexpected way to do that anthony russo added that transformation was continuation of lang s character arc from ant man saying he s just really impressed with captain america he just wants to deliver and he figures out a way to deliver where he might actually tear himself in half but he s willing to do it and it works emily vancamp as sharon carter a former agent of s h i e l d and peggy carter s niece who now works for cia and supports rogers vancamp stated that her character sides with rogers because they both have similar moral compasses on a potential relationship between rogers and carter as in comics evans said he s certainly open to it sharon is obviously relevant but we don t have to tie it up in one movie so they have time vancamp added we get to explore i can t say we are going to that extent of it but they are certainly getting to know each other tom holland as peter parker spider man a teenager allied with stark he received spider like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider feige said that parker would be torn between superhero ideologies saying does he want to be like these other characters does he want nothing to do with these other characters how does that impact his experience being this grounded but super powerful hero those are all things that stan lee and steve ditko played with in first 10 years of his comics and that now we can play with for first time in a movie on aligning with stark anthony russo said that despite entering conflict after two factions have formed and not having much political investment parker s choice comes from a very personal relationship he develops with stark russos hoped to take a very logical and realistic and naturalistic approach to character compared to previous film portrayals anthony russo added that character s introduction had to fit that specific tonal stylistic world of mcu as well as tone established by directors in winter soldier saying it s a little more grounded and a little more hard core contemporary that was coloring our choices a lot with parker on spider man suit joe russo described it as a slightly more traditional steve ditko influenced suit and that film would explore way suit operates particularly mechanical eyes holland chose not to read whole civil war script in order to avoid potentially leaking plot information publicly he is signed on for at least three films not including his civil war appearance holland later expanded saying he was signed for three spider man movies and three solo movies frank grillo as brock rumlow crossbones former commander of s h i e l d s counter terrorism s t r i k e team who was revealed to be an agent of hydra on returning to character grillo said he s a badass he is just vicious i like idea that it s no holds barred i was 15 pounds bigger when i did cap 2 and i ll put another 15 pounds on to do cap 3 however he cautioned that this movie is such a big movie with a lot of people in it so you don t get as much of time that you d like to have grillo stated that rumlow s main objective in film is to seek revenge whatever rumlow was feeling as far as being torn between which side he should be on which i think he was is gone now william hurt as thaddeus thunderbolt ross united states secretary of state and former u s army general dedicated to capturing hulk hurt on returning to mcu after appearing in incredible hulk said i don t think it s a reprise i think it s a new iteration completely adding what writers have done is they ve taken a character and made a new version a more modernized style joe russo added that ross was perfect character to use because he has a fanatical anti superhero point of view and has become much and more political and has put himself in a position of power not unlike a colin powell he s cornering avengers politically now he s out maneuvering them joe also added that ross was included because russos felt it was important to make incredible hulk relevant again within mcu since it may have been forgotten about a little bit daniel bruhl as helmut zemo a colonel turned terrorist who is obsessed with defeating avengers zemo who goes by multiple names in film does not wear his signature mask from comics bruhl said version appearing in film is loosely connected to character from comics and that was a reason he liked marvel as some of characters and things they re dealing with always reference to current events so my character is from a different area than you would think feige described character as very much a product of marvel cinematic universe and all that has occurred within that universe up to this point while anthony russo called him an everyman his approach was i ve seen these guys fight enough to know i can t win but what i can do is figure out ways to undermine them he s emotionally driven and he finds a weak spot bruhl who was cast due to his german accent did not feel role was a stereotype saying it s not a guy who s mean and sinister but he s actually very clever a very smart guy who does everything out of a very understandable reason and motivation bruhl also stated that zemo may re appear in future mcu films with moore adding that while zemo has a purpose in this film it is more to set up a future film additionally john slattery and kerry condon reprise their roles as howard stark and voice of f r i d a y from previous mcu films martin freeman is introduced as everett k ross a member of cia s joint counter terrorism center and a character associated with black panther in comics freeman described ross as someone who works for american government and works in conjunction with superheroes and certain agencies that help to tame superheroes power feige added that ross would appear briefly in film with intent being to expand on character s role in future films marisa tomei appears as may parker peter parker s aunt john kani appears as t chaka father of t challa and ruler of wakanda hope davis appears as maria stark tony stark s mother gene farber appears as vasily karpov hydra official who oversaw winter soldier program and florence portrays ayo a member of t challa s dora alfre woodard who portrays mariah dillard in mcu tv series luke cage briefly appears in film as miriam sharpe mother of an american citizen killed in battle of sokovia woodard was suggested for role by downey before marvel studios learned of her casting in luke cage jim rash appears as a faculty member at mit while stan lee makes a cameo appearance as a fedex deliveryman and co director joe russo cameos as theo broussard a psychiatrist murdered by zemo damion poitier who appeared as thanos in avengers before josh brolin was cast in that role for subsequent films appears as one of crossbones mercenaries production development in march 2014 anthony and joe russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third captain america film along with chris evans as captain america kevin feige as producer and christopher markus and stephen mcfeely as screenwriters markus and mcfeely had been working on screenplay since late 2013 while russo brothers began work in february 2014 re hiring of directors three months before release of captain america winter soldier came as a result of marvel executives being impressed with test screenings of that film evans earned 15 million for film in an april 2014 interview joe russo described project as a continuation of story from captain america winter soldier what s nice about film is that it s a two parter there s a journey that winter soldier goes on that isn t complete yet that month marvel announced a release date of may 6 2016 and trent opaloch who was cinematographer on winter soldier said he would return for sequel in july markus and mcfeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for film on which principal photography was expected to begin in april 2015 following month they stated that they were looking to make tone of film an amalgam of first avenger and winter soldier with russos likening it to a psychological thriller citing seven fargo and godfather as influences along with westerns and brian de palma s films russos also stated that a good portion of civil war is actually funnier than winter soldier with a more comedic tone and lighter moments throughout in august 2014 russos stated that film would be set a couple years after winter soldier and would continue to focus on steve rogers relationship with bucky barnes as well as political themes related to captain america anthony stated character was invented for an explicitly political purpose so it s hard to get away from that nature russos also said that they would be bringing some new elements to table that will give us a twist on winter soldier and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in atlanta they described themselves as ecstatic with a first draft of screenplay submitted by markus and mcfeely and also stated that film s title would be announced in a month or so at most and that concept and title for film came from feige who had it for a while in september joe expanded by saying film would have another big idea that alters universe as a whole in some way similar to s h i e l d falling in winter soldier rest of film such as characters story and tone would be left open to russos and writers interpretations pre production by october 2014 robert downey jr had entered final negotiations to reprise his role as tony stark iron man in film downey was added in order for film to adapt 2006 07 civil war comic book storyline written by mark millar which pitted iron man against captain america at end of month it was confirmed that sebastian stan would return as bucky barnes winter soldier a few days later marvel revealed that film would be titled captain america civil war confirming downey s appearance and announcing that chadwick boseman would appear in film as black panther ahead of his own solo film feige also confirmed that film would be first in mcu s phase three slate of films anthony russo stated that adapting civil war storyline was not always intended storyline and direction for film when brothers initially signed on to return as directors markus expanded on this saying original concept for a third captain america film never got to draft with feige at some point telling writing team to begin adapting civil war around their original ideas mcfeely also added that despite shift in direction for film central theme even way zemo is operating are from that early iteration russos revealed that had negotiations with downey to appear in film failed they would have used madbomb storyline from captain america comics which was eventually used as a plot point in first season of agent carter tv series premise for film would have centered on zemo detonating madbomb which would turn hordes of people into berserkers to present a physical threat to captain america while still pitting heroes against each other as some would be zombified due to madbomb to satisfy an emotional component for film mcfeely said that idea of basing a film on civil war had been on and off table for a while at marvel studios explaining it s a challenge to do it and make sure that all characters that we ve established and everyone s established in mcu are serviced and sound correct because there s a difference between characters in civil war which was written in 2006 2007 mcu doesn t exist when it was written there isn t a robert downey jr or chris evans who has helped create character s so we need to make sure that that template gets adjusted joe russo added that essence of civil war was used such as concept of registration notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary being applicable anthony russo expanded in a lot of ways superhero registration can be a political issue and we didn t want conflict of movie to solely exist on that level we wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone s relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated that s what relationship between steve and bucky allowed us to do to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or other executive producer nate moore added that it felt like it was kind of right time to adapt civil war given avengers plus many of phase two films thor dark world winter soldier and avengers age of ultron all dealt with world ending experiences we felt like we had to tell next step in that story which is what is world s reaction in november 2014 daniel bruhl joined cast in an unspecified role while anthony mackie and frank grillo were confirmed to return as sam wilson falcon and brock rumlow crossbones respectively following november 2014 hacking of sony pictures computers emails between sony pictures entertainment co chairman amy pascal and president doug were released stating that marvel wanted to include spider man whose film rights are licensed to sony in film but talks between studios concerning this were believed to have broken down however in february 2015 sony pictures and marvel studios reached a licensing deal for use of spider man in an mcu film and reports indicated that character would indeed appear in civil war russos stated they were lobbying for months to include character in film in january 2015 mackie revealed that in addition to atlanta filming locations would include puerto rico and berlin while russo brothers confirmed that scarlett johansson would return in film as natasha romanoff black widow editor jeffrey ford who worked on winter soldier also signed on for civil war in march 2015 jeremy renner was revealed to be reprising his role as clint barton hawkeye next month it was revealed that film would be converted to 3d in post production and that bruhl would be playing helmut zemo additionally elizabeth olsen revealed she would reprise her role in film as wanda maximoff scarlet witch filming thumb left film set for captain america civil war in downtown atlanta principal photography began on april 27 2015 in fayette county georgia at pinewood atlanta studios under working title sputnik other filming locations in atlanta metropolitan area included buckhead district of atlanta peachtree christian church in midtown atlanta downtown atlanta including an area near philips arena known as gulch which served as market in lagos norcross georgia porsche s headquarters in atlanta at atlanta which served as avengers headquarters in film and atlanta civic center which served as institute for infectious diseases laboratory in lagos latter s interiors doubled as mit and a third part was used for a berlin location trent opaloch served as director of photography while chad david leitch and spiro were second unit directors in early may marvel announced that martin freeman was cast in an unspecified role while also reprising roles in film would be paul bettany as vision don cheadle as james rhodes war machine paul rudd as scott lang ant man emily vancamp as sharon carter and william hurt as thaddeus thunderbolt ross samuel l jackson who appeared as nick fury in two previous captain america films said he was surprised to discover that he would not be in captain america civil war after russo brothers told him he was moore stated that fury was not included because he didn t add anything to civil war story they were telling while markus stated that they did not want him to choose any particular side because that s not his place in universe on each of character s ties to plot anthony russo said that each character was examined on a personal level to see how they would respond to idea of registration on portrayal of each character joe russo said that he and his brother had strong emotional and psychological connection s to these characters as children adding we want to reach into that and understand what motivated you to love character that s what we try to bring out in characters now he also mentioned that they were trying to honor feeling of naturalism and to honor feeling of reality with film after reveal of film s full cast many outlets and fans began referring to film as avengers 2 5 given variety and ensemble nature of cast usually reserved for avengers films and fact that film no longer felt like a captain america centric one as with winter soldier in response to this feige said what s fun about civil war though is as you know from comics it s a very simple story and it really has to be to accommodate that many players it s very much a captain america movie and it s very much a sequel to winter soldier in ways i don t think people will expect it s a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that i don t think becomes overwhelming feige also revealed that hope van dyne wasp was in an original draft of film after receiving wasp costume at end of ant man but was cut because there are so many characters in civil war that we didn t want to do her a disservice saying marvel was saving character for a better environment to reveal van dyne in wasp costume for first time and see her dynamic with scott lang in a way it could play out at end of may russo brothers along with feige and pascal held a screen test in atlanta for six teenage actors that were being eyed for role of peter parker spider man with actors testing against downey and evans for chemistry tom holland was cast as character next month to also appear in a solo film russos were pretty vocal about who we wanted for part pushing to cast an actor close to age of peter parker in comics in order to differentiate from previous portrayals they also praised holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background at time marvel did not confirm his involvement in civil war due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly russos discussed this saying that various business deals and agreements stemming from sharing of character rights such as on a promotional and commercial level were always lagging slightly behind how we were using character we were always in danger of upsetting deal there were still sensitive issues going on between two studios that they needed to agree on holland was confirmed to appear in film in july 2015 by jonathan m goldstein one of writers of solo spider man film and later by entertainment weekly from a set visit jon watts director of spider man homecoming was on set for filming of spider man s scenes in order to see what they were doing with it and that informed where we eventually took it and provide ideas about this and that such as what parker s wardrobe and bedroom should look like to make sure we were all on same page so that homecoming transitions seamlessly with theirs anthony russo stated that despite marvel telling them to have a plan b should deal with sony fail russos never created one because it was very important to us to reintroduce spider man in film adding we only have envisioned movie with spider man by end of june filming reached halfway mark with production moving to germany in early august filming locations in germany included olympic stadium in berlin and leipzig halle airport in additional filming also took place in puerto rico and norway and was scheduled to in iceland principal photography wrapped on august 22 2015 captain america civil war was first film to use imax s digital 2d cameras made in partnership with arri which was a customized version of arri alexa 65 according to joe russo approximately fifteen minutes of film sequence where two factions fight at leipzig halle airport which was described as having incredible scale to it and referred to by directors as splash panel were shot with cameras opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre production to shoot entire film with alexa 65 cameras however because of how close it was to start of shooting as well as idea being such a large scale undertaking it was decided to only use them for airport sequence with rest of film being shot on arri alexa xt digital cameras for airport sequence opaloch rigged alexa 65s to a technocrane a steadicam a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots which had its own dedicated team operating it because of amount of resolution alexa 65s offered opaloch chose to use medium close ups instead of close ups and for his wide shots hold shot a bit longer maybe with a slight camera move that allows viewer to take it all in post production in september 2015 mark ruffalo who plays bruce banner hulk in mcu films stated that his character was originally in civil war script but was removed due to end of age of ultron as marvel did not want to reveal where he is and why in this film markus added that as soon as hulk joined a side fight would be quickly over saying you ve got to kind of choose your roster of characters depending on what kind of fight you want to have he later explained that he contemplated having hulk appear at very end of film but decided against it feeling that he was over stuffing film with characters adding hulk has clearly gone somewhere at end of age of ultron and that s a story don t blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie additionally ross alter ego red hulk was also considered for inclusion but russos felt that part of character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in already crowded film they felt that ross was there sort of as government s agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to mix spider man s iron spider suit was also considered that november joe russo stated that theme of film was betrayal calling it extremely emotional film hinges on that emotion and on a very personal level we didn t want it to become about politics and people arguing about platitudes third act is built around a very personal moment between captain america and iron man russos spent a great deal of time with markus mcfeely and moore to ensure each character s emotional arc tracked through entire film correctly though realized that at some point you have to sacrifice logic for expediency speaking about post production process in january 2016 russo brothers said this has been easiest post process we ve ever had on a film we re very happy with how movie was everyone is very happy with where movie was for us tricky thing is effects because it s a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in film effects are on a much larger scale than work we did on winter soldier that s part that becomes really difficult because you don t have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards so everyone starts killing themselves at this point we ll be done with movie in two and a half months they also stated that film would be doing a few reshoots in mid to late january in february freeman s character was revealed to be everett k ross and gwyneth paltrow was reported to have joined film for january reshoots reprising her role as pepper potts however in april 2016 it was revealed that paltrow does not appear in film with anthony russo explaining that paltrow s contract with marvel had ended after iron man 3 and we decided early on that we could make pepper s break up with tony stark have an emotional impact without actually having a scene with her on march 16 2016 russos stated film was about a week and a half away from completion with joe adding that film would have a post credits scene with possibility for two or three total film was completed on april 4 2016 later in april alfre woodard and jim rash were revealed to be cast in film while feige explained that black panther director ryan contributed some dialogue for black panther in several scenes during reshoots at film s premiere it was revealed that marisa tomei appears in film as may parker peter parker s aunt visual effects thumb original top and bottom shots of fight scene at leipzig halle airport nearly 20 visual effects studios worked on captain america civil war including industrial light magic ilm lola vfx method studios luma pictures dneg image engine trixter cinesite and third floor amongst others lola vfx de aged downey jr in a scene that involved a younger holographic version of himself lola vfx s visual effects supervisor trent claus said in this case we analyzed footage of mr downey at approximate age that we wanted to target which was around time of film less than zero when downey was in his early 20s he also noted difficulty of scene due to it being close to 4 000 frames and fact that downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times lola also worked on visual effects for vision third floor extensively previsualized film including fight scene at leipzig halle airport gerardo ramirez previs and supervisor for third floor said we visualized most of major scenes in film some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best early edits were a combination of storyboards previs and stunt performance clips stunts would choreograph hand to hand action while storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for big action scenes that involved many digital characters method studios which worked on 440 shots was responsible for helicopter sequence in middle of film and climatic fight between iron man bucky and captain america original intent for helicopter sequence was to place scene next to paul lobe haus where bundestag meets however location was not allowed to be shown in film resulting in method needing to create a full cgi background for climatic fight one of challenges for method was getting color of iron man s suit correct opting to go with a more classic iron man look versus really glossy car paint look that iron man had in previous avengers films ilm was primarily responsible for visual effects during large scale fight sequence at airport along with creating digital assets for all of characters vfx supervisor russell earl stated that 20 minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining we ultimately ended up replacing 99 of everything that was shot with actors being lifted from background originally both spider man and black panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them luma pictures who also worked on winter soldier was assigned with completing shots of bucky s arm and his metal brainwashing chair they also worked on bucky s escape from task force lobby and designed iron man s new hybrid nanotechnology armor which was an homage to character s bleeding edge armor from comics their work totaled approximately 200 shots design firm sarofsky once again worked on film s main on end title sequence having done same for winter soldier sequence used muted and mottled burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey colors which were stark contrasts to sequences for winter soldier and first avenger latter created by method design which were a minimalist graphic approach reducing key players to silhouettes and paring palette down to three colors and vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life enticing viewer to join fray respectively creative director erin sarofsky noted one of challenges for civil wars sequence was to make it feel like a captain america title sequence and not an avengers sequence given number of characters in film music henry jackman returned from winter soldier to score sequel he found movie to be tonally different from previous one which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score this culminates in final fight between captain america winter soldier and iron man music for which jackman described as somewhat operatic and almost classical in its style though jackman reprised and developed his themes for captain america and winter soldier from previous film and introduced motifs for new characters spider man black panther and zemo he was wary of pushing audience to one side of central conflict or other by using character specific music jackman composed a new main theme for film to represent civil war a generic theme to balance everything out toward which all characters can gravitate it wrapped them all up and it helped to bind movie together rather than do endless disparate themes jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever mystery surrounding zemo s plan is explored this was inspired by works of jerry goldsmith score was released on a soundtrack album by hollywood records on may 6 2016 marketing promotion in early july 2015 marvel began a viral marketing campaign for ant man featuring leslie bibb reprising her role from iron man films as journalist christine everhart reporting for faux news program whih newsfront in one program everhart discusses events leading to captain america civil war post credits scene for ant man featured footage shot by russo brothers for captain america civil war showing wilson and rogers with barnes in their custody and unable to contact stark because of accords wilson mentions that he know s a guy implying lang feige explained that when post credit sequence appears in civil war it may appear with different takes different angles stan said scene was shot in early may 2015 and would appear in middle of civil war first footage of film debuted in august 2015 at d23 expo additional footage was shown in september 2015 at asia pop comic convention footage shown at d23 expo and 2015 asia pop comic convention received an overwhelmingly positive response from audiences first trailer for film debuted on jimmy kimmel live on november 25 2015 and within hours became number one trending topic on twitter trailer was viewed 61 million times in first 24 hours of release surpassing 34 million views of avengers age of in 2014 scott mendelson of forbes called trailer a and noted that early debut ahead of release of star wars force awakens was a good show on behalf of disney as it was a way to not get lost amid 8 000 other trailers debuting with star wars mendelson also noted that based on trailer s content film was being sold as captain america 3 as opposed to avengers 2 5 or iron man 4 which could help keep film s box office expectations in check on february 4 2016 marvel released their own version of facebook video for captain america video mirrors those created by facebook for users to celebrate anniversary of facebook s founding and features images of captain america s friends winter soldier thor falcon and hawkeye video concludes with an image of captain america and iron man being torn in half jennifer of hollywood reporter called video timely and its contents especially relevant considering storyline of civil war three days later a teaser debuted during super bowl 50 which received most social media activity out of all film trailers released that day anthony breznican of entertainment weekly said footage actually feels a little more like a teaser than a full trailer since it shows some new shots but really doesn t reveal much more about story additionally he felt chanting unseen voices calling out united we stand and divided we fall had a football stadium vibe complimenting it appearing during super bowl mendelson added that marvel did not need to follow model used for winter soldier during super bowl xlviii of showing a longer trailer after teaser since civil war was frankly a higher profile sequel overall mendelson felt spot was only a little less low key and small er scale as trailer that debuted in november 2015 and sold real world aspect with character drama and mostly real world action between would be superheroes four days later on valentine s day facebook campaign was continued with marvel creating a faux status update for captain america showing his relationship status had changed to in a complicated relationship with iron man at walt disney company s annual shareholder meeting in auditorium theatre in march ceo bob iger presented a clip from film to generous applause from march 7 to 10 marvel released individual posters for characters in film continued its facebook campaign with two teaser videos showcasing participants on team cap and team iron man and released a second trailer trailer was viewed close to 95 million times within first 24 hours of release surpassing views achieved by first trailer in addition 240 000 social media posts across twitter tumblr instagram and facebook among others were made related to trailer surpassing 81 000 age of ultron trailer received in 2014 according to internet analytics firm zefr trailer was viewed over 62 million times from youtube and facebook over four days making it second most viewed trailer at time behind 64 6 million views for first star wars force awakens trailer it also became top trailer in 2016 through march 13 2016 according to research firm listenfirst for receiving most likes retweets and other engagement on twitter trailer continued to be top viewed trailer on youtube and facebook for three straight weeks according to zefr receiving more than 96 million total views since its release mendelson called trailer a textbook case for unnecessary second pitches is there anyone out there who watched that first teaser back in december and said hmm it looks good and all but i need more evidence he added that he was a little disappointed by big spider man reveal having previously wondered after a spider man character poster was not released with others if marvel would have courage to not include character in any marketing materials before film s release letting peter parker scenes film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and or something that drives post opening weekend buzz mendelson s colleague at forbes mark hughes felt differently noting that trailer was targeting general audience rather than just fans by giving us more explanation and context of why a clearly major battle is raging between captain america and iron man and by including spider man since there are plenty of surprises in these movies and since we all already know spider man is in civil war refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless it s common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled inspired or otherwise driven to go out to movies that day there are any number of factors that can come into play and world needed to see spider man because it s sort of value added element that can make a difference graeme mcmillan of hollywood reporter felt that spider man reveal alone makes trailer describing it as feeling like comic book character come to life that awkward voice cracking hey everyone was as humble playing it cool and cocky as he should be with film seemingly continuing plot threads first introduced in age of ultron mendelson wondered to what extent whole consequences galore narrative of civil war will improve age of ultron as much great stuff as that movie has it ultimately shows main hero foolishly recklessly bring a world killing threat to earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet no one seems to care at end what does it mean if civil war does retroactively improve age of ultron will we be at a point where we really can t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix flaws a couple years down line mcmillan continued some of mendelson s thinking feeling that marvel was in an awkward place with civil war regarding superhero destruction moving forward he wondered how superhero oversight would actually prevent kind of destruction that it s meant to stop unless bad guys all agree to play by new rules as well worse still destruction caused by superhero fights should now be foremost in viewers heads audience won t be able to enjoy sight of hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of property damage and or whoever was standing on other side of that wall after civil war can marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again also in march marvel in partnership with national academy of sciences science entertainment exchange dolby laboratories broadcom and synchrony bank announced girls reforming future challenge aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in stem science technology engineering and mathematics education

by cinemascore gave film an a grade on an a to f scale while posttrak reported filmgoers gave it an 88 overall positive score and a 75 definite recommend justin chang of variety called it most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from marvel cinematic universe sheri linden of hollywood reporter said call it civil war or call it brand extension call it a cinematic universe or a corporate behemoth latest marvel extravaganza furthers studio s cross pollination of action franchises in a way that s sure to satisfy devotees robbie collin of daily telegraph wrote this is cinematic superhero showdown you ve dreamt of since childhood precisely because that s everything and all it wants to be catherine of guardian called it a huge aspartame rush of a film a giant irresistible snack not nutritious but very tasty richard roeper of chicago sun times wrote kudos to co directors anthony and joe russo and team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic book characters and nearly that many plot lines and only occasionally getting us and by us i mean me lost in geek weeds kenneth turan of los angeles times said if you live and breathe marvel this is one of mcu s stronger offerings if you are a spy coming in from cold answer is not so clear a o scott of new york times wrote captain america civil war does not in any way transcend conventions of genre on contrary it succeeds because it doesn t really try conversely stephen whitty of new york daily news said although it s called captain america civil war latest marvel movie is actually a supersized avengers picture overstuffed to bursting and sometimes during its two and a half hour running time it just goes bust mick lasalle of san francisco chronicle said as a work of thought civil war is compromised but at least there are thoughts to compromise as an action film it has its moments but aside from big opening sequence action scenes are a bit flat andrew o hehir writing for salon said much of captain america civil war is just laborious working out of leftover dangling plot elements from captain america winter soldier two summers ago while nicholas barber of bbc gave film a generally favorable review praising both its visuals and action sequences he criticized fact that there was no cogent reason for any of avengers to be on one side or other which is why their inevitable dust up feels like a game of dodgeball in a school playground mark millar writer of civil war comic storyline on which film was based felt film had a good opening twenty minutes but then i honestly can t remember what movie was about he also felt film lacked levity especially considering russo brothers background in comedy accolades year award category recipient s result 2016 teen choice awards choice
