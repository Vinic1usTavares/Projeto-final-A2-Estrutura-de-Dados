hudson river is a river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern new york in united states river originates in adirondack mountains of upstate new york flows southward through hudson valley to upper new york bay between new york city and jersey city it eventually drains into atlantic ocean at new york harbor river serves as a political boundary between states of new jersey and new york at its southern end further north it marks local boundaries between several new york counties lower half of river is a tidal estuary deeper than body of water into which it flows occupying hudson fjord an inlet which formed during most recent period of north american glaciation estimated at 26 000 to 13 300 years ago tidal waters influence hudson s flow from as far north as city of troy river is named after henry hudson an englishman sailing for dutch east india company who explored it in 1609 and after whom hudson bay in canada is also named it had previously been observed by italian explorer giovanni da verrazzano sailing for king francis i of france in 1524 as he became first european known to have entered upper new york bay but he considered river to be an estuary dutch called river north river with delaware river called south river and it formed spine of dutch colony of new netherland settlements of colony clustered around hudson and its strategic importance as gateway to american interior led to years of competition between english and dutch over control of river and colony during eighteenth century river valley and its inhabitants were subject and inspiration of washington irving first internationally acclaimed american author in nineteenth century area inspired hudson river school of landscape painting an american pastoral style as well as concepts of environmentalism and wilderness hudson was also eastern outlet for erie canal which when completed in 1825 became an important transportation artery for early 19th century united states thumb mouth of hudson yellow located between jersey city and new york city course sources source of hudson river is lake tear of clouds in adirondack park at an altitude of however river is not cartographically called hudson river until miles downstream river is named feldspar brook until its confluence with opalescent river and then is named opalescent river until river reaches calamity brook flowing south from outlet of henderson lake from that point on stream is cartographically known as hudson river u s geological survey usgs uses this cartographical definition left thumb hudson river flowing out of henderson lake in tahawus longest source of hudson river as shown on most detailed usgs maps is opalescent river on west slopes of little marcy mountain originating two miles north of lake tear of clouds several miles past flowed lands to hudson river and a mile longer than feldspar brook which flows out of that lake in adirondack mountains popular culture and convention however more often cite photogenic lake tear of clouds as source upper hudson river using river names as seen on maps indian pass brook flows into henderson lake and outlet from henderson lake flows east and meets southwest flowing calamity brook confluence of two rivers is where maps begin to use hudson river name south of outlet of sanford lake opalescent river flows into hudson hudson then flows south taking in beaver brook and outlet of lake harris after its confluence with indian river hudson forms boundary between essex and hamilton counties in hamlet of north river hudson flows entirely in warren county and takes in schroon river further south river forms boundary between warren and saratoga counties river then takes in sacandaga river from great sacandaga lake shortly thereafter river leaves adirondack park flows under interstate 87 and through glens falls just south of lake george although receiving no streamflow from lake it next goes through hudson falls at this point river forms boundary between washington and saratoga counties here river has an elevation of just south in fort edward river reaches its confluence with champlain canal which historically provided boat traffic between new york city and montreal and rest of eastern canada via hudson lake champlain and saint lawrence seaway further south hudson takes in water from batten kill river and fish creek near schuylerville river then forms boundary between saratoga and rensselaer counties river then enters heart of capital district it takes in water from hoosic river which extends into massachusetts shortly thereafter river has its confluence with mohawk river largest tributary of hudson river in waterford river then reaches federal dam in troy marking an impoundment of river at an elevation of bottom of dam marks beginning of tidal influence in hudson as well as beginning of lower hudson river lower hudson river thumb left river from poughkeepsie looking north south of federal dam hudson river begins to widen considerably river enters hudson valley flowing along west bank of albany and east bank of rensselaer interstate 90 crosses hudson into albany at this point in river hudson then leaves capital district forming boundary between greene and columbia counties it then meets its confluence with creek widening considerably at this point after flowing by hudson river forms boundary between ulster and columbia counties and ulster and dutchess counties passing germantown and kingston delaware and hudson canal meets river at this point river then flows by hyde park former residence of franklin d roosevelt and alongside city of poughkeepsie flowing under walkway over hudson and mid hudson bridge afterwards hudson passes wappingers falls and takes in wappinger creek river then forms boundary between orange and dutchess counties it flows between newburgh and beacon and under newburgh beacon bridge taking in fishkill creek in this area between gee s point at us military academy and constitution island an area known as world s end marks deepest part of hudson at shortly thereafter river enters hudson highlands between putnam and orange counties flowing between mountains such as storm king mountain breakneck ridge and bear mountain river narrows considerably here before flowing under bear mountain bridge which connects westchester and rockland counties thumb river between hudson waterfront in new jersey left and manhattan right afterward leaving hudson highlands river enters haverstraw bay widest point of river at wide shortly thereafter river forms tappan zee and flows under tappan zee bridge which carries new york state thruway between tarrytown and nyack in westchester and rockland counties respectively at state line with new jersey west bank of hudson enters bergen county palisades are large rocky cliffs along west bank of river also known as bergen hill at their lower end in hudson county further south east bank of river becomes yonkers and then riverdale neighborhood of bronx in new york city south of confluence of hudson and spuyten duyvil creek east bank of river becomes manhattan river is sometimes still called north river at this point george washington bridge crosses river between fort lee and washington heights neighborhood of manhattan lincoln tunnel and holland tunnel also cross under river between manhattan and new jersey south of battery river proper ends meeting east river to form upper new york bay also known as new york harbor its outflow continues through narrows between brooklyn and staten island under verrazzano bridge and into lower new york bay and atlantic ocean geography and watershed thumb bulk carrier nord angel breaking ice on hudson lower hudson is actually a tidal estuary with tidal influence extending as far as federal dam in troy there are about two high tides and two low tides per day as tide rises tidal current moves northward taking enough time that part of river can be at high tide while another part can be at bottom of its low tide strong tides make parts of new york harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate during winter ice floes may drift south or north depending upon tides mahican name of river represents its partially estuarine nature he kun ne tuk means river that flows both ways due to tidal influence from ocean extending to troy ny freshwater discharge is only about per second on average mean fresh water discharge at river s mouth in new york is approximately per second hudson river is long with depths of for stretch south of federal dam dredged to maintain river as a shipping route some sections there are around 160 feet deep and deepest part of hudson known as world s end between us military academy and constitution island has a depth of hudson and its tributaries notably mohawk river drain an area of hudson river watershed it covers much of new york as well as parts of connecticut massachusetts new jersey and vermont parts of hudson river form coves such as weehawken cove in towns of hoboken and weehawken in new jersey salinity new york harbor between narrows and george washington bridge has a mix of fresh and ocean water mixed by wind and tides to create an increasing gradient of salinity from river s top to its bottom this varies with season weather variation of water circulation and other factors snowmelt at winter s end increases freshwater flow downstream salt line of river varies from north in poughkeepsie to south at battery park in new york city though it usually lies near newburgh geology hudson is sometimes called in geological terms a drowned river rising sea levels after retreat of wisconsin glaciation most recent ice age have resulted in a marine incursion that drowned coastal plain and brought salt water well above mouth of river deeply eroded old riverbed beyond current shoreline hudson canyon is a rich fishing area former riverbed is clearly delineated beneath waters of atlantic ocean extending to edge of continental shelf as a result of glaciation and rising sea levels lower half of river is now a tidal estuary that occupies hudson fjord fjord is estimated to have formed between 26 000 and 13 300 years ago along river palisades are of metamorphic basalt or highlands are primarily granite and gneiss with intrusions and from beacon to albany shales and limestones or mainly sedimentary rock narrows were most likely formed about 6 000 years ago at end of last ice age previously staten island and long island were connected preventing hudson river from terminating via narrows at that time hudson river emptied into atlantic ocean through a more westerly course through parts of present day northern new jersey along eastern side of watchung mountains to bound brook new jersey and then on into atlantic ocean via raritan bay a buildup of water in upper new york bay eventually allowed hudson river to break through previous land mass that was connecting staten island and brooklyn to form narrows as it exists today this allowed hudson river to find a shorter route to atlantic ocean via its present course between new jersey and new york city suspended sediments mainly consisting of clays eroded from glacial deposits and organic particles can be found in abundance in river hudson has a relatively short history of erosion so it does not have a large depositional plain near its mouth this lack of significant deposits near river mouth differs from most other american estuaries around new york harbor sediment also flows into estuary from ocean when current is flowing north names river was called ca ho ha ta te a river by iroquois and it was known as river that flows two ways or waters that are never still by mohican tribe who formerly inhabited both banks of lower portion of river meaning of mohican name comes from river s long tidal range delaware tribe of indians bartlesville oklahoma considers closely related mohicans to be a part of lenape people and so lenape also claim hudson as part of their ancestral territory also calling it first known european name for river was rio san antonio as named by portuguese explorer in spain s employ estevao gomes who explored mid atlantic coast in 1525 another early name for hudson used by dutch was rio de montaigne later they generally termed it or north river delaware river being known as or south river other occasional names for hudson included manhattan river groote great river and de mouritse or great mouritse river is a dutch surname translated name north river was used in new york metropolitan area up until early 1900s with limited use continuing into present day term persists in radio communication among commercial shipping traffic especially below tappan zee term also continues to be used in names of facilities in river s southern portion such as north river piers north river tunnels and north river wastewater treatment plant it is believed that first use of name hudson river in a map was in a map created by cartographer john in 1740 in 1939 magazine life described river as america s rhine comparing it to stretch of rhine in central and western europe various stretches of river have their own historical names many created by early dutch explorers and settlers stretches all have similar sailing conditions and names were commonly used until early common use of steamboat these names include from south to north great chip reach tappan reach reach reach crescent or cook s reach hoge s or high reach martyr s or reach fisher s reach lange rack or long reach or reach or or baker s reach jan s reach and hart s or hunter s reach history pre columbian era area around hudson river was inhabited by indigenous peoples ages before europeans arrived lenape wappinger and mahican branches of algonquins lived along river mostly in peace with other groups algonquins in region mainly lived in small clans and villages throughout area one major settlement was called which was located at croton point overlooking hudson river other settlements were located in various locations throughout hudson highlands many villagers lived in various types of houses which algonquins called wigwams though large families often lived in longhouses that could be a hundred feet long at associated villages they grew corn beans and squash they also gathered other types of plant foods such as hickory nuts and many other wild fruits and tubers in addition to agriculture algonquins also fished in hudson river focusing on various species of freshwater fish as well as various variations of striped bass american eels sturgeon herring and shad oyster beds were also common on river floor which provided an extra source of nutrition land hunting consisted of turkey deer bear and other animals lower hudson river was inhabited by lenape while further north wappingers lived from manhattan island up to poughkeepsie they traded with both lenape to south and mahicans to north mahicans lived in northern part of valley from present day kingston to lake champlain with their capital located near present day albany exploration and colonization john cabot is credited for old world s discovery of continental north america with his journey in 1497 along continent s coast in 1524 florentine explorer giovanni da verrazzano sailed north along atlantic seaboard and into new york harbor however he left harbor shortly thereafter without navigating into hudson river in 1598 dutch men employed by greenland company wintered in new york bay eleven years later dutch east india company financed english navigator henry hudson in his search for northwest passage during search hudson decided to sail his ship up river that would later be named after him his travel up ever widening river led him to haverstraw bay leading him to believe he had successfully reached northwest passage he landed on western shore of bay and claimed territory for netherlands he then proceeded upstream as far as present day troy before concluding that no such strait existed there dutch subsequently began to colonize region establishing colony of new netherland including three major fur trading outposts new amsterdam wiltwyck and fort orange new amsterdam was founded at mouth of hudson river and would later become known as new york city wiltwyck was founded roughly halfway up hudson river and would later become kingston fort orange was founded on river north of wiltwyck and later became known as albany dutch west india company operated a monopoly on region for roughly twenty years before other businessmen were allowed to set up their own ventures in colony in 1647 director general peter stuyvesant took over management of colony and surrendered it in 1664 to british who had invaded largely defenseless new amsterdam new amsterdam and colony of new netherland were renamed new york after duke of york under british colonial rule hudson valley became an agricultural hub manors were developed on east side of river and west side contained many smaller and independent farms in 1754 albany plan of union was created at albany city hall on hudson plan allowed colonies to treaty with iroquois and provided a framework for continental congress revolution during american revolutionary war british realized that river s proximity to lake george and lake champlain would allow their navy to control water route from montreal to new york city british general john burgoyne planned saratoga campaign to control river and therefore cut off patriot hub of new england to river s east from south and mid atlantic regions to river s west action would allow british to focus on rallying support of loyalists in southerly states as a result numerous battles were fought along river and in nearby waterways these include battle of long island in august 1776 and battle of harlem heights following month later that year british and continental armies were involved in skirmishes and battles in of hudson in westchester county culminating in battle of white plains also in late 1776 new england militias fortified river s choke point known as hudson highlands which included building fort clinton and fort montgomery on either side of hudson and a metal chain between two in 1777 washington expected british would attempt to control hudson river however they instead conquered philadelphia and left a smaller force in new york city with permission to strike hudson valley at any time british attacked on october 5 1777 in battle of forts clinton and montgomery by sailing up hudson river looting village of peeksill and capturing two forts in 1778 continentals constructed great west point chain in order to prevent another british fleet from sailing up hudson hudson river school thumb robert havell jr view of hudson river from tarrytown hudson river school paintings reflect themes of discovery exploration and settlement in america in mid 19th century detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting works often juxtapose peaceful agriculture and remaining wilderness which was fast disappearing from hudson valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity school characterizes artistic body its new york location its landscape subject matter and often its subject hudson river in general hudson river school artists believed that nature in form of american landscape was an ineffable manifestation of god though artists varied in depth of their religious conviction their reverence for america s natural beauty was shared with contemporary american writers such as henry david thoreau and ralph waldo emerson artist thomas cole is generally acknowledged as founder of hudson river school his work first being reviewed in 1825 while painters frederic edwin church and albert bierstadt were most successful painters of school 19th century thumb left erie canal in amsterdam new york at beginning of 19th century transportation from us east coast into mainland was difficult ships were fastest vehicles at time as trains were still being developed and automobiles were roughly a century away in order to facilitate shipping throughout country s interior numerous canals were constructed between internal bodies of water in 1800s one of most significant canals of this era was erie canal canal was built to link midwest to port of new york a significant seaport during that time by way of great lakes canal mohawk river and hudson river completion of canal enhanced development of american west allowing settlers to travel west send goods to markets in frontier cities and export goods via hudson river and new york city completion of canal made new york city one of most vital ports in nation surpassing port of philadelphia and ports in massachusetts after completion of erie canal smaller canals were built to connect it with new system champlain canal was built to connect hudson river near troy to southern end of lake champlain this canal allowed boaters to travel from st lawrence seaway and then british cities such as montreal to hudson river and new york city another major canal was oswego canal which connected erie canal to oswego and lake ontario and could be used to bypass niagara falls cayuga seneca canal connected erie canal to cayuga lake and seneca lake farther south delaware and hudson canal was built between delaware river at honesdale pennsylvania and hudson river at kingston new york this canal enabled transportation of coal and later other goods as well between delaware and hudson river watersheds combination of these canals made hudson river one of most vital waterways for trade in nation during industrial revolution hudson river became a major location for production especially around albany and troy river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from interior of northeast to coast hundreds of factories were built around hudson in towns including newburgh kingston and hudson north tarrytown assembly later owned by general motors on river in sleepy hollow was a large and notable example river links to erie canal and great lakes allowing manufacturing in midwest including automobiles in detroit to use river for transport with industrialization came new technologies for transport including steamboats for faster transport in 1807 north river steamboat later known as clermont became first commercially successful steamboat it carried passengers between new york city and albany along hudson river hudson river valley also proved to be a good area for railroads hudson river railroad was established in 1849 on east side of river as a way to bring passengers from new york city to albany line was built as an alternative to new york and harlem railroad for travel to albany and as a way to ease concerns of cities along river railroad was also used for commuting to new york city further north livingston avenue bridge was opened in 1866 as a way to connect hudson river railroad with new york central railroad which goes west to buffalo smaller railroads existed north of this point on west side of hudson river west shore railroad opened to run passenger service from weehawken new jersey to albany and then buffalo in 1889 poughkeepsie railroad bridge opened for rail service between poughkeepsie and west side of river 20th and 21st centuries thumb george washington bridge links upper manhattan and fort lee new jersey starting in 20th century technological requirements needed to build large crossings across river were met this was especially important by new york city as river is fairly wide at that point in 1927 holland tunnel opened between new jersey and lower manhattan tunnel was longest underwater tunnel in world at time and used an advanced system to ventilate tunnels and prevent build up of carbon monoxide original upper level of george washington bridge and first tube of lincoln tunnel followed in 1930s both crossings were later expanded to accommodate extra traffic lincoln tunnel in 1940s and 1950s and george washington bridge in 1960s in 1955 original tappan zee bridge was built over one of widest parts of river from tarrytown to nyack late 20th century saw a decline in industrial production in hudson valley in 1993 ibm closed two of its plants in east fishkill and kingston due to ibm losing 16 billion over previous three years plant in east fishkill had 16 300 workers at its peak in 1984 and had opened in 1941 originally as part of war effort in 1996 north tarrytown gm plant closed in response to plant closures towns throughout region sought to make region attractive for technology companies ibm maintained a poughkeepsie mainframe unit and newer housing and office developments were built near there as well commuting from poughkeepsie to new york city also increased developers also looked to build on property of old gm plant thumb left upright 1 2 hudson valley

swain became first person to swim all 315 miles of hudson river in support of cleaning it up in conjunction with conservation efforts hudson river region has seen an economic revitalization especially in favor of green development in 2009 high line was opened in chelsea neighborhood of manhattan this linear park has views of river throughout its length also in 2009 original poughkeepsie railroad bridge since abandoned was converted into walkway over hudson a pedestrian park over river emblematic of increase in green development in region waterfront parks in cities like kingston poughkeepsie and beacon were built and several festivals are held annually landmarks numerous places have been constructed along hudson that have since become landmarks following river from its source to mouth there is hudson river islands state park in greene and columbia counties and in dutchess county there is bard college vanderbilt mansion national historic site franklin d roosevelt s home and

north bergen new jersey and selkirk yard in selkirk new york hudson is crossed at numerous points by bridges tunnels and ferries width of lower hudson river required major feats of engineering to cross results are today visible in george washington bridge and 1955 tappan zee bridge replaced by new tappan zee bridge as well as lincoln and holland tunnels and path and pennsylvania railroad tubes george washington bridge which carries multiple highways connects fort lee new jersey to washington heights neighborhood of upper manhattan and is world s busiest motor vehicle bridge new tappan zee bridge is longest in new york although verrazzano narrows bridge has a larger main span troy union bridge between waterford and troy was first bridge over hudson built in 1804 and destroyed in 1909 its replacement troy waterford bridge was built in 1909 rensselaer and saratoga railroad was chartered in 1832 and opened in 1835 including green island bridge second bridge over hudson south of federal dam pollution thumb debris floating on river near world trade center 1973 hudson river s sediments contain a significant array of pollutants accumulated over decades from industrial waste discharges sewage treatment plants and urban runoff overall water quality in river has improved significantly since 1990s however most discussed pollution of hudson river is general electric s contamination of river with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs between 1947 and 1977 this pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who ate fish from river or drank water in response to this contamination activists protested in various ways a group of fishermen formed an organization in 1966 that would later become riverkeeper first member of alliance musician pete seeger founded hudson river sloop clearwater and clearwater festival to draw attention to problem environmental activism led to passage of federal clean water act in 1972 as well as federal government designation of river as a superfund site in 1984 other kinds of pollution including mercury contamination and sewage dumping have also caused problems extensive remediation actions on river began in 1970s with implementation of wastewater discharge permits and consequent control or reduction of wastewater discharges and sediment removal operations which have continued into 21st century flora and fauna plankton thumb a juvenile house sparrow by hudson river zooplankton are abundant throughout fresh and saltwater portions of river and provide a crucial food source for larval and juvenile fish invertebrates benthic zone has species capable of living in soft bottom habitats within freshwater regions there are animal species including larvae of chironomid flies oligochaete worms predatory fly larvae and amphipods in saline regions there are abundant polychaete annelids amphipods and some mollusks such as clams these species burrow in sediment and accelerate breakdown of organic matter atlantic blue crabs are among larger invertebrates at northern limit of their range entire hudson was once far more populated with native suspension feeding bivalves freshwater mussels were common in river s zone but populations have been decreasing for decades probably from altered habitats and invasive zebra mussel oyster beds were once pervasive in saltwater portion but are now reduced through pollution and exploitation fish according to hudson river estuary program about 220 species of fish including 173 native species currently are found in hudson river commercial fishing was once prominent in river although most were shut down in 1976 due to pollution few survive today american shad are only finfish harvested for profit though in limited numbers species include striped bass most important game fish in hudson estimates of striped bass population in hudson range to nearly 100 million fish american eels also live in river before reaching breeding age for much of this stage they are known as glass eels because of transparency of their bodies fish are only species in hudson s estuary atlantic tomcod is a unique species that adapted resistance to toxic effects of pcbs polluting river scientists identified genetic mutation that conferred resistance and found that mutated form was present in 99 percent of tomcods in river compared to fewer than 10 percent of tomcods from other waters flatfish have been historically abundant in river where farmers would use them for inexpensive livestock feed giving fish its name other unusual fish found in river include northern lined seahorse and northern puffer atlantic sturgeon a species about 120 million years old enter estuary during their annual migrations fish grow to a considerable size up to and fish are symbol of hudson river estuary their smoked flesh was commonly eaten in river valley since 1779 and it was sometimes known as albany beef city of albany was called sturgeondom or in 1850s and 1860s with its residents known as sturgeondom name lost popularity around 1900 fish have been off limits from fishing since 1998 river s population of shortnose sturgeon have quadrupled since 1970s and are also off limits to all fishing as they are a federally endangered species marine and invasive species marine life is known to exist in estuary with seals crabs and some whales reported on march 29 1647 a white whale swam up river to rensselaerswyck near albany herman melville author of moby dick lived in and near albany from 1830 to 1847 and was known to have ancestry from new netherland leading some to believe stories of whale sighting inspired his novel non native species often originate in new york harbor a center of long distance commerce over 100 foreign species reside in river and its banks many of these have had significant effects on ecosystem and natural habitats water chestnut produces a vegetative mat that reduces oxygen content in water below enhances sedimentation impedes small vessel navigation and is a hazard to swimmers and walkers zebra mussel arrived in hudson in 1989 and has spread through river s freshwater region reducing photoplankton and river oxygen levels positively mussel clears suspended particles allowing for more light to aquatic vegetation in saltwater areas green crab spread in early 20th century and japanese shore crab has become dominant in recent years habitats hudson has a diverse array of habitat types most of river consists of deep water habitats though its tidal wetlands of freshwater and salt marshes are among most ecologically important there is strong biological diversity including intertidal vegetation like freshwater cattails and saltwater shallow coves and bays are often covered with submarine vegetation shallower areas harbor diverse benthic fauna abundance of food varies over location and time stemming from seasonal flows of nutrients hudson s large volume of suspended sediments reduces light penetration in area s water column which reduces photoplankton photosynthesis and prevents sub aquatic vegetation from growing beyond shallow depths oxygen producing phytoplankton have also been inhibited by relatively recent invasion of zebra mussel species hudson river estuary is site of wetlands from new york city all way up to troy it has one of largest concentrations of freshwater wetlands in northeast even though river can be considered brackish further south 80 percent of wetlands are outside influence of saltwater coming from atlantic ocean currently river has about acres of wetlands and rising sea levels due to climate change are expected to lead to an expansion of that area wetlands are expected to migrate upland as sea level and thus level of river rises this is different from rest of world where rising sea levels usually leads to a reduction in wetland areas expansion of wetlands are expected to provide more habitat to fish and birds of region activities parkland surrounds much of hudson river prominent parks include battery park and liberty state park at river s mouth riverside park in manhattan croton point park bear mountain state park storm king state park and hudson highlands moreau lake state park and its source in high peaks wilderness area fishing is allowed in river although state department of health recommends eating no fish caught from south glens falls dam to federal dam at troy women under 50 and children under 15 are not advised to eat any fish caught south of palmer falls dam in corinth while others are advised to eat anywhere from one to four meals per month of hudson river fish depending on species and location caught department of health cites mercury pcbs dioxin and cadmium as chemicals impacting fish in these areas common native species recreationally fished include striped bass formerly a major commercial species now only legally taken by anglers channel catfish white catfish brown bullhead yellow perch and white perch
