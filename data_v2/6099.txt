sultan hamengkubuwono ii building site however had already been known as a bathing place called spring since sunan amangkurat iv s reign 1719 1726 according to kitab in yogyakarta kraton project leader for construction of taman sari was tumenggung mangundipura he had travelled twice to batavia to learn about european architecture which is reason why architecture of taman sari has marks of european style regent of madiun raden rangga prawirasentika participated in funding construction of taman sari prawirasentika also beseeched sultan to be relieved of madiun s tax obligation he offered other alternative ways of payment sultan accepted his proposal in 1758 sultan commanded regent to supervise making of bricks and various complements which would be used to build a beautiful garden sultan wanted a place where he could spend some time to relax after many years of wars that he had just experienced raden tumenggung mangundipura under supervision of raden arya natakusuma who later became sri ii was responsible for construction building was started in 1684 javanese year 1758 ad after finding out how large complex was raden rangga prawirasentika realized that cost would have been greater than taxes he resigned from project and was replaced by prince natakusuma who continued project to completion taman sari was built three years after agreement as a resting place for sultan hamengkubuwono i complex consists of about 59 buildings including a mosque meditation chambers swimming pools and a series of 18 water gardens and pavilions surrounded by artificial lakes complex was

memet shows birds siphoning honey from flowery trees maintenance of taman sari was abandoned shortly after hamengkubuwono i died partly because elaborate hydraulic works were so difficult to maintain gardens were neglected and buildings suffered some damage during java war of 1825 1830 palace complex fell out of use following an earthquake in 1867 which destroyed several buildings and drained water features over time squatters began to inhabit site surrounding ruins of deserted pavilions and filling empty lakebeds in early 1970s effort at restoration was made only bathing complex has been completely restored demang tegis manuscript of serat mentions story of demang tegis a portuguese man said to be one of architect of taman sari according to manuscript a strange man suddenly appeared in village a locality name on south coast of java near parangtritis with long nose white complexion and a foreign language villagers suspected that person was some kind of spirit or forest fairy they presented him to current sultan hamengkubuwono ii apparently sultan found interest in person and took strange man as his servant some years had passed and man had finally learned to talk in javanese according to him he was a portuguese or in javanese portegis who was stranded from a shipwreck he also claimed to have been a housebuilder so sultan ordered him to erect a fortress satisfied by man s work sultan gave him title demang from then on that person was known as demang portegis or demang tegis there is a controversy whether demang tegis was actually architect of taman sari as design resembles a hybrid of javanese and dutch styles rather than portuguese p j in java book iii page 631 wrote local research says that taman sari s architecture was designed by either a spanish or portuguese engineer who was stranded off his sunken ship at southern beach however architecture that strongly shows javanese character contradicts this dat het door een of de ingenieur die als op het was maar het vab het in strijd evidence about demang tegis remains an inconclusive yet architecture of taman sari moved a number of portuguese experts on architecture and cultural heritage to examine taman sari in 2001 widespread assumption of european influence in design of taman sari has been also challenged by research of helene from university of pantheon sorbonne presented in a 2003 conference paper analysing historic context and architectural style of complex conclusion is that creators are most likely local javanese absence of any mention of european involvement in construction of taman sari in dutch historic descriptions is presented as further evidence in support of this hypothesis buildings taman sari can be divided into four areas first area is artificial lake segaran located in west second area is a bathing complex in south of segaran lake called umbul binangun bathing complex third area now completely gone is pasarean ledok sari and garjitawati pool located in south of bathing complex fourth area is east side of first and second area which extend far to east and to southeast complex of magangan segaran lake area segaran lake area was main complex of taman
