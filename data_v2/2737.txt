armstrong stated we ll start with silence and that s how we ll be able to find inspiration to find another record band did not release any details of writing and recording process until october 2007 when armstrong said in an interview with rolling stone that he had written something like 45 songs band members worked on primitive conceptual stages of album at their rehearsal studio in oakland california little was revealed on themes or musical style of album but armstrong stated i want to dig into who i am and what i m feeling at this moment which is middle aged he added that many of 45 songs were written on piano rather than guitar green day began recording process for 21st century breakdown in january 2008 later that year it was confirmed that band worked with producer butch vig album was recorded with vig throughout 2008 and into early 2009 at four locations in california ocean way recording in hollywood studio 880 in oakland studios in newport beach and costa mesa studios in costa mesa while recording in hollywood band members bought cheap turntables from amoeba music and listened to many vinyl records for inspiration including albums by beat and fricke p 50 armstrong cited as inspiration music of kinks ray davies pretty things s f sorrow doors doors and strange days and meat loaf s bat out of hell drummer tre cool noted influence of eddie cochran and creation on armstrong s writing while writing at his home studio armstrong worked on a cover of who s 1966 mini opera a quick one while he s away green day recorded a full band version of song during album sessions fricke pp 48 50 vig noted that frustrations would sometimes cause delays in recording process for 21st century breakdown armstrong kept his lyrics closely guarded and intentionally mixed his demos so that vocals were low in mix and thus unintelligible to other band members it was not until late 2008 that he chose to share his words with cool vig and bassist mike dirnt by sitting down with them and reading entire album s lyrics aloud in order band members made finishing touches on album in early april 2009 and claimed that its release would lead to a kind of post depression themes and composition 21st century breakdown continues rock opera style of its predecessor american idiot album is set in detroit michigan and is divided into three acts heroes and cons charlatans and saints and horseshoes and handgrenades its loose narrative follows a young couple named christian and gloria through challenges present in u s following presidency of george w bush bassist mike dirnt has compared relationships between songs to those in bruce springsteen s born to run saying that themes are not as tightly interwoven as in a concept album but that they are still connected many of record s themes and lyrics are drawn from armstrong s personal life and he sings in first person narrative style about abandonment and vengeance in before lobotomy christian s inferno and peacemaker rolling stone noted that album is most personal emotionally convulsive record armstrong has ever written title track s opening lyric born into nixon i was raised in hell references armstrong s birth year of 1972 while we are class of 13 references fact that his eldest son joseph would graduate from high school in 2013 dirnt has expressed his belief that last of american girls was written about armstrong s wife adrienne who he claimed is steadfast in her beliefs and assertively defends them armstrong has cited his disconnected childhood he was raised by his five older siblings after their father s death while their mother worked graveyard shifts as a waitress as roots of discontent expressed on 21st century breakdown east jesus nowhere rebukes fundamentalist religion and was written after armstrong attended a church service where a friend s baby was baptized musically 21st century breakdown is similar to punk rock style of american idiot but many critics have claimed that green day s traditional sound has evolved in five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale rob sheffield of rolling stone indicated that album sports ballads that are green day s most polished he claimed that band combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic rock grandiosity mtv compared material to that of classic rockers like who while spin called title track green day s most epic song yet cool has remarked it s important to us that we re still looked at as a punk band it was our religion our higher education however he also noted that armstrong had delved into past in writing 21st century breakdown gleaning inspiration from artists who shaped rock music armstrong himself has stated ground zero for me is still punk rock i like painting an ugly picture i get something uplifting out of singing some of most horrifying shit you can sing about it s just my dna promotion and release thumb 200px

awarded record four stars out of five and likened it to both bruce springsteen s music and avant garde writing of chuck palahniuk rolling stones david fricke called 21st century breakdown a compound bomb of classic rock ecstasy no mercy punk assault and pop song wiles it s like clash s london calling who s quadrophenia and husker du s zen arcade all compressed into 18 songs dan cairns of times concluded lyrically it may succeed in capturing contradictions vulnerabilities and longing for harmony that through armstrong dirnt and cool their country and humanity as a whole but its real triumph in an age of trimming of market testing of self censorship and lowest common denominators is not simply to aim insanely high but to make it to summit criticism centered on concept of record bbc s chris jones said that it is griping vaguely against authority and that too many buzz words obscure incisive meaning steve kandell of spin wrote that humor of american idiot was sorely missed and that energy of album seemed directionless guardians alexis petridis indicated that storyline becomes impossible to follow robert christgau of msn music wrote that i don t like right wing either but as every oppressed teen in right wing orbit knows full well they re not as garbled and simplistic as armstrong s anthems insist adam downer of sputnikmusic was most critical professional reviewer of album he questioned clarity of lyrics by calling 21st century breakdown more conceptually vague ridiculous than american idiot and he went on to say that it spirals out of control in its own heroic glory and never regains focus thus ending with a product that green day couldn t afford to produce an average record slant magazine claims that an uncanny sense of familiarity hangs over too much of album melodies of several tracks suggest ghosts of older green day songs kyle ryan at a v club gave album a b noting it as going even bolder than american idiot ryan also declared 21st century
