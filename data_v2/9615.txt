on bassist jeff ament said that communication was at an all time low drummer dave abbruzzese stated that communication problems started once guitarist stone gossard stopped acting as band s mediator according to gossard vitalogy was first album in which lead vocalist eddie vedder made final decisions at time gossard thought of quitting band hilburn robert working their way out of a jam los

recording sessions for vitalogy abbruzzese was fired in august 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members gossard said it was nature of how politics worked in our band it was up to me to say hey we tried it s not working time to move on on a superficial level it was a political struggle for whatever reason his ability to communicate with ed and jeff was very stifled i certainly don t think it was all dave abbruzzese s fault that it was stifled jack irons original drummer for red hot chili peppers and abbruzzese s successor plays drums on hey foxymophandlemama that s me gossard said jack entered band right at end of making vitalogy jack s a breath of fresh air a family man everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately he was just there to play drums and help out music and lyrics in a 1995 interview guitar world writer jeff gilbert described vitalogy as strange and very eclectic mccready agreed saying there is some weird stuff on there mccready attributed album s sound to group recording it on tour during this period vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist gossard said vitalogy is first one where ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs i remember thinking this is so different is anyone going to like this it had a more punk feel to it simple songs recorded really quickly interview with stone gossard and mike mccready total guitar november 2002 album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with band s first two albums mccready said vitalogy is not really a solo album i don t think songs demanded solos it was more of a rhythmic album stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic said that thanks to its stripped down lean production vitalogy stands as pearl jam s most original and uncompromising album he added that in between straight rock numbers and searching slow songs pearl jam contribute their strangest music of aye davanita sub tom waits accordion romp of bugs and chilling sonic collage hey

pressures of fame and dealing with resulting loss of privacy these include not for you pry to corduroy bugs satan s bed and immortality vedder said i m just totally vulnerable i m way too fucking soft for this whole business this whole trip i don t have any shell there s a contradiction there because that s probably why i can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can t necessarily express lyrics of not for you express anger at bureaucracy of music industry and how youth is being sold and exploited while vedder said corduroy is about one person s relationship with a million people in pry to phrase p r i v a c y is priceless to me is repeated many think that lyrics of immortality may be about nirvana frontman kurt cobain s suicide although vedder has denied this suggesting instead that it s about pressures on someone who is on a parallel train lyrics that appeared in first live version of immortality were altered before song was released as part of album vedder said regarding nothingman that if you love someone and they love you don t fuck up cause you are left with less than nothing better man is a song about an abusive

garage sale ament stated ed brought in that book and we said man that would make a great album cover he explained that from vs onward band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records ament said we tried really hard to make it like a book kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally which pissed off record stores they had to put it in sideways packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy problems arose when band discovered that later versions of book were still under copyright band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing material they wanted to include with album booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well being other notes in booklet dealing with life and death reflections seem to be more personal like a message typed on one of last pages supposedly referring to loss of a loved one i waited all day you waited all day but you left before sunset and i just wanted to tell you moment was beautiful just wanted to dance to bad music drive bad cars watch bad tv should have stayed for sunset if not for me booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to songs lyrics but to be interpreted as a commentary to songs and again as a reflection on how life should or shouldn t be lived an example is poem typed on aye davanita page song s subtitle is song without words as it is an instrumental track but page displays a sort of poem about wasted life of a young girl another episode of intruder words is on not for you lyrics page after second refrain instead of actual lyrics typed words give a hint about sisyphus myth yeah you call me sisyphus love yeah i move rock i just don t want to talk about moving rock anything that distracts me from moving rock lyrics to whipping are written on a copy of a petition to bill clinton against pro life killings of abortion doctors an x ray of vedder s teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on page for corduroy tour pearl jam promoted album with tours

golden gate park thing was a blur based on some bad food it was really really bad looking back at it it doesn t seem as intense as it was but it was horrible i just felt not human and looking back i should have got through that show somehow and i think fact that neil young was there made me feel like i could get off hook in some way and i did go out for a few songs because of vedder s health band was forced to cancel remaining dates of its tour of united states some dates were reinstated while rest were rescheduled for fall about canceling dates vedder said i think we all agreed that it had gotten insane that it was no longer about music marks craig road less traveled spin february 1997 ament later said we were so hardheaded about 1995 tour had to prove we could tour on our own and it
