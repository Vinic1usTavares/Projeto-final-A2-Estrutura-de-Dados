new york times book reviewer geoffrey wheatcroft said that a moral reckoning 2003 presents an indictment of roman catholic church comparable to goldhagen s indictment of germany in hitler s willing executioners 1996 saying both as an international institution under leadership of pope pius xii 1939 58 and at national levels in many european countries church was deeply implicated in appalling genocide just as germans had been carefully taught to hate jews to point that they could readily torment and kill them so had catholics that author goldhagen sees a deep vein of jew hatred ingrained within catholic tradition and he does not think that there was any difference of kind between that old religious jew hatred and murderous racial antisemitism of twentieth century in 2003 in atlantic

confront its history of hatred and harm to make amends with its victims and to right itself so that it is no longer source of hatred and harm that whatever its past it would no longer endorse he has attempted to analyze moral culpability of catholics and their leaders to judge actors and to discern how today s catholics can make material political and moral restitution goldhagen s book suggests that church owes financial reparation and support to jews and state of israel and should change its doctrine and accepted biblical canon to excise statements he labels as antisemitic and to indicate that jews way to god is as legitimate as christian way failing this author proposes disclaimers in every christian bible to annotate antisemitic passages and acknowledge them as having led to injury

book called a moral reckoning a 352 page exercise in intellectual bad manners and a spree of intellectual wilding in reply to charge of historical inaccuracy daniel goldhagen said that central contours of a moral reckoning role of catholic church in holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair 2002 are accurate because book s title and first page communicate its purpose of moral analysis
