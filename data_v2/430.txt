helped shape next generation of russian composers this group was named after timber merchant mitrofan belyayev an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in alexander glazunov s work by 1887 tchaikovsky was firmly established as one of leading composers in russia a favorite of tsar alexander iii he was widely regarded as a national treasure he was in demand as a guest conductor in russia and western europe and in 1890 visited united states in same capacity by contrast fortunes of nationalistic group of composers known as five which preceded belyayev circle had waned and group had long since dispersed of its members only nikolai rimsky korsakov remained fully active as a composer now a professor of musical composition and orchestration at saint petersburg conservatory rimsky korsakov had become a firm believer in western based compositional training that had been once frowned upon by group as a result of time tchaikovsky spent with belyayev circle s leading composers glazunov anatoly lyadov and rimsky korsakov somewhat fraught relationship he had previously endured with five would eventually meld into something more harmonious tchaikovsky s friendship with these men gave him increased confidence in his own abilities as a composer while his music encouraged glazunov to broaden his artistic outlook past nationalist agenda and to compose along more universal themes this influence grew to point that glazunov s third symphony became known as anti kuchist symphony of his ouvre kuchist refers to kuchka shortened russian name for five and shared several stylistic fingerprints with tchaikovsky s later symphonies nor was glazunov only composer so influenced rimsky korsakov wrote about belyayev composers worship of tchaikovsky and tendency toward eclecticism that became prevalent during this period along with a predilection toward italian french music of time of wig and farthingale that is of 18th century typified in tchaikovsky s late operas queen of spades and iolanta over long term tchaikovsky s influence over belyayev composers was not as great though they remained more eclectic in their musical approach and focused more on absolute music than five had done they continued writing overall in a style more akin to rimsky korsakov than to tchaikovsky even glazunov backed away from echoing tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan styles in an eclectic approach belyayev composers also spread nationalist musical aesthetic to

replied you ask about glazunov he is a very talented young man who studied for a year under rimsky korsakov when he composed his symphony he did not need any help tchaikovsky studied score for glazunov s first string quartet and wrote his brother modest despite its imitation of rimsky korsakov a remarkable talent is discernible as quoted in brown wandering 225 glazunov later sent tchaikovsky a copy of his poeme lyrique for orchestra about which tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to balakirev and had recommended for publication to his publisher p jurgenson brown wandering

been earlier they did not consider p i tchaikovsky one of our own we valued only a few of his works like romeo and juliet tempest francesca da rimini and finale of second symphony rest of his output was either unknown or alien to us as quoted in taruskin 37 tchaikovsky s presence won over glazunov and other young members present and his conversation with them was a fresh breeze amid our somewhat dusty atmosphere many of young musicians present including lyadov and myself left balakirev s apartment charmed by tchaikovsky s personality as lyadov put it our acquaintance with great composer was a real occasion as quoted in taruskin 37 38 glazunov adds that his relationship with tchaikovsky changed from elder composer being not one of our own to a close friendship that would last until tchaikovsky s death taruskin 38 i met tchaikovsky quite often both at balakirev s and at my own home glazunov remembered we usually met over music he always appeared in our social circle as one of most welcome guests besides myself and lyadov rimsky korsakov and balakirev were also constant members of our circle as quoted in poznansky eyes 141 this circle with which tchaikovsky would spend an increasing amount of time in last couple of years of his life would come to be known as belyayev circle named after its patron belyayev according to musicologist richard taruskin belyayev through his

contribute conspicuously to public life taruskin 49 they had worked their way up into wealth and being in their national outlook believed in greater glory of russia because of this belief they were more likely than aristocracy to support native talent and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones taruskin 42 this preference was not due to any social agenda inherent in art but due to its sympathetic and skillful portrayal of peculiar aspects of landscape of daily life and of character types with which they were familiar and which they lived taruskin 43 44 and it paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and that became prevalent in mainstream russian art and society taruskin 44 an amateur viola player and chamber music enthusiast belyayev hosted quartet

russian composers in 1884 he set up an annual glinka prize named after pioneer russian composer mikhail glinka 1804 1857 in 1885 disgusted with quality of music publishing in russia and lack of foreign copyright for works printed there he founded his own publishing firm in leipzig germany this firm initially issued works by glazunov rimsky korsakov lyadov and borodin at its own expense and would boast a catalog of over 2000 works all written by russian composers by time of october revolution in 1917 at rimsky korsakov s suggestion belyayev also founded his own concert series russian symphony concerts open exclusively to russian composers among works written especially for this series were three by rimsky korsakov for which he is currently best known in west scheherazade russian easter festival overture and capriccio espagnol these concerts would last until october revolution and by 1910 would host premieres of 165 works belyayev set up an advisory council made up of glazunov lyadov and rimsky korsakov to select which among many composers appealing for help should be assisted either through money publication or performances this council would look through compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which were deserving of patronage and public attention maes 173 though three worked together rimsky korsakov became de facto leader of group by force of matters purely

group of composers who now congregated with glazunov lyadov and rimsky korsakov were nationalistic in their outlook as five before them had been like five they believed in a uniquely russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic harmonic and rhythmic elements as exemplified by music of balakirev borodin and rimsky korsakov unlike five these composers also believed in necessity of an academic western based background in composition necessity of western compositional techniques was something that rimsky korsakov had instilled in many of them in his years at saint petersburg conservatory compared to revolutionary composers in balakirev s circle rimsky korsakov found those in belyayev circle to be progressive attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection but also broke new paths though more securely even if less speedily rimsky korsakov my musical life 286 287 visits in 1887 in november 1887 tchaikovsky arrived in saint petersburg in time

himself to musical sidelines and cui s critical missives had lost much of their sting for tchaikovsky rimsky korsakov was only one left who was fully active as a composer and much had changed in intervening years between him and tchaikovsky as a result of rimsky korsakov s change in musical values tchaikovsky had also changed more secure as a composer and less isolated personally than he had been in past tchaikovsky enjoyed company he now kept with glazunov lyadov and rimsky korsakov and found much to enjoy in their music brown final years 90 91 tchaikovsky admired several of pieces he heard during these concerts including rimsky korsakov s symphony and glazunov s second overture on greek themes he promised both glazunov and rimsky korsakov that he would secure performances of their works in concerts in moscow when these arrangements did not arise as planned tchaikovsky made urgent covert attempts to make good on his promises especially to rimsky korsakov whom he now called an outstanding figure worthy of every respect in december 1887 on eve of his departure to tour as a guest conductor through western europe tchaikovsky stopped in saint petersburg and consulted with glazunov lyadov and rimsky korsakov on a detailed program of russian music that he might lead in paris though this opportunity did not arise it shows his openness to promoting works by belyayev circle

unimpressed in 1882 publisher asked tchaikovsky s opinion about an arabesque for solo piano that lyadov had written tchaikovsky replied it is impossible to envisage any thing more vapid in content than this composer s music he has many interesting chords and harmonic sequences but not a single idea even of tiniest sort as quoted in brown final years 91 before meeting lyadov personally tchaikovsky may have been softening this stance he decided to present young composer a copy of score of his manfred symphony and once he had actually met person whom tchaikovsky authority david brown called indolent fastidious very private yet very engaging his attitude toward lyadov took a sharp turn for better younger composer became known as dear lyadov new confidence and advocacy two concerts tchaikovsky heard in saint petersburg in january 1889 where his music shared programs with compositions by new russian school as belyayev circle was also called proved a major watershed tchaikovsky recognized that while he had maintained good personal relations with some members of balakirev circle and perhaps some respect he had never been recognized as one of them now with his joint participation in these concerts he realized he was no longer excluded brown final years 172 he wrote to nadezhda von meck that while he found cui to be an individual deeply hateful to me this in no way hinders me from respecting or loving such representatives of school as balakirev rimsky korsakov lyadov glazunov or from considering myself flattered to appear on concert platform beside them as quoted in brown final years 90 91 this confession showed a wholehearted willingness for tchaikovsky to have his music heard alongside that of nationalists in giving this opinion tchaikovsky showed an implicit confidence in his own music and realization that it compared favorably to any number of their compositions he had nothing to fear from whatever comparisons might result brown final years 90 91 172 nor did he confine his views to private consumption tchaikovsky openly supported musical efforts of glazunov lyadov and rimsky korsakov despite a widely held view that they were musical enemies in an interview printed in weekly newspaper saint petersburg life zhizn in november 1892 he said according to view that is widespread among russian music public i am associated with party that is antagonistic to one living russian composer i love and value above all others nikolai rimsky korsakov in a word despite our different musical identities it would seem we are following a single path and i for my part am proud to have such a fellow traveler lyadov and glazunov are also numbered among my opponents yet i sincerely love and value their talent as quoted in poznansky eyes 207 208 with

tchaikovsky and were charmed by him poznansky quest 564 glazunov studied tchaikovsky s works and found much that was new that was instructive for us as young musicians it struck me that tchaikovsky who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies i admired thematic material of his works less than inspired unfolding of his thoughts his temperament and perfection quoted in lobanova 6 taruskin writes a sense of what tchaikovsky meant to glazunov may be gained by comparing latter s second symphony on which he was working at time of tchaikovsky s visit and third which he completed after a long gestation in 1890 and which he dedicated to tchaikovsky taruskin calls second symphony a veritable summa of with a number of stylistic fingerprints taken from balakirev borodin and rimsky korsakov with third symphony glazunov attempted to reach beyond nationalist style to reflect what he felt were universal forms moods and themes lobanova 6 tchaikovsky s influence is clear in work s lyrical episodes in its themes and key relations reminiscent of tchaikovsky s fourth and fifth symphonies taruskin 39 and in its orchestration full of dark doublings and subtle instrumental effects hearkening to tchaikovsky s style glazunov was not only composer among belyayev circle influenced by tchaikovsky s music rimsky korsakov wrote in his memoirs that a worship of tchaikovsky and a tendency toward eclecticism grew stronger among many of belyayev composers at this time along with a predilection for italian french music of time of

taruskin writes that seventh scene of rimsky korsakov s opera christmas eve written in 1895 is replete with wig and farthingale music based on second act of queen of spades taruskin 40 while he remained genial in public rimsky korsakov personally found situation with tchaikovsky more conflicting he was uncomfortable that tchaikovsky was becoming more popular among rimsky korsakov s followers and had developed a jealous resentment of tchaikovsky s greater fame holden 316 taruskin 39 he confessed his fears to his friend moscow critic semyon kruglikov writing that if tchaikovsky followed through with a contemplated move to saint petersburg a group of followers will immediately form around him which lyadov and glazunov will certainly join and after them many others o ur youth will drown and not only our youth look at lyadov in a sea of eclecticism that will rob them of their individuality as quoted in taruskin 19 20 about this eclecticism and tchaikovsky s part in it rimsky korsakov wrote in his memoirs seemingly matter of factly by this time quite an accretion of new elements and young blood had accumulated in belyayev s circle new times new birds new songs holden 316 yet to kruglikov he confessed in 1890 new times new birds new birds sic new songs except our birds are not so new and new songs they sing are worse than old ones as quoted in taruskin 70 even with these private reservations when tchaikovsky attended rimsky korsakov s party in may 1893 along with belyayev glazunov and lyadov rimsky korsakov asked tchaikovsky personally if he would conduct four concerts of russian musical society in saint petersburg following season after some hesitation tchaikovsky agreed brown final years 465 as a condition for tchaikovsky s engagement russian musical

musical life 341 legacy while belyayev circle remained a nationalistic school of composition its exposure to tchaikovsky and his music made it more readily amenable to western practices of composition producing works that were a synthesis of nationalist tradition and western technique overall however degree of influence tchaikovsky s music had on belyayev composers was short lived they generally continued stylistically from where five stopped falling back on cliches and mannerisms taken from works of rimsky korsakov and balakirev even in case of glazunov who was deeply influenced by tchaikovsky s music when he wrote his third symphony shadow of tchaikovsky would become less prevalent with his subsequent symphonies and he would reconcile it along with earlier influences of balakirev borodin and rimsky korsakov into an eclectic mature style schwarz new grove 2001 9 939 this eclecticism according to musicologist boris schwarz would effectively rob glazunov s music of ultimate stamp of originality and its academicism would tend to overpower glazunov s inspiration these traits would hold true for works by other belyayev composers as well with gradual of russian

approved by glazunov lyadov and rimsky korsakov that approved style maes writes included harmonies from coronation scene in mussorgsky s opera boris godunov colorful harmonization and of rimsky korsakov s operas mlada and and balakirev s folk song these elements served as a store of recipes for writing russian national music in portrayal of national character these techniques prevailed over subjects portrayed taruskin writes that echoing this style of writing became prime order of business with absolute music such as symphonies and chamber works preferred over program music favored by five and quasi oriental themes such as those used in balakirev s and rimsky korsakov s scheherazade scoffed at taruskin 71 trend toward writing in preferred style would continue at saint petersburg conservatory after rimsky korsakov s retirement in 1906 with his son in law maximilian steinberg in charge of composition classes at conservatory through 1920s wilson 37 dmitri shostakovich would

tatyana dated february 26 1924 as quoted in fay 24 kuchka short for moguchaya kuchka or mighty handful was another name for five eventually belyayev aesthetic spread as more of its composers took up

belyayevets realized importance of a solid academic grounding but they took importance of their conservatory training to extremes and devolved into academicism and they failed to take into account that tchaikovsky transcended what authority david brown calls heavy conditioning of his conservatory training through his innate russianness and his love of his own country s folk music brown new

five of a school to which all members would adhere but they took adherence to their school to point of mediocrity with a safe conformism becoming increasingly rule taruskin 57 this was point that composer cesar cui a former member of five made in his article fathers and sons in 1888 when he wrote despite frequent contact of all fathers with one another each of them preserved intact his individuality it is enough to glance at a single page of music by one of fathers to say with certainty that it is work of borodin balakirev mussorgsky tchaikovsky or rimsky korsakov music of sons is music of clones as quoted in taruskin 52 53 taruskin adds institutionalization and professionalization of musical life against which stasov had fought tooth and nail in 1860s was now a fait accompli
