significant depiction of battle historical accuracy of film was compromised to carry out plot of pretty girl shy hero and a villain while lieutenant dickenson was a real person and his wife was present at mission her name was suzanna suzanna dickenson and her infant daughter survived battle but there is no evidence of a mexican spy or a marriage attempt instead santa anna sent suzanna north

documentary based on its attempt at a faithful setting uses mexicans as a form of savages in melies cinematic motifs frank thompson s analysis of production notes states that william f haddock was delving into archives to produce an accurate depiction of alamo at studio because alamo itself was altered from time of battle thompson noted that despite battle being within living memory exact reproduction used a painted canvas backdrop and focused on an entirely fictional plot reception motography included a brief review of film which states this is indeed a well presented historical subject action has breadth and historical perspective with stirring scenes and large groupings and at same time there is a human plot threading its way through historical background and giving action a specific interest last scene showing santa anna s surrender as a common soldier is rather obscure one wonders why he did it in all other scenes action is clear and effective it would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to thrilling scene inside alamo moving picture worlds review stated that it is a very thrilling and altogether satisfactory reproduction of an important historical episode company deserves highest commendation for picture and way it is produced a negative review in column avoidable crudites by c h claudy in moving picture world found great faults with production claudy wrote one hardly conceives of a commander informed of approach of a column of enemy so far away they are only visible through field glasses getting sufficiently panic stricken to send immediately for help saying he is besieged by a thousand mexicans one imagines he would at least go look and see for himself and one resents a scene labelled attack which is so short one can t even look at all of it said attack being motionless men in a thin line pointing guns at alamo interior of alamo was well done yet do people stop a desperate defense to go through heroics about a line and fighting to death or do they fight to death without talking about it perhaps original fighters did go through that line drawn on floor stunt and agree among themselves to fight till they died but such desperate fighters didn t all stop fighting at once to discuss matter miss storey with a small part made most of it as usual and gave a convincing presentation of a woman in utter despair but she deserved a better and less crude setting than she received and so did her subject june 1911 issue of motion picture story magazine included an adapted story written by john eldridge chandos from scenario written by wilbert melville no known copies of film exist today and it is considered to be a lost film several movie stills of film immortal alamo film see also list of lost films references
