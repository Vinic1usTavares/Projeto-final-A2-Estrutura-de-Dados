remain bound by profession he made to anselm on his consecration as bishop of hereford gerard made this oath at council of westminster in 1107 it was a victory for canterbury but not a complete one as gerard avoided making a written profession and it was specific to gerard not to his office vaughn anselm of bec and robert of meulan pp 334 336 gerard continued to oppose anselm s attempts to assert canterbury s primacy but two were reconciled before gerard s death gerard also had an uneasy relationship with his cathedral chapter after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests he wrote to anselm in 1103 complaining of intransigence of his clergy and anselm s better relations with canterbury s chapter which was composed of monks instead of secular canons who made up york minster s chapter in this correspondence gerard complained that some of york canons refused to be ordained as priests thereby hoping to avoid taking vow of celibacy he also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at cathedral and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate canons argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others nicholl

chroniclers considered his ownership of a hebrew psalter to be disturbing seeing it as a sign of heresy or secret judaism among sins that malmesbury imputed to him was study of julius firmicus maternus a late roman astrologer every morning which to malmesbury meant that gerard was a sorcerer barlow english church 1066 1154 p 259 malmesbury further claimed that gerard was lewd and lustful in
