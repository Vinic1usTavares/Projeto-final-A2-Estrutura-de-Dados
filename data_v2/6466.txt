in mammals vagina is elastic muscular part of female genital tract in humans it extends from vulva to cervix outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a membrane called hymen at deep end cervix neck of uterus bulges into vagina vagina allows for sexual intercourse and birth it also channels menstrual flow menses which occurs in humans and closely related primates as part of monthly menstrual cycle although research on vagina is especially lacking for different animals its location structure and size are documented as varying among species female mammals usually have two external openings in vulva urethral opening for urinary tract and vaginal opening for genital tract this is different from male mammals who usually have a single urethral opening for both urination and reproduction vaginal opening is much larger than nearby urethral opening and both are protected by labia in humans in amphibians birds reptiles and monotremes cloaca is single external opening for gastrointestinal tract urinary and reproductive tracts to accommodate smoother penetration of vagina during sexual intercourse or other sexual activity vaginal moisture increases during sexual arousal in human females and other female mammals this increase in moisture provides vaginal lubrication which reduces friction texture of vaginal walls creates friction for penis during sexual intercourse and stimulates it toward ejaculation enabling fertilization along with pleasure and bonding women s sexual behavior with others which can include heterosexual or lesbian sexual activity can result in sexually transmitted infections stis risk of which can be reduced by recommended safe sex practices other health issues may also affect human vagina vagina and vulva have evoked strong reactions in societies throughout history including negative perceptions and language cultural taboos and their use as symbols for female sexuality spirituality or regeneration of life in common speech word vagina is often used to refer to vulva or to female genitals in general by its dictionary and anatomical definitions however vagina refers exclusively to specific internal structure and understanding distinction can improve knowledge of female genitalia and aid in healthcare communication etymology and definition term vagina is from latin meaning sheath or scabbard plural of vagina is either or vaginas vagina may also be referred to as birth canal in context of pregnancy and childbirth although by its dictionary and anatomical definitions term vagina refers exclusively to specific internal structure it is colloquially used to refer to vulva or to both vagina and vulva using term vagina to mean vulva can pose medical or legal confusion for example a person s interpretation of its location might not match another s interpretation of location medically vagina is canal between hymen or remnants of hymen and cervix while legally it begins at vulva between labia it may be that incorrect use of term vagina is due to not as much thought going into anatomy of female genitals as has gone into study of male genitals and that this has contributed to an absence of correct vocabulary for external female genitalia among both general public and health professionals because of this and because a better understanding of female genitalia can help combat sexual and psychological harm with regard to female development researchers endorse correct terminology for vulva structure gross anatomy thumb upright 1 36 alt diagram illustrating female pelvic anatomy pelvic anatomy including organs of female reproductive system human vagina is an elastic muscular canal that extends from vulva to cervix opening of vagina lies in urogenital triangle urogenital triangle is front triangle of and also consists of urethral opening and associated parts of external genitalia vaginal canal travels upwards and backwards between urethra at front and rectum at back near upper vagina cervix protrudes into vagina on its front surface at approximately a 90 degree angle vaginal and urethral openings are protected by labia when not sexually aroused vagina is a collapsed tube with front and back walls placed together lateral walls especially their middle area are relatively more rigid because of this collapsed vagina has an h shaped cross section behind inner vagina is separated from rectum by recto uterine pouch middle vagina by loose connective tissue and lower vagina by perineal body where vaginal lumen surrounds cervix of uterus it is divided into four continuous regions vaginal fornices these are anterior posterior right lateral and left lateral fornices posterior fornix is deeper than anterior fornix supporting vagina are its upper middle and lower third muscles and ligaments upper third are levator ani muscles and and ligaments it is supported by upper portions of cardinal ligaments and middle third of vagina involves urogenital diaphragm it is supported by levator ani muscles and lower portion of cardinal ligaments lower third is supported by perineal body or urogenital and pelvic diaphragms lower third may also be described as being supported by perineal body and part of levator ani muscle vaginal opening and hymen vaginal opening is at posterior end of vulval vestibule behind urethral opening opening to vagina is normally obscured by labia minora vaginal lips but may be exposed after vaginal delivery hymen is a membrane of tissue that surrounds or partially covers vaginal opening effects of intercourse and childbirth on hymen are variable where it is broken it may completely disappear or remnants known as may persist otherwise being very elastic it may return to its normal position additionally hymen may be lacerated by disease injury medical examination masturbation or physical exercise for these reasons virginity cannot be definitively determined by examining hymen variations and size length of vagina varies among women of child bearing age because of presence of cervix in front wall of vagina there is a difference in length between front wall approximately 7 5 cm 2 5 to 3 in long and back wall approximately 9 cm 3 5 in long during sexual arousal vagina expands both in length and width if a woman stands upright vaginal canal points in an upward backward direction and forms an angle of approximately 45 degrees with uterus vaginal opening and hymen also vary in size in children although hymen commonly appears crescent shaped many shapes are possible development right thumb alt drawn anatomic illustration as described in caption an illustration showing a cut away portion of vagina and upper female genital tract only one ovary and fallopian tube shown circular folds also called rugae of vaginal mucosa can be seen vaginal plate is precursor to vagina during development vaginal plate begins to grow where fused ends of ducts mullerian ducts enter back wall of urogenital sinus as sinus tubercle as plate grows it significantly separates cervix and urogenital sinus eventually central cells of plate break down to form vaginal lumen this usually occurs by twenty to twenty fourth week of development if lumen does not form or is incomplete membranes known as vaginal septae can form across or around tract causing obstruction of outflow tract later in life during sexual differentiation without testosterone urogenital sinus persists as vestibule of vagina two urogenital folds of genital tubercle form labia minora and swellings enlarge to form labia majora there are conflicting views on origin of vagina majority view is koff s 1933 description which posits that upper two thirds of vagina originate from caudal part of mullerian duct while lower part of vagina develops from urogenital sinus other views are bulmer s 1957 s description that vaginal epithelium derives solely from urogenital sinus epithelium and witschi s 1970 research which reexamined koff s description and concluded that bulbs are same as lower portions of ducts witschi s view is supported by research by et al bok and drews et al reviewed koff and bulmer s theories and support bulmer s description in light of their own research debates stem from complexity of interrelated tissues and absence of an animal model that matches human vaginal development because of this study of human vaginal development is ongoing and may help resolve conflicting data microanatomy thumb alt micrograph of vaginal wall medium power magnification micrograph of a h e stained slide showing a portion of a vaginal wall stratified squamous epithelium and underling connective tissue can be seen deeper muscular layers are not shown black line points to a fold in mucosa vaginal wall from lumen outwards consists firstly of a mucosa of stratified squamous epithelium that is not keratinized with a lamina propria a thin layer of connective tissue underneath it secondly there is a layer of smooth muscle with bundles of circular fibers internal to longitudinal fibers those that run lengthwise lastly is an outer layer of connective tissue called adventitia some texts list four layers by counting two of mucosa epithelium and lamina propria separately smooth muscular layer within vagina has a weak contractive force that can create some pressure in lumen of vagina much stronger contractive force such as during childbirth comes from muscles in pelvic floor that are attached to adventitia around vagina lamina propria is rich in blood vessels and lymphatic channels muscular layer is composed of smooth muscle fibers with an outer layer of longitudinal muscle an inner layer of circular muscle and oblique muscle fibers between outer layer adventitia is a thin dense layer of connective tissue and it blends with loose connective tissue containing blood vessels lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers that are between pelvic organs vaginal mucosa is absent of glands it forms folds transverse ridges or rugae which are more prominent in outer third of vagina their function is to provide vagina with increased surface area for extension and stretching thumb alt close up photograph of vagina folds of mucosa or vaginal rugae are shown in front third of a vagina epithelium of portion uterine cervix extending into vagina is an extension of and shares a border with vaginal epithelium vaginal epithelium is made up of layers of cells including basal cells cells superficial squamous flat cells and intermediate cells basal layer of epithelium is most active and reproduces new cells superficial cells shed continuously and basal cells replace them estrogen induces intermediate and superficial cells to fill with glycogen cells from lower basal layer transition from active metabolic activity to death apoptosis in these mid layers of epithelia cells begin to lose their mitochondria and other organelles cells retain a usually high level of glycogen compared to other epithelial tissue in body under influence of maternal estrogen vagina of a newborn is lined by thick stratified squamous epithelium or mucosa for two to four weeks after birth between then to puberty epithelium remains thin with only a few layers of cuboidal cells without glycogen epithelium also has few rugae and is red in color before puberty when puberty begins mucosa thickens and again becomes stratified squamous epithelium with glycogen containing cells under influence of girl s rising estrogen levels finally epithelium thins out from menopause onward and eventually ceases to contain glycogen because of lack of estrogen flattened squamous cells are more resistant to both abrasion and infection permeability of epithelium allows for an effective response from immune system since antibodies and other immune components can easily reach surface vaginal epithelium differs from similar tissue of skin epidermis of skin is relatively resistant to water because it contains high levels of lipids vaginal epithelium contains lower levels of lipids this allows passage of water and water soluble substances through tissue keratinization happens when epithelium is exposed to dry external atmosphere in abnormal circumstances such as in pelvic organ prolapse mucosa may be exposed to air becoming dry and keratinized blood and nerve supply blood is supplied to vagina mainly via vaginal artery which emerges from a branch of internal iliac artery or uterine artery vaginal arteries are joined along side of vagina with cervical branch of uterine artery this forms artery which lies on midline of anterior and posterior vagina other arteries which supply vagina include middle rectal artery and internal pudendal artery all branches of internal iliac artery three groups of lymphatic vessels accompany these arteries upper group accompanies vaginal branches of uterine artery a middle group accompanies vaginal arteries and lower group draining lymph from area outside hymen drain to inguinal lymph nodes ninety five percent of lymphatic channels of vagina are within 3 mm of surface of vagina two main veins drain blood from vagina one on left and one on right these form a network of smaller veins vaginal venous plexus on sides of vagina connecting with similar venous of uterus bladder and rectum these ultimately drain into internal iliac veins nerve supply of upper vagina is provided by sympathetic and parasympathetic areas of pelvic plexus lower vagina is supplied by pudendal nerve function secretions vaginal secretions are primarily from uterus cervix and vaginal epithelium in addition to minuscule vaginal lubrication from bartholin s glands upon sexual arousal it takes little vaginal secretion to make vagina moist secretions may increase during sexual arousal middle of or a little prior to menstruation or during pregnancy menstruation also known as a period or monthly is regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue known as menses from inner lining of uterus through vagina vaginal mucous membrane varies in thickness and composition during menstrual cycle which is regular natural change that occurs in female reproductive system specifically uterus and ovaries that makes pregnancy possible different hygiene products such as tampons menstrual cups and sanitary napkins are available to absorb or capture menstrual blood bartholin s glands located near vaginal opening were originally considered primary source for vaginal lubrication but further examination showed that they provide only a few drops of mucus vaginal lubrication is mostly provided by plasma seepage known as transudate from vaginal walls this initially forms as sweat like droplets and is caused by increased fluid pressure in tissue of vagina resulting in release of plasma as transudate from capillaries through vaginal epithelium before and during ovulation mucus glands within cervix secrete different variations of mucus which provides an alkaline fertile environment in vaginal canal that is favorable to survival of sperm following menopause vaginal lubrication naturally decreases sexual activity nerve endings in vagina can provide pleasurable sensations when vagina is stimulated during sexual activity women may derive pleasure from one part of vagina or from a feeling of closeness and fullness during vaginal penetration because vagina is not rich in nerve endings women often do not receive sufficient sexual stimulation or orgasm solely from vaginal penetration although literature commonly cites a greater concentration of nerve endings and therefore greater sensitivity near vaginal entrance outer one third or lower third some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation indicate no single area with a greater density of nerve endings other research indicates that only some women have a greater density of nerve endings in anterior vaginal wall because of fewer nerve endings in vagina childbirth pain is significantly more tolerable pleasure can be derived from vagina in a variety of ways in addition to penile penetration pleasure can come from masturbation fingering oral sex cunnilingus or specific sex positions such as missionary position or spoons sex position heterosexual couples may engage in cunnilingus or fingering as forms of foreplay to incite sexual arousal or as accompanying acts or as a type of birth control or to preserve virginity see 272 and page 301 for two different definitions of first of pages for no penetration definition second of pages for no penile penetration definition less commonly they may use non penile vaginal sexual acts as a primary means of sexual pleasure by contrast lesbians and other women who have sex with women commonly engage in cunnilingus or fingering as main forms of sexual activity some women and couples use sex toys such as a vibrator or dildo for vaginal pleasure kama sutra an ancient hindu text written by which includes a number of sexual positions may also be used to increase sexual pleasure with special emphasis on female sexual satisfaction most women require direct stimulation of clitoris to orgasm clitoris plays a part in vaginal stimulation it is a sex organ of structure containing an abundance of nerve endings with a broad attachment to pubic arch and extensive supporting tissue to labia research indicates that it forms a tissue cluster with vagina this tissue is perhaps more extensive in some women than in others which may contribute to orgasms experienced vaginally during sexual arousal and particularly stimulation of clitoris walls of vagina lubricate this begins after ten to thirty seconds of sexual arousal and increases in amount longer woman is aroused it reduces friction or injury that can be caused by insertion of penis into vagina or other penetration of vagina during sexual activity vagina lengthens during arousal and can continue to lengthen in response to pressure as woman becomes fully aroused vagina expands in length and width while cervix retracts with upper two thirds of vagina expanding and lengthening uterus rises into greater pelvis and cervix is elevated above vaginal floor resulting in tenting of mid vaginal plane this is known as tenting or ballooning effect as elastic walls of vagina stretch or contract with support from pelvic muscles to wrap around inserted penis or other object this creates friction for penis and helps to cause a man to experience orgasm and ejaculation which in turn enables fertilization an area in vagina that may be an erogenous zone is g spot it is typically defined as being located at anterior wall of vagina a couple or few inches in from entrance and some women experience intense pleasure and sometimes an orgasm if this area is stimulated during sexual activity a g spot orgasm may be responsible for female ejaculation leading some doctors and researchers to believe that g spot pleasure comes from skene s glands a female homologue of prostate rather than any particular spot on vaginal wall other researchers consider connection between skene s glands and g spot area to be weak g spot s existence and existence as a distinct structure is still under dispute because reports of its location can vary from woman to woman it appears to be nonexistent in some women and it is hypothesized to be an extension of clitoris and therefore reason for orgasms experienced vaginally childbirth vagina is birth canal for delivery of a baby when labor a physiological process preceding delivery nears several signs may occur including vaginal discharge and rupture of membranes water breaking that can result in a gush of amniotic fluid or an irregular or small stream of fluid from vagina water breaking most commonly happens during labor however it can occur before labor known as premature rupture of membranes and this happens in 10 of cases braxton hicks contractions are also a sign of nearing labor but not all women notice them among women giving birth for first time braxton hicks contractions are mistaken for actual contractions and are usually very strong in days leading up to labor as body prepares for childbirth cervix softens thins moves forward to face front and begins to open this allows fetus to settle or drop into pelvis as fetus settles into pelvis pain from sciatic nerves increased vaginal discharge and increased urinary frequency can occur while these symptoms are likelier to happen after labor has begun for women who have given birth before they may happen ten to fourteen days before labor in women experiencing labor for first time fetus begins to lose support of cervix when contractions begin with cervical dilation reaching a diameter of more than to accommodate head of fetus head moves from uterus to vagina elasticity of vagina allows it to stretch to many times its normal diameter in order to deliver child vaginal births are more common but if there is a risk of complications a caesarean section c section may be performed vaginal mucosa has an abnormal accumulation of fluid edematous and is thin with few rugae a little after birth mucosa thickens and rugae return in approximately three weeks once ovaries regain usual function and estrogen flow is restored vaginal opening gapes and is relaxed until it returns to its approximate pre pregnant state six to eight weeks after delivery known as postpartum period however vagina will continue to be larger in size than it was previously after giving birth there is a phase of vaginal discharge called that can vary significantly in amount of loss and its duration but can go on for up to six weeks vaginal microbiota vaginal flora is a complex ecosystem that changes throughout life from birth to menopause vaginal microbiota resides in and on outermost layer of vaginal epithelium this microbiome consists of species and genera which typically do not cause symptoms or infections in women with normal immunity vaginal microbiome is dominated by lactobacillus species these species metabolize glycogen breaking it down into sugar lactobacilli metabolize sugar into glucose and lactic acid under influence of hormones such as estrogen progesterone and follicle stimulating hormone fsh vaginal ecosystem undergoes cyclic or periodic changes clinical significance pelvic examinations thumb right alt photograph of a transparent speculum

examination along with health of most of organs of female reproductive system such exams may include pap test or cervical smear in united states pap test screening is recommended starting around 21 years of age until age of 65 however other countries do not recommend pap testing in non sexually active women guidelines on frequency vary from every three to five years routine pelvic examination on adult women who are not pregnant and lack symptoms may be more harmful than beneficial free text a normal finding during pelvic exam of a pregnant women is a bluish tinge to vaginal wall pelvic exams are most often performed when there are unexplained symptoms of discharge pain unexpected bleeding or urinary problems during a pelvic exam vaginal opening is assessed for position symmetry presence of hymen and shape vagina is assessed internally by examiner with gloved fingers before speculum is inserted to note presence of any weakness lumps or nodules inflammation and discharge are noted if present during this time skene s and bartolin s glands are to identify abnormalities in these structures after digital examination of vagina is complete speculum an instrument to visualize internal structures is carefully inserted to make cervix visible examination of vagina may also be done during a cavity search lacerations or other injuries to vagina can occur during sexual assault or other sexual abuse these can be tears bruises inflammation and abrasions sexual assault with objects can damage vagina and x ray examination may reveal presence of foreign objects if consent is given a pelvic examination is part of assessment of sexual assault pelvic exams are also performed during pregnancy and women with high risk pregnancies have exams more often medications administration is a route of administration where medication is inserted into vagina as a creme or tablet pharmacologically this has potential advantage of promoting therapeutic effects primarily in vagina or nearby structures such as vaginal portion of cervix with limited systemic adverse effects compared to other routes of administration medications used to ripen cervix and induce labor are commonly administered via this route as are estrogens contraceptive agents propranolol and antifungals vaginal rings can also be used to deliver medication including birth control in contraceptive vaginal rings these are inserted into vagina and provide continuous low dose and consistent drug levels in vagina and throughout body before baby merges from womb an injection for pain control during childbirth may be administered through vaginal wall and near pudendal nerve because pudendal nerve carries motor and sensory fibers that innervate pelvic muscles a pudendal nerve block relieves birth pain medicine does not harm child and is without significant complications infections diseases and safe sex vaginal infections or diseases include yeast infection vaginitis sexually transmitted infections stis and cancer lactobacillus and other lactobacillus species in vaginal flora provide some protection from infections by their secretion of and hydrogen peroxide healthy vagina of a woman of child bearing age is acidic with a ph normally ranging between 3 8 and 4 5 low ph prohibits growth of many strains of pathogenic microbes acidic balance of vagina may also be affected by pregnancy menstruation diabetes or other illness birth control pills certain antibiotics poor diet and stress such as from a lack of sleep any of these changes to acidic balance of vagina may contribute to yeast infection an elevated ph greater than 4 5 of vaginal fluid can be caused by an overgrowth of bacteria as in bacterial vaginosis or in parasitic infection trichomoniasis both of which have vaginitis as a symptom vaginal flora populated by a number of different bacteria characteristic of bacterial vaginosis increases risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes during a pelvic exam samples of vaginal fluids may be taken to screen for sexually transmitted infections or other infections because vagina is self cleansing it usually does not need special hygiene clinicians generally discourage practice of douching for maintaining health since vaginal flora gives protection against disease a disturbance of this balance may lead to infection and abnormal discharge vaginal discharge may indicate a vaginal infection by color and odor or resulting symptoms of discharge such as irritation or burning abnormal vaginal discharge may be caused by stis diabetes douches soaps bubble baths birth control pills yeast infection commonly as a result of antibiotic use or another form of vaginitis while vaginitis is an inflammation of vagina and is attributed to infection hormonal issues or irritants is an involuntary tightening of vagina muscles during vaginal penetration that is caused by a conditioned reflex or disease vaginal discharge due to yeast infection is usually thick creamy in color and odorless while discharge due to bacterial vaginosis is gray white in color and discharge due to trichomoniasis is usually a gray color thin in consistency and has a fishy odor discharge in 25 of trichomoniasis cases is yellow green hiv aids human papillomavirus hpv genital herpes and trichomoniasis are some stis that may affect vagina and health sources recommend safe sex or barrier method practices to prevent transmission of these and other stis safe sex commonly involves use of condoms and sometimes female condoms which give women more control both types can help avert pregnancy by preventing semen from coming in contact with vagina there is however little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing stis and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy which may be because female condom fits less tightly than male condom or because it can slip into vagina and spill semen vaginal lymph nodes often trap cancerous cells that originate in vagina these nodes can be assessed for presence of disease selective surgical removal rather than total and more invasive removal of vaginal lymph nodes reduces risk of complications that can accompany more radical surgeries these selective nodes act as sentinel lymph nodes instead of surgery lymph nodes of concern are sometimes treated with radiation therapy administered to patient s pelvic inguinal lymph nodes or both vaginal cancer and vulvar cancer are very rare and primarily affect older women cervical cancer which is relatively common increases risk of vaginal cancer which is why there is a significant chance for vaginal cancer to occur at same time as or after cervical cancer it may be that their causes are same cervical cancer may be prevented by pap smear screening and hpv vaccines but hpv vaccines only cover hpv types 16 and 18 cause of 70 of cervical cancers some symptoms of cervical and vaginal cancer are dyspareunia and abnormal vaginal bleeding or vaginal discharge especially after sexual intercourse or menopause however most cervical cancers are asymptomatic present no symptoms vaginal brachytherapy vbt is used to treat endometrial vaginal and cervical cancer an applicator is inserted into vagina to allow administration of radiation as close to site of cancer as possible survival rates increase with vbt when compared to external beam radiation therapy by using vagina to place emitter as close to cancerous growth as possible systemic effects of radiation therapy are reduced and cure rates for vaginal cancer are higher research is unclear on whether treating cervical cancer with radiation therapy increases risk of vaginal cancer effects of aging and childbirth age and hormone levels significantly correlate with ph of vagina estrogen glycogen and lactobacilli impact these levels at birth vagina is acidic with a ph of approximately 4 5 and ceases to be acidic by three to six weeks of age becoming alkaline average vaginal ph is 7 0 in pre pubertal girls although there is a high degree of variability in timing girls who are approximately seven to twelve years of age will continue to have labial development as hymen thickens and vagina elongates to approximately 8 cm vaginal mucosa thickens and vaginal ph becomes acidic again girls may also experience a thin white vaginal discharge called vaginal microbiota of adolescent girls aged 13 to 18 years is similar to women of reproductive age who have an average vaginal ph of 3 8 4 5 but research is not as clear on whether this is same for or girls vaginal ph during menopause is 6 5 7 0 without hormone replacement therapy or 4 5 5 0 with hormone replacement therapy thumb alt side by side illustration depicting thinning effects of menopause on of vaginal wall pre menopausal vaginal mucosa left versus menopausal vaginal mucosa right after menopause body produces less estrogen this causes atrophic vaginitis thinning and inflammation of vaginal walls which can lead to vaginal itching burning bleeding soreness or vaginal dryness a decrease in lubrication vaginal dryness can cause discomfort on its own or discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse hot flashes are also characteristic of menopause menopause also affects composition of vaginal support structures vascular structures become fewer with advancing age specific become altered in composition and ratios it is thought that weakening of support structures of vagina is due to physiological changes in this connective tissue menopausal symptoms can be eased by estrogen containing vaginal creams non prescription non hormonal medications vaginal estrogen rings such as or other hormone replacement therapies but there are risks including adverse effects associated with hormone replacement therapy vaginal creams and vaginal estrogen rings may not have same risks as other hormone replacement treatments hormone replacement therapy can treat vaginal dryness but a personal lubricant may be used to temporarily remedy vaginal dryness specifically for sexual intercourse some women have an increase in sexual desire following menopause it may be that menopausal women who continue to engage in sexual activity regularly experience vaginal lubrication similar to levels in women who have not entered menopause and can enjoy sexual intercourse fully they may have less vaginal atrophy and fewer problems concerning sexual intercourse vaginal changes that happen with aging and childbirth include mucosal redundancy rounding of posterior aspect of vagina with shortening of distance from distal end of anal canal to vaginal opening or disruption of muscles caused by poor repair of an episiotomy and blebs that may protrude beyond area of vaginal opening other vaginal changes related to aging and childbirth are stress urinary incontinence rectocele and cystocele physical changes resulting from pregnancy childbirth and menopause often contribute to stress urinary incontinence if a woman has weak pelvic floor muscle support and tissue damage from childbirth or pelvic surgery a lack of estrogen can further weaken pelvic muscles and contribute to stress urinary incontinence pelvic organ prolapse such as a rectocele or cystocele is characterized by descent of pelvic organs from their normal positions to impinge upon vagina a reduction in estrogen does not cause rectocele cystocele or uterine prolapse but childbirth and weakness in pelvic support structures can prolapse may also occur when pelvic floor becomes injured during a hysterectomy gynecological cancer treatment or heavy lifting pelvic floor exercises such as kegel exercises can be used to strengthen pelvic floor muscles preventing or arresting progression of prolapse there is no evidence that doing kegel exercises or with some form of weight is superior there are greater risks with using weights since a foreign object is introduced into vagina during third stage of labor while infant is being born vagina undergoes significant changes a gush of blood from vagina may be seen right before baby is born lacerations to vagina that can occur during birth vary in depth severity and amount of adjacent tissue involvement laceration can be so extensive as to involve rectum and anus this event can be especially distressing to a new mother when this occurs fecal incontinence develops and stool can leave through vagina close to 85 of spontaneous vaginal births develop some form of tearing out of these 60 70 require suturing lacerations from labor do not always occur surgery vagina including vaginal opening may be altered as a result of surgeries such as an episiotomy vaginectomy vaginoplasty or labiaplasty those who undergo vaginoplasty are usually older and have given birth a thorough examination of vagina before a vaginoplasty is standard as well as a referral to a to diagnose possible vaginal disorders with regard to labiaplasty reduction of labia minora is quick without hindrance complications are minor and rare and can be corrected any scarring from procedure is minimal and long term problems have not been identified during an episiotomy a surgical incision is made during second stage of labor to enlarge vaginal opening for baby to pass through although its routine use is no longer recommended and not having an episiotomy is found to have better results than an episiotomy it is one of most common medical procedures performed on women incision is made through skin vaginal epithelium subcutaneous fat perineal body and superficial transverse perineal muscle and extends from vagina to anus episiotomies can be painful after delivery women often report pain during sexual intercourse up to three months after laceration repair or an episiotomy some surgical techniques result in less pain than others two types of episiotomies performed are medial incision and medio lateral incision median incision is a perpendicular cut between vagina and anus and is most common medio lateral incision is made between vagina at an angle and is not as likely to tear through to anus medio lateral cut takes more time to heal than median cut vaginectomy is surgery to remove all or part of vagina and is usually used to treat malignancy removal of some or all of reproductive organs and genitalia can result in damage to nerves and leave behind scarring or adhesions sexual function may also be impaired as a result as in case of some cervical cancer surgeries these surgeries can impact pain elasticity vaginal lubrication and sexual arousal this often resolves after one year but may take longer women especially those who are older and have had multiple births may choose to surgically correct vaginal laxity this surgery has been described as vaginal tightening or rejuvenation while a woman may experience an improvement in self image and sexual pleasure by undergoing vaginal tightening or rejuvenation there are risks associated with procedures including infection narrowing of vaginal opening insufficient tightening decreased sexual function such as pain during sexual intercourse and fistula women who undergo this procedure may unknowingly have a medical issue such as a prolapse and an attempt to correct this is also made during surgery surgery on vagina can be elective or cosmetic women who seek cosmetic surgery can have congenital conditions physical discomfort or wish to alter appearance of their genitals concerns over average genital appearance or measurements are largely unavailable and make defining a successful outcome for such surgery difficult a number of sex reassignment surgeries are available to transgender people although not all intersex conditions require surgical treatment some choose genital surgery to correct atypical anatomical conditions anomalies and other health issues right thumb alt depicting urinary bladder at top above uterus to its bottom left and vagina to its bottom right an ultrasound showing urinary bladder 1 uterus 2 and vagina 3 vaginal anomalies are defects that result in an abnormal or absent vagina most common obstructive vaginal anomaly is an imperforate hymen a condition in which hymen obstructs menstrual flow or other vaginal secretions another vaginal anomaly is a transverse vaginal septum which partially or completely blocks vaginal canal precise cause of an obstruction must be determined before it is repaired since corrective surgery differs depending on cause in some cases such as isolated vaginal agenesis external genitalia may appear normal abnormal openings known as fistulas can cause urine or feces to enter vagina resulting in incontinence vagina is susceptible to fistula formation because of its proximity to urinary and gastrointestinal tracts specific causes are manifold and include obstructed labor hysterectomy malignancy radiation episiotomy and bowel disorders a small number of vaginal fistulas are congenital various surgical methods are employed to repair fistulas untreated fistulas can result in significant disability and have a profound impact on quality of life vaginal evisceration is a serious complication of a vaginal hysterectomy and occurs when vaginal cuff ruptures allowing small intestine to protrude from vagina cysts may also affect vagina various types of vaginal cysts can develop on surface of vaginal epithelium or in deeper layers of vagina and can grow to be as large as 7 cm often they are an incidental finding during a routine pelvic examination vaginal cysts can mimic other structures that protrude from vagina such as a rectocele and cystocele cysts that can be present include mullerian cysts gartner s duct cysts and cysts a vaginal cyst is most likely to develop in women between ages of 30 to 40 it is estimated that 1 out of 200 women has a vaginal cyst bartholin s cyst is of vulvar rather than vaginal origin but it presents as a lump at vaginal opening it is more common in younger women and is usually without symptoms but it can cause pain if an abscess forms block entrance to vulval vestibule if large and impede walking or cause painful sexual intercourse society and culture perceptions symbolism and vulgarity various perceptions of vagina have existed throughout history including belief it is center of sexual desire a metaphor for life via birth inferior to penis unappealing to sight or smell or vulgar these views can largely be attributed to sex differences and how they are interpreted david buss an evolutionary psychologist stated that because a penis is significantly larger than a clitoris and is readily visible while vagina is not and males urinate through penis boys are taught from childhood to touch their penises while girls are often taught that they should not touch their own genitalia which implies that there is harm in doing so buss attributed this as reason many women are not as familiar with their genitalia and that researchers assume these sex differences explain why boys learn to masturbate before girls and do so more often word vagina is commonly avoided in conversation and many people are confused about vagina s anatomy and may be unaware that it is not used for urination this is exacerbated by phrases such as boys have a penis girls have a vagina which causes children to think that girls have one orifice in pelvic area author hilda hutcherson stated because many women have been conditioned since childhood through verbal and nonverbal cues to think of their genitals as ugly smelly and unclean they aren t able to fully enjoy intimate encounters because of fear that their partner will dislike sight smell or taste of their genitals she argued that women unlike men did not have locker room experiences in school where they compared each other s genitals which is one reason so many women wonder if their genitals are normal scholar catherine blackledge stated that having a vagina meant she would typically be treated less well than her vagina less counterparts and subject to inequalities such as job inequality which she categorized as being treated like a second class citizen

dong vietnam negative views of vagina are simultaneously contrasted by views that it is a powerful symbol of female sexuality spirituality or life author denise linn stated that vagina is a powerful symbol of openness acceptance and receptivity it is inner valley spirit sigmund freud placed significant value on vagina postulating concept that vaginal orgasm is separate from clitoral orgasm and that upon reaching puberty proper response of mature women is a changeover to vaginal orgasms meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation this theory made many women feel inadequate as majority of women cannot achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone regarding religion vagina represents a powerful symbol as yoni in hinduism and this may indicate value that hindu society has given female sexuality and vagina s ability to deliver life while in ancient times vagina was often considered equivalent homologous to penis with anatomists galen 129 ad 200 ad and vesalius 1514 1564 regarding organs as structurally same except for vagina being inverted anatomical studies over latter centuries showed clitoris to be penile equivalent another perception of vagina was that release of vaginal fluids would cure or remedy a number of ailments various methods were used over centuries to release female seed via vaginal lubrication or female ejaculation as a treatment for suffocation of womb suffocation from retained seed green sickness and possibly for female hysteria reported methods for treatment included a midwife rubbing walls of vagina or insertion of penis or penis shaped objects into vagina symptoms of female hysteria diagnosis a concept that is no longer recognized by medical authorities as a medical disorder included faintness nervousness insomnia fluid retention heaviness in abdomen muscle spasm shortness of breath irritability loss of appetite for food or sex and a propensity for causing trouble it may be that women who were considered suffering from female hysteria

severe form is type iii fgm which is infibulation and involves removing all or part of labia and vagina being closed up a small hole is left for passage of urine and menstrual blood and vagina is opened up for sexual intercourse and childbirth significant controversy surrounds female genital mutilation with world health organization who and other health organizations campaigning against procedures on behalf of human rights stating that it is a violation of human rights of girls and women and reflects deep rooted inequality between sexes female genital mutilation has existed at one point or another in almost all human civilizations most commonly to exert control over sexual behavior including masturbation of girls and women it is carried out in several countries especially in africa and to a lesser extent in other parts of middle east and southeast asia on girls from a few days old to mid adolescent often to reduce sexual desire in an effort to preserve vaginal virginity comfort stated it may be that female genital mutilation was practiced in ancient egypt as a sign of distinction among aristocracy there are reports that traces of infibulation are on egyptian mummies custom and tradition are most frequently cited reasons for practice of female genital mutilation some cultures believe that female genital mutilation is part of a girl s initiation into adulthood and that not performing it can disrupt social and political cohesion in these societies a girl is often not considered an adult unless she has undergone procedure other animals thumb a sheep gives birth by vagina vagina is a structure of animals in which female is internally fertilized rather than by traumatic insemination used by some invertebrates shape of vagina varies among different animals in placental mammals and marsupials vagina leads from uterus to exterior of female body female marsupials have two lateral vaginas which lead to separate uteri but both open externally through same orifice a third canal which is known as median vagina and can be transitory or permanent is used for birth female spotted hyena does not have an external vaginal opening instead vagina exits through clitoris allowing females to urinate copulate and give birth through clitoris vagina of female coyote contracts during copulation forming a copulatory tie birds monotremes and some reptiles have a part of oviduct that leads to cloaca chickens have a vaginal aperture that opens from vertical apex of cloaca vagina extends upward from aperture and becomes egg gland in some jawless fish there is neither oviduct nor vagina and instead egg travels directly through body cavity and is fertilised externally as in most fish and amphibians in insects and other invertebrates vagina can be a part of

structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils to protect themselves from sexual coercion brennan p l r clark c j prum r o explosive eversion and functional morphology of duck penis supports sexual conflict in waterfowl genitalia proceedings biological sciences 277 1309 14 2010 a lack of research on vagina and other female genitalia especially for different animals has stifled knowledge on female sexual anatomy one explanation for why male genitalia is studied more includes penises being significantly simpler to analyze than female genital cavities because male genitals usually protrude and are therefore easier to assess and measure by contrast female genitals are more often concealed and require more dissection which in turn requires more time another explanation is that a main function of penis is to impregnate while female genitals may alter shape upon interaction with male organs especially as to benefit or hinder reproductive success non human primates are optimal models for human biomedical research because humans and non human primates share physiological characteristics as a result of evolution while menstruation is heavily associated with human females and they have most pronounced menstruation it is also typical of ape relatives and monkeys female macaques with a cycle length over course of a lifetime that is comparable to that of female humans estrogens and progestogens in menstrual cycles and during and are also similar in female humans and macaques however only in macaques does keratinization of epithelium occur during follicular phase vaginal ph of macaques also differs with near neutral to slightly alkaline median values and is widely variable which may be due to its lack of lactobacilli in vaginal flora this is one reason why although macaques are used for studying hiv transmission and testing microbicides animal models are not often used in study of sexually transmitted infections such as trichomoniasis another is that such conditions causes are inextricably bound to humans genetic makeup making results from other species difficult to apply to humans see also artificial vagina gynoecium portion of cervix uterine
