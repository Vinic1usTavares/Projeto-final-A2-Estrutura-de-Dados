siege of viborg took place in spring of 1710 during great northern war 1700 1721 as a second attempt by russians to capture fortress port of viborg vyborg near modern border between russia and finland after a failed attempt in 1706 after outbreak of war swedish forces had fortified themselves in port of viborg in order to assure safety for newly founded city of saint petersburg peter great ordered swedish fort to be secured a first unsuccessful attempt was made in 1706 later plans were put on hold because of other ongoing conflicts but after russian success at battle of poltava in june 1709 men and resources were available to capture town thirteen thousand troops under general admiral fyodor apraksin marched to viborg and laid siege on 22 march 1710 magnus stiernstrale swedish commander at fort waited in vain for swedish assistance while a stalemate ensued because russians lacked sufficient artillery in april peter great managed to bring through a fleet of 250 ships to deliver guns and supplies and to help perform a final assault on swedish positions after these russian attacks swedish garrison surrendered on 12 june 1710 background thumb a 1709 engraving showing schloss castle on

russian army undertook an offensive in two directions on baltic coast where in fall in 1710 riga was besieged and in finland with attacks on viborg and selection of command staff destined for siege of viborg led to main authority being given to general admiral fyodor apraksin while his subordinates were major generals and wilhelm bergholtz before siege bruce and bergholtz had operated mainly in defensive roles chiefly in defense of saint petersburg they would later lead offensive into finland they were chosen because at that time commanders most experienced in siege warfare including boris sheremetev jacob bruce and repnin were concentrated around riga consequently it was considered a possibility that peter great himself would command forces at viborg so that he would not have to reassign experienced generals and thus jeopardize attacks on riga fortifications at viborg in 1709 main fort at viborg consisted of five frontal bastions named holtz klein platform and eleonora connected by viborg town wall in eastern section of town western part of town connected to main section had three bastions named pansarlax and europa to west of wall between pansarlax and europa there was a ravelin and two caponiers and to west of wall between and eleonora was another ravelin both ravelins were apparently earthen but inside main eastern fort all structures were stone most of structures in western part of fort were wooden with exception of stone guard tower named petersburg tower separate from these fortifications on small central island east of town now island was schloss castle viborg which stands to this day fort had 151 guns at its defense by this time fortifications had fallen into disrepair because swedish command did not pay much attention to these territories and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant in addition forts at noteborg and were considered sufficient to provide defense for region in 1702 however some repairs were completed under supervision of captain l according to yuri a modern historian garrison at viborg in 1710 stood at 6000 men other modern historians b and a i put number at 4000 since 1702 commander there had been zacharias who was old and in poor health for that reason in february 1710 colonel magnus stiernstrale officially replaced him he had de facto headed efforts to fortify city previous attempts russia had made a previous attempt to capture viborg in october 1706 a siege corps was sent there under command of robert roman bruce on 22 october mortars were placed and bombardment began which continued for four days and caused five fires in fort at viborg after bombardment russian forces retreated to saint petersburg after commanders realized that a siege could not be carried out without naval support and larger cannon also autumn was not considered a suitable time for siege operations idea to reattempt a capture of viborg was first proposed by peter great in 1708 but rejected by military due to recent swedish offensive russian attack peter s plan for second siege of viborg involved a combination of land and sea forces and fort was to be taken by a prolonged siege by february 1710 a specialized siege corps had been assembled on kotlin island this time russian attack came in two stages on 2 march 1710 general apraksin received orders to attack viborg and he planned to move out by 15 march russian state naval archives f 233 opus 1 d 248 l 26 however on 16 march he was still on kotlin island from where he wrote to robert bruce that he was departing on day of tomorrow archive f 2 opus 1 d 47 p 170 in fact he only set out on 21 march arriving with cavalry on that same day at vyborg infantry and cannon arrived next day russian forces arrive when siege corps arrived at viborg on 22nd they occupied town s outskirts and countryside forcing swedes to regroup behind town s inner stone wall swedes had attempted to burn down part of town outside of stone walls to prevent it from falling into russian hands but failed to do so before they were driven into their fortifications on that same day as apraksin reported to czar thumb left 300px baltic theater of great northern war 1709 1721 we neared fort itself in approaches which took a great effort since at that time there was great cold and in addition to that situation around fort is rocky which caused significant upturn however despite difficulty approaches have brought us to sea strait which is right under city itself at distance of a musket s shot with which bags full of fur were very helpful where there were bare rocks and for other side to perform approaches major general bergholtz was sent out with six regiments which were also nearing city with approaches these advances took place under swedish artillery fire from 21 march until 29 march when according to aleksander myshlayevsky russians began firing their artillery 66 bombs and 1 200 round shots were released by swedish artillery also swedes attempted a ground assault but were driven back into fort number of artillery pieces estimates of number of artillery pieces taken to viborg differ widely according to various sources in most sources including journal of emperor peter great from 1698 to treaty of nystad report on capture of vyborg life and affairs of great sovereign and vyborg fortress chronicles from 1710 to 1872 it is said that there were ten 12 pounder guns and three mortars n g believed that there were ten 12 pounders and five mortars m m counted 24 cannon and four mortars and m v vasiliev 12 cannon and four mortars although none of these historians give their sources for their figures a letter from fyodor apraksin to peter great dated 2 april 1710 stated that enemy has constructed three batteries against us they shoot powerfully and accurately one of our cannon they have broken another blew up from frequent firing we have remaining 10 cannon in our batteries this was only recorded time during siege when swedish artillery managed to disable russian equipment thus concluded that there were originally 12 cannon brought to viborg but only ten of them were used in siege as two of them were disabled there were probably three mortars although there are no primary sources to validate this in any case there was not enough artillery but new pieces could not be brought in this was because it was very difficult to move them over land and there was not enough ice to bring them over sea initial bombardment thumb 300px right russian troop movements and battery positions thumb 300px viborg castle ablaze after russian attack on city in 1710 it is not certain on what day russians began shelling fort based on reports by apraksin to peter and on peter great s journal russian artillery opened fire on 1 april however apraksin reported to czar that he began bombarding viborg and castle on 30 march and on first day 130 bombs were planted and 90 on second furthermore aleksander myshlayevsky published a list of how many shots were fired from mortars and cannon at viborg from 21 march to 9 april and how many of them hit city there it claims that shelling began on 29 march when 150 mortar shots and 60 cannon shots were fired it continues saying that during next three days only mortars were used firing 100 shots per day in total during first period of siege attackers fired 2 975 shots from mortars and 1 531 from cannon and swedes fired 399 mortar shots and 7 464 cannon shots thus swedish fire outweighed russian fire on 5 april apraksin noted that our cannon are doing little to help us for they are rather small and light when we begin firing opponent shoots one out of ten however mortars inflicted great damage upon vyborg and fort forcing citizens to find cover in cellars despite this soldiers had to remain positioned on mounds and suffered heavy casualties soon major generals bruce and bergholtz turned to apraksin with a proposal to assault fort not waiting for production of an opening their reasoning was that they could end up losing more soldiers from injuries and disease than they would during an assault peter having found out about this from a letter by apraksin decided it to be very significant but also very dangerous in end he left decision up to general apraksin who not wanting to bear responsibility for a failure decided to wait for reinforcements to arrive by sea once ice had opened up small swedish garrison placed their hopes on support from royal swedish navy which was bound to arrive once ice opened up russians on other had were also running low on food and ammunition and with roads between viborg and saint petersburg ruined by thaw only route for their support and supplies to arrive was also via sea route with neither side able to make headway both sides waiting for their respective naval force side whose naval forces arrived first would have decisive advantage in siege reinforcements arrive thumb a contemporary illustration of russian fleet that arrived at vyborg meanwhile in saint petersburg preparations were already underway for an amphibious attack on vyborg tools needed for siege were taken from peter and paul fortress on 4 april cyril naryshkin first commandant of saint petersburg received orders for twenty 18 pounder guns to be sent to viborg from narva through saint petersburg by land or by sea whichever path is more convenient and 9 000 cannonballs along with them however naryshkin could not gather artillery fast enough and only on 25 april did he send cannon to kotlin island where captain received them peter did not wait for cannon and on 30 april set out with his fleet to sea he could not postpone his sailing due to a shortage of ammunition and provisions at viborg because ice had not completely melted trip to viborg was very difficult when ice was particularly thick crews had to resort to hauling a small cannon onto bowsprit and dropping it onto ice to break it notes of just juel danish ambassador to peter great 1709 1711 moscow 1900 p 196 many provision transport ships were driven off course by winds or ice and they were barely rescued when peter s fleet finally arrived on 9 may russian troops had only three days of provisions left russian forces also formed defenses to trangsund ru fi uuras to blockade town from sea swedish squadron consisting of seven ships of line and three frigates and their assorted support ships under admiral gustav wattrang had been delayed by easterly winds arrived only after russian fleet had already left back for saint petersburg since they were unable to approach town due to russian defenses swedish squadron chose to arrange blockade of their own outside of trangsund to trap few russian ships left behind however due to late arrival of squadron town had in effect already been lost and its surrender was only matter of time upon arriving at viborg peter immediately inspected swedish fortifications and devised instructions on preparations for an assault on viborg in it were plans for constructing two cannon batteries and three mortar batteries with a total of 60 cannon and 18 mortars directed toward viborg fort it was also ordered that 140 light mortars be placed to knock enemy troops from walls during a final assault and to perform nighttime bombardments peter noted that that left 20 cannon ten mortars and 50 light mortars in reserve which could be used during a full barrage of fort he also proposed using fire ships from sea although they were never used construction on batteries mentioned in peter s instructions began on 17 may and some of them were finished by 24 may vyborg fortress chronicles from 1710 to 1872 mentions that during construction a truce bearer was sent out from vyborg fort with a request to russian forces to allow passage for a courier to deliver letters to swedish general georg lybecker but request was denied there are also records that show a swedish fleet arriving at viborg and being beaten back by russians however other sources do not mention truce bearer or naval battle fyodor apraksin even wrote to czar saying that he could not imagine how a swedish fleet could be sent to viborg although he did take precautions during this time ivan was sent out with a fleet of galleys to block access to bay thus completely blockading town and fort of vyborg final barrage and swedish surrender in a letter on 29 may fyodor apraksin noted that work on artillery batteries on his side of viborg were finished and that there was still progress to be made toward completing batteries on bergholtz s side although ten mortars were already in place because of great swamps and rocky soil he asked peter whether to wait for bergholtz to finish building his batteries or proceed in barrage without him apraksin himself was leaning toward latter option because he did not want to lose time and supplies and because that side of fortress was too heavily fortified for bergholtz s guns czar agreed that there was no reason to wait and ordered that bombardment start as soon as possible however this led to another problem it was impossible to quietly transport artillery over rocky soil there was also more daylight by that time of year and due to viborg s location in northern latitudes sun only set around 9 00 pm this meant that twilight lasted almost all night and swedish defensive fire could continue for longer inflicting further casualties nevertheless second barrage of fort began on 1 june by then bergholtz had 13 additional cannon at his disposal barrage lasted until 6 june as a result of which there was made a great breach that two battalions were lined up on either side to take city during those six days there were a total of 2 975 mortar shots and 1 539 from cannon swedish fired 7 464 shots from cannon and 394 from mortars both first and second barrages had a similar number of shots fired but second barrage was a lot more devastating to swedish this was due to several factors shots fired during second bombardment used higher caliber ammunition and did greater damage per round and rate of fire was much more intense first bombardment took a month whereas second only took six days on 6 june decision was made to make a final assault on fort next two days were spent in preparation and those who would lead storm were already chosen russian state naval archives f 233 opus 1 d 3 pp 2 4 however on 9 june swedish side sent out another truce bearer who said they were ready to surrender on 13 june garrison at viborg officially surrendered before any direct assault took place surrendered swedish garrison numbered 3 880 men including 156 officers and 3 274 soldiers of lower rank swedish losses were estimated at around 2 500 contrary to what had been agreed in surrender documents russians took all healthy men left in garrison when it surrendered as prisoners while 877 wounded men as well as 169 women and group of children were transported to helsinki aboard ships of admiral wattrang aftermath thumb vyborg in late 1700s after being refortified by russians in his letters announcing capture of viborg peter great wrote that from now on final security of saint petersburg has been achieved czar said that viborg should become a firm cushion to new capital by capturing viborg several important strategic goals were achieved russian empire now had vastly improved access to baltic sea from which they could launch further attacks against finland and a powerful fort that would defend new capital of saint petersburg czar ordered fort to be renovated with help of a special army division and local peasants new swedish governor general of finland carl nieroth led an attempt to recapture town with an army of 10 000 men with naval support in spring of 1711 swedish light infantry had already started harassing operations and a naval blockade had been place for most of summer swedish manpower had been sapped by a plague which had struck finland in late 1710 delaying all swedish land and naval operations in autumn of 1711 swedish land forces were able to begin a siege but were unsuccessful due to a lack of supplies on 2 december 1711 freezing waters and harsh weather forced naval squadron to retreat while land forces persisted until 25 december governor general nieroth who had invigorated swedish operations in finland died suddenly on 25 january 1712 and was succeeded by weak georg henrik lybecker strategic significance with loss of viborg swedes lost an important naval and land base and their activities in gulf of finland were restricted russia s occupation of viborg allowed creation of a base to supply troops and build ships and expanded zone of action of baltic fleet viborg demonstrated this importance as a key military base from 1712 to 1714 when full scale russian land operations began in finland thus in effect capture of viborg and karelia served to determine outcome of great northern war by establishing a staging area for further military actions during peace talks with sweden viborg question was debated and peter great told his representative andrey osterman to pressure sweden to cede viborg and riga regardless of situation thus after treaty of nystad viborg officially became incorporated into russian empire as vyborg this began a new period in city s multinational history where russian influences would mix with city s swedish finnish and german culture notes references vyborg vyborg category 18th century in finland category conflicts in 1710
