marian adam rejewski 16 august 1905 13 february 1980 was a polish mathematician and cryptologist who reconstructed german military enigma cipher machine sight unseen in 1932 cryptologic achievements of rejewski and colleagues jerzy rozycki and henryk zygalski enabled british to begin reading german enigma encrypted messages at start of world war ii seven years after rejewski s original reconstruction of machine intelligence that was gained by british from enigma decrypts formed part of what was code named ultra and contributed perhaps decisively to defeat of germany in 1929 while studying mathematics at poznan university rejewski attended a secret cryptology course conducted by polish general staff s cipher bureau biuro szyfrow which he joined in september 1932 bureau had had no success in reading enigma enciphered messages and set rejewski to work on problem in late 1932 he deduced machine s secret internal wiring after only a few weeks rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for regular decryption of enigma messages his contributions included cryptologic card catalog derived using cyclometer that he had invented and cryptologic bomb five weeks before german invasion of poland in 1939 rejewski and colleagues presented their achievements to french and british intelligence representatives summoned to warsaw shortly after outbreak of war polish cryptologists were evacuated to france where they continued breaking enigma enciphered messages they and their support staff were again compelled to evacuate after fall of france in june 1940 and they resumed work undercover a few months later in vichy france after french free zone was occupied by germany in november 1942 rejewski and zygalski fled via spain portugal and gibraltar to britain there they enlisted in polish armed forces and were put to work solving low grade german ciphers after war rejewski reunited with his family in poland and worked as an accountant for two decades he remained silent about his prewar and wartime cryptologic work to avoid adverse attention from country s soviet dominated government he broke his silence in 1967 when he provided to polish military historical institute his memoirs of his work in cipher bureau he died at age 74 of a heart attack and was interred with military honors at warsaw s powazki military cemetery early life thumb poznan castle thumb in 1929 prof krygowski asked rejewski to place flowers on gottingen grave of mathematician carl friedrich gauss marian rejewski was born 16 august 1905 in bromberg in prussian province of posen now bydgoszcz poland to jozef and matylda nee thoms information on marian rejewski s military service record reproduced in after completing secondary school he studied mathematics at poznan university s mathematics institute housed in poznan castle in 1929 shortly before graduating from university rejewski began attending a secret cryptology course which opened on 15 january exact opening date is pinpointed in a 29 january 1929 letter of appreciation to professor krygowski from chief of polish general staff gen tadeusz organized for select german speaking mathematics students by polish general staff s cipher bureau with help of mathematics institute s professor zdzislaw krygowski course was conducted off campus at a military facility and as rejewski would discover in france in 1939 was entirely and literally based on french colonel marcel s 1925 book cours de cryptography course rejewski and fellow students henryk zygalski and jerzy rozycki were among few who could keep up with course while balancing demands of their normal studies on 1 march 1929 rejewski graduated with a master of philosophy degree in mathematics information on marian rejewski s master of philosophy diploma 1 march 1929 reproduced in a few weeks after graduating and without having completed cipher bureau s cryptology course he began first year of a two year actuarial statistics course at gottingen germany he did not complete statistics course because while home for summer of 1930 he accepted an offer from professor krygowski of a mathematics teaching assistantship at poznan university he also began working part time for cipher bureau which by then had set up an outpost at poznan to decrypt intercepted german radio messages rejewski worked some twelve hours a week near mathematics institute in an underground vault referred to as black chamber poznan branch of cipher bureau was disbanded in summer of 1932 in warsaw on 1 september 1932 rejewski zygalski and rozycki joined cipher bureau as civilian employees working at general staff building saxon palace their first assignment was to solve a four letter code used by german navy progress was initially slow but sped up after a test exchange consisting of a six group signal followed by a four group response was intercepted cryptologists guessed correctly that first signal was question when was frederick great born followed by response 1712 on 20 june 1934 rejewski married irena maria daughter of a prosperous dentist couple eventually had two children a son andrzej andrew born in 1936 and a daughter janina joan born in 1939 janina would later become a mathematician like her father enigma machine thumb enigma machine solved by rejewski in 1932 enigma machine was an electromechanical device equipped with a 26 letter keyboard and 26 lamps corresponding to letters of alphabet inside was a set of wired drums rotors and a reflector that scrambled input machine used a plugboard to swap pairs of letters and encipherment varied from one key press to next for two operators to communicate both enigma machines had to be set up in same way large number of possibilities for setting rotors and plugboard combined to form an astronomical number of configurations and settings were changed daily so machine code had to be broken anew each day before 1932 cipher bureau had succeeded in solving an earlier enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard but had been unsuccessful with enigma i a new standard german cipher machine that was coming into widespread use in late october or early november 1932 head of cipher bureau s german section captain maksymilian ciezki tasked rejewski to work alone on german enigma i machine for a couple of hours per day rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing solving wiring to decrypt enigma messages three pieces of information were needed 1 a general understanding of how enigma functioned 2 wiring of rotors and 3 daily settings sequence and orientations of rotors and plug connections on plugboard rejewski had only first at his disposal based on information already acquired by cipher bureau thumb a cycle formed by first and fourth letters of a set of indicators rejewski exploited these cycles to deduce enigma rotor wiring in 1932 and to solve daily message settings first rejewski tackled problem of discovering wiring of rotors to do this according to historian david kahn he pioneered use of pure mathematics in cryptanalysis previous methods had largely exploited linguistic patterns and statistics of natural language texts letter frequency analysis rejewski applied techniques from group theory theorems about permutations in his attack on enigma these mathematical techniques combined with material supplied by gustave bertrand chief of french radio intelligence enabled him to reconstruct internal wirings of machine s rotors and reflector solution writes kahn was rejewski s own stunning achievement one that elevates him to pantheon of greatest cryptanalysts of all time rejewski used a mathematical theorem that two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have same cycle structure that mathematics professor and cryptologia co editor cipher a deavours describes as theorem that won world war ii cipher a deavours in an afterword to before receiving french intelligence material rejewski had made a careful study of enigma messages particularly of first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day for security each message was encrypted using different starting positions of rotors as selected by operator this message setting was three letters long to convey it to receiving operator sending operator began message by sending message setting in a disguised form a six letter indicator indicator was formed using enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day termed ground setting which was shared by all operators particular way that indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into cipher for example suppose operator chose message setting kyg for a message operator would first set enigma s rotors to ground setting which might be on that particular day and then encrypt message setting on enigma twice that is operator would enter which might come out to something like operator would then reposition rotors at kyg and encrypt actual message a receiving operator could reverse process to recover first message setting then message itself repetition of message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect but it had unforeseen effect of greatly weakening cipher due to indicator s repetition of message setting rejewski knew that in plaintext of indicator first and fourth letters were same second and fifth were same and third and sixth were same these relations could be exploited to break into cipher rejewski studied these related pairs of letters for example if there were four messages that had following indicators on same day then by looking at first and fourth letters of each set he knew that certain pairs of letters were related b was related to t l was related to b e was related to l and t was related to e b t l b e l and t e if he had enough different messages to work with he could build entire sequences of relationships letter b was related to t which was related to e which was related to l which was related to b see diagram this was a cycle of 4 since it took four jumps until it got back to start letter another cycle on same day might be or a cycle of 3 if there were enough messages on a given day all letters of alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes cycles would be consistent for one day and then would change to a different set of cycles next day similar analysis could be done on 2nd and 5th letters and 3rd and 6th identifying cycles in each case and number of steps in each cycle enigma operators also had a tendency to choose predictable letter combinations as indicators such as girlfriends initials or a pattern of keys that they saw on enigma keyboard these became known to allies as misspelled using data thus gained from study of cycles and use of predictable indicators rejewski was able to deduce six permutations corresponding to encipherment at six consecutive positions of enigma machine these permutations could be described by six equations with various unknowns representing wiring within entry drum rotors reflector and plugboard french help at this point rejewski ran into difficulties due to large number of unknowns in set of equations that he had developed he would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data but he was assisted by cryptographic documents that section d of french military intelligence deuxieme bureau under future general gustave bertrand had obtained and passed on to polish cipher bureau documents procured from a spy in german cryptographic service hans thilo schmidt included enigma settings for months of september and october 1932 about 9 or 10 december 1932 documents were given to rejewski they enabled him to reduce number of unknowns and solve wirings of rotors and reflector there was another obstacle to overcome however military enigma had been modified from commercial enigma of which rejewski had had an actual example to study in commercial machine keys were connected to entry drum in german keyboard order however in military enigma connections had instead been wired in alphabetical order abcdef this new wiring sequence foiled british cryptologists working on enigma who dismissed abcdef wiring as too obvious rejewski perhaps guided by an intuition about a german fondness for order simply guessed that wiring was normal alphabetic ordering he later recalled that after he had made this assumption from my pencil as by magic began to issue numbers designating connections in rotor n thus connections in one rotor right hand rotor were finally known settings provided by french intelligence covered two months that straddled a changeover period for rotor ordering a different rotor happened to be in right hand position for second month and so wirings of two rotors could be recovered by same method rejewski later recalled finding wiring in third rotor and especially in reflector now presented no great difficulties likewise there were no difficulties with determining correct torsion of rotors side walls with respect to each other or moments when left and middle drums turned by year s end 1932 wirings of all three rotors and reflector had been recovered a sample message in an enigma instruction manual providing a plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext produced using a stated daily key and message key helped clarify some remaining details there has been speculation as to whether rotor wirings could have been solved without documents supplied by french intelligence rejewski recalled in 1980 that another way had been found that could have been used to solve wirings but that method was imperfect and tedious and relied on chance in 2005 mathematician john lawrence claimed that it would have taken four years for this method to have had a reasonable likelihood of success rejewski had earlier written that conclusion is that intelligence material furnished to us should be regarded as having been decisive to solution of machine solving daily settings after rejewski had determined wiring in remaining rotors he was joined in early 1933 by rozycki and zygalski in devising methods and equipment to break enigma ciphers routinely rejewski later recalled now we had machine but we didn t have keys and we couldn t very well require bertrand to keep on supplying us with keys every month situation had reversed itself before we d had keys but we hadn t had machine we solved machine now we had machine but we didn t have keys we had to work out methods to find daily keys early methods thumb cyclometer devised in mid 1930s by rejewski to catalog cycle structure of enigma permutations a number of methods and devices had to be invented in response to continual improvements in german operating procedure and to enigma machine itself earliest method for reconstructing daily keys was grill based on fact that plugboard s connections exchanged only six pairs of letters leaving fourteen letters unchanged next was rozycki s clock method which sometimes made it possible to determine which rotor was at right hand side of enigma machine on a given day after 1 october 1936 german procedure changed and number of plugboard connections became variable ranging between five and eight as a result grill method became considerably less effective however a method using a card catalog had been devised around 1934 or 1935 and was independent of number of plug connections catalog was constructed using rejewski s cyclometer a special purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations once catalog was complete permutation could be looked up in catalog yielding enigma rotor settings for that day cyclometer comprised two sets of enigma rotors and was used to determine length and number of cycles of permutations that could be generated by enigma machine even with cyclometer preparing catalog was a long and difficult task each position of enigma machine there were 17 576 positions had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors there were 6 possible sequences therefore catalog comprised 105 456 entries preparation of catalog took over a year but when it was ready about 1935 it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12 20 minutes however on 1 or 2 november 1937 germans replaced reflector in their enigma machines which meant that entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch nonetheless by january 1938 cipher bureau s german section was reading a remarkable 75 of enigma intercepts and according to rejewski with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90 bomba and sheets thumb zygalski sheet in 1937 rejewski along with german section of cipher bureau transferred to a secret facility near pyry in woods south of warsaw on 15 september 1938 germans introduced new rules for message keys a new indicator procedure making poles earlier techniques obsolete polish cryptanalysts rapidly responded with new techniques one was rejewski s an electrically powered aggregate of six enigmas which solved daily keys within about two hours six bombas were built and were ready for use by mid november 1938 bomba exploited fact that plugboard connections did not affect all letters therefore when another change to german operating procedure occurred on 1 january 1939 increasing number of plugboard connections usefulness of bombas was greatly reduced british bombe main tool that would be used to break enigma messages during world war ii would be named after and likely inspired by polish bomba though cryptologic methods embodied in two machines were different around same time as rejewski s bomba a manual method was invented by henryk zygalski that of perforated sheets zygalski sheets which was independent of number of plugboard connections rejewski describes construction of zygalski mechanism and its manipulation however application of both bomba and zygalski sheets was complicated by yet another change to enigma machine on 15 december 1938 germans had supplied enigma operators with an additional two rotors to supplement original three and this increased complexity of decryption tenfold building ten times as many bombas 60 would now be needed was beyond cipher bureau s ability that many bombas would have cost fifteen times its entire annual equipment budget two and a half weeks later effective 1 january 1939 germans increased number of plug connections to 7 10 which writes rejewski to a great degree decreased usefulness of bombs zygalski s perforated zygalski sheets writes rejewski like card catalog method was independent of number of plug connections but manufacture of these sheets in our circumstances was very time consuming so that by 15 december 1938 only one third of whole job had been done t he germans introduction of rotors iv and v increased labor of making sheets tenfold since 60 or ten times as many sets of sheets were now needed considerably exceeding our capacities allies informed thumb 2002 plaque bletchley park ing work of marian rejewski jerzy rozycki and henryk zygalski mathematicians of polish intelligence service in first breaking enigma code sic it was a cipher their work greatly assisted bletchley park code breakers and contributed to allied victory in world war ii as it became clear that war was imminent and that polish financial resources were insufficient to keep pace with evolution of enigma encryption e g due to prohibitive expense of an additional 54 bombas and due to poles difficulty in producing in timely fashion full 60 series of 26 zygalski sheets cited in polish general staff and government decided to initiate their western allies into secrets of enigma decryption polish methods were revealed to french and british intelligence representatives in a meeting at pyry south of warsaw on 25 july 1939 france was represented by gustave bertrand and air force cryptologist captain henri braquenie britain by government code and cypher school chief alastair denniston veteran cryptologist alfred dillwyn knox and commander humphrey head of section that had developed and controlled royal navy s intercept and direction finding stations polish hosts included cipher bureau chief langer bureau s german section chief maksymilian ciezki bureau s general staff intelligence supervisor stefan mayer and three cryptologists rejewski rozycki and zygalski poles gift of enigma decryption to their western allies five weeks before outbreak of world war ii came not a moment too soon knowledge that cipher was was a morale boost to allied cryptologists british were able to manufacture at least two complete sets of perforated sheets they sent one to pc bruno outside paris in mid december 1939 and began reading enigma within months of outbreak of war without polish assistance british cryptologists would at very least have been considerably delayed in reading enigma hugh sebag montefiore concludes that substantial breaks into german army and air force enigma ciphers by british would have occurred only after november 1941 at earliest after an enigma machine and key lists had been captured and similarly into naval enigma only after late 1942 intelligence gained from solving high level german ciphers intelligence codenamed ultra by british and americans came chiefly from enigma decrypts while exact contribution of ultra intelligence to allied victory is disputed kozaczuk and note that it is widely believed that ultra saved world at least two years of war and possibly prevented hitler from winning english historian sir harry hinsley who worked at bletchley park similarly assessed it as having shortened war by not less than two years and probably by four years availability of ultra was due to earlier polish breaking of enigma gordon head of bletchley park s hut 6 which solved german army and air force enigma ciphers writes hut 6 ultra would never have gotten off ground if we had not learned from poles in nick of time details both of german military version of commercial enigma machine and of operating procedures that were in use in france and britain pc bruno on 5 september 1939 cipher bureau began preparations to evacuate key personnel and equipment from warsaw soon a special evacuation train echelon f transported them eastward then south by time cipher bureau was ordered to cross border into allied romania on 17 september they had destroyed all sensitive documents and equipment and were down to a single very crowded truck vehicle was confiscated at border by a romanian officer who separated military from civilian personnel taking advantage of confusion three mathematicians ignored romanian s instructions they anticipated that in an internment camp they might be identified by romanian security police in which german abwehr and sd had informers mathematicians went to nearest railroad station exchanged money bought tickets and boarded first train headed south after a dozen or so hours they reached bucharest at other end of romania there they went to british embassy told by british to come back in a few days they next tried french embassy introducing themselves as friends of bolek bertrand s polish code name and asking to speak with a french military officer a french army colonel telephoned paris and then issued instructions for three poles to be assisted in evacuating to paris on 20 october 1939 three polish cryptologists resumed work on german ciphers at a joint french polish spanish radio intelligence unit stationed at forty kilometers northeast of paris and housed in chateau de code named pc bruno as late as 3 7 december 1939 when lt col langer and french air force capt henri braquenie visited london and bletchley park british asked that polish cryptologists be made available to them in britain langer however took position that they must remain where polish army in exile was forming on french soil on 17 january 1940 poles found first enigma key to be solved in france one for 28 october 1939 pc bruno staff collaborated by teleprinter with counterparts at bletchley park in england for their mutual communications security polish french and british cryptologic agencies used enigma machine itself bruno closed its enigma encrypted messages to britain with an ironic heil hitler in first months of 1940 alan turing principal designer of british cryptological bombe elaborated from polish bomba would visit bruno to confer about enigma decryption with three polish cryptologists on 24 june 1940 after germany s victory in battle of france gustave bertrand flew bruno s international personnel including fifteen poles and seven spaniards who worked on italian ciphers in three planes to algeria cadix some three months later in september 1940 they returned to work covertly in unoccupied southern vichy france rejewski s cover was as pierre a lycee professor from nantes a radio intelligence station was set up at chateau des fouzes code named cadix near cadix began operations on 1 october rejewski and his colleagues solved german telegraph ciphers and also swiss version of enigma machine which had no plugboard rejewski may have had little or no involvement in working on german enigma at cadix in early july 1941 rejewski and zygalski were asked to try solving messages enciphered on secret polish lacida cipher machine which was used for secure communications between cadix and polish general staff in london lacida was a rotor machine based on same cryptographic principle as enigma yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis two cryptologists created consternation by breaking first message within a couple of hours further messages were solved in a similar way youngest of three polish mathematicians who had worked together since 1929 jerzy rozycki died in sinking of a french passenger ship on 9 january 1942 as he was returning to cadix from a stint in algeria by summer 1942 work at cadix was becoming dangerous and plans for evacuation were drawn up vichy france was liable to be occupied by german troops and radio transmissions were increasingly at risk of detection by german a unit tasked with locating enemy radio transmitters indeed on 6 november a pickup truck equipped with a circular antenna arrived at gate of chateau des fouzes where cryptologists were operating visitors however did not enter and merely investigated nearby farms badly frightening their occupants nonetheless at bertrand s suggestion french intelligence ordered evacuation of cadix order was carried out on 9 november day after allied operation torch landings in north africa three days later on 12 november germans occupied chateau escaping france poles were split into groups of two and three on 11 november 1942 rejewski and zygalski were sent to nice in italian occupied zone after coming under suspicion there they had to flee again moving or hiding constantly their trek took them to cannes antibes back to nice then on to marseilles toulouse narbonne perpignan and ax les thermes near spanish border on 29 january 1943 accompanied by a local guide rejewski and zygalski bound for spain began a climb over pyrenees avoiding german and vichy patrols near midnight close to spanish border guide pulled out a pistol and demanded that they hand over their remaining money after being robbed rejewski and zygalski succeeded in reaching spanish side of border only to be arrested within hours by security police they were sent first to a prison in la seu d urgell then on 24 march transferred to a prison at lerida on 4 may 1943 after having spent over three months in spanish prisons on intervention by polish red cross pair were released and sent to madrid leaving there on 21 july they made it to portugal from there aboard hms scottish to gibraltar and then by air to raf hendon in north london arriving on 3 august 1943 britain thumb marian rejewski second lieutenant signals polish army in britain in late 1943 or in 1944 11 or 12 years after he first broke enigma rejewski and zygalski were inducted as privates into polish armed forces on 16 august 1943 and were posted to a polish army facility in boxmoor cracking german ss and sd hand ciphers ciphers were usually based on double playfair system which two cryptologists had already worked on in france british cryptologist alan suggests that setting them to work on system was like using racehorses to pull wagons on 10 october 1943 rejewski and zygalski were commissioned second lieutenants on 1 january 1945 rejewski and presumably also zygalski were promoted to lieutenant when gustave bertrand fled to england in june 1944 he and his wife were provided with a house in boxmoor a short walk from polish radio station and cryptology office where it seems likely that his collaboration with rejewski and zygalski continued enigma decryption however had become an exclusively british and american domain polish mathematicians who had laid foundations for allied enigma decryption were now excluded from making further contributions in this area by that time at bletchley park very few even knew about polish contribution because of strict secrecy and need to know principle back in poland after germans suppressed 1944 warsaw uprising they sent rejewski s wife and children west along with other warsaw survivors family eventually found refuge with her parents in bydgoszcz rejewski was discharged from polish army in britain on 15 november 1946 six days later he returned to poland to be reunited with his wife and family on his return he was urged by his old poznan university professor zdzislaw krygowski to take a university mathematics post at poznan or szczecin in western poland rejewski could have looked forward to rapid advancement because of personnel shortages as a result of war however he was still recovering from rheumatism which he had contracted in spanish prisons soon after his return to poland in summer of 1947 his 11 year old son andrzej died of polio after only five days illness after his son s death rejewski did not want to part even briefly with his wife and daughter so they lived in bydgoszcz with his in laws rejewski took a position in bydgoszcz as director of sales department at a cable manufacturing company kabel polski polish cable thumb 2005 bydgoszcz memorial unveiled on centennial of rejewski s birth it resembles alan turing memorial in manchester thumb 2005 polish prepaid postcard on centennial of rejewski s birth between 1949 and 1958 rejewski was repeatedly investigated by polish office of public security who suspected he was a former member of polish armed forces in west he retired in 1967 and moved with his family back to warsaw in 1969 to an apartment he had acquired 30 years earlier with financial help from his father in law rejewski had written a report of cryptologic work on german enigma machine cipher in 1942 before his 1967 retirement he began writing his memoirs of my work in cipher bureau of section ii of polish general staff which were purchased by polish military historical institute in warsaw rejewski had often wondered what use alan turing who in early 1940 had visited polish cryptologists at pc bruno outside paris and british at bletchley park had ultimately made of polish discoveries and inventions for nearly three decades after war little was publicly known due to a ban imposed in 1945 by british prime minister winston churchill in a 1967 book wladyslaw kozaczuk associated with military historical institute disclosed poland s breaking of german enigma ciphers until 1974 scant information published concerning enigma decryption attracted little attention farago s 1971 best seller game of foxes presented a garbled account of ultra s origins commander denniston went clandestinely to a secluded polish castle sic on eve of war to pick up an enigma wehrmacht s top system during world war ii dilly knox later solved its keying sic still this was marginally closer to truth than many british and american best seller accounts that would follow after 1974 their authors were at a disadvantage they did not know that founder of enigma decryption rejewski was still alive and alert and that it was reckless to fabricate stories out of whole cloth thumb left rejewski s grave in powazki military cemetery warsaw with gustave bertrand s 1973 publication of his enigma substantial information about origins of ultra began to seep out and with f w winterbotham s 1974 best seller ultra secret dam began to burst still many aspiring authors were not averse to filling gaps in their information with whole cloth fabrications rejewski fought a gallant if into 21st century not entirely successful fight to get truth before public he published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles books and television programs he was interviewed by scholars journalists and television crews from poland east germany united states britain sweden belgium soviet union yugoslavia and brazil rejewski maintained a lively correspondence with his wartime french host general gustave bertrand and at general s bidding he began translating bertrand s enigma into polish in 1976 at request of jozef pilsudski institute of america rejewski broke enciphered correspondence of jozef pilsudski and his fellow polish socialist conspirators from 1904 on 12 august 1978 he received from a grateful polish people officer s cross of order of polonia restituta rejewski who had been suffering from heart disease died of a heart attack on 13 february 1980 aged 74 after returning home from a shopping trip he was buried with military honors at warsaw s powazki military cemetery
