wonder stories is an early american science fiction magazine which was published under several titles from 1929 to 1955 it was founded by hugo gernsback in 1929 after he had lost control of his first science fiction magazine amazing stories when his media company experimenter publishing went bankrupt within a few months of bankruptcy gernsback launched three new magazines air wonder stories science wonder stories and science wonder quarterly air wonder stories and science wonder stories were merged in 1930 as wonder stories and quarterly was renamed wonder stories quarterly magazines

dated winter 1955 and title was then merged with startling stories another of pines science fiction magazines startling itself lasted only to end of 1955 before finally succumbing to decline of pulp magazine industry editors under gernsback s ownership were david lasser who worked hard to improve quality of fiction and from mid 1933 charles hornig both lasser and hornig published some well received fiction such as stanley weinbaum s a martian odyssey but hornig s efforts in particular were overshadowed by success of astounding stories which had become leading magazine in new field of science fiction under its new title thrilling wonder stories was initially unable to improve its quality for a period in early 1940s it was aimed at younger readers with a juvenile editorial tone and covers that depicted beautiful women in implausibly revealing spacesuits later editors began to improve fiction and by end of 1940s in opinion of science fiction historian mike ashley magazine briefly rivaled astounding publication history by end of 19th century stories centered on scientific inventions and set in future in tradition of jules verne were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines ashley time machines p 7 magazines such as munsey s magazine and argosy launched in 1889 and 1896 respectively carried a few science fiction stories each year some upmarket slicks such as mcclure s which paid well and were aimed at a more literary audience also carried scientific stories but by early years of 20th century science fiction though it was not yet called that was appearing more often in pulp magazines than in slicks ashley time machines pp 21 25 nicholls pulp magazines p 979 ashley transformations p 155 first science fiction magazine amazing stories was launched in 1926 by hugo gernsback at height of pulp magazine era it helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre and by end of 1930s a golden age of science fiction had begun inaugurated by efforts

his plans for new magazines mailing lists he used almost certainly were compiled from subscription lists of amazing stories this would have been illegal as lists were owned by irving trust receiver of

experience and knew little about science fiction but his recently acquired degree from mit convinced gernsback to hire him davin pioneers p 47 gernsback claimed that science fiction was educational he repeatedly made this assertion in amazing stories and continued to do so in his editorials for new magazines stating for example that teachers encourage reading of this fiction because they know that it gives pupil a fundamental knowledge of science and aviation gernsback editorial in air wonder stories july 1929 p 5 quoted in bleiler gernsback years p 542 he also recruited a panel of nationally known educators who pass upon scientific principles of all stories science fiction historian everett bleiler describes this as pure and simple asserting that there is no evidence that men on panel some of whom such as lee de forest were well known scientists had any editorial influence bleiler gernsback years p 580 however donald menzel astrophysicist on panel said that gernsback sent him manuscripts and made changes to stories as a result of menzel s commentary carter creation of tomorrow p 11 jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 2 8 2 9 2 10 2 11 2 12 3

merge science wonder stories and air wonder stories into wonder stories reason for merger is unknown although it may have been that he needed space in printing schedule for his new aviation mechanics magazine ashley time machines pp 70 71 bleiler has suggested that merger was caused by poor sales and a consequent need to downsize in addition air wonder stories was probably focused on too specialized a niche to succeed in an editorial just before science wonder stories changed its name gernsback commented that word science in title has tended to retard progress of magazine because many people had impression that it is a sort of scientific periodical rather than a fiction magazine gernsback in science wonder may 1930 p 1099 quoted in ashley time machines p 71 ironically inclusion of science in title was reason that science fiction writer isaac asimov began reading magazine when he saw august 1929 issue he obtained permission to read it from his father on grounds that it was clearly educational asimov before golden age i p 29 concerns about marketability of titles seem to have surfaced in last two issues of science wonder which had word science printed in a color that made it difficult to read on top of cover appeared words mystery adventure romance last of which was a surprising way to advertise a science fiction magazine first issue of merged magazine appeared in june 1930 still on a monthly schedule with lasser as editor volume numbering continued that of science wonder stories therefore wonder stories is sometimes regarded as a retitling of science wonder stories bleiler gernsback years pp 586 589 gernsback had also produced a companion magazine for science wonder stories titled science wonder quarterly first issue of which was published in fall of 1929 three issues were produced under this title but after merger gernsback changed companion magazine s title to wonder stories quarterly and produced a further eleven issues under that title bleiler

first three issues andwonder stories quarterly all subsequent issues was david lasser throughout in july 1933 gernsback dismissed lasser as editor lasser had become active in promoting workers rights and was spending less time on his editorial duties according to lasser gernsback told him if you like working with unemployed so much i suggest you go and join them davin pioneers p 57 it is likely that cost cutting was also a consideration as lasser was paid 65 per week a substantial salary in those days davin pioneers p 57 bleiler who cites davin gives lasser s salary as 70 per week though he does not explain discrepancy see bleiler gernsback years p 588 davin pioneers p 94 note 38 soon after lasser was let go gernsback received a fanzine fantasy fan from a reader charles hornig gernsback called hornig to his office to interview him for position of editor hornig turned out to be only 17 but gernsback asked him to proofread a manuscript and decided that results were satisfactory hornig was hired at an initial salary of 20 per week ashley time machines pp 78 79 davin pioneers p 70 that same year gernsback dissolved stellar publications and created continental publications as new publisher for wonder stories schedule stuttered for first time missing july and september 1933 issues recent bankruptcy of company s distributor eastern distributing corporation may have been partly responsible for this disruption davin pioneers p 29 davin pioneers p 43 first issue with continental on masthead and first listing hornig as editor was november 1933 wonder stories had a circulation of about 25 000 in 1934 comparable to that of amazing stories which had declined from an early peak of about 100 000 ashley time machines p 51 ashley time machines pp 85 86 gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934 wonder stories reprint annual but it never appeared tuck encyclopedia of sf vol 3 p 609 that year he experimented with other fiction magazines pirate stories and high seas adventures but neither was successful wonder stories was also failing and in november 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors by 1936 he was even failing to pay laurence manning one of his most reliable authors davin pioneers p 64 staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks for weeks at a time hornig quoted in davin pioneers p 68 hornig does not specify whether this happened only towards end of gernsback s control of magazine gernsback felt blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies and then selling stripped copies at a reduced rate to bypass dealers he made a plea in march 1936 issue to his readers asking them to subscribe and proposing to distribute wonder stories solely by subscription there was little response and gernsback decided to sell he made a deal with ned pines of beacon magazines and on 21 february 1936 wonder stories was sold ashley time machines p 91 thrilling wonder stories spring summer fall winter jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov 8 1 8 2 8 9 1 9 2 9 3 10 1 10 2 10 11 1 11 2 11 3

issue was titled as a quarterly e g rather than as a monthly pines magazines included several with thrilling in title such as thrilling detective and thrilling love stories these were run by leo margulies who had hired mort weisinger among others as workload increased in early 1930s weisinger was already an active science fiction fan and when wonder stories was acquired margulies involved him in editorial work margulies group worked as a team with margulies listed as editor in chief on magazines and having final say however since weisinger knew science fiction well weisinger was quickly

is by frank r paul when air wonder stories was launched in middle of 1929 there were already pulp magazines such as sky birds and flying aces which focused on aerial adventures gernsback s first editorial dismissed these as being of purely wild west world war adventure sky busting type editorial in air wonder stories july 1929 quoted in bleiler gernsback years p 541 by contrast gernsback said he planned to fill air wonder solely with flying stories of future strictly along scientific mechanical technical lines full of adventure exploration and achievement non fiction material on aviation was printed including quizzes short popular articles and book reviews letters column made it clear that readership comprised more science fiction fans than aviation fans and gernsback later commented that overlap with science wonder readers was 90 a figure that presumably referred only to subscription base not to newsstand sales gernsback frequently ran reader contests ashley time machines p 52 one of which announced in february 1930 issue of air wonder stories asked for a slogan for magazine john wyndham later to become famous as author of day of triffids won with future flying fiction submitted under his real name of john beynon harris later that year a contest in science wonder quarterly asked readers for an answer to question what i have done to spread science fiction winner was raymond palmer who later became editor of gernsback s original magazine amazing stories he won contest for his role in founding a science correspondence club davin pioneers p 39 science wonders first issue included first part of a serial reign of ray by fletcher pratt and irwin lester and short stories by stanton coblentz and david h keller air wonder began with a reprinted serial victor s ark of covenant writers who first appeared in pages of these magazines include neil r jones ed earl repp raymond z gallun and lloyd eshbach ashley time machines pp 65 67 quality of published science fiction at time was generally low and lasser was keen to improve it on 11 may 1931 he wrote to his regular contributors to tell them that their science fiction stories should deal realistically with effect upon people individually and in groups of a scientific invention or discovery in other words allow yourself one fundamental assumption that a certain machine or discovery is possible and then show what would be its logical and dramatic consequences upon world also what would be effect upon group of characters that you pick to carry your theme ashley time machines pp 71 73 quote from a letter by lasser dated 11 may 1931 is given by ashley on p 73 after merger lasser provided ideas to his authors and commented on their drafts attempting to improve both level of scientific literacy and quality of writing davin pioneers p 41 some of his correspondence has survived including an exchange with jack williamson whom lasser commissioned in early 1932 to write a story based on a plot provided by a reader winning entry in one of magazine s competitions lasser emphasized to williamson importance of scientific plausibility citing as an example a moment in story where earthmen have to decipher a written martian language you must be sure and make it convincing how they did it for they have absolutely no method of approach to a written language of another world davin pioneers pp 41 43 on one occasion lasser s work with his authors extended to collaboration time projector a story which appeared in july 1931 issue of wonder stories was credited to david h keller and david lasser both lasser and later hornig were given almost complete editorial freedom by gernsback who reserved only right to give final approval to contents this was in contrast to more detailed control gernsback had exerted over content of amazing stories in first years of its existence science fiction historian sam moskowitz has suggested that reason was poor financial state of wonder stories gernsback perhaps avoided corresponding with authors as he owed many of them money davin pioneers p 48 davin pioneers pp 63 64 lasser allowed letter column to become a free discussion of ideas and values and published stories dealing with topics such as relationship between sexes one such story thomas s gardner s last woman portrayed a future in which men having evolved beyond need for love keep last woman in a museum in venus adventurer an early story by john wyndham a spaceman corrupts innocent natives of venus lasser avoided printing space opera and several stories from wonder in early 1930s were more realistic than most contemporary space fiction examples include edmond hamilton s a conquest of two worlds p schuyler miller s forgotten man of space and several stories by frank k kelly including moon tragedy ashley time machines pp 73 75 lasser was one of founders of american rocket society which under its initial name of interplanetary society announced its existence in pages of june 1930 wonder stories davin pioneers pp 32 33 several of wonder s writers were also members of interplanetary society and perhaps as a consequence of relationship wonder stories quarterly began to focus increasingly on fiction with interplanetary settings a survey of last eight issues of wonder stories quarterly by bleiler found almost two thirds of stories were interplanetary adventures while only a third of stories in corresponding issues of wonder stories could be so described wonder stories quarterly added a banner reading interplanetary number to cover of winter 1931 issue and retained it as interplanetary stories for subsequent issues lasser and gernsback were also briefly involved with fledgling technocracy movement gernsback published two issues of technocracy review which lasser edited commissioning stories based on technocratic ideas from nat schachner these appeared in wonder stories during 1933 culminating in a novel revolt of scientists davin pioneers p 37 clute nat schachner p 1056 reviews of fiction and popular science books were published and there was a science column which endeavored to answer readers questions these features were at first of good quality but deteriorated after lasser s departure although it is not certain that lasser wrote content of either one an influential non fiction initiative was creation of science fiction league an organization that brought together local science fiction fan clubs across country gernsback took opportunity to sell items such as buttons and insignia and it was undoubtedly a profitable enterprise for him as well as a good source of publicity it was ultimately more important in becoming one of foundations of science fiction fandom peter roberts science fiction league p 1066 hornig when hornig took over from lasser at end of 1933 he attempted to continue and expand lasser s approach hornig introduced a new policy in january 1934 issue emphasizing originality and barring stories that merely reworked well worn ideas ashley time machines pp 87 88 he asked for stories that included good science although not enough to become boring to those readers who are not primarily interested in technicalities of science however astounding was moving into lead position in science fiction magazine field at this time and hornig had difficulty in competing his rates of payment were lower than astounding s one cent per word sometimes his writers were paid very late or not at all despite these handicaps hornig managed to find some good material including stanley g weinbaum s a martian odyssey which appeared in july 1934 wonder and has been frequently reprinted in december 1934 january 1935 issue of hornig s fanzine fantasy magazine he took unusual step of listing several stories that he had rejected as lacking novelty but which had subsequently appeared in print in other magazines list includes several by successful writers of day such as raymond z gallun and miles breuer most prominent story named is triplanetary by e e smith which appeared in amazing both lasser and hornig printed fiction translated from french and german writers including von and otto willi gail with rise of adolf hitler in germany in 1930s a few readers including donald wollheim wrote letters complaining about inclusion of german stories editorial response was a strong defense of translations gernsback argued that events in germany were irrelevant to business of selecting fiction carter creation of tomorrow p 119 covers for almost every issue of air wonder science wonder wonder stories and wonder stories quarterly were painted by frank r paul who had followed gernsback from amazing stories only exception was a cover image composed of colored dots which appeared on november 1932 issue ashley time machines p 276 weisinger and friend when magazine moved to beacon publications as thrilling wonder fiction began to focus more on action than on ideas covers often by earle k bergey typically depicted bizarre aliens and damsels in distress in 1939 a reader martin alger coined phrase bug eyed monster to describe one such cover phrase subsequently entered dictionary as a word for an alien several well known writers contributed including ray cummings and john w campbell whose brain stealers of mars series began in thrilling wonder in december 1936 issue a comic strip began in august 1936 first issue of beacon publications version it was illustrated and possibly written by max plaisted strip titled was not a success and was cancelled after eight issues ashley time machines pp 100 102 weisinger s successor friend gave magazine a significantly more juvenile feel he used alias sergeant saturn and was generally condescending to readers this may not have been his fault as margulies who was still editorial director probably wanted him to attract a younger readership under friend s direction earle k bergey transformed look of thrilling wonder stories by foregrounding human figures in space focusing on anatomy of women in implausibly revealing spacesuits and his trademark brass brassieres ashley time machines pp 187 188 merwin and mines merwin who took over with winter 1945 issue adopted a more mature approach than friend s he obtained fiction from writers who had previously been publishing mainly in john campbell s astounding summer 1945 issue of thrilling wonder included jack vance s first published story world thinker merwin also published several stories by ray bradbury some of which were later included in bradbury s collection martian chronicles other well known writers that merwin was able to attract included theodore sturgeon a e van vogt and robert a heinlein thrilling wonder often published intelligent thoughtful stories some of which campbell would have been unlikely to accept at astounding he did not like to publish stories that showed negative consequences of scientific advances such as nuclear power in opinion of science fiction historian mike ashley during late 1940s thrilling wonder became a serious rival to astoundings long domination of field ashley time machines pp 188 190 however this is not a universal opinion as magazine is elsewhere described during merwin s tenure as evidently secondary to startling malcolm edwards thrilling wonder stories pp 1222 1223 samuel mines took over from merwin at end of 1951 both at startling stories and thrilling wonder ashley transformations p 343 he argued against restrictions in science fiction themes and in 1952 published philip jose farmer s lovers a ground breaking story about inter species sex in startling he followed this in 1953 with another taboo breaking story from farmer mother in thrilling wonder in which a spaceman makes his home in an alien womb ashley transformations pp 13 16 peter nicholls sex p 539 in december 1952 thrilling wonder mines published edmond hamilton s what s it like out there a downbeat story about realities of space exploration that had been considered too bleak for publication when it had originally been written in 1930s sherwood springer s no land of nod in same issue dealt with incest between a father and his daughter in a world in which they are only two survivors these stories were all well received by readership influence on field for a few years lasser was dominant force in science fiction davin pioneers p 40 under him wonder stories was best of science fiction magazines of early 1930s clute illustrated encyclopedia p 100 and most successful of all gernsback s forays into field lasser shaped a new generation of writers who in many cases had no prior writing experience of any kind wonder stories was part of a forcing ground according to isaac asimov where young writers learned their trade magazine was less constrained by pulp convention than its competitors and published some novels such as eric temple bell s time stream and festus pragnell s green man of which were not in mainstream of development of science fiction genre as thrilling wonder magazine was much less influential until mid 1940s it was focused on younger readers and by time merwin and mines introduced a more adult approach astounding science fiction had taken over as unquestioned leader of field thrilling wonder could not compete with john campbell and golden age of science fiction that he brought into being but it did periodically publish good stories in end it was unable to escape its roots in pulp industry and died in carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in 1950s publication details
