christopher smart 11 april 1722 21 may 1771 was an english poet he was a major contributor to two popular magazines and a friend to influential cultural icons like samuel johnson and henry fielding smart a high church anglican was widely known throughout london mounsey 2001 p 281 smart was infamous as pseudonymous midwife mrs mary midnight and widespread accounts of his father in law john newbery locking him away in a mental asylum for many years over smart s supposed religious mania even after smart s eventual release a negative reputation continued to pursue him as he was known for incurring more debt than he could repay this ultimately led to his confinement in debtors prison until his death smart s two most widely known works are a song to david and jubilate agno both at least partly written during his confinement in asylum however jubilate agno was not published until 1939 and a song to david received mixed reviews until 19th century to his contemporaries smart was known mainly for his many contributions in journals midwife and student along with his famous seaton prize poems and his mock epic hilliad although he is primarily recognised as a religious poet his poetry includes various other themes such as his theories on nature and his promotion of english nationalism biography early life christopher smart was born in shipbourne in kent england on fairlawne estate of william viscount vane younger son of lord barnard of barnard castle mounsey p 22 he was according to his nephew of a delicate constitution having been born earlier than natural period hunter p vi he was baptised in wrotham parish on 11 may 1722 smart s father was peter smart p 4 or bailiff of fairlawne his mother was winifred smart of griffiths family of radnorshire wales sherbo p 5 winifred

during smart s younger years fairlawne was residence of christopher vane 1st baron barnard and lady barnard who bequeathed ps200 to smart sherbo p 6 he is supposed to have received so much money due to his father s closeness to vane family his being named after christopher vane and young boy was considered pride of however there is some controversy over exact nature of this inheritance while some cynically disagree with reasons for his inheritance no other explanation has been specified mounsey p 27 in 1726 three years after christopher vane died peter smart purchased hall place in east barming which included a mansion house fields orchards gardens and woodland a property that was influential throughout smart s later life from age of four until eleven he spent much time around farms but did not participate leading to speculations that he suffered from asthma attacks mounsey p 29 however not all scholars agree that he was a sickly youth sherbo p 12 only written record of events during his childhood comes from his writing of a short poem at age of four in which he challenges a rival to affections of a twelve year old girl while at hall place smart was sent to local maidstone grammar school where he was taught by charles walwyn a scholar from eton college who had received an ma from king s college cambridge in 1696 sherbo p 9 it was here that smart received an intensive education in latin and greek he did not complete his education at maidstone however as his father died on 3 february 1733 and his mother took smart and his siblings to live near relatives in durham after selling off a large portion of estate to pay off peter smart s debts sherbo p 19 smart then attended durham school where reverend mr richard was headmaster it is not known whether he lived with his uncle john smart or with a school master sherbo p 13 he spent vacations at raby castle which was owned by henry vane 1st earl of darlington grandson of christopher vane sherbo p 16 henry vane and his wife grace sister to william and henrietta fitzroy duke and duchess of cleveland had four children henry frederick anne and mary they were only a few years younger than smart and became playmates with anne and henry pairing off with christopher and his sister margaret respectively although nothing resulted from match anne has been traditionally described as being his first love sherbo p 17 during his time with vane family smart dedicated many poems to henrietta duchess of cleveland mounsey p 40 it was his closeness with vane family along with his skill for learning that encouraged henrietta to allow him a pension of 40 pounds yearly continued by her husband after her death in 1742 this allowed smart to attend pembroke college cambridge sherbo p 22 college thumb right christopher smart s pembroke portrait showing a letter sent from alexander pope smart was admitted to pembroke college on 20 october 1739 as a sizar under leonard addison sherbo p 24 although it is unclear why he chose pembroke college addison was named in peter smart s trust deed 1729 mounsey p 43 as a sizar he occasionally had to wait on fellows table and perform other menial tasks sherbo p 25 on 12 july 1740 he was awarded dr watt s foundation scholarship which granted him six pounds a year until he gained a bachelor of arts degree sherbo p 26 in addition to this income he was also granted four pounds a year for scholarship mounsey p 48 although he was successful academically he began to run up debt in order to pay for his extravagant lifestyle while at college during his time at pembroke smart borrowed numerous books spanning fields of literature religion and science mounsey p 44 these works helped when he wrote three tripos verse at end of each year mounsey p 47 these poems were written in latin and they along with his other latin poems like his translation of alexander pope s ode on st cecilia s day led to him being awarded craven scholarship for classics on 10 june 1742 which paid ps25 a year for 14 years mounsey p 49 these scholarships combined with his becoming a fellow in 1743 justified smart calling himself scholar of university sherbo p 31 in 1743 smart pushed his translation of pope s ode on st cecilia s day as carmen cl alexandri pope in s and paid for publication himself mounsey p 50 with this translation he wanted to win pope s favour and translate pope s essay on man but pope rejected idea and after a lettered response and a possible meeting between two smart translated pope s an essay on criticism de arte critica instead initial letter sent from pope recommending future translation was prized by smart sherbo p 33 in response to this letter and his budding relationship with pope pembroke fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding letter from pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of jubilee of pembroke s 400th year in 1744 mounsey p 51 in october 1745 smart was elected praelector of philosophy which paid one pound a year and made one of three keepers of common chest sherbo p 36 next year on 11 february 1746 he became a master of arts and was later elected on 10 october 1746 to praelector of philosophy praelector of rhetoric and keeper of common chest sherbo p 42 however he had run up more debt of over twice his annual income and he was not re elected in 1747 to praelectorship and was denied his control over common chest accounts sherbo p 44 45 however he was made a preacher before mayor of cambridge at college under title coram praetore and his modest living during this year allowed him to regain praelectorship in philosophy along with being made a catechist which suggests that he was ordained in anglican church sherbo p 45 in 1746 smart became tutor to john hussey delaval but this was abruptly cancelled because delaval was removed from pembroke after a variation of broken rules and mischief mounsey p 54 55 after recovering from this smart returned to studying in april 1747 a comedy he wrote just months before a trip to cambridge or grateful fair was performed in pembroke college hall with many parts including female roles played by smart himself sherbo p 53 54 prologue was printed in cambridge journal weekly flying post which claimed that play received universal applause sherbo p 54 during his final years at pembroke smart was writing and publishing many poems sherbo p 50 on 9 january 1748 there were three proposals for a collection of original poems by christopher smart m a fellow of pembroke hall in university of cambridge that would include hop garden judgment of midas a masque his odes his translations into latin and some original latin poems sherbo p 51 thomas gray on 17 march 1747 referred to this work as smart s collection of odes this collection was not printed in 1748 but was delayed until 1752 and was re titled poems on several occasions between 1740 and 1746 he was introduced to harriot pratt and he began to write poetry about her sherbo p 46 by 1749 he was in love with her and wrote to his friend charles burney father of fanny burney i am situated within a mile of my harriote love has friendship of her just dues there was a great musical crash at cambridge which was greatly admired but i was not there being much better pleased with hearing my harriote on her organ at her ancient mansion suggesting that he was living permanently in market downham london sherbo p 48 although he wrote many poems dedicated to harriot his poem lass with golden locks 1752 claims that he was done with both harriot polly and other women sherbo p 49 lass with golden locks who replaced smart s previous fancies was anna maria carnan poetical works iv p xxiii anna would be smart s future wife and she was stepdaughter of john newbery smart s future publisher sherbo p 87 london although smart seemed to turn his life around at pembroke he slowly abandoned college for london during 1749 smart listed himself on pembroke s liber and would occasionally return to pembroke throughout 1749 and 1750 sherbo p 57 because of his relationship with those at pembroke he was allowed to keep his name in college s records which allowed him to participate and be charged as a member of college by 1750 he was living near st james s park and was busy familiarising himself with grub street sherbo p 58 59 it was this year that smart developed a business relationship with john newbery sherbo p 59 smart worked for newbery and married his stepdaughter in 1752 it is unknown how smart and newbery met but smart s daughter claimed charles burney introduced two sherbo p 62 newbery was looking for a contributory to his midwife and student magazines and it is possible that smart s winning of cambridge s seatonian prize on 25 march 1750 brought his poetic abilities to newbery s attention seatonian prize was a contest for one english poem each year on topic of perfections or attributes of supreme being and prize would be rent of northamptonshire estate it was established by will of thomas seaton an anglican divine and hymn writer curry p 7 smart wrote in poetical essay tradition using miltonic blank verse in 1750 poem he won prize with was on eternity of supreme being prize was only worth 17 pounds each year before 7 pounds were deducted for publication of poem sherbo p 67 however after publication of poem smart became a regular contributor in student sherbo p 68 student before smart s work was a serious magazine that included a few poems and critical essays however once he joined and began writing under many pseudonyms magazine became filled with satire parody and humorous essays and poems along with him composing 15 of essays and majority of poems published in two volumes of magazine he decided to append three of inspector a humorous news report to second of volumes sherbo p 69 these reports included many puff pieces promoting smart s works along with various stories written by his friends and associates including famous writers poets henry fielding samuel johnson william collins and tobias smollett however this was not only important publication produced by him during this time during his time in london smart s work included mother midnight s oratory a series of wild tavern entertainments to which smart acted as writer and performer midwife thumb right title page of midwife midwife first published on 16 october 1751 and lasting until april 1753 was produced primarily by smart while he worked on student sherbo p 70 this magazine was popular enough to be published in four editions mounsey p 99 to hide his identity for practical and humorous reasons he adopted persona of a midwife also known as a mrs midwife in slang and called this persona mrs mary midnight when his poem night piece was attacked by william kenrick in or poetical ordinary possibly out of a prearranged publicity stunt smart used midwife in december 1750 to attack back at kenrick and promised an old woman s dunciad to be written against other poet sherbo p 72 however kenrick beat smart to use of title and printed his own in january 1751 this feud lasted as attacks published in a few issues of midwife but it soon died out when smart focused his attention to writing a prologue and epilogue for a production of othello and using magazine to promote it sherbo p 73 his attention slowly shifted away from midwife when he wrote for and won seatonian prize for his on immensity of supreme being and when he began working with newbery s children s magazine magazine sherbo p 74 75 however smart returned to this character full force when he established old woman s oratory or henley in petticoats in december 1751 sherbo p 75 oratory included smart playing as mrs midnight various songs and dances animal acts and miscellany acts mounsey p 119 oratory was successful and was completely redone on 21 january 1752 mounsey p 128 however not everyone enjoyed show and horace walpole described performance as lowest buffoonery in world even to me who am used to my uncle horace sherbo p 80 late in 1752 smart finished and published a collection of his works as poems on several occasions which resulted in end of oratory and midwife mounsey p 130 131 later career thumb right illustration of hop garden in 1752 christopher smart was slowly dragged into a large paper war that involved many of london s writers mounsey p 131 132 after publication of poems on several occasions including hop garden in june 1752 john hill launched a major attack upon smart s poetry mounsey p 131 smart responded with his mock epic hilliad mounsey p 134 before release of smart s poem hill was engaged in a large literary battle between various members of grub street s and london s writing community especially henry fielding bertelsen p 135 this battle may have been for publicity only and lasted over many months before smart involved himself bertelsen p 143 however even with such a late entry his hilliad was loudest broadside of war bertelsen p 144 smart was incurring many debts and started publishing as much as possible during this time to support his family he was married to anna maria carnan around mid 1752 and in 1754 already had two daughters marianne 3 may 1753 and elizabeth anne 27 october 1754 sherbo p 100 as a married man he could no longer stay enrolled at pembroke and collect his scholarship money when his marriage and children were made apparent to heads of college newbery allowed smart along with his wife and their children to live at canonbury house islington although newbery had a strong reputation for charity he was determined to have complete control over his writers mounsey p 149 it is likely that such an attitude combined with monetary problems led to a rift forming between two in 1753 mounsey p 157 between 1753 and 1755 smart published or republished at least 79 works mahony and rizzo however even if he received money from each of these publications these publications were unable to provide enough of an income to support a family especially to his standard of living mounsey p 159 while he was producing a poem each year for seatonian prize this amounted to very little of his writing he was forced into a life of hack work which was described by his contemporary arthur murphy as a bookseller is his only friend but for that bookseller however liberal he must toil and drudge mounsey p 167 in december 1755 he finished works of horace translated literally into english prose a translation of horace which was widely used but brought him little profit sherbo p 102 he signed a 99 year contract in november 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled universal visitor or monthly memorialist for thomas gardner and edmund allen sherbo p 104 however strain of publishing caused smart to suffer from a fit and he was unable to keep up with publishing of paper sherbo p 105 allen was a friend of samuel johnson and it was samuel johnson along with many other friends of smart who contributed to magazine in order to help smart keep up with his contract in march 1756 newbery published without smart s authority smart s final seatonian prize poem on goodness of supreme being and later on 5 june newbery published without smart s authority smart s hymn to supreme being a poem which thanked god for recovery over an illness of some kind possibly a disturbed mental state curry p 5 hymn to supreme being marks time in smart s life after mysterious fit was resolved and beginning of smart s obsession with religion and his praying without ceasing curry p 6 7 asylum confinement thumb a caricature of christopher smart in tommy tagg s book published by john newbery a commission of lunacy was taken out against smart and he was admitted to st luke s hospital for lunatics on 6 may 1757 as a curable patient sherbo p 112 it is possible that smart was confined by newbery over old debts and a poor relationship between two newbery had previously mocked smart and his immorality in his a collection of pretty poems for amusement of children six foot high mounsey p 181 regardless of exact reasons there is evidence suggesting that newbery s admittance of smart into mental asylum was not based on madness mounsey p 200 however there is also evidence that an incident of some kind took place in st james s park in which smart started to pray loudly in public until he had routed all company jubilate agno it is not known what exactly happened during his confinement but smart did work on two of his most famous poems jubilate agno and a song to david mounsey p 202 what is known is that he may have been in a private madhouse before st luke s and that he was later moved from st luke s to mr potter s asylum until his release mounsey p 203 at st luke s he transitioned from being curable to incurable and was moved to mr potter s asylum for monetary reasons mounsey p 203 204 during this time anna left and took children with her to ireland sherbo p 135 his isolation led him into writing religious poetry although he abandoned traditional genres of 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote jubilate agno guest p 123 although it is debated as to whether his turning inward to examine himself in his poetry represents an evangelical type of christianity his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for unmediated revelation hawes p 140 there is an inner light that serves as a focal point for smart and his poems written during this time and that inner light connects him to christian god hawes p 141 smart was left alone except for his cat and occasional gawker sherbo p 130 it is very possible that he felt homeless during this time and surely felt that he was in a limbo between public and private space hawes p 155 in london only a few of his works were still being published mounsey p 238 however not everyone viewed smart s madness as problematic and johnson defended him sometimes seriously and sometimes comically many times keymer p 190 a century later robert browning later remarked that a song to david was great because smart was mad and that poem allowed him to rank alongside of milton and keats jacobs p 193 it is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to mr potter s and freed him he was discharged from st luke s asylum uncured after one year he was thought to be confined elsewhere for following seven years during which time he wrote jubilate agno elizabeth his daughter claimed he grew better and some misjudging friends who misconstrued mr newbery s great kindness in placing him under necessary salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more mounsey p 239 although this may be a of events smart did leave asylum on 30 january 1763 mounsey p 240 final years a song to david was printed on 6 april 1763 along with a proposal for a new translation of psalms mounsey p 247 248 it is said that smart composed poem during his second period of confinement to an asylum during an episode of religious mania poem was received harshly which was possibly just thinly veiled personal attacks over smart being freed from asylum just weeks before mounsey p 249 however kenrick smart s former rival praised poem in one of his own printed on 25 may 1763 mounsey p 250 also john lockman followed on 21 june 1763 with his own poem in praise of smart s and samuel boyce followed this on 15 july 1763 with another mounsey p 252 along with this support smart responded to his critics at critical review in regards to smart s response critical review claimed that they would say no more of mr smart mounsey p 257 after a song to david he tried to publish a collection of his psalms translations and newbery sought to ruin him by hiring james merrick to produce his own translations mounsey p 260 newbery then hired smart s new publisher james fletcher which in turn forced smart to find a new publisher delaying printing of his psalms mounsey p 261 finally on 12 august 1765 he printed a translation of psalms of david which included hymns and spiritual songs and a second edition of a song to david poetical works iii p xiii this work was criticised by tobias smollett who was working with newbery at time and newbery s edition by merrick was constantly compared with smart s mounsey p 267 however modern criticism has received smart s version in a more favourable light davie p 828 while working on this project he was also working on a translation of phaedrus and a verse translation of horace mounsey p 268 his verse horace was published in july 1767 including a preface in which he attacked newbery but attack was in vain because newbery died soon after mounsey p 269 on 20 april 1770 smart was arrested for debt mounsey p 271 on 11 january 1771 he was tried by lord mansfield gentleman who originally introduced smart to alexander pope and he was soon recommended to king s bench prison mounsey p 272 although he was in prison charles burney purchased rules allowing him some freedom and smart s final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic rizzo p 515 in his final letter smart begged for money from rev mr jackson saying being upon recovery from a fit of illness and having nothing to eat i beg you to send me two or three shillings which god willing i will return with many thanks in two or three days dearnley p 11 on 20 may 1771 smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work hymns for amusement of children death in response to his uncle s death christopher hunter wrote i trust he is now at peace it was not his portion here curry qtd p 103 fanny burney in her journal wrote on 22 may 1771 a jury of twelve fellow inmates of king s bench prison declared that smart upon twentieth day of may instant died a natural death within rules of prison he was buried on 26 may in st paul s covent garden literary themes and styles christopher smart received occasional mentions by critics and scholars after his death especially by robert browning but analysis and commentary on his works increased dramatically with discovery of jubilate agno in 1939 poetical works i p xxii many recent critics approach smart from a religious perspective neil curry harriet guest clement hawes chris mounsey however some also favour a psychology sexual analysis of his works lance bertelsen hawes alan liu religion thumb right a page from let side of jubilate agno manuscript thumb right a page from for side of jubilate agno manuscript although smart wrote seatonian prize poems early on there is a contrast between mimicked miltonic blank verse and intense exploration of religion found in his later works guest p 70 his first seatonian prize poem on eternity of supreme being is part of two traditional types of religious writing authoritative discourse of religious poetry and tentative and self critical discourse of an apparently more personal devotion guest p 71 in connecting two he redefines role of religious poet by establishing a debate between these two forms harriet guest claims that smart creates a poetic space which allows poet to make provisional even questionable statements which are important to his later works guest p 83 to guest smart in his religious poems is not concerned to offer instruction in christian conduct guest p 94 besides greater theological debate poems also are origins of smart s belief that all of creation is constantly praising god and that a poet must give voice to mute nature s praise of god curry p 8 jubilate agno reflects an abandonment of traditional poetic structures in order to explore complex religious thought guest p 132 his let verses join creation together as he seemingly writes his own version of biblical poetry guest p 140 smart in jubilate agno plays on words and meaning behind words in order to participate with divine that exists within language guest p 167 although original manuscript divided let and for verses onto opposing sides of manuscript karina williams claims that dr w h bond then discovered that some of let and for folios were numbered and dated concurrently and that these chronologically parallel texts were further connected by verbal links prose works i p xxii this justified her combining two sides to follow each other using this as a model guest claims that for verses explore religion with a personal tone and let are unambiguous and deal with public matters guest p 141 142 jeanne walker goes further than guest and claims that let and for sections are united with hebrew tradition and iterate both present and future simultaneously that is they redeem time walker p 458 words and language connect poet to divine revelation and god is great poet who used language in order to create universe curry p 28 through words and language smart attempted to capture creative power of those words hawes p 140 141 by relying on power of words smart is according to clement hawes subverting anglican control over religious functions and services hawes p 152 in essence smart s approach to religion in jubilate agno is comparable to john wesley s theological dictum and to writings of john perro and william bowling hawes p 163 he also creates his own natural philosophy and criticises science like that established by isaac newton for their ignoring glory of almighty god guest p 201 to smart each piece of matter is alive because it is connected to god and matter cannot be described in a cold manner that disconnects it from this reality guest p 214 however smart accomplished his new science by relying on newtonian empiricism mounsey p 221 as part of his desire to bring back divine language to poetry and science he creates an ark of salvation in order to describe a prophetic and apocalyptic future which emphasises importance of christ and england prose works i p xxv along with being prophetic poem itself is modelled after canticles and follows form of benedicite benedicite is not only model however and there is a strong link between jubilate agno and psalm tradition walker p 450 smart s a song to david is an attempt to bridge poetry written by humans and biblical poetry guest p 246 biblical david plays an important role in this poem just as he played an important role in jubilate p 167 however david in jubilate agno is an image of creative power of poetry whereas he becomes a fully realised model of religious poet by focusing on david smart is able to tap into heavenly language jacobs p 189 many critics have focused on role of david as planner of solomon s temple and his possible role with freemasons curry p 57 however true life of poem comes later when christ is introduced as major subject after christ is introduced smart attempts to reach to heaven and final passages to neil curry represent a final rush for glory curry p 69 according to mounsey a song to david and smart s psalms is an attempt to christianize old testament through writing an 18th century psalter mounsey p 213 however psalms perform a secondary function they allow smart to relate to suffering of david and to reinforce his own religious convictions by following his biblical model curry p 44 as part of smart s christianizing of psalms jesus becomes a divine form of suffering and smart becomes further juxtaposed with his biblical model as both praise god for jesus s ultimate sacrifice and for beauty of all creation hymns and psalms form their own sort of liturgy and attempt to reform anglican liturgy by emphasising god s place in nature guest p 251 smart s hymns are modelled after a tradition exemplified by robert nelson curry p 74 they are steeped in anglican tradition and also emphasise english patriotism and england s divine favour curry p 76 hymns according to guest express a delight in creation that is largely absent from work of other hymn writers of century unless they are paraphrasing words of david guest p 252 to hawes hymns exemplify an evangelical spirit that separates smart from traditional anglican church hawes p 134 although he wrote his second set of hymns hymns for amusement of children for a younger audience smart cares more about emphasising need for children to be moral instead of innocent curry p 91 these works have been seem as possibly too complicated for amusement because they employee ambiguities and complicated theological concepts booth p 71 in essence hymns for amusement of children is intended to teach children specific virtues that make up subject matter of work curry p 93 like hymns for amusement of children smart s parables of our lord and saviour jesus christ were designed to teach morals parker p 88 however these parables alter original biblical parables in order to simplify them and help them make sense parker p 95 as such todd parker claims that parables and other religious works of smart are part of his final push for evangelization of london s reading public parker p 84 language language and commentary on language is of particular emphasis in jubilate agno to alan jacobs smart s use of language represents his attempt to connect to ur language allowing smart to connect to word calling forth world jacobs p 196 this is similar to david and orpheus s ability as poets to create through their song in his constant emphasis on force of poetry jubilate agno takes on qualities of ars poetica tradition ennis p 8 as such smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to one true eternal poem ennis p 10 poetic language that he creates is related to adam s tradition or idea that names hold significant weight in universe and that adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects costa p 296 in jubilate agno he describes his writing as creating impressions liu p 127 to accomplish this task he incorporated puns and in order to emphasise theological significance of his poetic language costa p 305 in addition to these techniques he relied on repeated language and allusions to traditional works and to scripture for a source of authority in various works especially in his hymns walsh p 40 along with scriptural authority he relies on prophetic rhetoric to gain his audience s sympathy katz p 54 during 18th century there was a debate over poetic language and translations of smart especially of horace positioned him as one who sought to redeem traditional forms and understanding of language walsh something old p 147 however some critics like alan liu believe that translations are effectively forced to compete against original works and that smart s language at least in his translations must constantly seek to undermine original authors like horace liu p 133 not all critics agree with liu and those like donald davie believe that smart s translations cannot be compared to original works but are part of a system of smart competing against language of his contemporaries davie p 825 thomas keymer further verified this point about smart s translations by revealing that poet claims in william toldervy s history of two orphans but what heaven exciting harmony might we not expect from that exalted genius who can produce such lines as these following in anticipation of replacing previous flawed translations of psalms keymer p 57 regardless of where he stood on specific issue of translation smart believed that there was an importance to language which carried over to his constant revising of his poems to slowly correct them mahony p 196 many of smart s poems served a dual purpose and when put to music were altered to meet various standards mahony p 200 by constantly revising he ensured that his poems were always authentic version mahony p 203 gender smart s role as mrs midnight along with his gendered comments in jubilate agno form focal point for analysing his understanding of sexuality and gender with mrs midnight smart challenges traditional social order found in 18th century england bertelsen p 364 however some like lance bertelsen claim that mrs midnight persona reveals a split personality torn between masculine and feminine roles bertelsen p 365 fraser easton claims that existence of mrs midnight proves that smart identified a female connection to poetry and her character was used to defy popular 18th century notions of who is able to attain knowledge easton p 198 this role allowed smart to focus on social and sexual dimensions in his satire easton p 200 however there is a potentially darker side to mrs midnight and she could represent his feelings that he was emasculated by economic pressures hawes bawdy p 9 image of horns in jubilate agno is commonly viewed as a sexual image liu p 121 easton puts particular emphasis on image of horns as a phallic image and contends that there are masculine and feminine horns throughout smart s poem easton p 234 hawes picks up this theme and goes on to claims that poem shows that smart had been feminized as a cuckold hawes bawdy p 4 in response to this possible jubilate agno predicts a misogynistic future while simultaneously undermining this effort with his constant associations to female creation hawes bawdy p 16 environmental smart had a reputation for being a dedicated gardener dearnley p 46 his poem hop garden helped to further this reputation and even during his stay in a mental asylum he convinced others of his bond with nature johnson witnessed smart s time in asylum and stated he has partly as much exercise as he used to have for he digs in garden boswell s life of johnson gardening to smart was a way in which humans could interact with nature and actually improve on natural landscape dearnley p 47 however smart did not only write about gardens and vegetation and his focus on his cat jeoffry is widely known and his focus on nature connects him to those mistreated and neglected by 18th century society bertelsen p 375 first fragment of jubilate agno is a poetic ark that pairs humans with animals in order to purify all of creation whole work relies on his extensive background in botany and his knowledge of taxonomy mounsey p 226 smart actively participated in 18th century taxonomy systems established by carl linnaeus however smart is mythologising his view of nature and creation when he adds information from pliny elder into his work miller p 109 by using this knowledge smart was able to give a voice to nature he believed that nature like his cat jeoffry is always praising god but needs a poet in order to bring out that voice as such themes of animals and language are merged in jubilate agno and jeoffry is transformed into a manifestation of ars poetica tradition ennis p 16 freemasonry many critics have focused on role of david as planner of solomon s temple and his possible role with freemasons although it is not known for sure whether christopher was a freemason or not there is evidence suggesting that he was either part of organisation or had a strong knowledge of its belief system rose p 404 based on personal admittance to contributing to a defence of freemasonry contemporary verification of his participation in volume and with masonic meetings there is enough to confirm his participation in masonic affairs sherbo p 221 furthermore there are accounts of smart attending meetings at bell tavern in westminster lane john masonic records 1717 1886 london 1886 p 4 23 information available has led marie roberts to declare in her 1986 book british poets and secret societies it has been universally accepted by scholars that christopher smart was a freemason yet no record of his membership has been traced roberts 1986 p 10 however in notes to chris mounsey s 2001 book christopher smart clown of god marie roberts 1986 book is referred to as an account of smart s work which accepts his association with freemasons but in mounsey s view since neither smart s name nor his pseudonyms appear in records of freemasons it is highly unlikely he was ever one of their number mounsey 2001 p 320 smart s involvement with masonry can be traced through his poems including jubilate agno and a song to david with his constant references to masonic ideas and his praise of free masonry in general roberts 1986 pp 10 11 in jubilate agno smart declares i am lord s builder and free and accepted mason in christ jesus b 109 this declaration of being a free and accepted mason has been interpreted to define his connection to speculative masonry in christ jesus declaration places smart within a christian version of masonry he also declares himself as lord s builder and this connects his life with building of king solomon s temple an important masonic idea in a song to david smart returns to building of solomon s temple and incorporates many of masonic images that he uses in jubilate agno roberts 1986 p 11 it was this detail that encouraged many critics to try and decode seven pillar section of a song of david along lines of masonic imagery poem follows two traditional sets of motions common to freemason writing that mimic image of jacob s ladder movement from earth to heaven and movement from heaven to earth rose p 405 this image further connects freemason belief surrounding relationship of david to solomon s temple rose p 407 while these images and further images in a song to david are related also to depictions of temple in isaac newton s chronology of ancient kingdoms amended 1728 john bunyan s solomon s temple d 1688 and to geneva bible these works were relied on by freemasons rose p 409 based on this theory first pillar greek alpha represents mason s compass and god as architect of universe rose p 406 second greek gamma represents mason s square rose pp 406 407 in addition square represents vault of heaven third greek eta represents jacob s ladder itself and is connected to complete idea of seven pillars rose p 408 fourth greek theta is either all seeing eye or point within a circle fifth letter greek iota represents a pillar and temple rose p 410 sixth letter greek sigma is an incomplete hexagram otherwise known as blazing star or to freemasons last greek omega represents a lyre and david as a poet rose p 413 works thumb first page of abimelech 1768 smart throughout his career published many known works although his works are far too many to list a few of his most famous and important publications during his life include a song to david poems on several occasions including hop garden hilliad hop garden hymns and spiritual songs epistle to mrs tyler psalm 58
