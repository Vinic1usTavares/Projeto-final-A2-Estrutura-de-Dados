19 march 1970 at bromley register office in bromley london they had an open marriage angela described their union as a marriage of convenience we got married so that i could work to get a permit i didn t think it would last and david said before we got married i m not really in love with you and i thought that s probably a good thing she said bowie said about angela that living with her is like living with a blow torch their son duncan born on 30 may 1971 was at first known as zowie doggett 2011 p 114 bowie and angela divorced on 8 february 1980 in switzerland bowie received custody of their

primarily in new york city and london as well as owning an apartment in sydney s elizabeth bay and britannia bay house on island of mustique now renamed mandalay estate sexuality bowie declared himself gay in an interview with michael watts for a 1972 issue of melody maker coinciding with his campaign for stardom as ziggy stardust according to buckley if ziggy confused both his creator and his audience a big part of that confusion centred on topic of sexuality buckley 2005 p 140 in a september 1976 interview with playboy bowie said it s true i am a bisexual but i can t deny that i ve used that fact very well i suppose it s best thing that ever happened to me his first wife angie supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that bowie had a relationship with mick jagger in a 1983 interview with rolling stone bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was biggest mistake i ever made and i was always a closet heterosexual on other occasions he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of times and situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings buckley 2005 p asked bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake after a long pause he said i don t think it was a mistake in europe but it was a lot tougher in america i had no problem with people knowing i was bisexual but i had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality and in puritanical america i think it stood in way of so much i wanted to do buckley wrote that bowie mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock buckley 2005 p 141 and was probably never gay nor even consistently actively bisexual instead experimenting out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with buckley 2005 p 147 biographer christopher sandford said according to mary finnigan with whom bowie had an affair in 1969 singer and his first wife angie created their bisexual fantasy sandford 1997 p 48 sandford wrote that bowie made a positive fetish of repeating quip that he and his wife had met while fucking same bloke gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter that bowie s actual tastes swung other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women bbc s mark easton wrote in 2016 that britain was far more tolerant of difference and that gay rights such as same sex marriage and gender equality would not have enjoyed broad support they do today without bowie s androgynous challenge all those years ago spirituality and religion over years bowie made numerous references to religions and to his evolving spirituality beginning in 1967 he became interested in buddhism and considered becoming a buddhist monk after a few months study at tibet house in london he was told by a lama you don t want to be buddhist you should follow music by 1975 bowie admitted i felt totally absolutely alone and i probably was alone because i pretty much had abandoned god in his will bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in bali in accordance with buddhist rituals after bowie married iman in a private ceremony in 1992 he said they knew that their real marriage sanctified by god had to happen in a church in florence earlier that year he knelt on stage at freddie mercury tribute concert and recited lord s prayer before a television audience in 1993 bowie said he had an undying belief in unquestionable existence of god in a separate 1993 interview while describing genesis of music for his album black tie white noise he said it was important for me to find something musically that also had no sort of representation of institutionalized and organized religion of which i m not a believer i must make that clear simon bates radio interviews bbc radio 1 29 31 march 1993 interviewed in 2005 bowie said whether god exists is not a question that can be answered i m not quite an atheist and it worries me there s that little bit that holds on well i m almost an atheist give me a couple of months i ve nearly got it right questioning his spiritual life was always germane to bowie s songwriting song station to station is very much concerned with stations of cross song also specifically references kabbalah bowie called album extremely dark nearest album to a magick treatise that i ve written earthling showed abiding need in me to vacillate between atheism or a kind of gnosticism what i need is to find a balance

matters of mysticism and mortality politics in 1976 speaking as thin white duke bowie s persona at time and at least partially tongue in cheek he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for adolf hitler in interviews with playboy nme and a swedish publication bowie was quoted as saying britain is ready for a fascist leader i think britain could benefit from a fascist leader after all fascism is really nationalism i believe very strongly in fascism people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership he was also quoted as saying adolf hitler was one of first rock stars and you ve got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with melody maker in october 1977 blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at time saying i was out of my mind totally completely crazed in 1980s and 1990s bowie s public statements shifted sharply towards anti racism and anti fascism in an interview with mtv in 1983 bowie criticised channel for not providing enough coverage of black musicians and music videos for china girl and let s dance were described by bowie as a very simple very direct statement against racism album tin machine took a more direct stance against fascism and neo nazism and was criticised for being too preachy in 2016 filmmaker and activist michael moore said he had wanted to use panic in detroit for his 1998 documentary big one denied at first he was given rights after calling bowie personally i ve read stuff since his death saying that he wasn t that political and he stayed away from politics but that wasn t conversation that i had with him death thumb a woman
