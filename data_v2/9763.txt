standing on a road pre race favourites for victory were maurice garin and hippolyte aucouturier garin dominated race from start by winning first stage a parcours from paris to lyon stage started at 15 16 and cyclists initially rode with a speed of 35 km h first cyclists abandoned after around at 23 00 garin and emile pagie leading race reached control point in nevers garin expected at that point that they would finish at 8 00 next morning during night garin s main rival aucouturier had stomach cramps and was unable to finish stage also during that first stage first breach of rules occurred jean fischer had used a car as pacer which was illegal pagie fell down but got up again he and garin kept leading race during night around 9 00 in morning both reached lyon garin got away from pagie and finished one minute ahead thumb upright finish of first tour alt on left a classic automobile and a group of men standing one of them holding a bicycle although aucouturier had abandoned in first stage and so was not eligible for general classification he could still start rest of stages in second stage aucouturier was able to win sprint in third stage cyclists who were competing for general classification started one hour earlier than other cyclists including aucouturier at end of that stage a group of four cyclists had broken away and eugene won sprint aucouturier finished 27 minutes later but this meant that he had run course 33 minutes faster so he was declared winner of stage garin retained lead helped by a crash of second placed pagie in second stage which eliminated him from

abandoned in 3rd stage took victory becoming first non french winner as in third stage cyclists departed in two groups and laeser was in second group because he was no longer contending for general classification laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists but he had travelled distance 4 minutes faster than them so he was declared winner at that point garin was leading with emile georget almost two hours behind in fifth stage georget had two flat tires and fell asleep when he stopped at side of road to rest he failed to finish thus garin extended his lead by winning this stage carrying nearly three hours advantage into final day s racing garin had requested other cyclists in leading group to let him win stage but fernand augereau refused to do this garin then had lucien pothier throw down his bicycle in front of augereau who fell and garin then bent augereau s rear wheel augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to finish however garin easily won
