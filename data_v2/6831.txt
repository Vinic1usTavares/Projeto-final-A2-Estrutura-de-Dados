baltimore city paper gave album a positive review saying stay trippy winds up as something of a triumph one of year s most thoroughly enjoyable major label albums david jeffries of allmusic said fans will need four or five hands to count all other laugh out loud punch lines and even if this album is redundant and overstuffed with hedonism and recklessness that s just juicy being juicy rick florino of artistdirect stated stay trippy is as wild as modern hip hop gets it s a slick seductive and stone romp through a hazy synth boom strip club ready beats and some of juicy j s tightest rapping to date stacy ann ellis of vibe gave album a positive review saying despite wild assortment of flows and flavors juicy j manages to avoid being eclipsed on his own project their presence only amplifies quality of his offering a hypothesis that is reinforced by three of album s standout pieces b j steiner of xxl said stay trippy is a record that knows to stay within lane that it s carved for itself big budget stripper rap has rarely sounded so fresh nick henderson of tiny mix tapes gave album three out of five stars saying on stay trippy juicy j sounds as energized self assured and dangerous as ever patrick taylor of rapreviews com stated even if juicy j s brand of explicit hip hop isn t your cup of syrup you have to admire man for staying relevant and good as he nears his third decade in

elysa gardner of usa today stated stay trippy can be musically compelling granted words are hard to miss stay motivated stay high stay hustling forget everything else he intones on so much money a title that sums up highest virtue in j s world david rek lee of hiphopdx said some rap is tailor made for headphone listening and careful analysis of every word then there are songs that are meant to be played loud in public settings and lyrics don t matter so much if you haven t already figured it out stay trippy is latter and for as much flack as it receives there is entertainment value there and it serves its purpose as a soundtrack to trippy lifestyle accolades stay trippy was ranked number 20 on spins list of 40 best hip hop albums of 2013 they commented saying this is basically what juiceman s been doing for 20 years self producing albums of bellowing bass eerie synths and shouted slogans it helps that his sound helped spawn wildly popular things like atlanta trap and chicago drill it helps that wiz khalifa helped him acquire budget to get an absolutely monstrous low end and it helps that we re not sick of bandz a make her dance it was also positioned at number 27 on complexs list of 50 best albums of 2013 they said armed with an endless barrage of rattling beats and a host of just so over top ridiculous you have to laugh punchlines and enough believable gangsta
