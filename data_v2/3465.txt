mistle thrush turdus viscivorus is a bird common to much of europe asia and north africa it is a year round resident in a large part of its range but northern and eastern populations migrate south for winter often in small flocks it is a large thrush with pale grey brown upper parts a greyish white chin and throat and black spots on its pale yellow and off white under parts sexes are similar in plumage and its three subspecies show only minimal differences male has a loud far carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather earning bird old name of stormcock found in open woods parks hedges and cultivated land mistle thrush feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates seeds and berries its preferred fruits include those of mistletoe holly and yew mistletoe is favoured where it is available and this is reflected in thrush s english and scientific names plant a parasitic species benefits from its seeds being excreted by thrush onto branches where they can germinate in winter a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard open cup nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch and is fearlessly defended against potential predators sometimes including humans or cats clutch typically of three to five eggs is incubated for 12 15 days mainly by female chicks fledge about 14 16 days after hatching there are normally two broods there was a large range expansion in 18th and early 19th centuries and a small decline in recent decades perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices given its high numbers and very large range this thrush is classified by international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern taxonomy mistle thrush was first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific names linnaeus 1758 p 168 turdus is latin for thrush and viscivorus mistletoe eater comes from mistletoe and to devour brookes 2006 p 952 jobling 2010 p 393 jobling 2010 p 404 bird s liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name mistle being an old name for plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in genus turdus characterised by rounded heads longish pointed wings and usually melodious songs clement et al 2000 pp 36 38 a mitochondrial dna study identified mistle thrush s closest relatives as similarly plumaged song and chinese thrushes these three species are early offshoots from eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as blackbird t merula which are descended from ancestors that had colonised caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there at least eight subspecies have been proposed but differences are mainly clinal with birds of nominate subspecies becoming paler and less densely spotted in east of range currently accepted subspecies are clement et al 2000 pp 397 491 turdus viscivorus viscivorus linnaeus 1758 nominate subspecies t v bonapartei cabanis 1860 t v deichleri erlanger 1897 an isolated population in crimea has sometimes been separated as t v tauricus but this is not considered to be a valid form mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily description thumb in kazakhstan mistle thrush is largest thrush native to europe nominate subspecies measures in length with a wingspan it weighs with an average of around it has a stocky upright posture when on ground it has pale grey brown upperparts chin and throat are greyish white and yellowish buff breast and off white belly are marked with round black spots spotting becomes denser on lower chest giving appearance of a breast band long tail has white tips on outer feathers and underwing coverts are white eyes are dark brown and bill is blackish with a yellowish base to lower mandible legs and feet are yellowish brown there are no plumage differences between sexes juveniles are similar to adults but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of feathers and smaller spots on yellowish underparts by their first winter they are very similar to adults but underparts are usually more buff toned eastern subspecies t v bonapartei is in length and therefore slightly larger than nominate form it is paler grey above and whiter below with fewer black spots birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of ob river where range overlaps with viscivorus southern race t v deichleri resembles bonapartei in appearance but is closer in size to nominate viscivorus although it has a more slender bill adults have a full moult after breeding beginning between late may and end of june and completed by early october juvenile birds have a partial moult replacing their head body and covert feathers this is completed by october although start of moult depends on when chicks hatched mistle thrush is much larger paler and longer tailed than sympatric song thrush in western himalayas it could be confused with both plain backed and long tailed thrushes these are similar to mistle thrush but plain backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars is more rufous above than its relative and is barred rather than spotted below long tailed thrush has olive toned upperparts bars on its breast and two wing bars juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white s thrush but that species has golden yellow plumage scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern voice male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles sounding like or similar repeated three to six times and used to advertise his territory attract a mate and maintain pair bond clement et al 2000 p 41 tone resembles that of song thrush or blackbird but compared to its relatives mistle thrush s repertoire is less varied and delivery is slower song is however much louder often audible up to 2 km 2 000 yd away song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from november to early june male is most vocal in early morning and its tendency to sing after and sometimes during wet and windy weather led to old name stormcock song may be heard in any month although it is uncommon from july to august while thrush is moulting main call given by both sexes is a dry chattering louder when it is alarmed or excited it is often likened to sound of a football rattle a form of musical ratchet there is also a squeaky tuk contact call distribution and habitat thumb an adult right with two juveniles feeding on a lawn mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia although it is absent from treeless far north and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe turkey and middle east in these warmer southern areas it tends to be found in milder uplands and coastal regions nominate t v viscivorus breeds in europe and in asia east to ob beyond which it is replaced by t v bonapartei southern form t v deichleri is resident in north africa corsica and sardinia mistle thrush is a partial migrant birds from north and east of range wintering in milder areas of europe and north africa scandinavian and russian birds start moving south from mid september onwards most birds wintering in europe western turkey and middle east between mid october and november large numbers cross strait of gibraltar and others pass through cyprus but there is hardly any migration across north sea breeding birds in british isles and north west europe are resident or move only short distances in himalayas breeding population moves to nearby lower altitude sites in winter return migration starts mainly from late march although it can be a month earlier in middle east and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late april or early may migration may be by day or night and typically involves individuals or small groups vagrant birds have occurred in azores china crete faroe islands iceland japan oman saudi arabia sikkim and united arab emirates in winter 2017 2018 first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees including forests plantations hedges and town parks in south and east of its range it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and range extends above main tree line where dwarf juniper is present breeding occurs at up to in mountains of north africa and occasionally much higher to in highlands of europe its preferred altitude is from snow perrins 1998 pp 1230 1234 more open habitats such as agricultural land moors and grassy hills are extensively used in winter or on migration there is evidence that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range in germany and elsewhere in central europe it was found only in coniferous forest until mid 1920s when its range rapidly expanded first into farmland and then to suburbs and urban parks reasons for this expansion are unclear fuller 2003 p 28 in areas of intensive farming such as eastern england arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built up areas with their greater variety of green habitats perhaps most notable find of 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi new brunswick this was first record for this species in north america discovery attracted many from canada and united states sightings continued from early december 2017 through late march 2018 behaviour mistle thrushes are found as individuals or pairs for much of year although families forage together in late summer and groups may merge to form large flocks when food sources are plentiful it is not uncommon for up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year they roost at night in trees or bushes again typically as individuals or pairs except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together mistle thrush is quite terrestrial hopping with its head held up and body erect when excited it will flick its wings and tail flight consists of undulating bounds interspersed with glides breeding thumb male left passing earthworms to female on nest mistle thrushes breed in year subsequent to their hatching they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout year in areas where they are not migratory their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes although nest territory is only about around is used for feeding territories are normally reoccupied in subsequent years territories are larger in woods than in farmland male will attack intruders into its breeding area including birds of prey and corvids and sometimes cats or humans courtship feeding of female by her partner has sometimes been observed breeding typically commences in mid march in south and west of europe late february in britain but not till early may in finland nest is usually built in a tree in fork of a branch or against trunk although hedges ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used nest site may be up to above ground although is more typical common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush vigilance of chaffinch and aggressive behaviour of thrush benefiting both species thrush s nest is a large cup of sticks dry grass roots and moss coated on inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves nest is built by female although male may help nests built early in breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather clutch is typically three to five eggs range two to six which are usually whitish buff or greenish blue and are spotted with red purple or brown average size of egg is and weighs of which 6 is shell eggs are incubated for 12 15 days mainly by female chicks are altricial and downy and are fed by both parents they fledge about 14 16 days after hatching there are normally two broods except in siberia where there is only one male feeding fledglings from first brood while female sits on second clutch sometimes same nest is reused for both broods young are dependent on their parents for 15 20 days after fledging in a study carried out in britain survival rate for juveniles in their first year is 57 per cent and adult annual survival rate is 62 per cent life expectancy is typically three years but maximum age recorded from bird ringing recoveries is 21 years and 3 months for a bird shot in switzerland feeding thumb mistle thrush derives its english and scientific names from mistletoe a favourite food mistle thrushes feed mainly on invertebrates fruit and berries animal prey include earthworms insects and other arthropods slugs and snails snails are sometimes smashed on a stone anvil a technique also used by song thrush mistle thrush has been known to kill slowworms and young of song thrush blackbird and dunnock plant food includes fruits and seeds of bushes and trees mainly holly yew ivy and mistletoe but also for example blackberry cherry elder hawthorn olive and rose it may eat flowers and shoots of grasses and other plants and will take fallen apples and plums it forages within its breeding habitat and in open fields sometimes sharing these feeding areas with redwings or fieldfares young birds are initially mainly fed on invertebrates often collected from low foliage or under bushes rather than in grassland preferred by adults adults will roam up to 1 km approximately 1 100 yards from nest on pasture or ploughed land after fledging young may accompany their parents until onset of winter individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit bearing trees throughout winter with preference shown for trees which host mistletoe parasitic plant from which bird derives its name where mistletoe is not present holly is most common tree chosen snow snow 2010 pp 154 156 although thrush normally feeds on ground and from low bushes defence of this resource conserves fruit for later in season when other food items become scarce trees are defended against other thrushes as well as birds such as and great spotted woodpecker in milder winters with an abundance of fruit however this strategy is less used and thrushes can be observed foraging in flocks conversely in hard winters defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares redwings or bohemian waxwings as its name implies mistle thrush is important in propagating mistletoe an aerial parasite which needs its seeds to be deposited on branches of suitable trees highly nutritious fruits are favoured by thrush which digests flesh leaving sticky seeds to be excreted possibly in a suitable location for germination rothschild clay 1953 p 28 predators and parasites a castor bean tick swollen with blood of its host thumb mistle thrush is predated upon by a wide variety of birds of prey including boreal owl korpimaki 2012 p 97 short eared owl tawny owl ural owl eurasian eagle owl golden eagle watson 2010 p 94 kestrel common buzzard red kite northern goshawk 2010 p 204 peregrine falcon ratcliffe 2010 p 415 and sparrowhawk newton 2010 p 108 eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids parent birds exhibit fearlessness in defence of their nests occasionally even attacking humans coward 1928 pp 193 196 mistle thrush is not normally a host of common cuckoo a brood parasite external parasites of mistle thrush include hen flea moorhen flea castor bean tick and brightly coloured harvest mite rothschild clay 1953 pp 84 85 rothschild clay 1953 p 227 internally they can suffer from parasites including tapeworm rothschild clay 1953 p 197 nematodes rothschild clay 1953 p 189 and a species of rothschild clay 1953 p 181 blood parasites can include trypanosoma and plasmodium species rothschild clay 1953 p 171 rothschild clay 1953 p 165 status mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in europe and western asia and its european breeding population is estimated at 9 22 2 million birds when asian breeders are added this gives a global total of 12 2 44 4 million species was formerly more restricted in range and rarely bred even in northern england in 1700s brown grice 2005 p 499 it expanded rapidly into lowland and coastal areas of europe during 18th century and first half of 19th century colonising areas where it was formerly rare or absent such as ireland where it first bred in 1807 scotland and netherlands range also increased in denmark norway hungary and austria although population now appears to be declining decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria given its high numbers and very large range this thrush is therefore classified by international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern perceived decline may be due to loss of invertebrate rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland adult survival clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture in finland loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline in culture thumb mistle thrush and alpine chough by giovanni da udine upright desiderius erasmus s early sixteenth century collection of latin proverbs included turdus malum sibi ipse thrush himself excretes his own trouble which refers to use of sticky mistletoe berries favoured by this species as an ingredient in birdlime used to trap birds thrush was seen to be thus spreading seeds of his own destruction erasmus 1982 p 25 mistle thrush and alpine chough by giovanni da udine an artist who worked in raphael s studio in 16th century was a sketch for his bird with garland and fruit and this in turn was basis for a raphael fresco in

society et al 1842 p 6 andrew 1985 p 77 song of mistle thrush is also described in thomas hardy s darkling thrush and edward thomas s thrush armitage dee 2011 pp 202 203 loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names including screech and swainson 1886 pp 1 2 lockwood 1984 p 104 other names including stormcock referred to its willingness to sing in wind and rain holm thrush cock and holm cock are based on obsolete names for holly tree which may be defended by thrush in winter for its berries cocker mabey 2005 pp 360 361 in frances hodgson burnett s secret
