renamed in 1897 as rhondda urban district after river rhondda residents of either valley rarely use terms rhondda fach or rhondda fawr referring instead to rhondda or their specific village when relevant locals tend to refer to rhondda with definite article despite its non usage on sign posts and maps early history prehistoric and roman rhondda 8 000 bc 410 ad rhondda valley is located in upland or blaenau area of glamorgan landscape of rhondda was formed by glacial action during last ice age as slow moving glaciers gouged out deep valleys that exist today with retreat of ice sheet around 8000 bc valleys were further modified by stream and river action this left two river valleys of rhondda with narrow steep sided slopes which would dictate layout of settlements from early to modern times davis 1989 p 5 mesolithic period earliest evidence of presence of man in these upper areas of glamorgan was discovered in 1963 at craig y llyn a small chipped stone tool found at site recorded as possibly being of creswellian type or at least from early mesolithic period places human activity on plateau above valleys davis 1989 p 7 many other mesolithic items have been discovered in rhondda predominantly in upper areas around blaenrhondda blaencwm and maerdy mainly stone age items relating to hunting fishing and foraging which suggests seasonal nomadic activity though no definite mesolithic settlements have been located in area concentration of finds at craig y llyn escarpment suggests presence of a temporary campsite in vicinity neolithic period first structural

camp a hillfort whose remains are situated between ton pentre and cwmparc davis 1989 p 14 although its defences would have been slight camp made good use of natural slopes and rock outcrops to its north east face maendy camp consisted of two earthworks an inner and outer enclosure when site was excavated in 1901 several archaeological finds led to camp being misidentified as bronze age these finds mainly pottery and flint knives were excavated from a burial cairn discovered within outer enclosure but site has since been classified as from iron age settlement at hen dre r mynydd in blaenrhondda was dated around roman period when discovery of fragments of wheel made romano british pottery were discovered at location site is made up of a group of ruinous drystone roundhouses and

visited seasonally by pastoralists davis 1989 p 18 a few earthwork dykes are only structural relics in rhondda area from this period and no carved stones or crosses exist to indicate presence of a christian shrine during early middle ages communities were split between bondmen and freemen bondmen lived in small villages centred on a court or llys of local ruler to whom they paid dues while freemen who enjoyed a higher status lived in scattered homesteads most important village was mayor s settlement or maerdref maerdy in rhondda fach has been identified as a maerdref mainly on strength of name though village did not survive past middle ages largest concentration of dwellings from this time have been discovered around gelli and ystrad in rhondda fawr mainly platform houses during late 11th century norman lord robert fitzhamon entered morgannwg in an attempt to gain control of area building many earth and timber castles in lowlands davis 1989 p 19 in early 12th century norman expansion continued with castles being founded around neath and coity while within same period bishop urban established diocese of llandaff under which glynrhondda belonged to large parish of llantrisant royal commission on ancient and historical monuments in wales hmso glamorgan inventories vol 3 part 2 upon death of william lord of glamorgan his extensive holdings were eventually granted to gilbert de clare in 1217 subjugation of glamorgan begun by fitzhamon was finally completed by powerful de clare family davies 2008 p 746 but although gilbert de clare had now become one of great marcher lords territory was far from settled hywel ap maredudd lord of captured his cousin morgan ap cadwallon and annexed glynrhondda in an attempt to reunify commotes under a single native ruler this conflict was unresolved by time of de clare s death and area fell under royal control settlements of medieval rhondda little evidence exists of settlements within rhondda during norman period unlike communal dwellings of iron age remains of medieval buildings discovered in area follow pattern similar to modern farmsteads with separate holdings spaced out around hillsides evidence of medieval welsh farmers comes from remains of their buildings with foundations of platform houses having been discovered spaced out throughout both valleys davis 1989 p 22 when site of several platform houses at common were excavated in 1930s potsherds dating from 13th 14th century were discovered rhondda also has remains of two medieval castles older is castell cynon taf library service digital

but a high stony in top of an hille castle comprises a scarp and ditch forming a raised platform and on north face is a ruined drystone building due to its location and form it does not appear to be of norman design and is therefore thought to have been built by welsh as a border defence and must therefore date before 1247 when richard de clare seized glynrhondda davis 1989 p 25 second castle is ynysygrug located close to what is now tonypandy town centre little remains of this motte and bailey earthwork defence as much was destroyed when tonypandy railway station was built in 19th century davis 1989 p 26 ynysygrug is dated around 12th century or early 13th century and has been misidentified by several historians notably owen morgan in his book history of pontypridd and rhondda valleys who recorded it as a sacred 1989 p 26 morgen not only misidentifies height of 30 ft mound as but states that all these sacred mounds were reared in this country when druidism was established religion but gives no historic proof book also has an illustration of castle which artist has added a moat and several druids neither of which are factual and iolo who erroneously believed it to be burial

divided into three hamlets upper or rhigos hamlet to north middle or penrhys hamlet and lower or clydach hamlet davis 1989 p 29 throughout post medieval period rhondda was a heavily wooded area and its main economic staple was rearing of sheep horses and cattle historian rice merrick in describing upland area of vale of glamorgan stated that there was always great breeding of cattle horses and sheep but in elder time grew but small store of corn for in most places there ground was not thereunto apt while english cartographer john speed described that rearing of cattle was best means unto

no fair held in rhondda animals would be taken to neighbouring fairs and markets at neath merthyr llantrisant and llandaff however to be self supporting farmers of area grew crops such as oats corn and barley in small quantities crops were grown in lower part of rhondda on narrow meadows adjoining though during napoleonic wars scarce supplies forced cultivation of upland areas such as carn y and penrhys lewis 1959 pp 18 20 merrick would describe diet of upland inhabitants as consisting of bread made of wheat and ale and bear and over two hundred years later benjamin malkin showed how little diet had changed when he wrote that people still ate oatmeal bread with a relish of miserable cheese and beer where they have any is worse than none malkin benjamin 1807 scenery antiquities biography of south wales longman hurst rees and orme in first half of 17th century a rising cost of consumable goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in glamorgan those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farm lands enclosure of freehold lands that began in later middle ages now gained momentum and farms that were once owned by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners glamorgan county history volume iv early modern glamorgan from act of union to industrial revolution glanmor williams p 26 university of wales press 1974 by 19th century most of rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords such as marquis of bute earl of dunraven

acts of union in mid 16th century and english civil war in mid 17th century a period of great rebuilding took place in kingdom of england of which wales was now annexed and this is reflected in structures that were built within rhondda valley davis 1989 p 38 fluctuating economic state of late tudor period resulted in farmers taking in more land creating higher levels of surplus goods and therefore producing higher profits this profit was reflected in new farm houses built in rhondda and for first time an emphasis on domestic comfort became apparent in design of dwellings many of new farm buildings were simple structures consisting of two or three small rooms though of a much sturdier and permanent quality than medieval platform houses a popular style of building was long house a building which combined house and cowshed into a single building by 1840 at least 160 farms existed in rhondda davis 1989 p 40 but most were destroyed with growth of mining industry of few surviving buildings those of note include tynewydd new house in blaenrhondda a 17th century house thought to have given its name to neighbouring village of tynewydd and in ystrad dated around 1600 there were few industrial buildings pre 1850 those of note include 17th century blast furnace at 1989 p 34 which gave village its name and fulling mill established by harri david in 1738 which in turn gave its name to tonypandy davis 1989 p 35 corn mills existed sparsely throughout valleys as did early coal pits with two early pits recorded as being opened in 1612 at rhigos and cwmparc though these would

of glamorgan and entirety of rhondda was situated within it although neighbouring areas such as merthyr and aberdare had already sunk coal mines it was not until walter coffin initiated dinas lower colliery in 1812 that coal was first exported from rhondda valleys on any sort of commercial scale this coal was originally taken by packhorse before extension of dr griffiths private tramline to pontypridd and then by glamorganshire canal to port at cardiff lack of any transportation links was one of main problems that curtailed exploitation of rhondda valley coal fields along with belief that coalfields beneath valley were thought to be too deep for economic working john 1980 p 182 it was therefore seen as an expensive risk and deterred anyone looking for a quick profit exploration of rhondda was undertaken by bute trustees agents of third marquess of bute who not only owned large tracts of valley farmland but also possessed a large financial interest in cardiff docks which would export coal trustees sank bute merthyr colliery in october 1851 at top of rhondda fawr in what would become treherbert bute merthyr began producing coal in 1855 first working steam coal colliery in rhondda in conjunction with sinking of first colliery at head of rhondda second issue of transportation was being tackled at same time with extension of taff vale railway tvr line after royal assent was given to construct railway in 1836 original line was laid from cardiff to and by 1841 a branch was opened to link cardiff with dinas via pontypridd this would allow easier and faster transportation for walter coffin s dinas mine an unsurprising addition considering coffin was a director of tvr in 1849 tvr had extended into rhondda fach and by 1856 railway had reached furthest areas of both fach and fawr valleys at maerdy and treherbert for first time rhondda valley was connected by a major transportation route to rest of 1980 p 182 and exploitation of its coalfields could begin tvr line would dominate transportation of coal throughout rhondda s industrial history and its monopoly was a point of contention as with no rivals colliery owners could not negotiate for haulage rates john 1980 p 454 several attempts were made to break monopoly including opening of rhondda and swansea bay railway between 1885 and 1895 awdry 1990 p 41 which linked blaenrhondda at head of rhondda fawr to prince of wales dock to achieve this rail link rhondda 1980 p 455 was constructed through mynydd to at time longest railway tunnel in wales initially shallower pits at aberdare proved a bigger attraction for prospective mine owners but once aberdare became fully worked by 1860s rhondda saw a rapid growth in development during 1860s 1870s 20 collieries opened in rhondda valleys with leading in rhondda fach being david davis of aberdare and david davies in rhondda fawr in 1865 output of coal from rhondda valley was roughly one quarter of that of aberdare ten years later rhondda was producing over two million tons more than aberdare valleys these figures would later be dwarfed by massive excavation rates seen in last quarter of 19th century up to beginning of first world war in 1913 it was recorded that rhondda valley s output was 9 6 million tons john 1980 p 183 by 1893 there were more than 75 collieries within rhondda valleys and although most were initially owned by a small group of private 1980 p 192 this trend changed towards start of 20th century as companies began buying up existing collieries widespread adoption of limited liability status began a trend towards a concentration of ownership john 1980 p 193 reducing some of economic risks involved in coalmining unstable coal prices inflated acquisitions geological difficulties and large scale accidents john 1980 pp 192 193 emerging companies were formed by individuals and families who sank original collieries but by start of 20th century they were no more than principal shareholders

mining communities of rhondda robert thomas 1926 1999 at start of first world war economic prospects in south wales were good although production fell after 1913 high demand was still strong enough to push coalfields to their limit john 1980 p 519 in february 1917 coal mining came under government control and demand increased as war intensified ensuring a market for sufficient supplies of coal after war picture began to change initially british coal industry was buoyed by a series of fortuitous economic events such as american coal miners strike and by 1924 unemployment for miners was below national average but belief that mining industry would experience a permanent demand for coal was shattered by depression and rhondda experienced a massive upturn in unemployment davies 2008 p 748

twentieth century world family on dole 1919 1939 mid glamorgan county council education department 1994 pp 3 4 while in maerdy local miners set up a rationing system by time miners returned to work there was little desire for further action through strikes which saw a decline in popularity of fed and greater emphasis on solving problems through political and parliamentary means morgan 1988 p 102 with advent of great depression employment within rhondda valleys continued to fall this in turn led to a decline in public and social services as people struggled to pay rates and rents john 1980 p 541 one of outcomes of a lack of funds was a fall in health provisions which in rhondda lead to a lack of medical and nursing staff john 1980 p 542 a failure to provide adequate sewage works and a rise in deaths from tuberculosis john 1980 p 543 by 1932 long term unemployment figure in rhondda was recorded at 63 john 1980 p 539 and in ferndale unemployment figure for adult males rose as high as

treorchy in rhondda fawr coal mining industry of rhondda was artificially buoyed throughout war years though there were expectations of a return to pre 1939 industrial collapse after end of second world war there was a sense of salvation when government announced nationalisation of british coal mines in 1947 but following decades saw a continual reduction in output from rhondda mines from 15 000 miners in 1947 rhondda had just a single pit within valleys producing coal in 1984 located at maerdy decline in mining of coal after world war ii was a country wide issue but south wales and rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of britain oil had superseded coal as fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing supply of oil john 1980 p 590 of few industries that were still reliant on coal demand was for quality coals especially coking coal which was required by steel industry fifty percent of glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks john 1980 p 595 with second biggest market being domestic heating which smokeless coal of rhondda became once again fashionable after publication of clean air act john 1980 p 596 these two markets now controlled fate of mines in rhondda and as demand fell from both sectors knock on effect on mining industry was further contraction in addition exports to other areas of europe traditionally france italy and low countries experienced a massive decline from 33 per cent around start of 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980 other major factors in decline of coal were related to massive under investment in rhondda mines over past decades most of mines in valleys were sunk between 1850s and 1880s which as a consequence meant they were far smaller than most modern mines john 1980 p 588 rhondda mines were in comparison antiquated with methods of ventilation coal preparation and power supply all of a poor standard in 1945 british coal industry cut 72 per cent of their output mechanically whereas in south wales figure was just 22 per cent only way to ensure financial survival of mines in valleys was massive investment from ncb but plan for coal paper drawn up in 1950 was overly optimistic in future demand for coal john 1980 p 589 which was drastically reduced following an industrial recession in 1956 and an increased availability of oil john 1980 p 590 british government and welsh employment bodies funded and subsidized external businesses to locate new ventures within valleys to replace vanishing heavy industries first attempt to bring in business not connected to coal mining industry began in 1920s when david jones town clerk to rhondda urban council gained government support in attracting outside businesses to area companies included alfred
