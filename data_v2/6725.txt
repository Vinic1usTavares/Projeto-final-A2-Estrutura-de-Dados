day of opening ceremony he became fourth athlete to die during preparations for a winter olympics and seventh athlete to die in either a summer or winter olympic games kumaritashvili who first began to participate in luge when he was 13 came from a family of seasoned lugers his grandfather had introduced sport to soviet republic of georgia and both his father and uncle had competed when they were younger with his uncle later serving as head of georgian luge federation kumaritashvili himself began competing in 2008 09 luge world cup he had also been a student at georgian technical university where he earned an economics degree in 2009 life and career kumaritashvili was born on 25 november 1988 in borjomi georgian ssr present day georgia to david and dodo kumaritashvili he had one sister mariam who was four years younger kumaritashvili s family had a long association with luge his grandfather aleko kumaritashvili introduced luge to georgia after first training for it in east germany aleko helped build a primitive luge run in bakuriani in 1970 a more finished track funded by soviet authorities was built in 1973 kumaritashvili s uncle and coach felix kumaritashvili served as head of georgian luge federation and his father david won a ussr youth championship when georgia was part of soviet union and was a three time champion at spartakiad once in two man bobsled and twice in luge kumaritashvili grew up in nearby bakuriani which is known for its many ski slopes he enjoyed several winter sports and started luge when he was 13 years old while attending georgian technical university where he graduated with a bachelor s degree in economics in 2009 kumaritashvili maintained a rigorous training and competition schedule though his family endured economic hardship kumaritashvili attended as many luge events as he could often driving for days to reach world cup events as a devout member of georgian orthodox church he prayed at church before every competition during his first season of competition kumaritashvili finished 55th out of 62 competitors at 2008 09 luge world cup where he was entered in four races he finished 28th out of 32 competitors at 2009 10 luge world cup event at cesana pariol in january which was his fifth and last world cup event at time of his death he was ranked 44th out of 65 competitors in 2009 10 world cup season and was regarded as one of best lugers to come from georgia by 31 december 2009 cut off date for luge qualifications for olympics kumaritashvili was ranked 38th overall he qualified for luge men s singles event at 2010 winter olympics his olympic debut by racing in five world cup races over two years olympic luge track venue for olympic luge competition whistler sliding centre was designed by udo gurgel and his firm gurgel ibg of leipzig with final version produced on 23 october 2004 using specified track dimensions for a variety of sled entrance and exit trajectories ibg calculated speeds and g forces along each curve of track new curve configurations rather than speed were expected to provide main challenge maximum calculated speed for men s luge was in february 2005 concerns arose regarding difficulties posed by cesana pariol track built for 2006 winter olympics in turin italy several serious crashes occurred prompting calls for physical modifications to that track international luge federation fil was concerned that similar modifications might be required at whistler track and communicated these concerns to vancouver organizing committee vanoc in march 2005 uncertainty about track design persisted into 2006 until scheduled start of track construction when it was determined that construction would be based on original design after construction during track homologation certification process track produced speeds exceeding design calculations by at least following olympic test event in february 2009 josef fendt president of fil sent a letter to ibg expressing surprise that a record speed of had been reached concluding that designer s calculations were incorrect and stating that high speed makes me worry letter also said that overstepping this limit would be an absolute unreasonable demand for athletes he asked ibg to respond in particular with regard to future sochi olympic track fendt also informed vanoc that whistler track was not supplied as ordered vanoc however concluded that no action was required regarding whistler track since focus of fendt s letter to ibg was new sochi track in april 2009 ibg explained that differences between calculated and actual observed speeds were caused by new sled technology that reduced drag coefficients and ice friction coefficients because of secrecy inherent in sled development ibg engineers had difficulty obtaining latest sled specifications required for their engineering calculations in view of games organizers high speeds and technical challenges could be safely mitigated by imposing additional practice and graduated training requirements on athletes accident and death thumb left upright spectators at whistler sliding centre look down track as sliders pass point where kumaritashvili crashed on 12 february 2010 after 25 previous attempts 15 of them from men s start kumaritashvili was fatally injured in a crash during his final training run after losing control in last turn of course he was thrown off his luge and over sidewall of track striking an unprotected steel support pole at end of run he was travelling at moment of impact medics were at kumaritashvili s side immediately after crash both cardio pulmonary and mouth to mouth resuscitation were performed he was airlifted to a whistler hospital where he died of his injuries it was luge s first fatality since 10 december 1975 when an italian luger had been killed kumaritashvili became fourth athlete to die during preparations for a winter olympics after british luger kazimierz kay and australian skier ross milne both 1964 innsbruck and swiss speed skier nicolas 1992 albertville he was also 16th participating athlete to die during or in practice for a summer or winter olympic games mourning after footage of kumaritashvili s death was televised there was shock and mourning in georgia in response to accident georgian team announced that it would consider skipping opening ceremonies or withdrawing from games entirely but nika georgian minister for sports and culture later announced team would stay in vancouver and dedicate their efforts to their fallen comrade during opening ceremony seven remaining members of georgian olympic team wore black armbands bore georgian flag with a black ribbon tied to it and left a space vacant in procession as marks of respect upon entering bc place stadium georgian team was greeted with a standing ovation from assembled crowd team left stadium immediately after procession thumb right georgian athletes during opening ceremony later during opening ceremonies a moment of silence was held to honour kumaritashvili s memory and both canadian and olympic flags were lowered to half staff fellow teammate and luger levan gureshidze who was to compete with kumaritashvili withdrew after crash telling teammates that he couldn t go on and went home to attend funeral lugers who stayed to compete all wore a black stripe on their helmets in honour of kumaritashvili early in morning of 17 february 2010 kumaritashvili s body arrived in tbilisi it reached his hometown of bakuriani later that day thousands of georgians attended a funeral feast for him on 19 february and he was buried on saturday 20 february at church he had attended georgian president mikheil saakashvili attended funeral service dressed in a georgian olympic uniform in bakuriani street of kumaritashvili s childhood home was renamed in his honour felix loch of germany who won gold medal in luge at vancouver olympics had his medal melted down and refashioned into two disks giving one etched with an image of kumaritashvili and years of his birth and death to kumaritashvili s parents in spite of several donations of money to kumaritashvili family tragedy was hard on them twice in years afterwards dodo who continued to fix a meal for kumaritashvili every day tried to kill herself while david dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple hospital stays emergency safety measures right thumb wall that was installed just past final turn of whistler sliding centre after death of kumaritashvili fil stated that kumaritashvili s death was not caused by an unsafe track but as a preventive measure walls at exit of were raised and ice profile was adjusted padding was also added to exposed metal beams near finish line olympic officials claimed changes were not for safety reasons but to accommodate emotional state of lugers in addition start of men s luge was moved to women s starting point to reduce speed while start of women s luge was also moved farther down track training runs on track resumed on 13 february after changes to track were finished three lugers including departed gureshidze did not participate in any training runs on that day international luge federation report on 19 april 2010 fil published its final report to international olympic committee on kumaritashvili s death report found that sled used by kumaritashvili had met all fil standards it attributed accident to driving errors starting in curve 15 16 which as an accumulation ended in impact that resulted in him leaving track and subsequently hitting a post this is a tragic result that should not have occurred as a result of an initial driving error as sled hit wall at curve 16 exit it catapulted off track causing kumaritashvili to lose control of it entirely this was a type of accident not seen before and therefore w ith unknown and unpredictable dynamics of this crash calculation and construction of walls in that section of track did not serve to prevent tragedy that happened however report also determined that during homologation process and later sessions at whistler sliding centre track was faster than originally calculated instead of expected highest speed recorded was fil felt that luge athletes were able to cope with this speed but this was not a direction fil would like to see sport head in fil president fendt wrote to sochi 2014 olympic organizing committee that fil would proposed sochi track only if speeds did not exceed fil also said it was determined to do what it could to prevent such accidents from occurring again it would re examine changes to sport sled design and track technology fil secretary general svein summarized what happened to nodar has been an unforeseeable fatal accident coroner s report thumb right kumaritashvili memorial whistler 2010 british columbia coroner s office investigated incident it was reported to be considering among other pieces of evidence written complaints about safety of whistler track by venezuelan luger werner crashed on track on 13 november 2009 suffering a severe information suggesting that track was constructed in such a narrow and steep location near whistler and mountains for commercial reasons track designer udo gurgel said track had to be near whistler for use after olympics you don t want to ruin an investment so track is on terrain that s a little steep according to john furlong chief executive of 2010 winter olympics organizing committee proposals to build sliding centre on grouse mountain near vancouver were rejected early in bid phase due to reservations expressed by international luge and bobsled and skeleton federations in a report dated 16 september 2010 coroner ruled kumaritashvili s death an accident brought on by an interaction of factors including high speed of track its technical difficulty and athlete s relative unfamiliarity with track he wrote that during kumaritashvili s training runs it was reasonable to assume that mr kumaritashvili was sliding faster than ever before in his life and was attempting to go even faster while simultaneously struggling to learn intricacies of track and dynamics it created coroner accepted that would always carry an element of risk and that best practices known at time had been followed in construction of whistler track he also called upon fil to require athletes to engage in more mandatory training sessions prior to olympic games and other major competitions thumb left 2010 georgian postal stamp commemorating kumaritashvili coroner also commented organizers regulatory bodies and venue owners must ensure that no effort is spared to anticipate unforeseeable as far as safety is concerned and to err on side of caution insisting on more rather than less responding to report kumaritashvili s father said i don t accept statement about nodar s lack of experience he wouldn t have won right to take part in olympics if he lacked experience mont hubbard report in 2013 mont hubbard a university of california davis mechanical and aerospace professor issued a report claiming that kumaritashvili s crash was probably caused by a fillet a joint between lower edge of curve and a vertical wall hubbard suggested that right runner of kumaritashvili s sled rose up fillet launching him into air terry president of isc ibg group a consortium involved in construction of whistler track dismissed hubbard s theory as flawed stating that data to replicate ice surface at site of accident in three dimensions do not exist luge track built for use at 2014 winter olympics in sochi russia was designed with two uphill sections to reduce speeds and for runs about slower than whistler track see also lists of sportspeople who died during their careers sergei notes external
