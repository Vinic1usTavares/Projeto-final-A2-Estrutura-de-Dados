special it s heavy and mike has ability to cut through sentiment he went on to say mike s talent is deep i will always write for mike o malley actor did not have to audition and was invited to read for part by murphy personally two men along with falchuk had previously worked together on television movie pretty handsome while reading first twenty pages of script o malley was not initially enthusiastic about playing role as character appeared to be an intolerant stereotype he changed his mind however after realizing that burt was to be portrayed as a more accepting man with grace and love that comes first for his son after appearing in five glee episodes over course of first season o malley was upgraded to a series regular along with heather morris and naya rivera in show s second season murphy confirmed this fact on july 13 2010 in wake of o malley s nomination for an emmy award for his work in role of burt he appeared in eight season two episodes and is guaranteed at least six episodes during third season in early 2011 o malley was cast in lead role in a comedy pilot entitled family album which prompted media speculation that his role as burt might need to be reduced in actuality actor ensured that he would be able to meet his six episode commitment to glee should pilot be picked up for a full series run and commented burt is one of best parts i ve ever had in my life i don t want to leave it behind until it s run its course or story has run its course on august 11 2011 fox announced that family album would not be made into a series although there was no

development in series with observation relationships burt is father of glee club member kurt hummel colfer has credited his off screen relationship with o malley with improving quality of their scenes together and o malley has said same about working with colfer burt loves kurt and openly accepts his son after kurt tells him that he is gay in show s fourth episode preggers murphy took scene verbatim from his own experience of coming out to his father he called father son relationship one of stories that we really love on show and one that is very personal to him as he wishes his own father had acted more like burt during first season kurt has cause to wonder whether his father truly accepts him colfer offered insight that his character is more concerned with being ok in his dad s eyes than with anyone else and said that bond between them would continue to strengthen as series progressed from o malley s point of view there s a lot at stake in their relationship and we re trying to show other people how it can be in a positive way i m not saying hey let s go to greenwich village and be in parade this is very very difficult but he loves his son burt is shown to have deeply loved his first wife kurt s mother a strong woman who died eight years prior to premiere of show he later characterizes his life after losing her as being asleep kurt introduces him to carole hudson finn s widowed mother and they begin dating he falls in love with her and she with him he tells finn that she is an angel who came down to wake me up after all these years at carole s behest burt becomes something of a father figure to finn taking him to ball games though this development does not sit well with kurt who works to win his father s attention back from finn by emulating his father s dress and interests before burt realizes how hurt kurt is relationship between burt and carole progresses to point that they decide to live together and she and finn move in with hummels since their house is larger of two however after finn uses a homophobic slur against kurt burt tells finn that his behavior is unacceptable and he cannot live in house any more imperiling his romance with carole following his appearance in this episode o malley spoke of future reconciliation between burt and finn he stated one of things i think is really important in life and for human beings is to forgive and be able to rise up from our mistakes i m hoping that finn and burt are able to cross that chasm couple apparently continues to date however carole visits burt s bedside when he is comatose in hospital after his heart attack and in furt he proposes to carole she accepts and they wed families combine under same roof soon thereafter reception critical response character of burt has been

called scene utterly heartbreaking and lovely he added it was an amazing moment for glee capped off by simple gesture of burt grabbing his son s shoulder in an act of support mike o malley is completely emmy worthy we ve never seen a character like this before on television or seen such a relationship between a father and son poniewozik wrote mike o malley as always made me believe that burt was not speaking out of some false enlightenment but out of a desire to protect his family and a struggle to do right thing buddytv s henrik batallones said o malley was star of show while second season episode grilled cheesus received mixed reviews from television critics o malley was praised for his contribution robert canning of ign commented that hummels relationship is most affecting of

and commented if you made it through vows without shedding a tear you have no soul emily vanderwerff of a v club praised genuinely sweet chemistry between o malley and rosemont and found processional dance nicely moving though unoriginal she too commented on focus on kurt and finn in their vows but conceded if you d been a single parent that long you d probably talk about your kids a lot too he expanded in episode sexy reviewers acclaimed scene where burt gives kurt talk about sex poniewozik wrote o malley who really seems to exist in a different emotional dimension from most of glee adults
