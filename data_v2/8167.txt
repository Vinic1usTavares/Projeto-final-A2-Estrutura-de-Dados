battalion became known as oxley regiment in recognition of its connection to oxley region it was also granted motto hostes and following year battalion became allied with east yorkshire regiment initially strength of citizens forces units was maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service in 1929 1930 however newly elected scullin labor government terminated compulsory service and replaced citizens forces with an all volunteer militia funding was cut heavily and training opportunities were also reduced this combined with economic pressure caused by great depression which made it difficult for part time soldiers to maintain their livelihoods while continuing their training commitments meant that number of volunteers fell sharply consequently a number of infantry battalions were disbanded or amalgamated as a result of this decision 15th battalion was merged with 9th to form 9th 15th battalion a memorial plaque to battalion was unveiled in anzac square in brisbane in 1932 in 1934 9th 15th was split and 15th merged with 26th battalion to form 15th 26th battalion this formation was split in july 1939 as part of a hasty expansion of australia s military

war garrison duty in australia and service in new guinea after outbreak of second world war in september 1939 due to provisions of defence act which precluded militia from being sent outside

conscripts consisting of several hundred individuals who were attached to battalion to receive three months of compulsory full time training as war loomed in pacific many of conscripts received at this time were university students and most had no previous military experience although some had served as volunteers in militia prior to their call up initially these personnel were formed into separate training companies receiving three months of continuous training at chermside with university students completing a shorter period of just 60 70 days to fit in with their semester break later in february 1942 once they had completed their period of mandatory training conscripts were either released from service or moved into battalion s four rifle companies where they served alongside volunteers on full time service following japanese victories in malaya singapore and elsewhere in pacific in late 1941 and early 1942 whole 15th battalion was mobilised for wartime service and tasked

weeks later while there battalion s commanding officer lieutenant colonel jack amies appealed to battalion to volunteer for service as part of aif while some already had majority of men were still classified as militia personnel which meant that battalion was restricted in where it could serve and was liable to be broken up to be classified as an aif battalion under provisions of newly passed defence citizen military forces act 1943 65 per cent or more of personnel had to volunteer for service outside australian territory response was considerable and by august battalion was gazetted as an
