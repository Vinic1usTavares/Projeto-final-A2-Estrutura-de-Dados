other families fight for independence from it it opens with additional threats in icy north and essos in east showrunner david benioff jokingly suggested sopranos in middle earth as game of thrones tagline referring to its intrigue filled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons in a 2012 study out of 40 recent television drama shows game of thrones ranked second in deaths per episode averaging 14 deaths themes series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism george r r martin set out to make story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles political intrigue and characters believing that magic should be used moderately in epic fantasy genre martin has stated that true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and dark lords but from ourselves a common theme in fantasy genre is battle between good and evil which martin says does not mirror real world just like people s capacity for good and for evil in real life martin explores questions of redemption and character change series allows audience to view different characters from their perspective unlike in many other fantasies and thus supposed villains can provide their side of story benioff said george brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy he introduced gray tones into a black and white universe in early seasons under influence of a song of ice and fire books main characters were regularly killed off and this was credited with developing tension among viewers in later seasons critics pointed out that certain characters had developed plot armor to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to game of thrones deviating from novels to become more of a traditional television series series also reflects substantial death rates in war inspirations and derivations although first season closely follows events of first novel later seasons have made significant changes according to david benioff series is about adapting series as a whole and following map george laid out for us and hitting major milestones but not necessarily each of stops along way novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings characters and plot on events in european history most of westeros is reminiscent of high medieval europe from lands and cultures to palace intrigue feudal system castles and knightly tournaments a principal inspiration for novels is english wars of roses 1455 1485 between houses of lancaster and york reflected in martin s houses of lannister and stark scheming cersei lannister evokes isabella she wolf of france 1295 1358 she and her family as portrayed in maurice druon s historical novel series accursed kings were a main inspiration of martin s other historical antecedents of series elements include hadrian s wall which becomes martin s wall roman empire and legend of atlantis ancient byzantine greek fire wildfire icelandic sagas of viking age ironborn mongol hordes dothraki hundred years war and italian renaissance series popularity has been attributed in part to martin s skill at fusing these elements into a seamless credible version of alternate history martin acknowledges i take history and i file off serial numbers and i turn it up to 11 cast and characters game of thrones has an ensemble cast

directed several in january 2006 david benioff had a phone conversation with george r r martin s literary agent about books he represented and became interested in a song of ice and fire as he had been a fan of fantasy fiction when young but had not read books before literary agent then sent benioff series first four books benioff read a few hundred pages of first novel a game of thrones shared his enthusiasm with d b weiss and suggested that they adapt martin s novels into a television series weiss finished first novel in maybe 36 hours at about 2 50 they pitched series to hbo after a five hour meeting with martin himself a veteran screenwriter in a restaurant on santa monica boulevard according to benioff they won martin over with their answer to his question who is jon snow s mother before being approached by benioff and weiss martin had had other meetings with other scriptwriters most of whom wanted to adapt series as a feature film martin however deemed it unfilmable and impossible to be done as a feature film stating that size of one of his novels is as long as lord of rings which had been adapted as three feature films similarly benioff also said that it would be impossible to turn novels into a feature film as scale of novels is too big for a feature film and dozens of characters would have to be discarded benioff added a fantasy movie of this scope financed by a major studio would almost certainly need a pg 13 rating that means no sex no blood no profanity fuck that martin himself was pleased with suggestion that they adapt it as an hbo series saying that he never imagined it anywhere else i knew it couldn t be done as a network television series it s too adult level of sex and violence would never have gone through series began development in january 2007 hbo acquired television rights to novels with benioff and weiss as its executive producers and martin as a co executive producer intention was for each novel to yield a season s worth of episodes initially martin would write one episode per season while benioff and weiss would write rest of episodes jane espenson and bryan cogman were later added to write one episode apiece first season first and second drafts of pilot script by benioff and weiss were submitted in august 2007 and june 2008 respectively although hbo liked both drafts a pilot was not ordered until november 2008 2007 2008 writers guild of america strike may have delayed process pilot episode winter is coming was first shot in 2009 after a poor reception in a private viewing hbo demanded an extensive re shoot about 90 percent of episode with cast and directorial changes pilot reportedly cost hbo us 5 10million to produce while first season s budget was estimated at 50 60million in second season series received a 15 percent budget increase for climactic battle in blackwater which had an 8million budget between 2012 and 2015 average budget per episode increased from 6million to at least 8million sixth season budget was over 10million per episode for a season total of over 100million and a series record casting nina gold and robert sterne are series primary casting directors through a process of auditions and readings main cast was assembled only exceptions were peter dinklage and sean bean whom writers wanted from start they were announced as joining pilot in 2009 other actors signed for pilot were kit harington as jon snow jack gleeson as joffrey baratheon harry lloyd as viserys targaryen and mark addy as robert baratheon addy was according to showrunners benioff and weiss easiest actor to cast for series due to his audition performance some of characters in pilot were recast for first season catelyn stark was initially played by jennifer ehle but role was recast with michelle fairley daenerys targaryen was also recast with emilia clarke replacing tamzin merchant rest of first season s cast was filled in second half of 2009 although many of cast returned after first season producers had many new characters to cast for each of following seasons due to large number of new characters benioff and weiss postponed introduction of several key characters in second season and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters some recurring characters were recast over years for example gregor clegane was played by three different actors while dean charles chapman who played tommen baratheon also played a minor lannister character writing thumb upright alt george r r martin george r r martin author of a song of ice and fire is a

seasons worked closely with benioff and weiss dave hill joined writing staff for fifth season after working as an assistant to benioff and weiss although martin is not in writers room he reads script outlines and makes comments benioff and weiss sometimes assign characters to particular writers for example cogman was assigned to arya stark for fourth season writers spend several weeks writing a character outline including what material from novels to use and overarching themes after these individual outlines are complete they spend another two to three weeks discussing each main character s individual arc and arranging them episode by episode a detailed outline is created with each of writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode cogman who wrote two episodes for fifth season took a month and a half to complete both scripts they are then read by benioff and weiss who make notes and parts of script are rewritten all ten episodes are written before filming begins since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries benioff and weiss write each of their episodes together with one of them writing first half of script and other second half

golden globe awards was particularly noted in many ways game of thrones belongs to dinklage wrote mary mcnamara of los angeles times before tyrion became series central figure in season two several critics highlighted performances by actresses and children fourteen year old maisie williams noted in first season for her debut as arya stark was singled out for her season two work with veteran actor charles dance tywin lannister stephen dillane has received positive reviews for his performance as stannis baratheon especially in fifth season with one critic noting whether you like stannis or not you have to admit that stephen dillane delivered a monumental performance this season series has a rating of 89 percent on rotten tomatoes first season reviewers said series had high production values a fully realized world and compelling characters according to variety there may be no show more profitable to its network than game of thrones is to hbo fully produced by pay and already a global phenomenon after only one season fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely second season was also well received entertainment weekly praised its vivid vital and just plain fun storytelling and according to hollywood reporter series made a strong case for being one of tv s best series its seriousness made it only drama comparable to mad men or breaking bad new york times

metacritic based on nine reviews indicating generally favorable reviews seventh season scored 77 out of 100 based on twelve reviews and was praised for its action sequences and focused central characters but received criticism for its breakneck pace and plot developments that defied logic darren franich of entertainment weekly gave series a b rating stating that it was ultimately okay with both transcendent moments and miserable phases it was beloved enough to be criticized by everyone for something franich described seasons 3 and 4 as relentless seasons 6 s ending having a killer one two punch while seasons 7 and 8 were indifferent sex and violence despite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics some have criticized show for amount of female nudity violence and sexual violence it depicts and for manner in which it depicts these themes atlantic called series tendency to ramp up sex violence and especially sexual violence of source material defining weakness of adaptation george r r martin responded that he feels obliged to be truthful about history and human nature and that rape and sexual violence are common in war and that omitting them from narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels themes its historical realism hbo said that they fully support vision and artistry of dan and david s exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself amount of sex and nudity in series especially in scenes that are incidental to plot was focus of much of criticism aimed at series in its first and second seasons stephen dillane who portrays stannis baratheon likened series frequent explicit scenes to german porn from 1970s charlie jane anders wrote in io9 that while first season was replete with light hearted sexposition second season appeared to focus on distasteful exploitative and dehumanizing sex with little informational content according to washington posts anna holmes nude scenes appeared to be aimed mainly at titillating heterosexual men right down to brazilian waxes sported by women in series faux medieval setting which made these scenes alienating to other viewers huffington posts maureen ryan likewise noted that game of thrones mostly presented women naked rather than men and that excess of random boobage undercut any aspirations series might have to address oppression of women in a feudal society saturday night live parodied this aspect of adaptation in a sketch that portrayed series as retaining a 13 year old boy as a consultant whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible in third season which saw theon greyjoy tortured and eventually emasculated series was also criticized for its use of torture new york magazine called scene torture porn madeleine davies of jezebel agreed saying it s not uncommon that game of thrones gets accused of being torture porn senseless objectifying violence combined with senseless objectifying sexual imagery according to davies although series violence tended to serve a narrative purpose theon s torture in bear and maiden fair was excessive a scene in fourth season s episode breaker of chains in which jaime lannister rapes his sister and lover cersei triggered a broad public discussion about series depiction of sexual violence against women according to dave itzkoff of new york times scene caused outrage in part because of comments by director alex graves that scene became consensual by end itzkoff also wrote that critics fear that rape has become so pervasive in drama that it is almost background noise a routine and occurrence sonia saraiya of a v club wrote that series choice to portray this sexual act and a similar one between daenerys targaryen and khal drogo in first season both described as consensual in source novels as a rape appeared to be an act of exploitation for shock value in fifth season s episode unbowed unbroken sansa stark is raped by ramsay bolton most reviewers including those from vanity fair salon atlantic and daily beast found scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary for example joanna robinson writing for vanity fair said that scene undercuts all agency that s been growing in sansa since end of last season in contrast sara stewart of new york post wondered why viewers were not similarly upset about many background and minor characters who d undergone similar or worse treatment in response to scene pop culture website mary sue announced that it would cease coverage of series because of repeated use of rape as a plot device and us senator claire mccaskill said that she would no longer watch it as sixth and seventh seasons saw daenerys sansa and cersei assume ruling positions alyssa rosenberg of washington post noted that series could be seen as a long arc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain power namely that their past leaves them too broken to do anything but commit brutal acts in their own turn and that their personal liberation does not effect social change needed to protect others from suffering time reported before seventh season that even if benioff and weiss don t always admit it show has changed scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another for example have been pared back lighting issues lighting or lack of light in darker scenes has been a recurring point of criticism since season 6 of series in 2016 bustles caitlyn callegari listed 31 examples of scenes where lighting caused viewers problems ranging from not being able to tell a character s hair color to not being able to see what was going on some reviewers have noted this is part of a wider trend among shows that are made by people who have experience working primarily on films suggesting they haven t grasped nuances or lack thereof of television as a medium especially differences between watching a scene on a television screen versus watching it on big screen in a movie theater in a 2017 interview robert mclachlan a cinematographer working on show explained lack of lighting as an artistic choice we re trying to be as naturalistic as possible criticism reached a high point during long
