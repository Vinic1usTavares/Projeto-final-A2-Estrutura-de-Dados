thumb lieutenant general george s patton commander of seventh united states army in 1943 in early august 1943 lieutenant general george s patton slapped two united states army soldiers under his command during sicily campaign of world war ii patton s hard driving personality and lack of belief in medical condition combat stress reaction then known as battle fatigue or shell shock led to soldiers becoming subject of his ire in incidents on 3 and 10 august when patton struck and berated them after discovering they were patients at evacuation hospitals away from front lines without apparent physical injuries word of incidents spread eventually reaching patton s superior general dwight d eisenhower who ordered him to apologize to men patton s actions were initially suppressed in news until journalist drew pearson publicized them in united states while u s congress and general public expressed both support and disdain for patton s actions eisenhower and army chief of staff george marshall opted not to fire patton as a commander he was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year seizing opportunity predicament presented eisenhower used patton as a decoy in operation fortitude sending faulty intelligence to german agents that patton was leading invasion of europe while patton eventually returned to combat command in european theater in mid 1944 slapping incidents were seen by eisenhower marshall and other leaders to be examples of patton s brashness and impulsiveness patton s career was halted as former subordinates such as omar bradley became his superiors background allied invasion of sicily began on 10 july 1943 with lieutenant general george s patton leading 90 000 men of seventh united states army in a landing near gela scoglitti and licata to support bernard montgomery s british 8th army landings to north initially ordered to protect british forces flank patton took palermo after montgomery s forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of nazi germany and kingdom of italy patton then set his sights on messina he sought an amphibious assault but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in santo stefano until 8 august by which time germans and italians had already evacuated bulk of their troops to mainland italy throughout campaign patton s troops were heavily engaged by german and italian forces as they pushed across island patton had already developed a reputation in u s army as an effective successful and hard driving commander punishing subordinates for slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well as a way to promote an image that inspired his troops patton created a larger than life personality he became known for his flashy dress highly polished helmet and boots and no nonsense demeanor general dwight d eisenhower commander of sicily operation and patton s friend and commanding officer had long known of patton s colorful leadership style and also knew that patton was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self restraint battle fatigue prior to world war i u s army considered symptoms of battle fatigue to be cowardice or attempts to avoid combat duty soldiers who reported these symptoms received harsh treatment at time of incidents two soldiers patton slapped were believed to be suffering from battle fatigue otherwise known as shell shock or battle stress today this condition is characterized as a form of post traumatic stress disorder which can result from prolonged severe exposure to death and destruction among many other traumatic events while causes symptoms and effects of condition were familiar to physicians by time of two incidents it was generally less understood in military circles an important lesson from tunisia campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had to be treated as soon as possible and not evacuated from combat zone this was not done in early stages of sicilian campaign and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to north africa with result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty as campaign wore on system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty some time before what would become known as slapping incident patton spoke with major general clarence r huebner newly appointed commander of u s 1st infantry division in which soldiers both served patton had asked huebner for a status report huebner replied front lines seem to be thinning out there seems to be a very large number of malingerers at hospitals feigning illness in order to avoid combat duty for his part patton did not believe condition was real in a directive issued to commanders on 5 august he forbade battle fatigue in seventh army incidents 3 august private charles h kuhl of l company u s 26th infantry regiment reported to an aid station of c company 1st medical battalion on 2 august 1943 kuhl who had been in u s army for eight months had been attached to 1st infantry division since 2 june 1943 he was diagnosed with exhaustion a diagnosis he had been given three times since start of campaign from aid station he was evacuated to a medical company and given sodium notes in his medical chart indicated anxiety state moderately severe soldier has been twice before in hospital within ten days he can t take it at front evidently he is repeatedly returned kuhl was transferred from aid station to 15th evacuation hospital near nicosia for further evaluation patton arrived at hospital same day accompanied by a number of medical officers as part of his tour of u s ii corps troops he spoke to some patients in hospital commending physically wounded he then approached kuhl who did not appear to be physically injured kuhl was sitting on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers when patton asked kuhl where he was hurt kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was nervous rather than wounded adding i guess i can t take it patton immediately flared up slapped kuhl across chin with his gloves then grabbed him by collar and dragged him to tent entrance he shoved him out of tent with a kick to his backside yelling don t admit this son of a bitch patton demanded that kuhl be sent back to front adding you hear me you gutless bastard you re going back to front picked up kuhl and brought him to a ward tent where it was discovered he had a temperature of and was later diagnosed with malarial parasites speaking later of incident kuhl noted at time it happened patton was pretty well worn out i think he was suffering a little battle fatigue himself kuhl wrote to his parents about incident but asked them to just forget about it that night patton recorded incident in his diary i met only errant coward i have ever seen in this army companies should deal with such men and if they shirk their duty they should be tried for cowardice and shot patton was accompanied in this visit by major general john p lucas who saw nothing remarkable about incident after war he wrote patton was heard by a war correspondent angrily denying reality of shell shock claiming that condition was an invention of jews 10 august private paul g bennett 21 of c battery u s 17th field artillery regiment was a four year veteran of u s army and had served in division since march 1943 records show he had no medical history until 6 august 1943 when a friend was wounded in combat according to a report he could not sleep and was nervous bennett was brought to 93rd evacuation hospital in addition to having a fever he exhibited symptoms of dehydration including fatigue confusion and listlessness his request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers on 10 august patton entered receiving tent of hospital speaking to injured there patton approached bennett who was huddled and shivering and asked what trouble was it s my nerves bennett responded i can t stand shelling anymore patton reportedly became enraged at him slapping him across face he began yelling your nerves hell you are just a goddamned coward shut up that goddamned crying i won t have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying patton then reportedly slapped bennett again knocking his helmet liner off and ordered receiving officer major charles b etter not to admit him patton then threatened bennett you re going back to front lines and you may get shot and killed but you re going to fight if you don t i ll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose in fact i ought to shoot you myself you goddamned whimpering coward upon saying this patton pulled out his pistol threateningly prompting hospital s commander colonel donald e currier to physically separate two patton left tent yelling to medical officers to send bennett back to front lines as he toured remainder of hospital patton continued discussing bennett s condition with currier patton stated i can t help it it makes my blood boil to think of a yellow bastard being and i won t have those cowardly bastards hanging around our hospitals we ll probably have to shoot them some time anyway or we ll raise a breed of morons aftermath private reprimand and apologies thumb general dwight eisenhower commander of sicily invasion and patton s superior in 1943 eisenhower privately criticized patton for incidents but refused to remove him completely from command 10 august incident particularly sight of patton threatening a subordinate with a pistol upset many of medical staff present ii corps surgeon colonel richard t arnest submitted a report on incident to brigadier general william b kean chief of staff of ii corps who submitted it to lieutenant general omar bradley commander of ii corps bradley out of loyalty to patton did nothing more than lock report in his safe arnest also sent report through medical channels to brigadier general frederick a blesse general surgeon of allied force headquarters who then submitted it to eisenhower who received it on 16 august eisenhower ordered blesse to proceed immediately to patton s command to ascertain truth of allegations eisenhower also formulated a delegation to investigate incidents from soldiers points of view including major general john p lucas two colonels from inspector general s office and a theater medical consultant lieutenant colonel perrin h long to investigate incident and interview those involved long interviewed medical personnel who witnessed each incident then filed a report entitled mistreatment of patients in receiving tents of 15th and 93rd evacuation hospitals which extensively detailed patton s actions at both hospitals by 18 august eisenhower had ordered that patton s seventh army be broken up with a few of its units remaining garrisoned in sicily majority of its combat forces would be transferred to fifth united states army under lieutenant general mark w clark this had already been planned by eisenhower who had previously told patton that his seventh army would not be part of upcoming allied invasion of italy scheduled for september on 20 august patton received a cable from eisenhower regarding arrival of lucas at palermo eisenhower told patton it was highly important that he personally meet with lucas as soon as possible as lucas would be carrying an important message before lucas arrived blesse arrived from algiers to look into health of troops in sicily he was also ordered by eisenhower to deliver a secret letter to patton and investigate its allegations in letter eisenhower told patton he had been informed of slapping incidents he said he would not be opening a formal investigation into matter but his criticism of patton was sharp eisenhower noted that no formal record of incidents would be retained at allied headquarters save in his own secret files still he strongly suggested patton apologize to all involved on 21 august patton brought bennett into his office he apologized and men shook hands on 22 august he met with currier as well as medical staff who had witnessed events in each unit and expressed regret for his impulsive actions patton related to medical staff a story of a friend from world war i who had committed suicide after skulking he stated he sought to prevent any recurrence of such an event on 23 august he brought kuhl into his office apologized and shook hands with him as well after apology kuhl said he thought patton was a great general and that at time he didn t know how sick i was currier later said patton s remarks sounded like no apology at all an attempt to justify what he had done patton wrote in his diary that he loathed making apologies particularly when he was told by bennett s brigade commander brigadier general john a crane that bennett had gone absent without leave awol and arrived at hospital by falsely representing his condition patton wrote it is rather a commentary on justice when an army commander has to soft soap a to placate timidity of those above as word of actions had spread informally among troops of seventh army patton drove to each division under his command between 24 and 30 august and gave a 15 minute speech in which he praised their behavior and apologized for any instances where he had been too harsh on soldiers making only vague reference to two slapping incidents in his final apology speech to u s 3rd infantry division patton was overcome with emotion when soldiers supportively began to chant no general no no to prevent him from having to apologize in a letter to general george marshall on 24 august eisenhower praised patton s exploits as commander of seventh army and his conduct of sicily campaign particularly his ability to take initiative as a commander still eisenhower noted patton continued to exhibit some of those unfortunate traits of which you and i have always known he informed marshall of two incidents and his requirement that patton apologize eisenhower stated he believed patton would cease his behavior because fundamentally he is so avid for recognition as a great military commander that he will ruthlessly suppress any habit of his that will tend to jeopardize it when eisenhower arrived in sicily to award montgomery legion of merit on 29 august patton gave him a letter expressing his remorse about incidents media attention word of slapping incidents spread informally among soldiers before eventually circulating to war correspondents one of nurses who witnessed 10 august incident apparently told her boyfriend a captain in seventh army public affairs detachment through him a group of four journalists covering sicily operation heard of incident bess of saturday evening post merrill mueller of nbc news al newman of newsweek and john charles daly of cbs news four journalists interviewed etter and other witnesses but decided to bring matter to eisenhower instead of filing story with their editors bess mueller and quentin reynolds of collier s magazine flew from sicily to algiers and on 19 august bess gave a summary on slapping incidents to eisenhower s chief of staff major general walter bedell smith reporters asked eisenhower directly about incident and eisenhower requested that story be suppressed because war effort could not afford to lose patton bess and other journalists initially complied however news reporters then demanded eisenhower fire patton in exchange for them not reporting story a demand which eisenhower refused story of kuhl s slapping broke in u s when newspaper columnist drew pearson revealed it on his 21 november radio program pearson received details of kuhl incident and other material on patton from his friend ernest cuneo an official with office of strategic services who obtained information from war department files and correspondence pearson s version not only conflated details of both slapping incidents but falsely reported that private in question was visibly out of his head telling patton to duck down or shells would hit him and that in response patton struck soldier knocking him down pearson punctuated his broadcast by twice stating that patton would never again be used in combat despite fact that pearson had no factual basis for this prediction in response allied headquarters denied that patton had received an official reprimand but confirmed that patton had slapped at least one soldier patton s wife beatrice patton spoke to media to defend him she appeared in true confessions a women s confession magazine where she characterized patton as toughest most hard boiled general in u s army but he s quite sweet really she was featured in a washington post article on 26 november while she did not attempt to justify patton s action she characterized him as a tough perfectionist stating that he cared deeply about men under his command and would not ask them to do something he would not do himself public response demands for patton to be relieved of duty and sent home were made in congress and in newspapers across country u s representative jed johnson of oklahoma s 6th district described patton s actions as a despicable incident and was amazed and chagrined patton was still in command he called for general s immediate dismissal on grounds that his actions rendered him no longer useful to war effort representative charles b of iowa s 9th district said on house floor that parents of soldiers need no longer worry of their children being abused by hard boiled officers he wondered whether army had too much blood and guts eisenhower submitted a report to secretary of war henry l stimson who presented it to senator robert r reynolds chairman of senate committee on military affairs report laid out eisenhower s response to incident and gave details of patton s decades of military service eisenhower concluded that patton was invaluable to war effort and that he was confident corrective actions taken would be adequate investigators eisenhower sent to patton s command found general remained overwhelmingly popular with his troops by mid december government had received around 1 500 letters related to patton with many calling for his dismissal and others defending him or calling for his promotion kuhl s father herman f kuhl wrote to his own congressman stating that he forgave patton for incident and requesting that he not be disciplined retired generals also weighed in on matter former army chief of staff charles p summerall wrote to patton that he was indignant about publicity given a trifling incident adding that whatever patton did he was sure it was justified by provocation such cowards used to be shot now they are only encouraged major general kenyon a joyce another combat commander and one of patton s friends attacked pearson as a sensation stating that niceties should be left for softer times of peace in one notable dissension patton s friend former mentor and general of armies john j pershing publicly condemned his actions an act that left patton deeply hurt and caused him to never speak to pershing again after consulting with marshall stimson and assistant secretary of war john j mccloy eisenhower retained patton in european theater though his seventh army saw no further combat patton remained in sicily for rest of year marshall and stimson not only supported eisenhower s decision but defended it in a letter to u s senate stimson stated that patton must be retained because of need for his aggressive winning leadership in bitter battles which are to come before final victory stimson acknowledged retaining patton was a poor move for public relations but remained confident it was right decision militarily effect on plans for invasion of europe contrary to his statements to patton eisenhower never seriously considered removing general from duty in european theater writing of incident before media attention he said if this thing ever gets out they ll be howling for patton s scalp and that will be end of georgie s service in this war i simply cannot let that happen patton is indispensable to war effort one of guarantors of our victory still following capture of messina in august 1943 patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months thumb left omar bradley whom eisenhower selected to lead us ground forces on invasion of normandy over patton bradley patton s former subordinate would become patton s superior in final months of war patton was passed over to lead invasion in northern europe in september bradley patton s junior in both rank and experience was selected to command first united states army that was forming in england to prepare for operation overlord according to eisenhower this decision had been made months before slapping incidents became public knowledge but patton felt they were reason he was denied command eisenhower had already decided on bradley because he felt invasion of europe was too important to risk any uncertainty while eisenhower and marshall both considered patton to be a superb corps level combat commander bradley possessed two of traits that a theater level strategic command required and that patton conspicuously lacked a calm reasoned demeanor and a meticulously consistent nature slapping incidents had only further confirmed to eisenhower that patton lacked ability to exercise discipline and self control at such a command level still eisenhower re emphasized his confidence in patton s skill as a ground combat commander by recommending him for promotion to four star general in a private letter to marshall on 8 september noting his previous combat exploits and admitting that he had a driving power that bradley lacked by mid december eisenhower had been appointed supreme allied commander in europe and moved to england as media attention surrounding incident began to subside mccloy told patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command patton was briefly considered to lead seventh army in operation dragoon but eisenhower felt his experience would be more useful in normandy campaign eisenhower and marshall privately agreed that patton would command a follow on field army after bradley s army conducted initial invasion of normandy bradley would then command resulting army group patton was told on 1 january 1944 only that he would be relieved of command of seventh army and moved to europe in his diary he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army on 26 january 1944 formally given command of a newly arrived unit third united states army he went to united kingdom to prepare unit s inexperienced soldiers for combat this duty occupied patton throughout early 1944 exploiting patton s situation eisenhower sent him on several high profile trips throughout mediterranean in late 1943 he traveled to algiers tunis corsica cairo jerusalem and malta in an effort to confuse german commanders as to where allied forces might next attack by next year german high command still had more respect for patton than for any other allied commander and considered him central to any plan to invade europe from north because of this patton was made a central figure in operation fortitude in early 1944 allies fed german intelligence organizations through double agents a steady stream of false intelligence that patton had been named commander of first united states army group fusag and was preparing for an invasion of pas de calais fusag command was actually an intricately constructed phantom army of decoys props and radio signals based around southeast england to mislead german aircraft and to make axis leaders believe a large force was massing there patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive germans into thinking he was in dover throughout early 1944 when he was actually training third army as a result of operation fortitude german 15th army remained at pas de calais to defend against expected attack formation remained there even after invasion of normandy on 6 june 1944 patton and third army traveled to europe
