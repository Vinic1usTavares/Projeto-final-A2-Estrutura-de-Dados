epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking these episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones in epilepsy seizures have a tendency to recur and as a rule have no immediate underlying cause isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy people with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to their condition cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown some cases occur as result of brain injury stroke brain tumors infections of brain or birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases epileptic seizures are result of excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in cortex of brain diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems this may be partly done by imaging brain and performing blood tests epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram eeg but a normal test does not rule out condition epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable seizures are controllable with medication in about 70 of cases inexpensive anti seizure medications are often available in those whose seizures do not respond to medication surgery neurostimulation or dietary changes may then be considered not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong and many people improve to point that treatment is no longer needed about 39 million people have epilepsy nearly 80 of cases occur in developing world in 2015 it resulted in 125 000 deaths an increase from 112 000 in 1990 epilepsy is more common in older people in developed world onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and elderly in developing world onset is more common in older children and young adults due to differences in frequency of underlying causes about 5 10 of people will have an unprovoked seizure by age of 80 and chance of experiencing a second seizure is between 40 and 50 in many areas of world those with epilepsy either have restrictions placed on their ability to drive or are not permitted to drive until they are free of seizures for a specific length of time word epilepsy is from ancient greek to seize possess or afflict signs and symptoms thumb upright 1 4 a still image of a generalized seizure thumb upright 1 4 a bite to tip of tongue due to a seizure epilepsy is characterized by a long term risk of recurrent seizures these seizures may present in several ways depending on part of brain involved and person s age seizures most common type 60 of seizures are convulsive of these one third begin as generalized seizures from start affecting both hemispheres of brain two thirds begin as focal seizures which affect one hemisphere of brain which may then progress to generalized seizures remaining 40 of seizures are non convulsive an example of this type is absence seizure which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds focal seizures are often preceded by certain experiences known as auras they include sensory visual hearing or smell psychic autonomic and motor phenomena jerking activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it is known as a jacksonian march may occur which are non consciously generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something there are six main types of generalized seizures tonic clonic tonic clonic myoclonic absence and atonic seizures they all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning tonic clonic seizures occur with a contraction of limbs followed by their extension along with arching of back which lasts 10 30 seconds tonic phase a cry may be heard due to contraction of chest muscles followed by a shaking of limbs in unison clonic phase tonic seizures produce constant contractions of muscles a person often turns blue as breathing is stopped in clonic seizures there is shaking of limbs in unison after shaking has stopped it may take 10 30 minutes for person to return to normal this period is called postictal state or postictal phase loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure tongue may be bitten at either tip or on sides during a seizure in tonic clonic seizure bites to sides are more common tongue bites are also relatively common in psychogenic non epileptic seizures myoclonic seizures involve spasms of muscles in either a few areas or all over absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of head or eye blinking person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends atonic seizures involve loss of muscle activity for greater than one second this typically occurs on both sides of body about 6 of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises in certain types of epilepsy seizures happen more often during sleep and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping post ictal after active portion of a seizure ictal state there is typically a period of recovery during which there is confusion referred to as postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns it usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours other common symptoms include feeling tired headache difficulty speaking and abnormal behavior psychosis after a seizure is relatively common occurring in 6 10 of people often people do not remember what happened during this time localized weakness known as todd s paralysis may also occur after a focal seizure when it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two psychosocial epilepsy can have adverse effects on social and psychological well being these effects may include social isolation stigmatization or disability they may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes learning disabilities are common in those with condition and especially among children with epilepsy stigma of epilepsy can also affect families of those with disorder certain disorders occur more often in people with epilepsy depending partly on epilepsy syndrome present these include depression anxiety obsessive compulsive disorder ocd and migraine attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects three to five times more children with epilepsy than children without condition adhd and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child s behavioral learning and social development epilepsy is also more common in children with autism causes epilepsy can have both genetic and acquired causes with interaction of these factors in many cases established acquired causes include serious brain trauma stroke tumours and problems in brain as a result of a previous infection in about 60 of cases cause is unknown epilepsies caused by genetic congenital or developmental conditions are more common among younger people while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people seizures may also occur as a consequence of other health problems if they occur right around a specific cause such as a stroke head injury toxic ingestion or metabolic problem they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in broader classification of seizure related disorders rather than epilepsy itself genetics genetics is believed to be involved in majority of cases either directly or indirectly some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect 1 2 most are due to interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors each of single gene defects is rare with more than 200 in all described most genes involved affect ion channels either directly or indirectly these include genes for ion channels themselves enzymes gaba and g protein coupled receptors in identical twins if one is affected there is a 50 60 chance that other will also be affected in non identical twins risk is 15 these risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures if both twins are affected most of time they have same epileptic syndrome 70 90 other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of general population between 1 and 10 of those with down syndrome and 90 of those with angelman syndrome have epilepsy acquired epilepsy may occur as a result of a number of other conditions including tumors strokes head trauma previous infections of central nervous system genetic abnormalities and as a result of brain damage around time of birth of those with brain tumors almost 30 have epilepsy making them cause of about 4 of cases risk is greatest for tumors in temporal lobe and those that grow slowly other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as of those who have had a stroke 2 4 develop epilepsy in united kingdom strokes account for 15 of cases and it is believed to be cause in 30 of elderly between 6 and 20 of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma mild brain injury increases risk about two fold while severe brain injury increases risk seven fold in those who have experienced a high powered gunshot wound to head risk is about 50 some evidence links epilepsy and celiac disease and non celiac gluten sensitivity while other evidence does not there appears to be a specific syndrome which includes coeliac disease epilepsy and calcifications in brain a 2012 review estimates that between 1 and 6 of people with epilepsy have coeliac disease while 1 of general population has condition risk of epilepsy following meningitis is less than 10 that disease more commonly causes seizures during infection itself in herpes simplex encephalitis risk of a seizure is around 50 with a high risk of epilepsy following up to 25 a form of an infection with pork tapeworm in brain is known as and is cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of world where parasite is common epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria toxoplasmosis and chronic alcohol use increases risk of epilepsy those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a 2 5 fold increase in risk other risks include alzheimer s disease multiple sclerosis tuberous sclerosis and autoimmune encephalitis getting vaccinated does not increase risk of epilepsy malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in developing world although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association people with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic having disease mechanism normally brain electrical activity is non synchronous as neurons do not normally fire in sync with each other but rather fire in order as signals travel throughout brain its activity is regulated by various factors both within neuron and cellular environment factors within neuron include type number and distribution of ion channels changes to receptors and changes of gene expression factors around neuron include ion concentrations synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells chronic inflammation also appears to play a role epilepsy exact mechanism of epilepsy is unknown but a little is known about its cellular and network mechanisms however it is unknown under which circumstances brain shifts into activity of a seizure with its excessive synchronization in epilepsy resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased this may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly this then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop known as a seizure focus another mechanism of epilepsy may be up regulation of excitatory circuits or down regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to brain these secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis failure of blood brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in blood to enter brain seizures there is evidence that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress alcohol abuse flickering light or a lack of sleep among others term seizure threshold is used to indicate amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy in epileptic seizures a group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal excessive and synchronized manner this results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal shift normally after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time this is due in part to effect of inhibitory neurons electrical changes within excitatory neuron and negative effects of adenosine focal seizures begin in one hemisphere of brain while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres some types of seizures may change brain structure while others appear to have little effect neuronal loss and atrophy of specific areas of brain are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy diagnosis thumb upright 1 4 an eeg can aid in locating focus of epileptic seizure diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on observation of seizure onset and underlying cause an electroencephalogram eeg to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging ct scan or mri to look at structure of brain are also usually part of workup while figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted it is not always possible video and eeg monitoring may be useful in difficult cases definition epilepsy is a disorder of brain defined by any of following conditions cellpadding 5 style border 1px solid ccc bgcolor fafafa at least two unprovoked or reflex seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart one unprovoked or reflex seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to general recurrence risk at least 60 after two unprovoked seizures occurring over next 10 years diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome furthermore epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past that age or those who have remained seizure free for last 10 years with no seizure medicines for last 5 years this 2014 definition of international league against epilepsy is a clarification of ilae 2005 conceptual definition according to which epilepsy is a disorder of brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by cognitive psychological and social consequences of this condition definition of epilepsy requires occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure it is therefore possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes epilepsy to be resolved but with no guarantee that it will not return in definition epilepsy is now called a disease rather than a disorder this was a decision of executive committee of ilae taken because word disorder while perhaps having less stigma than does disease also does not express degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use in particular it aims to clarify when an enduring predisposition according to 2005 conceptual definition is present researchers statistically minded and other specialized groups may choose to use older definition or a definition of their own devising ilae considers doing so is perfectly allowable so long as it is clear what definition is being used classification in contrast to classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure classification of epilepsies focuses on underlying causes when a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure diagnostic workup results preferably in seizure itself being classified e g tonic clonic and in underlying disease being identified e g hippocampal sclerosis name of diagnosis finally made depends on available diagnostic results and applied definitions and classifications of seizures and epilepsies and its respective terminology international league against epilepsy ilae provided a classification of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in 1989 as follows cellpadding 5 style border 1px solid ccc bgcolor fafafa localization related epilepsies and syndromes unknown cause e g benign childhood epilepsy with spikes symptomatic cryptogenic e g temporal lobe epilepsy generalized unknown cause e g childhood absence epilepsy cryptogenic or symptomatic e g lennox gastaut syndrome symptomatic e g early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression epilepsies and syndromes undetermined whether focal or generalized with both generalized and focal seizures e g epilepsy with continuous spike waves during slow wave sleep special syndromes with situation related seizures this classification was widely accepted but has also been criticized mainly because underlying causes of epilepsy which are a major determinant of clinical course and prognosis were not covered in detail in 2010 ilae commission for classification of epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories genetic structural metabolic unknown cause that were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent and scientific advances cellpadding 5 style border 1px solid ccc bgcolor fafafa unknown cause mostly genetic or presumed genetic origin pure epilepsies due to single gene disorders pure epilepsies with complex inheritance symptomatic associated with gross anatomic or pathologic abnormalities mostly genetic or developmental causation childhood epilepsy syndromes progressive myoclonic epilepsies syndromes other neurologic single gene disorders disorders of chromosome function developmental anomalies of cerebral structure mostly acquired causes hippocampal sclerosis perinatal and infantile causes cerebral trauma tumor or infection cerebrovascular disorders cerebral immunologic disorders degenerative and other neurologic conditions provoked a specific systemic or environmental factor is predominant cause of seizures provoking factors reflex epilepsies cryptogenic presumed symptomatic nature in which cause has not been identified syndromes cases of epilepsy may be organized into epilepsy syndromes by specific features that are present these features include age that seizure begin seizure types eeg findings among others identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine underlying causes as well as what anti seizure medication should be tried ability to categorize a case of epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since onset of seizures is commonly early less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy 2 8 per 100 000 childhood absence epilepsy 0 8 per 100 000 and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy 0 7 per 100 000 severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused at least partly by some aspect of epilepsy are also referred to as epileptic encephalopathies these are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction for instance lennox gastaut syndrome and west syndrome genetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them however extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect more recent and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies including and and and syndromes in which causes are not clearly identified are difficult to match with categories of current classification of epilepsy categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily idiopathic unknown cause category of 2011 classification includes syndromes in which general clinical features and or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause some childhood epilepsy syndromes are included in unknown cause category in which cause is presumed genetic for instance benign rolandic epilepsy others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause in at least in some cases for instance lennox gastaut syndrome clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not main feature e g angelman syndrome were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within category idiopathic classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research tests an electroencephalogram eeg can assist in showing brain activity suggestive of an increased risk of seizures it is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on basis of symptoms in diagnosis of epilepsy electroencephalography may help distinguish type of seizure or syndrome present in children it is typically only needed after a second seizure it cannot be used to rule out diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without disease in certain situations it may be useful to perform eeg while affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived diagnostic imaging by ct scan and mri is recommended after a first non febrile seizure to detect structural problems in and around brain mri is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected for which ct is more sensitive and more easily available if someone attends emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly imaging tests may be done at a later point if a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging repeating imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures for adults testing of electrolyte blood glucose and calcium levels is important to rule out problems with these as causes an electrocardiogram can rule out problems with rhythm of heart a lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed in children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders a high blood prolactin level within first 20 minutes following a seizure may be useful to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non epileptic seizure serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures if it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope it is not recommended as a routine part of diagnosis of epilepsy differential diagnosis diagnosis of epilepsy can be difficult a number of other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures including syncope hyperventilation migraines narcolepsy panic attacks and psychogenic non epileptic seizures pnes in particular a syncope can be accompanied by a short episode of convulsions nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy often misdiagnosed as nightmares was considered to be a but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome attacks of movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures cause of a drop attack can be among many others an atonic seizure children may have behaviors that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not these include breath holding spells bed wetting night terrors tics and shudder attacks gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of back and twisting of head to side in infants which may be mistaken for tonic clonic seizures misdiagnosis is frequent occurring in about 5 to 30 of cases different studies showed that in many cases seizure like attacks in apparent treatment resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause approximately 20 of people seen at epilepsy clinics have pnes and of those who have pnes about 10 also have epilepsy separating two based on seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult prevention while many cases are not preventable efforts to reduce head injuries provide good care around time of birth and reduce environmental parasites such as pork tapeworm may be effective efforts in one part of central america to decrease rates of pork tapeworm resulted in a 50 decrease in new cases of epilepsy management thumb upright 1 4 wristbands or bracelets denoting their condition are occasionally worn by epileptics should they need medical assistance epilepsy is usually treated with daily medication once a second seizure has occurred while medication may be started after first seizure in those at high risk for subsequent seizures supporting people s self management of their condition may be useful in drug resistant cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet implantation of a or neurosurgery first aid rolling a person with an active tonic clonic seizure onto their side and into recovery position helps prevent fluids from getting into lungs putting fingers a bite block or tongue depressor in mouth is not recommended as it might make person vomit or result in rescuer being bitten efforts should be taken to prevent further self injury spinal precautions are generally not needed if a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if there are more than two seizures in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus this may require medical help to keep airway open and protected a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this at home recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in mouth diazepam may also be used rectally in hospital intravenous lorazepam is preferred if two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective other medications such as phenytoin are recommended convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as or propofol medications thumb upright 1 4 anticonvulsants mainstay treatment of epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications possibly for person s entire life choice of anticonvulsant is based on seizure type epilepsy syndrome other medications used other health problems and person s age and lifestyle a single medication is recommended initially if this is not effective switching to a single other medication is recommended two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work in about half first agent is effective a second single agent helps in about 13 and a third or two agents at same time may help an additional 4 about 30 of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment there are a number of medications available including phenytoin carbamazepine and valproate evidence suggests that phenytoin carbamazepine and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine and may have fewer side effects in united kingdom carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first line treatment for focal seizures with levetiracetam and valproate as second line due to issues of cost and side effects valproate is recommended first line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second line in those with absence seizures or valproate are recommended valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures if seizures are well controlled on a particular treatment it is not usually necessary to routinely check medication levels in blood least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around us 5 a year world health organization gives it a first line recommendation in developing world and it is commonly used there access however may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug adverse effects from medications are reported in 10 to 90 of people depending on how and from whom data is collected most adverse effects are dose related and mild some examples include mood changes sleepiness or an unsteadiness in gait certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes liver toxicity or suppression of bone marrow up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy many of common used medications such as valproate phenytoin carbamazepine and have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects especially when used during first trimester despite this treatment is often continued once effective because risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than risk of medications among antiepileptic medications levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry lowest risk of causing birth defects slowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years however around a third of people have a recurrence most often during first six months stopping is possible in about 70 of children and 60 of adults measuring medication levels is not generally needed in those whose seizures are well controlled surgery epilepsy surgery may be an option for people with focal seizures that remain a problem despite other treatments these other treatments include at least a trial of two or three medications goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60 70 of cases common procedures include cutting out hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection removal of tumors and removing parts of neocortex some procedures such as a corpus are attempted in an effort to decrease number of seizures rather than cure condition following surgery medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases neurostimulation may be another option in those who are not candidates for surgery three types have been used in those who do not respond to medications vagus nerve stimulation anterior thalamic stimulation and closed loop responsive stimulation diet there is tentative evidence that a ketogenic diet high fat low carbohydrate adequate protein decreases number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some however further research is necessary it is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option about 10 stay on diet for a few years due to issues of effectiveness and side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30 and there are long term concerns about heart disease less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective it is unclear why this diet works in people with coeliac disease or non celiac gluten sensitivity and occipital calcifications a gluten free diet may decrease frequency of seizures other avoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers for example those who are sensitive to light may have success with using a small television avoiding video games or wearing dark glasses operant based biofeedback based on eeg waves has some support in those who do not respond to medications psychological methods should not however be used to replace medications exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim some dogs commonly referred to as seizure dogs may help during or after a seizure it is not clear if dogs have ability to predict seizures before they occur there is moderate quality evidence supporting use of psychological interventions along with other treatments in epilepsy this can improve quality of life enhance emotional wellbeing and reduce fatigue in adults and adolescents psychological interventions may also improve seizure control for some individuals by promoting self management and adherence as an add on therapy in those who are not well controlled with other medications appears to be useful in some children in 2018 fda approved this product for lennox gastaut syndrome and syndrome alternative medicine alternative medicine including acupuncture routine vitamins and yoga have no reliable evidence to support their use in epilepsy melatonin is insufficiently supported by evidence trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions prognosis thumb upright 1 4 deaths due to epilepsy per million persons in 2012 epilepsy cannot usually be cured but medication can control seizures effectively in about 70 of cases of those with generalized seizures more than 80 can be well controlled with medications while this is true in only 50 of people with focal seizures one predictor of long term outcome is number of seizures that occur in first six months other factors increasing risk of a poor outcome include little response to initial treatment generalized seizures a family history of epilepsy psychiatric problems and waves on eeg representing generalized activity in developing world 75 of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated in africa 90 do not get treatment this is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive mortality people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of death this increase is between 1 6 and 4 1 fold greater than that of general population greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among elderly those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk mortality is often related to underlying cause of seizures status epilepticus suicide trauma and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy sudep death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications risk of suicide is between 2 and 6 times higher in those with epilepsy cause of this is unclear sudep appears to be partly related to frequency of generalized tonic clonic seizures and accounts for about 15 of epilepsy related deaths it is unclear how to decrease its risk in united kingdom it is estimated that 40 60 of deaths are possibly preventable in developing world many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus epidemiology epilepsy is one of most common serious neurological disorders affecting about 39 million people it affects 1 of population by age 20 and 3 of population by age 75 it is more common in males than females with overall difference being small most of those with disorder 80 are in developing world estimated prevalence of active epilepsy is in range 3 10 per 1 000 with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy who has had a least one unprovoked seizure in last five years epilepsy begins each year in 40 70 per 100 000 in developed countries and 80 140 per 100 000 in developing countries poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one s country in developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in young or in old in developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases in developed countries number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among elderly between 1970s and 2003 this has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in elderly history thumb upright 1 4 hippocrates 17th century engraving by peter paul rubens of an antique bust oldest medical records show that epilepsy has been affecting people at least since beginning of recorded history throughout ancient history disease was thought to be a spiritual condition world s oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in akkadian a language used in ancient mesopotamia and was written around 2000 bc person described in text was diagnosed as being under influence of a moon god and underwent an exorcism epileptic seizures are listed in code of hammurabi c 1790 bc as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund and edwin smith papyrus c 1700 bc describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions oldest known detailed record of disease itself is in a babylonian cuneiform medical text from bc this text gives signs and symptoms details treatment and likely outcomes and describes many features of different seizure types as babylonians had no biomedical understanding of nature of disease they attributed seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating condition through spiritual means around 900 bc described epilepsy as loss of consciousness this definition was carried forward into ayurvedic text of charaka samhita about 400 bc ancient greeks had contradictory views of disease they thought of epilepsy as a form of spiritual possession but also associated condition with genius and divine one of names they gave to it was sacred disease e epilepsy appears within greek mythology it is associated with moon goddesses selene and artemis who afflicted those who upset them greeks thought that important figures such as julius caesar and hercules had disease notable exception to this divine and spiritual view was that of school of hippocrates in fifth century bc hippocrates rejected idea that disease was caused by spirits in his landmark work on sacred disease he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in brain he accused those of attributing a sacred cause to disease of spreading ignorance through a belief in superstitious magic hippocrates proposed that heredity was important as a cause described worse outcomes if disease presents at an early age and made note of physical characteristics as well as social shame associated with it instead of referring to it as sacred disease he used term great disease giving rise to modern term grand mal used for tonic clonic seizures despite his work detailing physical origins of disease his view was not accepted at time evil spirits continued to be blamed until at least 17th century in ancient rome people did not eat or drink with same pottery as that used by someone who was affected people of time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep problem from affecting them according to apuleius and other ancient physicians in order to detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of whose smoke would trigger seizure occasionally a spinning potter s wheel was used perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy in most cultures persons with epilepsy have been stigmatized shunned or even imprisoned as late as in second half of 20th century in tanzania and other parts of africa epilepsy was associated with possession by evil spirits witchcraft or poisoning and was believed by many to be contagious in birthplace of modern neurology jean martin charcot found people with epilepsy side by side with mentally ill those with chronic syphilis and criminally insane in ancient rome epilepsy was known as morbus disease of assembly hall and was seen as a curse from gods in northern italy epilepsy was once traditionally known as saint valentine s malady in mid 1800s first effective anti seizure medication bromide was introduced first modern treatment phenobarbital was developed in 1912 with phenytoin coming into use in 1938 society and culture stigma stigma is commonly experienced around world by those with epilepsy it can affect people economically socially and culturally in india and china epilepsy may be used as justification to deny marriage people in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed in parts of africa such as tanzania and uganda epilepsy is incorrectly claimed to be associated with possession by evil spirits witchcraft or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious before 1971 in united kingdom epilepsy was considered grounds for annulment of marriage stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures economics seizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in united states epilepsy resulted in economic costs in europe of around 15 5 billion euros in 2004 in india epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of us 1 7 billion or 0 5 of gdp it is cause of about 1 of emergency department visits 2 for emergency departments for children in united states vehicles those with epilepsy are at about twice risk of being involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus in many areas of world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met in some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to licensing body while in others requirement is only that they encourage person in question to report it themselves countries that require physician reporting include sweden austria denmark and spain countries that require individual to report include uk and new zealand and physician may report if they believe individual has not already in canada united states and australia requirements around reporting vary by province or state if seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country many countries require one to three years without seizures in united states time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year those with epilepsy or seizures are typically denied a pilot license in canada if an individual has had no more than one seizure they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered in united states federal aviation administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license rarely exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication in united kingdom a full national private pilot license requires same standards as a professional driver s license this requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years support organizations there are organizations that provide support for people and families affected by epilepsy out of shadows campaign a joint effort by world health organization international league against epilepsy and international bureau for epilepsy provides help internationally in united states epilepsy foundation is a national organization that works to increase acceptance of those with disorder their ability to function in society and to promote research for a cure epilepsy foundation some hospitals and some individuals also run support groups in united states research seizure prediction refers to attempts to forecast epileptic seizures based on eeg before they occur no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed kindling where
