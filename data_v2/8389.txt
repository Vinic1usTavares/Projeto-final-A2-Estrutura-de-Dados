samarium is a chemical element with symbol sm and atomic number 62 it is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air being a typical member of lanthanide series samarium usually assumes oxidation state 3 compounds of samarium ii are also known most notably monoxide smo monochalcogenides sms smse and smte as well as samarium ii iodide last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis samarium has no significant biological role but is only slightly toxic samarium was discovered in 1879 by french chemist paul emile lecoq de boisbaudran and named after mineral samarskite from which it was isolated mineral itself was earlier named after a russian mine official colonel vassili samarsky bykhovets who thereby became first person to have a chemical element named after him albeit indirectly although classified as a rare earth element samarium is 40th most abundant element in earth s crust and is more common than metals such as tin samarium occurs with concentration up to 2 8 in several minerals including cerite gadolinite samarskite monazite and bastnasite last two being most common commercial sources of element these minerals are mostly found in china united states brazil india sri lanka and australia china is by far world leader in samarium mining and production major commercial application of samarium is in samarium cobalt magnets which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets however samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures above without losing their magnetic properties due to alloy s higher curie point radioactive isotope samarium 153 is active component of drug samarium 153sm lexidronam quadramet which kills cancer cells in treatment of lung cancer prostate cancer breast cancer and osteosarcoma another isotope samarium 149 is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to control rods of nuclear reactors it is also formed as a decay product during reactor operation and is one of important factors considered in reactor design and operation other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions radioactive dating and x ray lasers physical properties samarium is a rare earth metal having a hardness and density similar to those of zinc with boiling point of 1794 degc samarium is third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium this property facilitates separation of samarium from mineral ore at ambient conditions samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure a form upon heating to 731 degc its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close packed hcp however transition temperature depends on metal purity further heating to 922 degc transforms metal into a body centered cubic bcc phase heating to 300 degc combined with compression to 40 kbar results in a double hexagonally close packed structure dhcp applying higher pressure of order of hundreds or thousands of induces a series of phase transformations in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900 kbar in one study dhcp phase could be produced without compression using a annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700 degc confirming transient character of this samarium phase also thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions samarium and its sesquioxide are paramagnetic at room temperature their corresponding effective magnetic moments below 2mb are 3rd lowest among lanthanides and their oxides after lanthanum and lutetium metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14 8 k individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules they can also be doped between c60 molecules in fullerene solid rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8 k samarium doping of iron based superconductors most recent class of high temperature superconductors allows enhancing their transition temperature to 56 k which is highest value achieved so far in this series chemical properties freshly prepared samarium has a silvery luster in air it slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at 150 degc even when stored under mineral oil samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish yellow powder of oxide hydroxide mixture at surface metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon samarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide 2 sm s 6 h2o l 2 sm oh 3

samarium compounds it exists in several crystalline phases trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from melt melting point of sm2o3 is rather high 2345 degc and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating but with induction heating through a radio frequency coil sm2o3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by flame fusion method verneuil process from sm2o3 powder that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter boules are transparent when pure and defect free and are orange otherwise heating metastable trigonal sm2o3 to 1900 degc converts it to more stable monoclinic phase cubic sm2o3 has also been described samarium is one of few lanthanides that form a monoxide smo this lustrous golden yellow compound was obtained by reducing sm2o3 with samarium metal at elevated temperature 1000 degc and pressure above 50 kbar lowering pressure resulted in an incomplete reaction smo has cubic rock salt lattice structure greenwood p 1239 chalcogenides samarium forms trivalent sulfide selenide and telluride divalent chalcogenides sms smse and smte with cubic rock salt crystal structure are also known they are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure whereas transition is continuous and occurs at about 20 30 kbar in smse and smte it is abrupt in sms and requires only 6 5 kbar this effect results in spectacular color change in sms from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished transition does not change lattice symmetry but there is a sharp decrease 15 in crystal volume beaurepaire eric ed magnetism a synchrotron radiation approach springer 2006 p 393 it shows hysteresis that is when pressure

metal with 1 2 in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at room temperature greenwood p 1240 sm s smi2 ch2 ch2 in addition to dihalides reduction also produces numerous non stoichiometric samarium halides with a well defined crystal structure such as and as reflected in table above samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another which is an uncommon behavior for most elements e g actinides many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition one being significantly more stable and another being metastable latter is formed upon compression or heating followed by quenching to ambient conditions for example compressing usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing pressure results in a pbcl2 type orthorhombic structure density 5 90 g cm3 and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide density 5 97 g cm3 borides sintering powders of samarium oxide and boron in vacuum yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases and their volume ratio can be controlled through mixing proportion powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques relying on different melting crystallization temperature of smb6 degc smb4 about 2300 degc and smb66 2150 degc all these materials are hard brittle dark gray solids with hardness increasing with boron content samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure about 65 kbar and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240 degc to stabilize its growth increasing temperature results in preferential formations of smb6 samarium hexaboride samarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate valence compound where samarium is present both as sm2 and sm3 ions at ratio 3 7 it belongs to a class of kondo insulators that is at high temperatures above 50 k its properties are typical of a kondo metal with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering whereas at low temperatures it behaves as a non magnetic insulator with a narrow band gap of about 4 14 mev cooling induced metal insulator transition in smb6 is accompanied by a sharp increase in thermal conductivity peaking at about 15 k reason for this increase is that electrons themselves do not contribute to thermal conductivity at low temperatures which is dominated by phonons but decrease in electron concentration reduced rate of electron phonon scattering new research seems to show that it may be a topological insulator other inorganic compounds thumb upright samarium sulfate sm2 so4 3 samarium carbides are prepared by melting a graphite metal mixture in an inert atmosphere after synthesis they are unstable in air and are

an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode thus heating rate has to be kept well below 1 degc

prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with nac5h5 in tetrahydrofuran contrary to cyclopentadienides of most other lanthanides in sm c5h5 3 some c5h5 rings bridge each other by forming ring e1 or edges e2 toward another neighboring samarium atom thereby creating polymeric chains sm c5h5 2cl has a dimer structure which is more accurately expressed as e5 c5h5 m cl 2 e5 c5h5 2 there chlorine bridges can be replaced for instance by iodine hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by cn groups greenwood p 1249 c5h5 ion in samarium cyclopentadienides can be replaced by c9h7 or c8h8 2 ring resulting in sm c9h7 3 or ksm e8 c8h8 2 latter compound has a similar structure to that of uranocene there is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium sm c5h5 2 a solid that sublimates at about 85 degc contrary to ferrocene c5h5 rings in sm c5h5 2 are not parallel but are tilted by 40deg alkyls and aryls of samarium are obtained through a metathesis reaction in tetrahydrofuran or ether smcl3 3 lir 3

first found in remote russian region of urals by late 1870s its deposits had been located in other places making mineral available to many researchers in particular it was found that samarium isolated by boisbaudran was also impure and contained comparable amount of europium pure element was produced only in 1901 by eugene anatole demarcay boisbaudran named his element samaria after mineral samarskite which in turn honored vassili samarsky bykhovets 1803 1870 samarsky bykhovets as chief of staff of russian corps of mining engineers had granted access for two german mineralogists brothers

its element samarium royal society of chemistry it is prepared by solvent extraction from mixed lanthanides isolated from bastnasite or monazite since heavier lanthanides have greater affinity for solvent used they are easily extracted from bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent not all rare earth producers who process bastnasite do so on a large enough scale to continue onward with separation of components of seg which typically makes up only one or two percent of original ore such producers will therefore be making seg with a view to marketing it to specialized processors in
