overlying message band intended for we don t need to whisper is that future could become a utopia opening track valkyrie missile opens we don t need to whisper with a cinematic organ melody 1980s influenced guitars and a quote from an astronaut anybody out there distraction follows and is filled with hand claps and a keyboard melody over verses lamenting death and destruction do it for me now

young lovers watching sunrise adventure is an exhilarating ode to a beckoning future with a huge guitar sound reminiscent of cure song was motivated by a friend whose marriage was falling apart when his wife committed adultery situation had a deep impact on delonge in that he spent a night up crying for him when he wrote track a little s enough was inspired by a religious concept in which a god came to bring positive change on earth when it faces terrorism war or famine war an anthem about iraq war and its death toll is succeeded by it hurts a track about a friend of delonge s with a cheating girlfriend it s a terrible situation where my friend is being crushed from inside out by all manipulative stuff she s doing and this song s about that during development delonge often took his daughter ava to an ice cream shop in san diego and on one occasion they wandered into a next door toy store and delonge was enchanted by sound of a pink toy piano which he would eventually purchase he placed piano in his shower and recorded start machine which attempts to illustrate state of being on a boat as you re leaving a city in flames only to find a tropical island and a more alluring place ahead delonge considered it a reference to his time with blink 182 and central to angels airwaves theme that something special can come out of destruction promotion in september 2005 after spending months avoiding publicity delonge announced his new angels airwaves project and promised greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation his statements containing predictions that album would usher in an entire new culture of youth and lead to band s dominance were regarded as highly grandiose in press and mocked and set sources in his belief that his album would become a recording critics would refer to two decades on as album of 2000s or sole successor to what he considered most recent important album nirvana s nevermind 1991 he also contended he began writing whisper immediately following release of blink 182 seeing it as a force to be reckoned with that he knew he had to beat and while wishing to take project to that police level that joshua tree level he observed in interviews that prior to blink 182 s hiatus he thought angels airwaves would become a highly important band other band members did not refute delonge s press statements viewing them as tongue in cheek and offering little substance thoroughly utilized by band delonge often discussed minor details and plans for accompanying films and other promotional matter and his managers approached him having an intervention in which they questioned his frame of mind his ambitious beliefs were intensified by his addiction to vicodin a drug which he used due to his back problem and did not try out again when he was unable to obtain it for a week hallucinating and deep in withdrawal reception critical we don t need to whisper received largely mixed reviews from contemporary music critics at time of its release alternative press was generally most enthusiastic of positive reviews considering it influential to rock bands in 2006 publication found album to not be abounding or thought provoking and commented while lyrics might be delonge at his most soul searching music is built for nothing smaller than football stadiums ign was also very positive in their assessment of record writing this album is like a post millennial concept record that beckons to be listened to with lights dimmed and headphones clamped tightly around your aural receptors it may not be your cup of tea but kudos to quartet for not merely re treading blink market with more mature lyrics entertainment weekly journalist leah greenblatt gave album a b rating commending its obvious influences while also criticizing delonge s vocals it stated that his vocals might improve to resemble those of robert smith heard on tracks like it hurts but likened it to a high school student with a job at del taco communicating with a drive through microphone rolling stone writer christian hoard summarized record and mixed reviews simply as delonge yanks heartstrings with so so results and saw atmospheric elements as excessive spin had a similar sentiment here his three sidemen elevate delonge s emo tendencies to something grander and more romantic though somewhat less exciting blender composition of album as it contains duller aspects of blink 182 accompanied with u2 influenced guitar chimes many critics arraigned album to be pretentious and contrasted angels airwaves with blink 182 a v club journalist kyle ryan described his experience with we don t need to whisper as 50 minutes of delonge demonstrating his musical skills english magazine uncut discerned his departure from blink 182 and album s serious tone allmusic writer stephen thomas erlewine praised differences in musical style between both bands but remained polarized about album and commented that it may not make for a successful record but it does make for an interesting one particularly in how delonge s desire to be taken seriously has led him to use serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he s serious now but we don t need to whisper is too doggedly dour and amorphous to be more than a curiosity commercial performance album sold 127 000 copies its first week and was certified gold by riaa
