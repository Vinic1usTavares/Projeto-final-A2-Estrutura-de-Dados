to plan d blueprint for restructuring raaf sponsored by chief of air staff air vice marshal george jones a major facet of plan d adopted in june 1947 was its encouragement of local industry to design

raise standard of technical roles in air force opened early in 1948 at ground training school in raaf station wagga new south wales to provide education and technical training for youths aged fifteen

vice marshal wackett left greeted by group captain d r chapman officer commanding no 91 composite wing raaf iwakuni japan april 1953 wackett played a key role in establishing technical services as a distinct department within raaf rather than forming part of supply branch as in previous years mindful of increasing responsibility that was being placed on scientific and technical resources in modern air force he had raised question of a specialist engineering branch immediately after war and in march 1946 gained broad approval for its establishment after eighteen months of work defining its scope and responsibilities technical branch was formed under wackett s leadership on 23 september 1948 his goals being to support operational power of raaf by providing most efficient technical organisation possible and to increase effectiveness of air power through technical development this in turn led to a separate list of engineering personnel as opposed to earlier technical list subgroup under general duties branch stephens going solo pp 171 173 for flexibility and to ensure that flying and engineering branches had a better appreciation of their respective operations wackett supported practice of some general duties officers continuing to perform engineering work and as many technical officers as possible receiving secondary training as aircrew he was disappointed however by limits imposed by air board on career advancement for his personnel while general duties branch in late 1940s was permitted to maintain thirty seven officer positions of group captain and above technical branch was only allowed fourteen such slots though both departments had an almost identical overall strength of just under 400 staff this anomaly led wackett to submit a dissenting report on subject to air board one of few occasions a board member exercised his right to such a protest his new organisation caused some other tensions in raaf new airworthiness considerations frustrated pilots who found their flying time restricted by introduction of more rigorous maintenance procedures supply officers feared being outshone by new status accorded to engineers and so called black handers old school technical officers who had risen through ranks regarded with disdain prospect of an influx of silly young blokes with degrees thumb right 250px alt two men in military uniforms with

for equipment and maintenance to air member for technical services in which capacity he would serve until his retirement from raaf in 1959 appointed a commander of order of british empire in 1951 king s birthday honours wackett again worked closely with air vice marshal hewitt now air member for supply and equipment to introduce concept of acquiring spare parts based on life of type whereby forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft s projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed to reduce costs and delivery time stephens going solo p 182 in 1953 wackett established advanced diploma training for twenty five airmen annually at melbourne technical college graduates receiving commissions as pilot officers stephens going solo p 137 he also began recruiting university qualified engineers to technical branch and put in place formal relationships with such bodies as csiro council of aeronautics of which he was a member aeronautical research laboratories and local aircraft manufacturers de havilland australia government aircraft factories and cac he further initiated raaf sponsorship of a chair of aeronautics at university of sydney

an attitude to quality and professionalism that went beyond simply whether aircraft were fit to fly or not wackett was described in official history of post war air force as among outstanding officers of post war era establishment of a dedicated technical branch which he founded in 1948 was a key factor in raaf developing ability to successfully manage maintenance and upgrade of such highly

stipulated that appointees had to belong to raaf s general duties aircrew branch in 1975 air marshal rowland was appointed as cas though he had to transfer from engineering to general duties before
