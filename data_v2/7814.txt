men from east bringing gifts of gold myrrh and frankincense to newborn jesus unknown poet of cantata text may be same as for bwv 40 and bwv 64 for second and third day of christmas a person theologically competent and poetically sic as bach scholar klaus hofmann writes librettist begins with final verse of epistle reading isaiah s prophecy all they from sheba shall come they shall bring

with a chorale text is not extant but it is assumed to be stanza 10 of paul gerhardt s hymn bach first performed cantata for epiphany on 6 january 1724 in his christmas oratorio of 1734 bach dedicated part vi to topic and occasion and first performed it on 6 january 1735 music structure and scoring bach structured cantata in seven movements opening chorus is followed by a chorale then two soloists sing a sequence of recitative and aria each and work closes with a chorale bach scored cantata for two vocal soloists tenor t and bass b a four part choir and a festive baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns co two recorders fl two oboes da caccia oc two violins vl viola va and basso continuo bach employed a pair of horns before in his christmas cantata bwv 40 and later in his cantata for

juva a pre fixed prayer to most of bach s compositions feast of epiphany concerto for 2 hunting horns 2 oboes da caccia two recorders 2 violins and viola with 4 voices following table of movements gives scoring according to neue bach ausgabe keys and time signatures are taken from book on all bach cantatas by bach scholar alfred durr using symbol for common time 4 4 continuo playing throughout is not shown movements bach uses scoring and especially instrumentation to illustrate contrast between poverty and abundance while all recitatives are secco and strings are silent for first aria which is supported only by oboes da caccia in low register a festive orchestra with three kinds of wind instruments and strings accompanies not only as usual opening chorus and closing chorale but also penultimate movement a tenor aria expressing how believer gives his heart as a present hofmann notes that bach combines high art with folk style 1 opening chorus they will all come forth out of sheba depicts that all not just wise men gather and move to adore horn signals call first and prevail throughout movement canonical and imitative developments depict growing of a crowd central section is an extended choral fugue framed by two sections with voices embedded in a repeat of instrumental introduction john eliot gardiner remarked in connection with his bach cantata pilgrimage that instrumentation resembles near eastern music recorders representing high pitches often associated with oriental music and oboes da caccia in tenor register to evoke shawm like double reed instruments and zurna of near east 2 thumb upright 1 3 first print of published by in nurnberg in 1553 same idea is rendered in a stanza from christmas carol kings came out of sheba telling of unknown number of kings from sheba as mentioned by isaiah its melody in triple time is set for four parts 3 first recitative what isaiah prophesied there has happened in bethlehem applies situation to individual christian who has nothing to offer as a gift but his heart explained in an arioso ending musicologist julian mincham notes unexpected harmonies when stable of bethlehem is mentioned as if to illustrate lowliness of that birthplace 4 first aria gold from ophir is too meager is accompanied by oboes da caccia whose low register together with bass voice conveys humility expressed in words instruments keep repeating first motif recalling initial idea that gold is not good enough 5 tenor recitative do not scorn o you light of my soul my heart begins with a plea expressed in a line descending through a ninth it ends on notion abundance of greatest wealth must some day be mine in heaven 6 to show abundance dance like aria take me to yourself as your own is accompanied by all wind instruments playing concertante and together instead of a conventional da capo aria bach creates a bar form by repeating text of second idea on new musical material a long ritornello of 32 measures contains an almost unprecedented variety of instrumental colouring as mincham writes 7 closing chorale ah now then my god i fall confidently into your hands is sung on melody of which bach used frequently later as base for his chorale cantata bwv 111 and movement 25 of his st matthew passion recordings entries are taken from selection on bach cantatas website choirs with one voice per part
