hyacinthoides non scripta formerly endymion non scriptus or scilla non scripta is a bulbous perennial plant found in atlantic areas from north western spain to british isles and also frequently used as a garden plant it is known in english as common bluebell or simply bluebell a name which is used in scotland to refer to harebell campanula rotundifolia in spring h non scripta produces a nodding one sided inflorescence of 5 12 tubular sweet scented violet blue flowers with strongly recurved tepals and 3 6 long linear basal leaves h non scripta is particularly associated with ancient woodland where it may dominate understorey to produce carpets of violet blue flowers in bluebell woods but also occurs in more open habitats in western regions it is protected under uk law and in some other parts of its range a related species h hispanica has also been introduced to british isles and hybridises with h non scripta to produce intermediates known as hyacinthoides x massartiana h x massartiana taxonomy hyacinthoides non scripta was first described by carl linnaeus in his seminal 1753 work as a species in genus hyacinthus specific epithet means or unmarked and was intended to distinguish this plant from classical hyacinth of greek mythology this mythical flower which was almost certainly not modern hyacinth sprang up from blood of dying prince hyacinthus his lover god apollo shed tears that marked new flower s petals with letters alas as a sign of his grief in 1803 johann von and johann heinrich friedrich link transferred species to genus scilla and in 1849 christian august friedrich transferred it to genus endymion now a synonym of hyacinthoides it is still widely known as scilla non scripta or endymion non scriptus in 1934 pierre transferred species to its current placement in genus hyacinthoides scilla was original greek name for sea squill maritima endymion is a character from greek mythology hyacinthoides means like a hyacinth type species of hyacinthoides is h hispanica while that of endymion is scilla nutans described by james edward smith in english botany in 1797 but now treated as a synonym of h non scripta smith had argued that nodding is a more fitting epithet than which makes no sense once separated from hyacinthus but international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants requires oldest name to be used regardless of meaning common names for hyacinthoides non scripta include bluebell common bluebell english bluebell british bluebell wild hyacinth wood bell fairy flower and bell bottle in scotland term bluebell is used for harebell campanula rotundifolia related species hyacinthoides non scripta forms a clade with three other species h hispanica h paivae and h cedretorum centred on iberian peninsula h paivae is restricted to a small area of north western iberia galicia and neighbouring parts of portugal while h cedretorum is found in mountainous areas of western north africa morocco and algeria within iberia h non scripta and h hispanica are geographically separated by duero river genus also contains seven further species mostly distributed further east in mediterranean basin description hyacinthoides non scripta is a perennial plant that grows from a bulb it produces 3 6 linear leaves all growing from base of plant and each wide an inflorescence of 5 12 exceptionally 3 32 flowers is borne on a stem up to tall which droops towards tip flowers are arranged in a 1 sided nodding raceme each flower is long with two bracts at base and six tepals are strongly recurved at their tips tepals are violet blue three stamens in outer whorl are fused to perianth for more than 75 of their length and bear cream coloured pollen flowers are strongly and sweetly scented seeds are black and germinate on soil surface bulbs produce contractile roots when these roots contract they draw bulbs down into deeper layers of soil where there is greater moisture reaching depths of this may explain absence of h non scripta from some thin soils over chalk in south east england since bulbs are unable to penetrate into sufficiently deep soils h non scripta differs from h hispanica which occurs as an introduced species in british isles in a number of ways h hispanica has paler flowers which are borne in radially symmetrical racemes their tepals are less recurved and are only faintly scented outer stamens are fused with tepals for less than 75 of their length and anthers are same colour as tepals these two species are thought to have diverged 8000 years ago two species hybridise readily to produce fertile offspring known as hyacinthoides x massartiana hybrids are intermediate between parental species forming a spectrum of variation which connects two distribution and ecology hyacinthoides non scripta is native to western parts of atlantic europe from north western spain occasionally even north western portugal to netherlands and british isles it is found in belgium great britain france ireland netherlands and spain and also occurs as a naturalized species in germany italy and romania it has also been introduced and can be highly invasive into various parts of north america in both pacific northwest british columbia washington and oregon great lakes region ontario new york ohio and pennsylvania and other parts of united states kentucky and indiana despite wide distribution of h non scripta it reaches its greatest densities in british isles where bluebell woods woodland with understory dominated by h non scripta in spring are a familiar sight h non scripta is found throughout british isles with exception of northern outer hebrides lewis and harris orkney and shetland and it is estimated that 25 50 of all common bluebells may be found in british isles bluebells are a species of deciduous woodland over much of their range flowering and leafing early before canopy closes in late spring they may also be found growing under bracken or japanese knotweed perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy they are most successful on slightly acid soils same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as mercurialis perennis as a species adapted to woodlands young shoots are able to penetrate through a thick layer of leaf litter and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows and in west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats including coastal meadows bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees although they are also visited by various other insects they are a host species for parasitic fungus muscari which causes bluebell rust ability of h non scripta to take up phosphorus from soil is greatly enhanced by presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots protection hyacinthoides non scripta is not protected under international law such as cites or eu habitats directive in united kingdom h non scripta is a protected species under wildlife and countryside act 1981 landowners are prohibited from removing common bluebells on their land for sale and it is a criminal offence to remove bulbs of wild common bluebells this legislation was strengthened in 1998 under schedule 8 of act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence punishable by fines of up to ps5 000 per bulb species is not protected in republic of ireland in france h non scripta is largely confined to northern half of country it is not legally protected at national level but it is protected in many of towards edge of its range correze loiret gironde lot et garonne dordogne cher eure et loir indre et loire and loir et cher in wallonia h non scripta is protected under of uses bluebells are widely planted as garden plants either among trees or in herbaceous borders they flower at same time as hyacinths narcissus and some tulips their ability to reproduce vegetatively using bulb offsets and seed means that they can spread rapidly and may need to be controlled as weeds bluebells synthesise a wide range of chemicals with potential medicinal properties they contain at least 15 biologically active compounds that may provide them with protection against insects and animals certain extracts water soluble alkaloids are similar to compounds tested for use in combating hiv and cancer bulbs of bluebells are used in folk medicine as a remedy for and as a diuretic or styptic while sap can be used as an adhesive bluebell may be regarded as united kingdom s favourite flower when wild plant charity organised a survey in 2004 to find a favourite flower for each county in united kingdom it decided to ban voters from choosing bluebell because it had been by far top choice in an earlier poll for nation s favourite flower a stylised bluebell is used as logo for botanical society of britain and ireland notes references
