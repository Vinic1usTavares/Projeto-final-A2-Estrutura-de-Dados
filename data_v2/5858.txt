groove only available on 1985 reissue of like a virgin vogue from 1990 s i m breathless and justify my love from 1990 s immaculate collection may disappoint some fans robin murray from clash noted that while it traced evolution of a pop phenomenon he felt it needed bonus materials andy kellman from allmusic was more ambivalent in his reception of box set stating that release is more suitable for voracious newcomers than longtime followers describing packaging kellman noted that it was sharp but not elaborate a clamshell box with each disc packaged in a paper lp replica sleeve while box is a convenient and reasonably priced way to obtain most of madonna s releases an investment of that scope should entail all stray hits from same era this really could have used a 12th disc for adding all other songs released by madonna bbc described packaging as a no frills affair cds are housed in cardboard sleeves that won t stand up to house party punishment clash commented on packaging more favorably describing it as fairly lavish commercial performance in united kingdom box set debuted at number 70 on uk albums chart with sales of 2 055 copies madonna s total album sales for 21st
