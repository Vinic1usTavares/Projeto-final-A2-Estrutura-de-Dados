beryllium is a chemical element with symbol be and atomic number 4 it is a relatively rare element in universe usually occurring as a product of spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays within cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements it is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl aquamarine emerald and chrysoberyl as a free element it is a steel gray strong lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal in structural applications combination of high flexural rigidity thermal stability thermal conductivity and low density 1 85 times that of water make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components missiles spacecraft and satellites because of its low density and atomic mass beryllium is relatively transparent to x rays and other forms of ionizing radiation therefore it is most common window material for x ray equipment and components of particle detectors high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications when added as an alloying element to aluminium copper notably alloy beryllium copper iron or nickel beryllium improves many physical properties tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface beryllium does not form oxides until it reaches very high temperatures commercial use of beryllium requires use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of toxicity of inhaled beryllium containing dusts that can cause a chronic life threatening allergic disease in some people called berylliosis characteristics physical properties beryllium is a steel gray and hard metal that is brittle at room temperature and has a close packed hexagonal crystal structure it has exceptional stiffness young s modulus 287 gpa and a melting point of 1287 c modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50 greater than that of steel combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium about 12 9 km s at ambient conditions other significant properties are high specific heat 1925 j kg 1 k 1 and thermal conductivity 216 w m 1 k 1 which make beryllium metal with best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight in combination with relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion 11 6 k 1 these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading nuclear properties naturally occurring beryllium save for slight contamination by cosmogenic radioisotopes is isotopically pure beryllium 9 which has a nuclear spin of beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high energy neutrons about 6 barns for energies above approximately 10 kev therefore it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator effectively slowing neutrons to thermal energy range of below 0 03 ev where total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower exact value strongly depends on purity and size of crystallites in material single primordial beryllium isotope 9be also undergoes a n 2n neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1 9 mev to produce 8be which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles thus for high energy neutrons beryllium is a neutron multiplier releasing more neutrons than it absorbs this nuclear reaction is n 2 2 n neutrons are liberated when beryllium nuclei are struck by energetic alpha particles producing nuclear reaction n where is an alpha particle and is a carbon 12 nucleus beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays thus natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for laboratory production of free neutrons small amounts of tritium are liberated when nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in three step nuclear reaction n b n note that has a half life of only 0 8 seconds b is an electron and has a high neutron absorption cross section tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams as a metal beryllium is transparent to most wavelengths of x rays and gamma rays making it useful for output windows of x ray tubes and other such apparatus isotopes and nucleosynthesis both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars but radioisotopes do not last long it is believed that most of stable beryllium in universe was originally created in interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope 9be and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic and element thumb left upright 1 35 plot showing variations in solar activity including variation in sunspot number red and 10be concentration blue note that beryllium scale is inverted so increases on this scale indicate lower 10be levels radioactive cosmogenic 10be is produced in atmosphere of earth by cosmic ray spallation of oxygen 10be accumulates at soil surface where its relatively long half life 1 36 million years permits a long residence time before decaying to boron 10 thus 10be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion soil formation and development of lateritic soils and as a proxy for measurement of variations in solar activity and age of ice cores production of 10be is inversely proportional to solar activity because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach earth nuclear explosions also form 10be by reaction of fast neutrons with 13c in carbon dioxide in air this is one of indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites isotope 7be half life 53 days is also cosmogenic and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots much like 10be 8be has a very short half life of about 8 s that contributes to its significant cosmological role as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in big bang this is due to lack of sufficient time during big bang s nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by fusion of nuclei and very low concentrations of available beryllium 8 british astronomer sir fred hoyle first showed that energy levels of 8be and 12c allow carbon production by so called triple alpha process in helium fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available this process allows carbon to be produced in stars but not in big bang star created carbon basis of carbon based life is thus a component in elements in gas and dust ejected by agb stars and supernovae see also big bang nucleosynthesis as well as creation of all other elements with atomic numbers larger than that of carbon 2s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding therefore when 7be decays by l electron capture it does so by taking electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding this makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings a rare occurrence in nuclear decay shortest lived known isotope of beryllium is which decays through neutron emission it has a half life of 2 7 x 10 21 s is also very short lived with a half life of 5 0 x 10 21 s hammond c r elements in exotic isotopes 11be and 14be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo this phenomenon can be understood as nuclei of 11be and 14be have respectively 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside classical fermi model of nucleus occurrence left thumb beryllium ore with coin for scale thumb

beryl chrysoberyl and be2sio4 precious forms of beryl are aquamarine red beryl and emerald green color in gem quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium about 2 for emerald two main ores of beryllium beryl and bertrandite are found in argentina brazil india madagascar russia and united states total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400 000 tonnes production extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed united states china and kazakhstan are only three countries involved in industrial scale extraction of beryllium beryllium production technology is in early stages of development in russia after a 20 year hiatus beryllium is most commonly extracted from mineral beryl which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium fluorosilicate and soda at to form sodium fluoroberyllate aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water extraction of beryllium using melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated in concentrated sulfuric acid mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate aqueous ammonia is then used to remove aluminium and sulfur leaving beryllium hydroxide beryllium hydroxide created using either sinter or melt method is then converted into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride to form fluoride aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate which is heated to to form beryllium fluoride heating fluoride to with magnesium forms finely divided beryllium and additional heating to creates compact metal heating beryllium hydroxide forms oxide which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain metal chemical properties thumb structure

he 2s2 predominant oxidation state of beryllium is 2 beryllium atom has lost both of its valence electrons lower oxidation states have been found in for example bis compounds beryllium s chemical behavior is largely a result of its small atomic and ionic radii it thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms which is why all of its compounds are covalent its chemistry has similarities with chemistry of aluminium an example of a diagonal relationship an oxide layer forms on surface of beryllium metal that prevents further reactions with air

vauquelin conferred on account of its property of forming sweet salts name glycine sweet earth on new earth that had been found by him in beryl and smaragd he certainly didn t expect that soon thereafter another earth would be found which with fully equal right could claim this name therefore in order to avoid confusion of it with yttria earth it would perhaps be advisable to abandon this name glycine and replace it with beryl earth beryllina which name change was also recommended by prof link and for reason that a genus of plants glycine already exists name beryllium was first used by wohler in 1828 thumb left upright friedrich wohler was one of men who independently isolated beryllium friedrich wohler and antoine bussy independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride as follows becl2 2 k 2 kcl be using an alcohol lamp wohler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired shut platinum crucible above reaction immediately took place and caused crucible to become white hot upon cooling and washing resulting gray black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster highly reactive potassium had been produced by electrolysis of its compounds a process discovered 21 years before chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride by paul lebeau in 1898 resulted in first pure 99 5 to 99 8 samples of beryllium however industrial production started only after first world war original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to union carbide and carbon corporation in cleveland oh and siemens ag in berlin in us process was ruled by hugh s cooper director of laboratories company in germany first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by alfred stock and hans goldschmidt a sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from decay of radium in a 1932 experiment by james chadwick that uncovered existence of neutron this same method is used in one class of radioisotope based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million a particles beryllium production saw a rapid increase during world war ii due to rising demand for hard beryllium copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights most early fluorescent lamps used zinc with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light small additions of magnesium improved blue part of spectrum to yield an acceptable white light based phosphors replaced beryllium based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during 19th century metal s high melting point makes this process more energy consuming than corresponding processes used for alkali metals early in 20th century production of beryllium by thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following success of a similar process for production of zirconium but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957 even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium price on american market for vacuum cast beryllium ingots was about 338 per pound 745 per kilogram in 2001 between 1998 and 2008 world s production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes of which 176 tonnes 88 came from united states etymology early precursors of word beryllium can be traced to many languages including latin french ancient greek beryl prakrit pali or to become pale in reference to pale semiprecious gemstone beryl original source is probably sanskrit word which is of south indian origin and could be related to name of modern city of belur for about 160 years beryllium was also known as or with accompanying chemical symbol gl black macmillan company new york 1937 or g john newlands table of octaves name coming from ancient greek word for sweet due to sweet taste of beryllium salts applications radiation windows thumb left beryllium target which converts a proton beam into a neutron beam thumb right a square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an x ray microscope beryllium is highly transparent to x rays owing to its low atomic number because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for x rays oldest and still one of most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for x ray tubes extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in x ray images thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for x ray detectors and extremely low absorption minimizes heating effects caused by high intensity low energy x rays typical of synchrotron radiation vacuum tight windows and beam tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium in scientific setups for various x ray emission studies e g energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted x rays have much lower energies 100 ev than x rays from most studied materials low atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles therefore it is used to build beam pipe around collision region in particle physics setups such as all four main detector experiments at large hadron collider alice atlas cms and slac low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach surrounding detectors without significant interaction its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within pipe to minimize interaction with gases its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with complex magnet systems used to steer and focus particle beams mechanical applications because of its stiffness light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in defense and aerospace industries in high speed aircraft guided missiles spacecraft and satellites including james webb telescope several liquid fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel but this use has never materialized a small number of extreme high end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium from 1998 to 2000 mclaren formula one team used mercedes benz engines with beryllium aluminium alloy pistons use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by scuderia ferrari mixing about 2 0 beryllium into copper forms an alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity high strength and hardness nonmagnetic properties as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance these applications include non sparking tools that are used near flammable gases beryllium nickel in springs and membranes beryllium nickel and beryllium iron used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices as little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability thumb beryllium copper adjustable wrench high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation e g in inertial guidance systems and in support mechanisms for optical systems beryllium copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in jason pistols which were used to strip paint from hulls of ships beryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion shure user s guide page 2 an earlier major application of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes because of its hardness high melting point and exceptional ability to dissipate heat environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials to reduce costs beryllium can be alloyed with significant amounts of aluminium resulting in alloy a trade name this blend is cheaper than pure beryllium while still retaining many desirable properties mirrors beryllium mirrors are of particular interest large area mirrors frequently with a honeycomb support structure are used for example in meteorological satellites where low weight and long term dimensional stability are critical smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire control systems e g in german made leopard 1 and leopard 2 main battle tanks in these systems very rapid movement of mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity usually beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium in some applications though beryllium blank is polished without any coating this is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause coating to buckle james webb space telescope will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors because jwst will face a temperature of 33 k mirror is made of gold plated beryllium capable of handling extreme cold better than glass beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass and remains more uniform in such temperatures for same reason optics of spitzer space telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal magnetic applications thumb sphere beryllium b52 gyrocompass beryllium is non magnetic therefore tools fabricated out of beryllium based materials are used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes they are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging mri machines because of high magnetic fields generated in fields of radio communications and powerful usually military radars hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune highly magnetic klystrons traveling wave tubes etc that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in transmitters nuclear applications thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon designs as very outer layer of plutonium pits in primary stages of thermonuclear bombs placed to surround fissile material these layers of beryllium are good pushers for implosion of plutonium 239 and they are good neutron reflectors just as in beryllium moderated nuclear reactors beryllium is also commonly used in some neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed rather than having to use a nuclear reactor or a particle accelerator powered neutron generator for this purpose a target of beryllium 9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a radioisotope such as polonium 210 radium 226 plutonium 238 or americium 241 in nuclear reaction that occurs a beryllium nucleus is transmuted into carbon 12 and one free neutron is emitted traveling in about same direction as alpha particle was heading such alpha decay driven beryllium neutron sources named urchin neutron initiators were used in some early atomic bombs neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with gamma rays from a gamma decay radioisotope are also used to produce laboratory neutrons byrne j neutrons nuclei and matter dover publications mineola ny 2011 pp 32 33 right thumb upright 1 6 two candu

iter to condition components which face plasma beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods because of its good combination of mechanical chemical and nuclear properties beryllium fluoride is one of constituent salts of eutectic salt mixture which is used as a solvent moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs including liquid fluoride thorium reactor acoustics low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high frequency speaker drivers because beryllium is expensive many times more than titanium hard to shape due to its brittleness and toxic if mishandled beryllium tweeters are limited to high end home pro audio and public address applications some high fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed to be made of material some high end phonograph cartridges used beryllium cantilevers to improve tracking by reducing mass electronic beryllium is a p type dopant in iii v compound semiconductors it is widely used in materials such as gaas algaas and grown by molecular beam epitaxy mbe cross rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for printed circuit boards in surface mount technology in critical electronic applications beryllium is both a structural support and heat sink application also requires a coefficient of thermal expansion that is well matched to alumina and glass substrates beryllium beryllium oxide composite e materials have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have additional advantage that thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials beryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor with high strength and hardness and a very high melting point beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for

micrograms of beryllium is found in average human body an amount not considered harmful beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes which causes them to malfunction because be2 is a highly charged and small ion it can easily get into many tissues and cells where it specifically targets cell nuclei inhibiting many enzymes including those used for synthesizing dna its toxicity is exacerbated by fact that body has no means to control beryllium levels and once inside body beryllium cannot be removed chronic berylliosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment symptoms of

or machined is very well documented solid beryllium metal does not carry same hazards as airborne inhaled dust but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented workers handling finished beryllium pieces are routinely advised to handle them with gloves both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as
