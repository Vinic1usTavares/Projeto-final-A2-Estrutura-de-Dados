ian meckiff born 6 january 1935 is a former cricketer who represented australia in 18 tests between 1957 and 1963 a left arm fast bowler he is best known for two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player he was batsman run out by joe solomon in 1960 causing first tied test in cricket history and in december 1963 his career was sensationally ended when he was called for throwing in first test against south africa by australian umpire col egar during late 1950s and early 1960s there had been a media frenzy about perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket controversy and speculation that dogged meckiff in years preceding his final match caused sections of cricket community to believe that he had been made a scapegoat by australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing with an unconventional front on bowling action meckiff progressed through district cricket ranks at south melbourne cricket club making his first class debut for victoria in 1956 57 after a productive first season meckiff was named in a new look australian team for 1957 58 tour of south africa this was result of a generational change in australian test team after a decline in performances in 1950s shift saw meckiff open bowling in his debut test where he performed strongly to take eight wickets generating his pace from an unusual bent arm action which involved a flick of wrist meckiff reached his peak in second test of 1958 59 season against england at melbourne cricket ground he took 6 38 in second innings as england were dismissed for 87 setting up an australian victory his achievement was engulfed by controversy as english media and former players accused him of throwing australia to victory controversy over meckiff s action persisted as throwing was in spotlight in england where it was regarded as a growing problem issue prompted numerous international discussions and meetings on amending throwing law and interpretation thereof an expected confrontation with english umpires in 1961 was averted when bowler suffered multiple injuries in preceding australian summer and was omitted from team to tour england but meckiff had two strong seasons in domestic cricket that forced australian selectors to recall him for tests against south africa in 1963 64 victorian s recall had occurred despite his being no balled for throwing in two separate sheffield shield matches in previous season in his first over of test meckiff was no balled four times by umpire egar australian captain richie benaud chose to not bowl his paceman again and meckiff retired from all cricket at end of match throwing controversy provoked heavy debate among cricket commentators players and umpires past and present some praised egar s no ball call while others condemned umpire and felt that paceman had bowled in same way as he had always done others felt that meckiff had been set up so that he would be no balled in an execution or sacrifice to prove australia s resolve against throwing early life meckiff was second of three children born to vera and walter meckiff he had an older brother don and a younger sister margaret

made a steady start to his international career with 11 test wickets at an average of 32 09 and 56 runs at 18 66 in entire tour he took 33 first class wickets at 23 09 however there was a hint of controversy that was to end his career six years later a year after series south african test umpire bill marais said he was prepared to no ball meckiff and his teammate jim burke for throwing haigh and frith p 119 there were reports that craig had been tipped off about marais s intentions and therefore operated two bowlers exclusively from end at which marais was not officiating career peak and start of throwing controversy victorian paceman s international career peaked in 1958 59 during english tour of australia he started season with a match for victoria against tourists taking 4 69 and 1 16 in a losing effort his wickets included english test batsmen peter richardson twice arthur milton and raman row test team was now under leadership of benaud craig had been forced to withdraw from cricket due to hepatitis meckiff retained his place in side perry p 210 prior to tests english all rounder trevor bailey privately described meckiff as worst bowler ever to represent australia and felt he posed little threat to visitors haigh p 124 however this proved to be questionable benaud era started well for australia and meckiff with a comfortable eight wicket victory in first test in brisbane paceman took 3 33 and 2 30 removing milton colin cowdrey and captain peter may early on first day to help australia take initiative after tourists had batted first match also marked start of

fixture in front of his home crowd and also marked start of his career long public problem with accusations of throwing match was dominated by victorian and his left arm pace partner davidson pair took 18 of 20 english wickets to fall england s first innings was headlined by davidson s 6 64 meckiff took 3 69 including wicket of england captain may for 113 with a swinging ball which breached batsman s defence and crashed into stumps piesse p 189 this ended a century partnership with cowdrey and triggered a collapse that saw england be dismissed for 259 last six english wickets falling for 49 runs meckiff rated ball as best of his career he made a duck as hosts replied with 308 to take a 49 run lead it was in england s second innings that australia s left arm pacemen were at their most potent apart from one over from benaud pair bowled unchanged to dismiss england for 87 in 32nd over meckiff taking 6 38 whimpress p 69 backed a by a vocal home crowd victorian dismissed opener richardson for three before removing bailey tom graveney and cowdrey in quick succession he followed this by removing english skipper for a second time to leave england at 7 71 this set up a comfortable australian victory as they reached their target of 39 with loss of two wickets australian pace duo were aided by a series of difficult diving catches pollard p 129 pair combined forces when davidson caught may and then graveney in leg trap behind square from bowling of his fellow left armer who called reflex catches absolutely unbelievable meckiff described hometown atmosphere as electrifying and attributed his performance to crowd support match ended on eve of meckiff s 24th birthday but australian celebrations were marred by english journalists who levelled accusations of throwing against him and some of his colleagues evening edition of melbourne herald carried a column by former english spinner johnny wardle accusing meckiff of throwing england out whimpress p 70 wardle s piece was written confrontationally as a series of sentences starting with i accuse this was followed by more anti meckiff comments in english press including one that dubbed bowler greatest ogre of international cricket since larwood evening news proclaimed meckiff s throwing was devastating and star said at least two of his wickets were obtained by deliveries which looked to be thrown former england spinner ian peebles asserted that meckiff and gordon rorke threw greater number of balls they deliver haigh and frith p 120 while former english paceman alf gover claimed that none of left armer s deliveries were legal it was ridiculous that a player of his action should be agent of england s destruction pollard p 181 according to australian writer jack pollard such headlines relegated cold war which usually occupied front pages to interior of english newspapers by contrast to strident condemnation of meckiff in english press australian opinion was mixed former test opener and leading commentator jack fingleton said when he meckiff delivered to bailey his fastest ball looked most suspect and that left armer should have been called for throwing fingleton claimed to know of five former australian test cricketers who felt that meckiff threw but only named 1930s paceman ernie mccormick former australian player tommy andrews claimed if they stop throwing in australia cricket will die former australian captain ian johnson argued that if meckiff were to be cited for an illegal action for jerking his wrist then leading english bowlers such as trueman brian statham and tony lock who played against australia during season should also be sanctioned pollard p 134 whimpress p 72 as with meckiff lock was under scrutiny at time and later tried to change his bowling action but new style coincided with a downturn in results johnson also noted that any successful spinner would be called for throwing if law were enforced strictly because of their flicking of wrist and fingers during delivery of ball as they could not otherwise extract spin whimpress p 73 in 1993 robert coleman historian of victorian cricket association decried anti meckiff campaign as fleet street bleating coleman p 588 and said there have been no more hysterical outbursts on subject of throwing than occurred during england s 1958 59 tour piesse p 190 writing decades after event pollard said meckiff in fact went to crease with a beautifully relaxed approach paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight and then let ball go with a blurred swing of arm that was impossible to follow from 60 yards away even with aid of good binoculars journalists who wrote books about 1958 59 season made thinly veiled references to controversy in names of their work fingleton s account on series was entitled four chukkas to australia while e n wellings labelled his tome ashes thrown away and accused meckiff along with burke rorke and keith slater of throwing for australia in tests haigh and frith p 118 an australian television debate program featured an entire session where english journalists wellings and crawford white discussed throwing issue with former australian test cricketers keith miller and sid barnes in third test at sydney cricket ground meckiff took one wicket bailey in first innings before breaking down with an injury in second this ruled him out of fourth test perry p 243 and he missed a month of cricket before returning for final test in melbourne in mid february where he removed specialist batsmen may and ted dexter on field it had been a successful series for victorian he had taken 17 wickets at 17 17 as australia claimed series 4 0 these efforts placed him top of test bowling averages for series when lindwall was recalled for fourth test in place of injured meckiff he was reported to have said i m last of straight arm bowlers veteran paceman played alongside meckiff in later matches including fifth test meckiff was also prominent in two shield matches against new south wales when both teams were at full strength in first contest he had match figures of 5 129 his victims including test teammates burke o neill and davidson twice but his efforts were unable to prevent defeat in return fixture meckiff took a total of 7 162 five of his victims were australian test batsmen victoria held upper hand and were 45 runs short of victory in second innings when time ran out within wider cricket community there was a steady crescendo of comment condemning prevalence of bowlers with suspect actions prior to alteration of bowling law by imperial cricket conference in 1960 law stated whimpress p 71 reaction by players and officials in contrast to heated debate in media players and administrators refrained from publicly questioning or condemning meckiff neither england captain may nor manager freddie brown raised any concerns about meckiff s action after test however it was later revealed that brown had wanted to lodge an official complaint with australian board of control but may had refused fearing accusations of sour grapes years later richardson and some of his fellow batsmen accused australian fast bowler of throwing them out while england paceman fred trueman said meckiff s action was totally illegal and that he should never have been allowed to play richardson s off spinning teammate jim laker likened meckiff s and burke s arm actions to those of dart throwers benaud said he was completely satisfied that meckiff s delivery was fair and legitimate pollard p 182 while selection panel of don bradman dudley seddon and jack ryder continued to pick paceman implying that they regarded his action as legal whimpress p 74 bill dowling chairman of australian board of control denounced media attention on suspect bowling actions as excessive and magnified out of all proportion haigh p 125 off field throwing controversy was beginning to affect meckiff adversely in his 1961 autobiography prophetically titled thrown out coleman p 591 he said accusations took a deep personal toll on him and his family and prompted him to shun public he became known by derisive nickname chucker and was credited on front cover of his autobiography as ian chucker meckiff meckiff reported that from melbourne test onwards his son was verbally abused by classmates meckiff s parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally he added that doctors believed his anxiety was contributing to stomach ailments at time players were not allowed to talk to media during season and meckiff was upset because he could not rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him he denied ever throwing but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day s play as his body would begin to fall away in delivery stride due to fatigue he had a permanently bent bowling arm he generated his pace from his wrist action and asserted that his thin wrists gave impression that his whole arm was bending subcontinent tour in 1959 60 season started with a test trial between xis of lindwall and benaud meckiff claimed a match total of 4 90 for lindwall s men and was selected for test tour of pakistan and india before team departed meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action which used a rigid left arm during run up haigh p 181 before swinging arm over during delivery stride whimpress p 80 over next two years sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair and said so in public he was not called for throwing in either india or pakistan meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned meckiff was wicketless in australia s win in first test against pakistan on a matting wicket in dacca now in bangladesh in first innings of second test in lahore

seventh to fourth in table and become last qualifier for semi finals they subsequently won their semi final and grand final to secure title coleman p 497 alterations to throwing law in 1960 at a meeting of imperial cricket conference in london cricket s throwing law was changed to forbid straightening of arm at instant of ball s delivery australian board of control were so concerned about controversy and its possible impact on australian game that they sent board chairman dowling and board member sir donald bradman to meeting rather than customary britain based representative coleman p 590 despite agreed change in law because of conflicting interpretations in different countries a compromise was agreed which specified an amnesty during forthcoming 1961 australian tour to england it was agreed that on tour umpires would privately report any concerns about bowling actions to teams concerned for them to remedy after tour umpires would call bowlers whenever they felt new law to have been breached whimpress pp 73 75 on his return to australia dowling angrily accused english cricket community of pre judging meckiff dowling said strident press attacks on meckiff had amounted to intimidation of umpires through media pollard p 143 and claimed that some administrators had privately told him that australian paceman would be called if he toured england president of marylebone cricket club sir hubert ashton said he hoped australia would not choose meckiff for their 1961 tour tied test against west indies 1960 61 victorian was not called during 1960 61 australian season but

innings meckiff broke down after only four overs but came out to bat on 14 december late in australia s climactic run chase for which he was often remembered at end of a dramatic final day australia needed seven runs from final over for victory and they had three wickets in hand home side had seemed destined for a win after davidson and benaud had fought back with a century stand for seventh wicket in final session both were well set and had passed 50 but tourists halted australia s momentum by running out davidson with a direct hit from last ball of previous over fiddian p 90 benaud was caught behind on second ball of final over attempting a hook and meckiff came to crease to join wally grout five runs were needed from six balls with two wickets in hand injured paceman blocked first

close to fence it stopped rolling a metre short on slow outfield haigh p 147 grout attempted a third run which would have won match but an accurate long throw saw him run out last man lindsay kline came in for final two balls with scores level and australian pair agreed to run under all circumstances meckiff backed up significantly in anticipation of a quick single and set off for winning run

form saved australian selectors difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential run in with umpires in england critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959 60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness no balled in sheffield shield 1962 63 throwing controversy subsided during 1961 english season and 1961 62 australian season was purely domestic with no touring international teams as a result there were no pressing diplomacy imperatives involving throwing meckiff was victoria s leading bowler with 28 wickets at 27 14 in eight matches and was not called his best performance was 5 53 in first innings of match against queensland at mcg which ended in defeat for home team despite healthy results for season overall

over years i have always accepted umpire s decision whimpress p 88 australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent and one of his predecessors lindsay hassett believed meckiff should have been

delivery was unfair gibbs p 23 for his part meckiff said game is bigger than individual and he backed benaud s decision because doing otherwise could only have added fuel to controversy retired test umpires col hoy and les townsend were watching at ground when meckiff was called day after incident both asserted that they would not have no balled paceman hoy said he had never had any problem with bowler s action during matches in which he officiated he described meckiff s action as slightly different but attributed this to an accentuated wrist action used in an attempt to get more life out of dead pitches rather than his elbow townsend watched paceman through binoculars and deemed all of his 12 deliveries to be identical townsend regarded meckiff s arm action as peculiar but felt he did not throw whimpress p 89 former test spinners ian johnson and doug ring said meckiff s action was fair after his retirement meckiff agreed to put his name to a series of ghost written articles about no ball incident haigh p 187 he said that egar s calls hit him like a dagger in back but described umpire as a fair and just man who acted according to his convictions allegations of a conspiracy sections of cricket community believed meckiff was no balled to prove that australia was serious about dealing with wave of complaints regarding suspected throwing in 1950s and 1960s leading cricket historian david frith wrote meckiff was a popular australian and won much sympathy among those who believed him innocent or to have been victimised in a clean up campaign a dinner hosted by don bradman at his adelaide home in january 1963 for visiting state captains was later cited to suggest that meckiff may have been a sacrificial offering at dinner attended by bill lawry of victoria barry shepherd ken mackay and benaud whimpress p 90 haigh p 182 bradman had showed frame by frame slow motion film of meckiff and other suspect australian bowlers which purportedly depicted incriminating actions this indicated bradman s doubts over meckiff s legitimacy yet bradman was one of selectors who agreed to bowler s inclusion in brisbane test team whimpress p 91 many members of australian

watched meckiff s performance against western australia which prompted his test selection miller felt that if selectors deemed bowler illegitimate then they should not have allowed him to be executed by umpires jack pollard said there is little doubt meckiff was sacrificed to end long running controversy and way it was done irked many cricket lovers cricketer turned journalist dick whitington asserted that benaud was aware his fast bowler had been set up claiming that australian captain knew of bradman s views on meckiff s action whitington further cited fact that egar and bradman had travelled from adelaide to brisbane test together as evidence of a plot others saw bradman s tea time conversation with benaud after no balling as proof of a conspiracy haigh p 188 benaud repudiated allegations claiming he was involved in a set up former australian captain hassett hinted at a conspiracy when he stated that as selectors must have considered meckiff to be legitimate then if selectors are right egar is wrong and if he is incapable of interpreting laws correctly he should not stand in first class cricket on other hand if selectors as a body threw meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by opinion of a single umpire they are very much guilty of passing buck and of exposing both bowler and umpire to extreme embarrassment records of australian board of control attest to board member clem jones s protestations against meckiff s inclusion when selectors proposed team list was submitted for approval jones cited bowler s questionable action but chairman ewart macmillan rejected his objection as unconstitutional two other board members attempted to overrule chairman but their motion was defeated more than 40 years after meckiff incident jones was sure bowler s fate had been predetermined he said they d decided to do it a week before game so poor bloke had no hope i was chairman of umpires selection committee jones remained convinced of bradman s intention to have meckiff called for throwing something bradman flatly denied haigh and frith p 124 gibbs remains suspicious of motives for selecting meckiff he pointed out that although pitch was conducive to spin bowling australia chose five specialist batsmen two spinners and three fast bowlers gibbs speculated that selection of an extra fast bowler most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen instead of another batsman betrayed fears that meckiff would be unable to complete match gibbs pp 22 24 alan connolly remained adamant that his teammate s action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy saying i wasn t amazed by egar s call there was a good reason for that which i can t disclose and won t disclose tom who made his test debut for australia in meckiff s last

booth peter burge and one or two others as really nature s gentlemen and said his exit was one of saddest days of lawry s life lawry credited his fellow victorian for being dignified despite torment
