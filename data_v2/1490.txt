hydnellum is a genus of tooth fungi in family bankeraceae order thelephorales widely distributed in northern hemisphere genus contains around 40 species fruitbodies of its members grow by slowly enveloping nearby bits of grass and vegetation there is great variability in form of hydnellum fruitbodies which are greatly influenced by environmental conditions such as rainfall and humidity drying winds and temperature they are too tough and woody to eat comfortably several species have become focus of increasing conservation concern following widespread declines in abundance hydnellum species produce pigments that have been used to dye textiles several chemical compounds some with unique biological activity have been isolated and identified from genus one of better known species is unusual pinkish white hydnellum peckii also known as strawberries and cream or as bleeding tooth fungus due to red droplets that appear on pinkish or whitish fruitbodies another species h suaveolens has a strong odor of anise or peppermint taxonomy hydnellum was circumscribed by finnish mycologist petter adolf karsten in 1879 with what was then known as hydnum suaveolens as type species before then fungi with spines hydnoid fungi had been grouped in hydnum by elias fries in his 1821 work systema mycologicum harrison 1961 p 16 karsten defined hydnellum as having fruitbodies with a corky or leathery tough cap and a centrally attached stipe synonyms of hydnellum include karsten 1881 and joseph schroter 1888 hydnellum is classified in family bankeraceae which was circumscribed by marinus anton donk in 1961 genus was not in donk s original family concept which included only bankera and phellodon genera whose species produce hyaline translucent and ornamented spores donk left hydnellum in tribe of family thelephoraceae along with sarcodon and in 1981 however walter julich emended donk s concept of bankeraceae adding hydnoid genera that produced brown lobed spores hydnellum and sarcodon stalpers 1993 p 22 name originates from greek word hydnum meaning spongy plant or fungus british mycological society in their recommended list of common names for fungi in united kingdom name hydnellum fungi in form descriptor word plus tooth such as gold tooth h auratile zoned tooth h concrescens and velvet tooth h spongiosipes phylogeny phylogenetic studies have shown that in its current circumscription genus hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to white spored genera bankera and phellodon currently grouped together in family bankeraceae analyses of its region by parfitt and colleagues and ainsworth and colleagues have further revealed multiple cryptic lineages within genus most of cryptic species belong to h concrescens h scrobiculatum species complex resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names at moment number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds number of described taxa in genus making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in future morphology thumb right caps of some hydnellum species h concrescens pictured can fuse together during growth hydnellum fruitbodies have caps and stipes often with growth forms that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce forming intricately intertwined caps and partially fused stipes flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh but becomes hard and woody when dry zones in flesh reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent extending down length of stipe fruitbodies may display a variety of colors from white to yellow olive green shades of orange light brown or dark brown in age spores of hydnellum are almost spherical to oblong and tuberculate and are brown in mass basidia spore bearing cells are narrowly club shaped and usually four spored there are no cystidia in hydnellum three types of hyphae are found in flesh of hydnellum generative hyphae thin walled not inflated skeletal hyphae thick walled and narrow and thin walled like hyphae which stain with methyl blue stalpers 1997 p 9 thumb left spines of h ferrugineum in conditions of high humidity several species can form striking colored drops on actively growing caps red drops in h peckii h diabolus h ferrugineum and h cruentum yellow drops in h caeruleum and coffee colored drops in h mirabile harrison 1961 p 15 common names of h peckii reflect its appearance strawberries and cream and bleeding tooth fungus some hydnellum species have a mealy odor e g h mirabile and h similar to freshly ground flour h zonatum smells like while h suaveolens has a sweet odor resembling anise or peppermint all are too tough and woody to be edible and many have an acrid taste anyway differences between hydnellum species tend to be more distinguishable in younger specimens fruitbody development is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as levels of rainfall drying winds and temperature blue tooth h caeruleum for example develops a deeper blue color when it grows during cooler autumn weather optimal growth occurs during periods of frequent light rains and high humidity if habitat dries out growth will stop but may resume after further precipitation this intermittent growth affects fruitbodies of different species to variable extents leading to large variations in form surface texture and color morphological variability of fruitbodies and dependence of their appearance upon environmental conditions has made hydnellum a difficult group to study canadian mycologist kenneth a harrison who described several new species from north america noted t he remarkable longevity of individual of many species and changes in appearance that occur during long period of their development have confused all workers studying this group harrison 1961 p 12 for example h aurantiacum initially white becomes in turn shades of orange rusty brown and brownish black its fruitbody initially has a cushion like shape with a lumpy surface later becoming flattened to funnel shaped with a smooth to corrugated surface texture harrison 1961 p 13 caps form from top of short stipe by growth and expansion of a blunt margin and later as a thickening of upper surface spines start to form when cap hangs over stipe slightly they are white in many species but become brown in maturity as brown colored spores accumulate on surface harrison 1961 p 14 habitat and distribution hydnellum fungi are mycorrhizal and are usually found in coniferous and mixed woods favored tree hosts include members of fagaceae and pinaceae stalpers 1997 p 34 genus is widely distributed in northern hemisphere particularly europe and north america but some species are also found in tropical asia harrison identified a dozen new species from north america in 1960s harrison 1961 rudolph arnold maas geesteranus recognized 16 european species in his 1975 treatment of genus to which h dianthifolium has been recently added by loizides and colleagues some hydnellum species including h ferrugineum and h scleropodium form a tough mat of mycelia in humus and upper soil of pine forests this mycelial mat grows larger with old trees and can cover an area of several square meters these areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote vigorous growth of mosses reindeer lichens often occur in center of large mats presence of fungus changes nature of soil resulting in a thinner humus layer decreased groundwater penetration decreased soil ph and increases in level of root respiration as well as quantity of roots fungus also decreases organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations soil with mycelium becomes more than surrounding soil conservation thumb left hydnellum ferrugineum is of conservation concern in europe some hydnellum species have been shown to be in decline in europe including czech republic netherlands norway and scotland in united kingdom several are listed in biodiversity action plan for hydnoid fungi h aurantiacum is classified as critically endangered h caeruleum h ferrugineum are listed as endangered while h concrescens h spongiosipes h peckii and h scrobiculatum are considered vulnerable h ferrugineum and h peckii are sensitive to increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear cutting a forestry practice used in some areas of europe conservation efforts for hydnellum are hindered by fact that some species are difficult to discriminate in field making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status techniques based on species specific pcr primers and dna extraction from soil have been developed to detect mycelia of various hydnellum species without having to rely on presence of fruitbodies which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below ground ecology similar techniques have been used to show that in case of h aurantiacum and h caeruleum fungus can persist below ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies bioactive compounds thumb right 250px alt 2 5 3 6 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 4 benzoquinone structural formula of anticoagulant and antibacterial compound atromentin found in h peckii several chemical compounds some with unique biological activity have been isolated and identified from hydnellum species for example hydnellum peckii contains atromentin a pigment with anticoagulant properties similar to heparin atromentin also possesses antibacterial activity inhibiting enzyme enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase essential for biosynthesis of fatty acids in bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae some species are used as dyes hydnellum caeruleum used in north america and scandinavia to dye silk and wool produces a range of colors including tan blue and forest green depending on mordant that is used hydnellum peckii produces gray brown and olive colors and are pigments responsible for coloration of h ferrugineum and h zonatum is a yellow pigment found in h geogenium thelephoric acid is present in several hydnellum species stalpers 1997 p 7 this compound derived metabolically from shikimic acid pathway inhibits enzyme prolyl which is involved in deteriorating certain that are believed to contribute to memory and learning hydnellum caeruleum and h concrescens have several para terphenyl derivatives named thelephantins specifically variants thelephantins i n some of which can inhibit enzyme alpha compounds a and b are found in h suaveolens and hydnellum chemicals responsible for fragrant anise like aroma of h suaveolens have been identified as and para species karsten s original 1879
