senior hansell rose to cadet captain and developed a reputation as a martinet his harshness with corps of cadets combined with an excessive number of demerits acquired while school was temporarily

percent of units and 5 5 percent of personnel ultimately mobilized griffith quest p 78 and it accurately predicted time frame when invasion of europe by allies would take place griffith quest p 77 hansell s contribution to plan was based on a serious flaw however as had most observers hansell assumed that nazi economy was working at maximum capacity when in fact it was still at 1938 levels of production an error that led to an underestimation of numbers of sorties bomb tonnage and time required for bombing to have a decisive effect however a more significant error in planning omission of long range fighter escorts for bombers seriously affected strategic bombing campaign that later took place hansell deeply regretted omission but noted that it reflected best available information at time on fighter aircraft capabilities which was that any means then available to extend range would also seriously degrade a fighter s air combat performance hansell wrote failure to see this issue through proved one of air corps tactical school s major shortcomings hansell air plan that defeated germany p 22 a lack of knowledge about capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system also contributed to over reliance on self defense capabilities of bombers greer development of air doctrine in army air arm pp 63 65 however hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in long run greer p 60 he surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly inhibiting if not entirely suppressing concepts that proved decisive in world war ii and essential to creation of united states air force tate army and its air corps p 163 world war ii service

formation detailed mission standard operating procedures and all aircraft bombing in unison with lead bomber each designed to improve bombing accuracy griffith quest pp 108 109 hansell recognized most serious flaws in daylight precision bombardment theory that radar early warning and lack of long range escort fighters made deep penetration raids by massed bombers too costly to achieve strategic goals until a means of air superiority was attained and that german industry rather than being fragile and fixed proved to be resilient and mobile miller masters of air pp 40 and 144 these factors later influenced his planning of similar daylight raids against japan on march 23 1943 he headed up a committee of usaaf and raf commanders to draw up a plan for combined bomber offensive cbo hansell air plan that defeated hitler p 157 despite fact that it altered target system priorities outlined in awpd 42 and changed overall goal of offensive from knocking germany out of war using airpower to one of preparing for invasion of europe hansell approved designation of german aircraft industry as its most important target and destruction of german luftwaffe as its top priority hansell wrote final draft of cbo plan himself although hansell did not personally participate in later strategic bombing operations against germany he had been instrumental in setting in motion plans and policies that led to near total destruction of german war industry griffith quest p 117 118 he continued to fly combat missions at same rate as his group commanders with his final mission to antwerp on may 4

hansell successfully argued that an invasion should only be a contingency if bombing and a sea blockade of japan failed to compel a surrender griffith quest p 134 hansell accompanied president roosevelt and joint chiefs aboard to sextant conference in november then was appointed deputy chief of air staff in december working directly with arnold his main responsibility was developing

have temperament to be a combat commander aware of arnold s legendary impatience deputy aaf commander general barney giles who was doubtful that hansell could accomplish task given him setting up an effective air campaign in a brief period using an untried aircraft obtained a commitment from arnold that he would not relieve hansell in only a few months griffith quest p 155 however hansell s tenure was threatened from start because his replacement on air staff major general lauris norstad did not support concept of daylight precision bombing craven and cate pacific matterhorn to nagaski june 1944 to august 1945 p 104 instead advocating massive destruction of japanese cities by firebombing a tactic that had been promoted in aaf planning circles as early as november 1943 fire raids on

270 xxi bomber command arrived on saipan on october 12 1944 and from start hansell was beset by a host of serious command problems worst of which were continued teething problems with b 29 tardy delivery of aircraft aircrews untrained in high altitude formation flying primitive airfield conditions lack of an air service command for logistical support no repair depots a total absence of target intelligence stubborn internal resistance to daylight operations by his sole combat wing strong resistance by japanese during seizure of marianas and subsequent low construction priorities assigned by

bomber command who lobbied for his removal and hansell s inferiority in rank in dealing with other aaf commanders in theater griffith quest p 160 162 190 hansell s difficulties were exacerbated by petty jurisdictional resistance from army commander of pacific ocean area in hawaii general robert c richardson jr and by low priorities assigned to buildup of hansell s facilities in marianas by nimitz s staff in favor of roads and naval installations despite xxi bc being only force on islands conducting continuous combat operations craven and cate vol 5 pp 533 534 and 542 furthermore hansell

factored into his relief main reasons were hansell s persistence in daylight precision attacks reluctance to night firebombing norstad s view that hansell was an impediment to instituting incendiary

strategy especially taking into account deep and pervasive revulsion among american people against strategic bombing of all sorts that was a consequence hansell strategic air war against germany and japan a memoir p 270 historian and hansell biographer dr charles griffith concluded that hansell sacrificed his command of b 29 force and his later career on principle adhering to idea that precision rather than area bombing was not only more moral but more effective as a strategy griffith quest pp 193 and 199 his dismissal griffith argues was a pivotal event in u s airpower doctrine as air force moved toward a strategy of bombing civilian populations griffith quest p 204 which led to an increasing dependence on more potentially devastating inflexible and doctrine of nuclear warfare that lasted for decades conrad crane took a somewhat different stance arguing that despite firebombing campaign in japan american air commanders throughout world war ii and thereafter placed an emphasis on precision bombing and avoiding civilian casualties use of precision guided weapons in gulf war and beyond he wrote demonstrated continued adherence to precision bombing doctrine and significant progress toward ideal first envisioned by hansell and other air corps tactical school theorists crane p 157 hansell lectured on theory of precision air attack throughout his life particularly at

strategic air war against germany and japan a memoir 1986 hansell continued to study modern weapons systems becoming an advocate of strategic defense initiative and b 2 spirit bomber however his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy griffith quest p 205 retirement
