dried grapes of varieties xynisteri and mavro while often a fortified wine through its production method it often reaches high alcohol levels around 15 already before fortification it represents an ancient wine style documented in cyprus back to 800 bc and has distinction of being world s oldest named wine still in production with name commandaria dating back to crusades in 12th century history wine has a long history said to date back to time of ancient greeks where it was a popular drink at festivals a dried grape wine from cyprus was first known to be described in 800 bc by greek poet hesiod and was known by much later as cypriot manna thumb right commandaria by keo during crusades commandaria was served at 12th century wedding of king richard lionheart to berengaria of navarre in town of limassol it was during wedding that king richard pronounced commandaria wine of kings and king of wines near end of century he sold island to knights templar who then sold it to guy de lusignan but kept a large feudal estate at close to limassol to themselves this estate was referred to as la grande commanderie word commanderie referred to military headquarters whilst grande helped distinguish it from two smaller such command posts on island one close to paphos phoenix and another near kyrenia this area under control of knights templar and subsequently knights hospitaller became known as commandaria when knights began producing large quantities of wine for export to europe s royal courts and for supplying pilgrims en route to holy lands wine assumed name of region thus it has

invaded island just to acquire commandaria also that grapes used to make this wine were same grapes exported to portugal that eventually became famous as source of port wine production thumb right 150px mavro grapes used in production of commandaria commandaria is made exclusively from two types of indigenous cyprus grapes xynisteri and mavro grapes are left to overripe on vine and when sugar content reaches acceptable levels corresponding to high must weight they are harvested more specifically xynisteri is picked when at around 12 degrees baume degbe and mavro at 15 16 degbe grapes are then laid out in sun to further increase sugar density through evaporation when must weight reaches 19 to 23 degbe juice is extracted thorough crushing and pressing fermentation takes place in reservoirs and will arrest naturally due to high levels of alcohol achieved at around 15 above process has to take place within confines of 14 designated villages that lie in commandaria region see below commandaria by law is aged for at least four years in oak barrels but this can take place outside above designated area within cyprus under strict control and under conditions laid down in cypriot legislation once fermentation has been completed at a minimum alcohol level of 10 which is often exceeded alcoholic strength of commandaria may be increased by addition of pure 95 grape alcohol or a wine distillate of at least 70 alcohol however after this addition wine s actual alcohol content may not exceed 20 while its total potential alcohol including its sugar content must be at least 22 5 thus commandaria may be a fortified wine but fortification is not mandatory thumb left 150px xynisteri grapes origins of production method are not definite in his poem works and days written in 7th century bc hesiod writes pliny elder describes similar methods employed by greeks for making a sweet wines in his account samuel baker describes production in 1879 he claims that evolution of this method was more out of necessity than choice commandaria is produced both by large wine industries keo and and by small local producers of commandaria appellation zone see below data recorded by samuel baker in his book cyprus how i saw it in 1879 reveal that in late 19th century cyprus had an annual production of about 300 000 okes equivalent to about 385 000 litres data reflects only duty paid production of this cyprus exported 180 103 okes from limassol port of which vast majority went to austria 155 000 okes valued at 075 official figures released by cyprus vines products
