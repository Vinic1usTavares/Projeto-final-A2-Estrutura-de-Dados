battle of arawe also known as operation 2011 p 2009 p 316 was fought between allied and japanese forces during new britain campaign of world war ii battle formed part of allied operation cartwheel and had objective of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at cape gloucester in late december 1943 japanese military was expecting an allied offensive in western new britain and was reinforcing region at time of allied landing in arawe area on 15 december 1943 allies secured arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with outnumbered japanese force initial allied goals for landing at arawe included securing a base for american pt boats and diverting japanese forces away from cape gloucester pt boat base was subsequently deemed unnecessary and was never built only a small japanese force was stationed at arawe at time although reinforcements were en route main allied landing on 15 december was successful despite a failed subsidiary landing and problems coordinating landing craft american forces quickly secured a beachhead and dug in japanese air units made large scale raids against arawe area in days after landing and in late december imperial japanese army ija troops unsuccessfully counterattacked american force in mid january 1944 american force reinforced with additional infantry and tanks launched a brief offensive that pushed japanese back japanese units at arawe withdrew from area towards end of february as part of a general retreat from western new britain there is no consensus among historians on whether allied offensive at arawe was necessary while some have argued that landing served as a useful diversion ahead of cape gloucester operation others believe that entire campaign in western new britain was unnecessary and that force employed at arawe could have been better used elsewhere background military situation in july 1942 u s joint chiefs of staff directed that main objective of allied forces in south pacific and southwest pacific area commands was to capture major japanese base at rabaul on eastern tip of new britain from august 1942 u s and australian forces conducted a series of offensives in new guinea and solomon islands with goals of eliminating japanese positions in region and establishing air bases close to rabaul japanese forces in area mounted a strong resistance but were unable to stop allied advance coakley 1989 pp 504 507 in june 1943 allies launched a major offensive designated operation cartwheel to capture rabaul during next five months australian and u s forces under overall command of general douglas macarthur advanced along north coast of eastern new guinea capturing town of lae and huon peninsula u s forces under command of admiral william halsey jr simultaneously advanced through solomon islands from guadalcanal and established an air base at bougainville in november coakley 1989 pp 510 511 in june joint chiefs of staff decided that it was unnecessary to capture rabaul as japanese base there could be neutralized by blockade and aerial bombardment macarthur initially opposed this change in plans but it was endorsed by british and united states combined chiefs of staff during quebec conference in august miller 1959 pp 224 225 thumb 300px alt a map of eastern new guinea bismarck archipelago and solomon islands with towns and elevations marked area in which operation cartwheel took place japanese imperial general headquarters assessed strategic situation in southwest pacific in late september 1943 and concluded that allies would attempt to break through northern solomon islands and bismarck archipelago in coming months en route to japan s inner perimeter in western and central pacific accordingly reinforcements were dispatched to strategic locations in area in an attempt to slow allied advance strong forces were retained at rabaul however as it was believed that allies would attempt to capture town at time japanese positions in western new britain were limited to airfields at cape gloucester on island s western tip and several small way stations which provided small boats travelling between rabaul and new guinea with shelter from allied aerial attacks shaw and kane 1963 pp 324 325 on 22 september 1943 macarthur s general headquarters ghq directed lieutenant general walter krueger s alamo force to secure western new britain and surrounding islands this operation had two goals first of which was to establish air and pt boat bases to attack japanese forces at rabaul second objective was to secure vitiaz and dampier straits between new guinea and new britain so that convoys could safely pass through them en route to conduct further landings along new guinea s north coast and beyond to this end ghq directed that both cape gloucester and gasmata on new britain s south coast be captured this offensive was code named operation dexterity miller 1959 pp 272 273 1st marine division was selected for cape gloucester operation and heavily reinforced 126th regimental combat team from 32nd infantry division was to attack gasmata senior allied commanders disagreed over whether it was necessary to land forces in western new britain lieutenant general george kenney commander of allied air forces in southwest pacific opposed landings arguing that his forces did not need air fields at cape gloucester as existing bases in new guinea and surrounding islands were adequate to support planned landings in region vice admiral arthur s carpender commander of both 7th fleet and allied naval forces southwest pacific area as well as rear admiral daniel e barbey commander of task force 76 tf 76 supported occupying cape gloucester to secure both sides of straits but opposed landing at gasmata as it was too close to japanese air bases at rabaul gasmata operation was cancelled in early november in response to concerns raised by kenney and navy as well as intelligence reports that japanese had reinforced their garrison there miller 1959 pp 273 274 on 21 november a conference between ghq kenney carpender and barbey was held in brisbane at which it was decided to land a small force in arawe area miller 1959 p 274 this operation had three goals to divert japanese attention from cape gloucester to provide a base for pt boats and to establish a defensive perimeter and make contact with marines once they landed 2007 p 117 it was intended that pt boats operating from arawe would disrupt japanese barge traffic along southern shore of new britain and protect allied naval forces at cape gloucester from attack morison 2001 p 372 geography thumb 300px alt a terrain map of arawe area as described in article s text arawe area arawe area lies on south coast of new britain about from island s western tip its main geographical feature is cape merkus which ends in l shaped arawe peninsula several small islands called arawe islands lie to southwest of cape rottman 2002 p 186 in late 1943 arawe peninsula was covered by coconut trees which formed part of amalut plantation terrain inland from peninsula and on its offshore islands was swampy most of shoreline in area has limestone cliffs there was a small unused airfield east of neck of arawe peninsula and a coastal trail leading east from cape merkus to pulie river where it split into tracks running inland and along coast terrain to west of peninsula was a trackless region of swamp and jungle which was very difficult for troops to move through shaw and kane 1963 p 334 several of beaches in arawe area were suitable for landing craft best were house fireman on peninsula s west coast and one near village of umtingalu to east of peninsula s base miller 1959 p 283 prelude planning alamo force was responsible for coordinating plans for invasion of western new britain arawe landing was scheduled for 15 december as this was earliest date by which air bases around nadzab in new guinea which were needed to support landing could be made operational this date also gave landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals miller 1959 pp 274 275 as arawe was believed to be only weakly defended krueger decided to use a smaller force than one which had been intended for landing at gasmata this force designated director task force was concentrated at goodenough island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations logistical plans called for assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat after landing holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti aircraft ammunition for which a 10 day supply was thought necessary miller 1959 p 279 assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo shaw and kane 1963 p 335 commander of pt boat force in southwest pacific commander morton c mumma opposed building extensive pt boat facilities at arawe as he had sufficient bases and japanese barges normally sailed along north coast of new britain mumma took his concerns to carpender and barbey who eventually agreed that he would not be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary instead he assigned six boats stationed at dreger harbor in new guinea and kiriwina island to operate along south coast of new britain east of arawe each night and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at arawe director task force s commander brigadier general julian w cunningham issued orders for landing on 4 december he directed that task force would initially capture arawe peninsula and its surrounding islands and establish an outpost on trail leading to pulie river main body of director task force was to land at house fireman beach on arawe peninsula at about dawn two troop sized forces would conduct separate operations about an hour before main landing one troop was to capture island to peninsula s south as it was believed that japanese had established a radio station and a defensive position there which commanded entrance to arawe harbor other troop was to land at umtingalu and establish a blocking position on coastal trail east of peninsula once beachhead was secure amphibious patrols would be conducted to west of peninsula in an attempt to make contact with marines at cape gloucester shaw and kane 1963 pp 334 335 u s navy personnel on planning staff were concerned about these subsidiary landings as a night time landing conducted at lae in september had

november all elements of regiment were ashore at goodenough by 2 december powell 2006 p 66 a full scale rehearsal of landing was held at island on 8 december this revealed problems with coordinating waves of boats and demonstrated that some of force s officers were insufficiently trained in amphibious warfare there was insufficient time for further training to rectify these problems however powell 2006 p 67 at goodenough troopers of 112th cavalry were issued with several types of infantry weapons with which they had not previously been equipped each of regiment s rifle squads received a

worthwhile for allies official history of usmc in world war ii stated that presence of two experienced japanese battalions at arawe made 1st marine division s task at cape gloucester easier however samuel eliot morison wrote in his history of united states naval operations in world war ii that arawe was of small value as allies never used it as a naval base and garrison stationed in area after landings would have been better employed elsewhere u s army s official history concluded that in retrospect landings at arawe and cape gloucester were probably not essential to reduction of rabaul or approach to philippines though offensive in western new britain had some benefits and was not excessively high in casualties miller 1959 pp 294 295 references notes citations bibliography external
