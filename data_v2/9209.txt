india karan johar explained that he harboured intentions of remaking original agneepath ever since film released in 1990 though film had received critical acclaim over years its commercial failure had devastated his father producer yash johar idea of a possible remake materialised on sets of johar s directorial my name is khan in which karan malhotra was an assistant director johar told malhotra of his desire to remake original film and asked him to revisit it again on not directing film himself johar commented i am happy directing films on love romance and drama that s what i do best i don t think i will be good at an action film so i am not taking reins of film in my hand however johar maintained that new film would belong to a different milieu as compared to original he stated we are adapting film from original but ours would be a new age version that would fit in well with today s time we really hope that we are able to do justice to original and make remake exciting for today s generation in an interview with filmfare he added that protagonist of film would be more of an underdog while antagonist would be more flamboyant and menacing than older version several changes were made to story line of original film including omission of certain characters and addition of new ones characters of krishnan iyer ma played by mithun chakraborty and nurse mary matthew played by madhavi were done away with and new characters such as rauf lala and kaali gawde were introduced in screenplay moreover characterisation of vijay chauhan was changed unlike original which was inspired by al pacino s role in scarface 1983 in an interview with calcutta telegraph director karan malhotra explained adaptation by saying similarity between original and this film lies only in fact that it is a revenge film a son seeking revenge for his father s death unlike mr amitabh bachchan s film my film starts and ends in mandwa and is primarily about conflict between mother and son it s a completely new film with a lot of new characters he additionally termed agneepath to be a crazily dramatic masala bollywood film casting thumb left 350px principal cast clockwise hrithik roshan rishi kapoor priyanka chopra and sanjay dutt while media reports initially suggested that abhishek bachchan was being considered to portray role of vijay chauhan director karan malhotra approached hrithik roshan for role roshan however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by amitabh bachchan and agreed to star in film only after months of deliberation he said script had so much passion that i felt very emotional and i made up my mind to do it on casting hrithik malhotra explained hrithik has charm of a boy and attitude of a man also he has a certain vulnerability which i was looking in my characterisation of vijay chauhan while explaining character of vijay chauhan malhotra added nobody can play vijay way amitabh bachchan did and i would have wanted my vijay to be subtle even if it wasn t hrithik i wanted negative characters in my film to be bigger this made hrithik s victory seem bigger in preparation for film roshan did not look up bachchan s performance in original for inspiration as he considered his role to be completely different roshan however faced several difficulties while filming he suffered from a severe back injury which caused him considerable pain throughout shooting schedule in an interview with filmfare he quoted agneepath is hardest i ve ever worked in my life i didn t know what film had in store for me i ve never been so tired in my life i have exhausted my body completely actor rishi kapoor was subsequently cast as rauf lala an underworld don kapoor who had never played a completely negative character in his entire career was initially hesitant to sign film in an interview with daily news and analysis he stated that when malhotra had offered him role he considered it to be a joke and thought that he would be reason for film s failure kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin so that he could comfortably fit into muslim character of lala who wears kohl in his eyes a cap and is dressed in traditional kurta pajamas while shooting for action sequences kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co star hrithik roshan for his professionalism for role of kancha antagonist sanjay dutt was cast according to malhotra script of agneepath demanded that villain be more powerful than hero and due to dutt s bulky frame he was considered perfect for role character of kancha demanded that dutt go bald but due to a prior commitment to film son of sardar which was being shot simultaneously he could not do so for sake of continuity therefore hollywood make up artist robin slater created a bald look for dutt with use of prosthetics however due to summer heat in diu make up would eventually drip down dutt s face which impelled him to finally shave his head director malhotra admitted to being inspired by marlon brando s bald look in film apocalypse now 1979 while designing dutt s character dutt explained his look by saying kancha is suffering from an ailment that leaves him hairless i shaved my head for role not once but twice and eye brows and eye lashes have been digitally removed furthermore dutt worked out in gym twice a day in order to bulk up for role during pre production media reports suggested that several actresses including genelia d souza priyanka chopra and kareena kapoor were being considered for role of kaali gawde however chopra was approached over others who agreed to do film instantly while initial reports suggested that chopra would be playing role of a sex worker in film they were later denied as rumours in an interview with rediff com she clarified that she was playing a prostitute s daughter on chopra s character malhotra commented despite being a male dominated film part played by priyanka is very prominent it isn t that of a simple or ordinary lover she is there for vijay unconditionally and without any expectations with all dangerous people around her she is like this pretty flower standing there with a smile on her face in preparation for her role chopra wanted to visit a brothel but malhotra insisted that she doesn t for safety reasons for supporting roles zarina wahab was cast as suhasini chauhan vijay s mother a role originally played by rohini hattangadi wahab agreed to do film due to her close association with producer johar for role of shiksha chauhan newcomer kanika was auditioned and cast among 6500 girls in order to feature an item number in film producer johar wanted to sign kareena kapoor who refused offer and katrina kaif was eventually contracted it was later told that katrina did not charge any money for song filming for song was demanding on kaif as she ended up with cuts and blisters on her feet due to long stretched out schedules filming principal photography of agneepath took place in union territory of diu which was used to double as village of mandwa johar had to complete several formalities before shooting could begin due to sensitive nature of territory director malhotra however did not shoot in port of mandwa itself as it was too congested while shooting for film in mumbai a picture of hrithik roshan filming a dahi handi sequence was leaked to media worried over this johar increased security on sets and banned use of cell phones additionally priyanka chopra faced difficulties in allocating dates to shoot for film as she was simultaneously shooting for anurag basu s barfi according to malhotra most of action stunts in film were shot by roshan and dutt themselves while body doubles were used to film a few scenes several accidents took place during filming of agneepath priyanka chopra s lehenga caught fire while shooting for an elaborate ganpati festival song hrithik roshan too scalded his hands while shooting for same scene roshan also suffered from an eye injury during shoot of a song when holi colours were flung into his eyes by some junior artists in october roshan suffered from a major back injury while lifting a man weighing 110 kilograms which was a part of an elaborate action sequence shooting was stalled for some time following incident while roshan recuperated in a hospital while ravi k chandran was assigned as cinematographer of agneepath he opted out of film after filming certain portions for unknown reasons kiran deohans was later contracted to replace him sabu cyril was contracted as production designer for film along with a team of 200 people he explained creation of kancha s den by saying that he built a like structure with tantric paintings on walls resembling an old fort built by portuguese who had historically occupied diu vijay s home on other hand was a small sack like thing on terrace of a which was built on open ground with a hundred houses cyril added we wanted a tree to be at edge of a hillside protruding out due to erosion with not enough soil we made this banyan tree with fibre as we wanted it to have a particular look this tree forms a visual

yet entertaining dwells on strong emotions and aggressive and forceful action yet is dissimilar from original it is a fitting tribute to masterwork subhash k jha of ians gave it 4 out of 5 stars while commenting every component of film falls into place with a resounding thump agneepath is brilliant in its brutality it s a riveting and hectic homage to spirit of cinema when revenge reigned supreme and content was king this new agneepath takes us back to era when there was no computer or cellphones and communication with audience was immediate and electrifying kaveree bamzai of india today rated film 4 out of 5 noting melodramatic choir inducing sentiment ecstatic agneepath is that rare mainstream movie written well aniruddha guha of daily news and analysis gave film 3 5 out of 5 reviewing an adaptation rather than a remake film assumes a life of its own once central plot has been established film then charts a journey of his own dasgupta of ndtv gave it 3 5 out of 5 stating watch this film because this one is unadulterated bollywood entertainment daily bhaskar gave film 3 5 out of 5 stars while adding on whole agneepath totally rests on star power which will lure cine goers to halls but how far will it impress them remains to be seen ghosh of times of india gave film 3 stars out of 5 and said try to wipe out movie s earlier version from your mind you might find it more enjoyable sukanya verma of rediff gave it 3 out of 5 while commenting agneepath less of a remake more of a tribute makers of agneepath should have just called it kunal guha of yahoo com gave film 3 out of 5 stars saying that biggest dilemma of remaking a movie is how much to retain and what to retain if new story takes violent shifts you lose audience who came to revisit original if you photocopy scene by scene you risk failing to connect with audience who is accustomed to present sensibilities only safe bet a khichdi of past and present like this one mayank shekhar of hindustan times gave film 3 out of 5 stars while remarking this is kind of genuine theatre experience now getting rare which remains most precious in life of a film goer reason can take over later i had a ball sonia chopra of sify gave it 3 out of 5 and mentioned debut director karan malhotra shows great promise in making film visually arresting and maintaining consistency of performances but remaking a cult film means you have big shoes to fill if you re a loyalist of late mukul anand s agneepath you re likely to have reservations with this one but if you leave comparisons aside and are willing to forgive faults agneepath is worth a watch essentially to savor hrithik s performance rajeev masand of cnn ibn gave agneepath 3 out of 5 and said it is in end an old fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic over top style you re not likely to be bored by intense action and solid performances but prepare to be exhausted by just how long this film plays on overseas overseas film received positive reviews russel edwards of variety reviewed debuting helmer karan malhotra stokes up a fiery revenge tale in agneepath an expensively pumped up relentlessly energetic retelling of 1990 amitabh bachchan cult favorite of same name bollywood hunk hrithik roshan and veteran actor sanjay dutt donning hat as antagonist this dynamic hindi action extravaganza boosts its potent story with an aggressive style that will ensure audiences feel every blow farah andrews of gulf news praised film while saying fans of 1990 original starring amitabh bachchan and danny denzongpa as vijay and kancha may be wary about remake but take it from us revamped flick is well worth a watch a khan of first post wrote director karan malhotra has made an impressive film under able guidance of his mentor karan

themes and analysis agneepath derives its name from a poem of same name written by harivansh rai bachchan poem which is recited through film provides a metaphorical link to represent vijay s quest for vengeance several critics consider agneepath to be a homage to era of melodramatic over top action films of 1980s and 90s critic rajeev masand analysed agneepath is a throwback to those heightened action dramas of 90s so every dialogue is delivered as a punch line our hero may be battered and stabbed yet he ll rise like phoenix and women are flung around to be raped or sold as sex slaves he added film is enhanced by uncompromising brutal action and by its striking camerawork especially those scenes framed against a monsoon sky heavy with dark clouds writing for hindustan times mayank shekhar explained that film like several other bollywood films was inspired by indian mythological tale of ramayana he also added that external logic of a star driven fantasy fed film would not be easy to gulp for many while writing a critique for deccan chronicle suparna sharma quoted agneepath is more than a remake or a homage to original it s about a son righting a wrong and this emotion
