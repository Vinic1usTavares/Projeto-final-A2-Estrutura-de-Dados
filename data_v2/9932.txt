lead guitarist jim matheos offered following quote in a june 2016 interview about possibility of a future album no as i just said it s same situation with john kevin and i are both busy doing other things i believe kevin is experimenting and working on some chroma key material right now so who knows in future i would love to do it and if it happens that s great but there are no plans right now my main focus for at least rest of this year and probably next year is going to be fates warning musical style moore has described osi s sound as a new approach to progressive rock combining elements of progressive metal and electronica moore considers two genres to be almost natural enemies and that conflict between two genres keeps music interesting matheos cites progressive rock and heavy metal bands such as genesis jethro tull black sabbath and ufo as influences moore described his influences as minimal techno experimental electronic musicians and bands that play live and then chop it up matheos and moore primarily work alone exchanging files and ideas by email writing process for all osi s albums has been same with matheos sending moore an idea from just a guitar riff to elaborate almost completed songs which moore then edits and sends back to matheos moore band s vocalist and lyricist has described process of writing lyrics as an audio rorschach test lyrics on office of strategic influence feature political themes but lyrics on later releases are less political instead being based on moore s personal experiences i ll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something he said but then by time i m finished lyrics it ll be about a relationship or something like that on blood moore largely abandoned his earlier stream of consciousness approach to writing lyrics in an attempt to make lyrics more coherent i didn t want it to be like oh you get your own impression of lyrics everybody has their own idea i wanted to have an idea that i wanted to communicate and something communicable he explained moore has acknowledged narrow range of his vocals he considers his vocal style to come from how i feel when i m singing when i m in zone of writing lyrics and recording which a lot of times comes as same time it s sort of an introspective time a lot of material lends itself to that kind of voice and that kind of spirit
