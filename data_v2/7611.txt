lactarius argillaceifolius is a species of fungus in russulaceae family mushrooms produced by fungus have convex to flattened drab lilac colored caps that are up to wide cream colored gills are closely spaced together and extend slightly down length of stem which is up to long by thick mushroom produces an off white latex when injured that stains mushroom tissue brownish species is found in eastern north america with a range extending from canada to northeastern mexico it has also been found in pine plantations in brazil where it is probably an introduced species lactarius trivialis is a european counterpart that is similar in appearance in addition to its distribution it can be distinguished from l argillaceifolius by differences in preferred habitat and color differences in gills cap and latex l argillaceifolius variety megacarpus a larger form with caps up to wide occurs under coast live oak and tanoak in pacific coast states and baja california variety dissimilis described on basis of a single specimen from south carolina differs from main form in microscopic structure of cap cuticle taxonomy and classification species was first described by american mycologists lexemuel ray hesler and alexander h smith in their 1979 monograph on north american species of lactarius type specimen collected by smith from oak grove livingston county michigan in july 1972 is housed at university of michigan herbarium hesler and smith simultaneously published varieties dissimilis and megacarpus collected from south carolina and california respectively variety megacarpus is commonly known as vulgar milkcap smith and hesler classified l argillaceifolius in subgenus tristes in stirps argillaceifolius this grouping of related species which includes l is characterized by gelatinous cuticle of stem hesler and smith 1979 p 364 description cap is wide and initially convex to broadly convex before flattening out with a depressed center cap margin is curved inward and often remains that way into maturity cap surface is covered with fine soft hairs when young but later becomes smooth it is slimy and sticky when wet color of cap ranges from lilac brown when young fading to lilac tan or pale lilac gray and eventually to pale tan or pinkish buff at center gills are attached to slightly decurrent extending somewhat down length of stem broad and packed together closely they are cream colored when young and later develop pinkish tones near margin in maturity they become flushed with brownish orange color stains buff to olive brown to dark brown when bruised stem is long by thick and nearly equal in width throughout or tapering downward its surface may be slimy or dry depending on moisture in environment it is whitish but in age becomes spotted with brownish stains flesh is firm and white to buff its odor is not distinctive while its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid latex is creamy white on initial exposure and stains gills grayish brown to dark brown or olive brown its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid older fruit bodies tend to have less abundant and weaker tasting latex spore print is pinkish buff edibility of l argillaceifolius is unknown cap surface will turn yellow to orange when a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied microscopic characteristics thumb 150px right spore surfaces are ornamented and may form a partial reticulum spores are roughly spherical to broadly elliptical and measure 7 11 by 7 8 um they are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial reticulum a pattern of interconnected ridges with prominences up to 1 um high spore are hyaline translucent and amyloid meaning that they will absorb iodine when stained with melzer s reagent cap cuticle of young specimens is made of a tissue type known an which contains gelatinized hyphae of different lengths arranged in roughly parallel fashion as mushroom matures cap cuticle gradually becomes an characterized by branching entangled gelatinous hyphae basidia spore bearing cells are four spored and measure 45 52 by 9 10 5 um pleurocystidia cystidia on gill face are abundant and relatively long between 60 140 um long by 6 14 um thick cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edge measure 32 67 by 6 9 um varieties lactarius argillaceifolius var dissimilis a variety reported from south carolina is nearly identical in appearance but it has white latex that tastes bitter then acrid structure of cap cuticle differs from nominate variety in that it has dextrinoid staining yellowish or reddish brown with meltzer s reagent incrustations on hyphae variety megacarpus has a larger cap up to wide with flesh that is up to thick and white and unchanging latex with an acrid taste its stem measures long by wide near top microscopically spores of var megacarpus are more reticulate than nominate variety similar species thumb right lactarius trivialis is a lookalike species lactarius trivialis is a european species that is similar in appearance to l argillaceifolius and they are often confused for each other l trivialis can be distinguished by gills that stain brown when exposed to latex and a preference for growing in conifer and birch rich boreal and subalpine forests variety megacarpus may be confused with l pallescens a smaller paler colored species with latex that stains gills lilac rather than brown habitat and distribution like all lactarius species l argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal fruit bodies of lactarius argillaceifolius grow scattered or in groups on ground under hardwoods especially oak from july to october it is often one of first mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long lasting species is found from eastern canada south to florida and west to minnesota and texas it is common in northeast mexico mushroom has also been reported from southern brazil state of santa catarina growing in association with pine pinus elliottii plantations where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers l argillaceifolius var megacarpus has been collected from baja california california oregon and washington where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak see also list of lactarius species references external links argillaceifolius category fungi
