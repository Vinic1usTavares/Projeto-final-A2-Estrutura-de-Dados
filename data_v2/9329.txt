some away games and university and corps functions throughout year band has also participated in inauguration parades for many united states presidents and texas governors major annual parades across country and dedication ceremony for george h w bush presidential library history early years aggie band owes its existence to joseph holick born in 1868 in moravia in 1885 holick and his brother louis boarded an empty boxcar bound for orange texas so that they could gain employment in a lumber mill en route two stopped in bryan texas near campus of agricultural and mechanical college of texas 22 year old holick began to doubt his choice stating i was a small boy and couldn t do lumbering work and chose to remain in bryan working under raymond blatherwick owner of a prominent boot shop lawrence sullivan ross president of nearby college and a former governor of texas stopped into blatherwick s boot shop and noted how inconvenient it was for cadets to go to bryan for their boots ross requested holick be stationed at new military college to perform cobbler duties thumb left aggie band s first 13 members led by joseph holick holick accepted proposal and moved to work at texas a m shortly after his arrival commandant s staff discovered his musical talents they requested him to play bugle for corps functions and for us 65 a month he was assigned to play reveille and taps because new job paid much more than his previous one holick wanted to give school more than just two tunes for its money and he asked commandant for permission to start a cadet band commandant agreed and named holick its first bandmaster under his tutelage and leadership of subsequent bandmasters band grew from 13 members at its inception in 1894 to 75 bandsmen in 1924 early drum majors are credited with inspiring band s name first student drum major h a california morse was asked to leave college due to fighting in addition early drum majors were chosen in physical combat insomuch that candidates were placed in a locked room with best fighter one emerging victorious being named to coveted position this tradition of aggressiveness and physical combat was noted by band members who

senior boots which dunn tried to eliminate in 1924 lieutenant colonel richard j dunn was appointed as bandmaster as a former member of john philip sousa s marine band and with 26 years of military band leadership experience dunn quickly instituted changes within band first was to position of bugler whose duties had fallen to bandmaster since 1894 when informed that he was expected to fill role dunn told college officials i have blown enough bugles i am bandmaster someone else can blow bugle calls from then on corps bugler was chosen from ranks of aggie band dunn also instituted uniform changes which added white canvas to band uniform resulting in a flash effect every other step dunn tried to no avail to rid band of senior boots but this tradition was too well established other additions included crossed white belts later discarded in favor of a white sam browne belt silver buckles and addition of a bugle rank to lead band in its maneuvers changes in drills included block t band s signature and such intricate designs which led to talk amongst fans about band always winning halftime under dunn s experience band instituted some traditions that university uses to present in 1925 marvin h mimms wrote lyrics for an alma mater for school dunn who found aggie war hymn inappropriate for social functions and solemn occasions wrote its accompanying music and presented it to student body titled spirit of aggieland in 1926 tradition of elephant walk began when two seniors in band led a procession of seniors throughout school grounds visiting all important places on campus all seniors in one single file was quite a site to behold and one junior commented that they looked like a bunch of old elephants wandering around trying to find some place to die name stuck and tradition continues to present beginning in 1939 u s army required all cadets to be in either infantry or field artillery units therefore band was split into two separate units at opposite ends of campus dormitories and named infantry and artillery bands when two units performed together they formed combined band 1942 saw band expand to 250 members but need for manpower for war effort caused membership to plummet by end of 1942 1943 school year it dropped it to only 90 bandsmen as a crusty old army man dunn understood nation s urgent need for troops and he accepted fact that aggie band could only return after war was over along with conducting aggie band dunn started his own orchestra with newly built a m consolidated high school on texas a m campus called little symphony orchestra dunn was also founder of famous a m consolidated high school tiger band in 1947 adams era right thumb 2007 2008 aggie band performs a countermarch a maneuver first introduced by colonel adams dunn once told then cadet edward vergne adams one day i want you to direct this band adams thought colonel was joking but went to music school after graduation just in case he wasn t after music school he joined army and put his musical skills to rest for duration of war with one exception while on regimental staff during retreat ceremony at end of day assigned bugler had no experience and couldn t play a single note so adams stepped out of formation took bugle from bugler s hands blew appropriate calls handed bugle back and marched back into his spot in formation this intolerance for incompetence served him well when he accepted invitation of dunn to be his replacement as director of aggie band adams began his tenure with an undisciplined band devoid of experience and ravaged by years of war but in his first year of leadership ranks of band quickly swelled to 225 members infantry and field artillery associations were no longer required by army and adams changed units names to maroon and white bands adams began to make drills far more intricate and precise than they had been in past by adding a countermarch maneuvers from army drill manual and established a 30 inch 76 cm step or six steps for every five yards 4 as band standard adams also added criss cross maneuver first performed november 27 1947 at annual thanksgiving day game with university of texas criss cross maneuver and its later variations specifically four way cross became band s most anticipated maneuver other band directors said it was impossible to do because it required two people to be in same place at same time indeed to this day computer programs that chart band formations say that this maneuver cannot be performed to accomplish this band members step between each other s feet in later years people who did not know that maneuver was first done in 1947 claimed that drill was designed by a computer adams explained it s all a matter of mathematics one man can take up only a certain amount of space at one time and moves in one direction at a predictable rate of speed thumb left e v adams band hall band s reputation spread and other bands had begun to have some apprehension about performing in same halftime as aggie band one southwest conference band director stated i dread going against aggie band what is so humiliating is to see aggie band do things band directors talk about as being impossible and do them perfectly it takes two weeks to recover from trauma in 1960 one band gave up without a fight trinity tiger band opted to sit instead of perform and gave aggie band entire halftime to perform during adams tenure college acquired a new mascot first since original reveille died in 1944 reveille ii like original reveille was cared for and attended to by band members during halftime performances young dog was allowed to be on field with band without her leash during these breaks where she could get out and run she had a tendency to do her business on kyle field s playing surface this didn t bother band members much as reveille stayed away from band but adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yard line dog would defecate he quickly ended practice and turned responsibility of caring for reveille over to company e 2 which has since been called mascot company on october 7 1967 first meeting of aggie band association took place to support band organization composed of former members and supporters continue to assist band through fundraising scholarships instrument repair and general welfare of cadets in band in 1970 adams acquired funds and built a new band hall which was named in his honor modernization and expansion thumb right joe t haney drill field considered by bandsmen to be a working memorial as ashes of some former bandsmen have been scattered across it thumb haney drill field ceased to be used by aggie band in november 2018 notice ruts created by constant formation marching colonel joe t haney took over band in 1973 he felt his obligation was not to build up band but to keep it at its already exceptional level during haney s years band expanded to include a concert band a symphonic band aggieland orchestra and a drum and bugle corps and names of two subunits reverted to their earlier designations of infantry and artillery bands this simple philosophy was tested as texas a m transitioned from an all male military college to a coeducational research university addition of women to corps presented some challenges including one high profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former corps and band members when women were finally admitted to band under court order fall semester 1985 first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within band dorms reporters were relentless and haney finally called an open press conference with three young ladies female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies members of their freshman class in their unit were included in photos with a band dropout rate of 33 odds were against all of female cadets succeeding only andrea remained in band through her senior year haney realized separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated dorms grouping females at one end of dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use amidst these drastic changes large proportions of freshmen classes some as high as 30 contained all state high school band members as band s experience and musical talents grew quality of music improved dramatically haney even rewrote drills to include a portion where band stopped moving and played to audience this innovation was well received and became a staple of band s repertoire in 1975 at a televised game versus university of arkansas aggie band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in game by fourth quarter aggie band had played on tv during every break and colonel haney trying his best to be fair told cameraman that they really should let razorback band play a little too cameraman called up to broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied director doesn t want to hear arkansas band he wants to hear aggie band drills became even more complicated as haney added formations and maneuvers never before seen excellence shown on field belied its heavy dependence on precision on october 24 1981 band suffered a serious misstep during halftime show at rice university when four members of a lead element turned early and before anyone could make a correction colliding band members ground drill to a halt with so many members doing exactly what person in front of them does with mere inches of clearance cascade effect was unrecoverable and band simply stopped and left field although it was first rumored that collision was intended to mock rice marching owl band and later that rice students were using whistles to throw off band s response to drum major whistle commands all of rumors proved to be unsubstantiated thereafter band performed all drills in houston without whistle commands following weekend band attempted their most complicated drill and performed flawlessly each subsequent week drills became more complicated bryan college station eagle s editor opined a m is probably only school anywhere that throws in a free football game with
