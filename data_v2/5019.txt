hypnotic and wicked beats of last decade priya elan of nme described lyrics suck my cockiness lick my persuasion as cringey but complimented song s compositional structure writing that it provides a genuine elastic thrill twisting into all sorts of jaw dropping musical shapes randell roberts of los angeles times described cockiness love it and another track from album birthday cake as breast and booty of talk that talk but noted that they failed to capture raunchiness that they set out to achieve melissa maerz of entertainment weekly also wrote that cockiness love it and birthday cake were most provocative songs on album describing them as i like it rough tracks but criticized them for being album fillers designed to get listener out of bedroom and on to dance floor jon caramanica of new york times wrote that rihanna appeared to be channelling swedish singer songwriter and rapper neneh cherry on cockiness love it in a pseudo melodic impersonation caramanica continued to praise song and called it a triumph writing that singer eases out come ons as if she were lapping up milk despite raising concerns for younger audiences with regard to song s overt sexual lyrics a reviewer for flavour magazine praised mr bangladesh s production on cockiness love it pip ellwood of entertainment focus noted that cockiness love it along with birthday cake leave you under no misunderstanding that rihanna is as sexual as she s ever been throughout her career arwa haider of metro wrote that song is predictably filthy nathan s of dj booth noted that cockiness love it is by far album s most explicit offering and listed song along with watch n learn as his top two songs from talk that talk lindsay zoladz of pitchfork media was critical of song writing rihanna s always been singing about sex she s just never shown such an unfortunate proclivity for cheesy lyrics and dessert metaphors suck my cockiness lick my persuasion rihanna commands on embarrassingly literal cockiness love it hoping boldness of delivery will distract you from thinking about what a clunky line it is it won t though bangladesh s beats might nguyen of a v club commented that although rihanna evokes a raunchy appeal during verses he criticized singer for providing stony vocals simon price of independent shared same opinion as nguyen with regard to rihanna s vocal performance writing it s a shame that cockiness love it like every rihanna vocal is delivered in a voice which sounds as bored as a sex line worker filing her nails adrian thrills of daily mail labelled song as hardly subtle as rihanna asks listener to be her sex slave mike diver for bbc was critical of song s inclusion on album writing a forgettable vocal from jay z on title track foreshadows an awful exercise in quasi
