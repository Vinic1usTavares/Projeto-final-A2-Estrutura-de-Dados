perfect immortal civilization living in peace and harmony xans eventual discovery and research of source s power lead them to create powerful technology they built a great civilization but this made them greedy and arrogant two factions formed within xan calling themselves redeemed and unredeemed these groups fought over how best to use source now strained and unstable from their tampering they tried in vain to fix problem but discovered it was too late source would soon destroy planet rubi ka was ripped apart in a cataclysm leaving it a barren rock source and small fragments of xans dead civilization were thrown into another dimension known as shadowlands survivors left in search of other habitable planets where they planted versions of their species they hoped that one would prosper and eventually return to rubi ka earth was one of their destinations in year 28 708 ad a mining survey ship from mega corporation omni tek rediscovered rubi ka interstellar confederation of corporations icc granted omni tek a one thousand year lease on planet shortly after it was a seemingly useless arid landscape far from civilization until discovery of mineral notum unique to rubi ka research of notum and its properties led to major leaps forward in nanotechnology making possible creation of powerful new technology as well as resurrection of dead after terraforming a portion of rubi ka and constructing several cities outposts and transportation infrastructure company began importing colonists under contract as miners and other professions first five hundred years of omni tek s control of rubi ka were marked with an exemplary worker treatment record however as time passed their policies degraded their scientists tinkering with mutating effects of notum on colonists in a quest for efficiency lead to large numbers of failed experiments survivors of these experiments became game s four playable races or breeds each designed by omni tek to specialize in a type of work together with original race genetically engineered herculean atrox intelligent and nimble they continued their labor in midst of an increasingly hostile and totalitarian culture this caused a significant number of workers to rebel and begin to trade stolen notum to a rival corporation these rebel groups collectively calling themselves clans fought a series of wars with omni tek over next several centuries player point of view anarchy onlines story from player s point of view began in 29 475 after most recent peace treaty had been signed between omni tek and clans icc peacekeeping troops later moved into some cities to protect neutral observers of war who had rejected their contractual obligations with omni tek but did not align themselves with clans omni tek clans and neutral observers make up game s three playable factions and control much of rubi ka s terraformed surface after scientists opened a portal to shadowlands players found source killing guardian xan had left there to protect it this prompted an alien race known as to begin attacking rubi ka story s current plots revolve around fight by all sides for control of planet gameplay thumb right alt an armored

expansion packs players assume roles of new colonists to rubi ka or shadowlands game world is occupied by human players and computer controlled characters both friendly and hostile game begins with player creating a unique character choosing its name gender height weight and facial features each character is also one of four humanoid breeds final choice is that of character s profession similar to character classes of other role playing games game s multiplayer nature and free form gameplay encourage creating personal networks and cooperating and fighting with other players players interact with anarchy onlines interface via a keyboard and mouse game s heads up display consists of a series of windows menus and buttons located on periphery of screen players communicate with each other by typing text in chat windows and occasionally through emotive character animations communication with computer controlled characters is executed via text windows in which players chose from a menu of possible responses to conversation being shown getting started on rubi ka pg 17 19 like most role playing games anarchy online provides structure for role playing events most major cities include night clubs and other venues specifically for this events are organized either by players or officially by funcom staff groups of players large or small are often required to complete objectives in addition to forming teams and informal chat groups joining a player organization is encouraged these are like guilds in similar games officially recognized groups bound together for technical and social benefits organizations are able to build their own cities across game world control areas of land run player markets and access other special content getting started on rubi ka pg 72 75 among most distinct gameplay elements of anarchy online are dynamic missions missions or quests are a traditional gameplay element in role playing genre player or team is given a set of tasks usually related to story to complete somewhere in game world in return they are rewarded with experience points items and money dynamic missions are similar to traditional missions in purpose but are created at player s request once they choose its difficulty and other options game generates a new indoor area filled with computer controlled enemies player or team are told to go to its location and finish some task inside for their reward getting started on rubi ka pg 63 64 dynamic missions like many other encounters in anarchy online are instanced each mission area is available only to owners of mission getting started on rubi ka pg 62 skill system much of what characters can do and how well they do it is determined by game s eighty three distinct character skills a skill is a numerical representation of a character s proficiency in an area of skill starting at zero as players kill computer controlled enemies they gain experience points for their character after gaining enough points character levels up current maximum level is 220 at each new level character is given some skill points which are used to increase any combination of eighty three skills that they choose getting started on rubi ka pg 30 33 any character can access and increase any skill character s profession however provides unique resources perks alien perks research and nano programs that increase specific skill further this makes each profession more adept at elements of gameplay than others doctors for instance can increase skills related to healing much higher than a soldier because of these additional resources perks are chosen from a menu when character reaches certain levels alien perks are gained when player kills enough of a specific type of alien enemy getting started on rubi ka pg 48 49 research is gained by diverting a percentage of earned experience points toward personal or faction specific research projects instead of new levels nano programs give temporary increases to certain skills getting started on rubi ka pg 43 combat after targeting another character and initiating combat player and his opponent will damage each other automatically with their weapons this continues until player stops or target is dead each profession s unique nano programs perks and research also provide combat abilities used by player during fight these can heal owner cause additional damage lower skills of enemy blind them or otherwise hinder enemy s ability to fight once target is dead player is able to loot money and items from enemy s body getting started on rubi ka pg 27 29

encouraged by both reward of special equipment and social nature of game killing other players also rewards characters with a pvp ranking permanently shown beside player s name which represent how many other human players they have killed player versus player combat is controlled by percentage of suppression gas in area that dictates whether a player can start combat unprovoked with another player generally this percentage approaches 100 in major cities providing safe havens and decreases while moving to more remote areas combat was updated with release of battlestation expansion this allowed for a pure pvp environment where clan and omni could square off in a spacestation arena neutrals could join any side much later due to a declining playerbase clans and omni were allowed to join teams side by side battlestation points were scored by capturing capping up to four locations one in middle and three down long corridors teleporters shortened distance between corridor ends battlestation allowed for much higher team and individual kill scores highest scoring team kill player of all time was a doctor class omni https www anarchy online com history development preliminary development for anarchy online began in 1995 at funcom s oslo norway studios up until that point company had only developed offline video games for consoles including critically successful speed punks for playstation in a 2007 interview former project leader godager said funcom s management wanted to put substantial resources into developing a new mmorpg they believed genre s user base would expand in coming years unlike most other games in genre which had traditional role playing fantasy themes anarchy online featured a science fiction theme game would also feature a relatively large playable area and graphics that were at time more advanced than existing mmorpgs godager said he and many other developers saw idea as crazy describing project as very ambitious project s team grew steadily between 1995 and 2001 to include at least 70 developers in a 2001 interview gameworld designer morten byom said that process of creating rubi ka s virtual world had taken more time and effort than anyone imagined when we first started team took inspiration from a number of sources including science fiction books movies architecture in oslo and other games in genre they stated one of biggest challenges as finding ways to encourage players to use entire game world as they play not to gather in one corner byom said he wanted to give world as much detail as possible to make game convincing to player composers morten sorlie tor linlokken and bjorn arve lagim created soundtrack and music of anarchy online using a system they call sample based interactive music game mixes numerous music samples to create dynamic music by starting stopping fading and layering samples based on where player is and what they are doing game creates a continuous stream of background music bjorn arve lagim stated music is inspired by traditional sound of a film score using both orchestral and electronic instruments longer full length versions of some songs were later released on compact disc with a special edition of game in 2002 anarchy online was officially announced at 2000 electronic entertainment expo e3 gamespot and other online sites published articles tracking game s development over

year in rest of europe in addition to being distributed as a retail box from physical and online stores anarchy online was one of first mmorpgs available via online digital distribution during its first month of release many stability registration and billing issues hurt public perception of game some gaming reporters claimed it was worst launch of an mmo in history of genre funcom spent about 6 months fixing game particularly beginning experience company then took fixed game on a press tour to convince reporters to give it another try even though reviews and scores had been printed months before at same time company needed to build subscribers which was very difficult given reputation of game funcom introduced first free trial of game and gave out returned boxed copies for free at 2002

launch woes and won mmo of year award from pc gamer company went on to create expansions including shadowlands expansion in 2003 that earned several editor s choice awards two months after its release

launch of anarchy online and subsequent technical problems funcom issued a statement to reviewers asking them to hold back on a full review until we have solved these problems some video game reviewers such as computer games magazine published reviews anyway others such as gamespy who described game as nearly unplayable chose to wait one month before publishing a formal review troubled release has had a lasting effect on game s reputation and is nearly always mentioned in generally positive reviews of later expansion packs as a juxtaposition while anarchy onlines launch problems had a negative effect on initial critics game itself was generally reviewed favorably it scored an average of 7 6 out of 10 from gamespy gamespot and ign gamespy later described it as a promising game with some big technical flaws ign called it a brilliant engaging profound mmorpg but added it came with atrocious technical problems pc gamer magazine said that it will be next great mmorpg but that game needed some serious work before it would reach its potential they would award game with best massively multiplayer game next year computer games magazine described anarchy online as a science fiction everquest everquest was a popular fantasy mmorpg at time in that it took traditional fantasy elements of genre and gave them science y sounding words they went on to praise game s large detailed game world and its evolutionary user interface gamespy said game s soundtrack was grand cinematic and very appropriate in their review pc gamer magazine said that intricate skill system gave game incredible character depth dynamic mission system was met with mixed reviews pc gamer called it a brilliant solution to camping practice of waiting for a computer controlled character in outdoor game world to appear so that it can be killed and items looted computer games magazine said that while missions were a good idea in theory they are too simple and similar claiming that this caused players to become bored and camp for items outside anyway visually they called missions cramped boxy and generally unappealing compared to rest of game editors of pc gamer us later named anarchy online best massively multiplayer game of 2001 they wrote after aos abysmal launch and well deserved public drubbing funcom dedicated itself to fixing game s myriad troubles result has been admirable first booster pack notum wars was released in 2002 at that time first expansion pack shadowlands had already been announced staci krause of ign noted new character creation interface made game s introduction to new players easier land control areas one of major additions in notum wars were described by krause as not only interesting but fun she also said that new additions to game world and improvements to 3d rendering engine add to sense that rubi ka is a busy planet yahoo criticized land control areas as being complicated and expensive and said that participation in battles was difficult for players not in an organization shadowlands expansion was most critically acclaimed by far winning several editor s choice awards from ign cnet gamespot gamespy and others in 2003 critics applauded size and scope of it such as andrew park of gamespot who called it absolutely enormous tom chick of gamespy praised distinctive and exotic art direction of new areas critics of shadowlands noted that expansion s design was too fantasy oriented as compared to original game alien invasion released in 2004 did not receive same abundance of praise as its predecessor although most scores were above 7 out of 10 new content it introduced in critics eyes was not designed for new players g4 tv wrote that it would be a tough sell to new players but added it offer s existing players a solid reason to keep playing gamespy wrote that expansion s new features such as improved user interface and chat system make game more enjoyable to play after twelve years anarchy online has become one of longest running mmorpgs in operation publications who had reviewed game s previous additions did not review lost eden expansion in 2006 or legacy of xan booster in 2009 gamesradar s sarah borger wrote of lost eden that game s aging graphics and user interface make world hard to interact with but she went on to acclaim new player versus player content it added sales and subscriptions five days after
