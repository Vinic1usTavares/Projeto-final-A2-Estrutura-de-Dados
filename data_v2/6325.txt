attracted national attention his lynching two years later in response to commutation of his death sentence became focus of social regional political and racial concerns particularly regarding

frank and jim conley a janitor at factory on may 24 1913 frank was indicted on a charge of murder and case opened at fulton county superior court on july 28 prosecution relied heavily on testimony of conley who described himself as an accomplice to murder and who defense at trial argued was in fact perpetrator of murder a guilty verdict was announced on august 25 frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals their final appeal to supreme court of united states failed in april 1915 considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial governor john m slaton commuted frank s sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment case attracted national press and many reporters deemed conviction a travesty within georgia this outside criticism

to write them oney pp 129 132 after testing conley again on his spelled night watchman as night witch police were convinced he had written notes they were skeptical about rest of his story not only

conley admitted he had lied about his friday meeting with frank he said he had met frank on street on saturday and was told to follow him to factory frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being

found phagan was an easier target police placed little credence in officials theory but had no explanation for failure to locate phagan s purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day oney p 3 they were also concerned that conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote notes suggesting frank had simply dictated notes to conley arbitrarily to resolve their doubts police attempted on may 28 to arrange a confrontation between frank and conley frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney who was out of town police were quoted in

against an accusation of rape by a white woman he had also taken an elderly black woman s civil case as far as georgia supreme court although smith believed conley had told truth in his final affidavit he became concerned that conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters smith was also anxious about reporters from hearst papers who had taken frank s side he arranged for conley to be moved to a different jail and severed his own relationship with georgian oney pp 147 148 on february 24 1914 conley was sentenced to a year in jail for being an accomplice after fact

april 17 of that year oney p 377 defense continued to investigate case and filed an extraordinary motion before georgia supreme court this appeal which would be held before a single justice ben hill

number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony a state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of hair on lathe shortly after murder did not match phagan s at same time that various repudiations were leaked to newspapers state was busy seeking repudiations of new affidavits an analysis of murder notes which had only been addressed in any detail in closing arguments suggested conley composed them in basement rather than writing what frank told him to write in his office prison letters written by conley to annie maude carter were discovered defense then argued that these along with carter s testimony implicated conley was actual murderer dinnerstein 1987 pp 84 90 102 105 oney pp 371 373 378 380 385 387 389 390 defense also raised a federal constitutional issue on whether frank s absence from court when verdict was announced constituted deprivation of due process of law different attorneys were brought in to argue this point since rosser and arnold had acquiesced in frank s absence there was a debate between rosser and arnold on whether it should be raised at this time since its significance might be lost with all of other evidence being presented louis marshall president of american jewish committee and constitutional lawyer urged them to raise point and decision was made that it should be made clear that if extraordinary motion was rejected they intended to appeal through federal court system and there would be an impression of injustice in trial dinnerstein 1987 pp 90 91 for almost every issue presented by defense state had a response most of repudiations were either retracted or disavowed by witnesses question of whether outdated order pads used to write murder notes had been in basement before murder was disputed integrity of defense s investigators were questioned and intimidation and bribery were charged and significance of conley s letters to annie carter was disputed oney pp 403 416

considered a belated effort as trifling with court dinnerstein 1987 pp 107 108 oney p 446 federal appeals next step for frank team was to appeal issue through federal system original request for a writ of error on absence of frank from jury s announcement of verdict was first denied by justice joseph rucker lamar and then justice oliver wendell holmes jr both denied request because they agreed with georgia court that issue was raised too late full supreme court then heard arguments but denied motion without issuing a written decision however holmes said i very seriously doubt if petitioner has had due process of law because of trial taking place in presence of a hostile demonstration and seemingly dangerous crowd thought by presiding judge to be ready for violence unless a verdict of guilty was rendered freedman p 56 dinnerstein 1987 p 109 holmes statement as well as public indignation over this latest rejection by courts encouraged frank s team to attempt a habeas corpus motion arguing that threat of crowd violence had forced frank to be absent from verdict hearing and constituted a violation of due process justice lamar heard motion and agreed that full supreme court should hear appeal on april 19 1915 supreme court denied appeal by a 7 2 vote in case frank v mangum part of decision repeated message of last decision that frank failed to raise objection in due season when fully cognizant of fact dinnerstein 1987 p 110 holmes and charles evans hughes dissented with holmes writing it is our duty to declare lynch law as little valid when practiced by a regularly drawn

execute a man on testimony of an accomplice when circumstances of crime tend to fix guilt upon accomplice oney pp 470 473 480 488 application then passed to governor john slaton slaton had been elected in 1912 and his term would end four days after frank s scheduled execution in 1913 before phagan s murder slaton agreed to merge his law firm with that of luther rosser who became frank s lead attorney slaton was not directly involved in original trial after commutation popular georgia politician tom watson attacked slaton often focusing on his partnership with rosser as a conflict of interest dinnerstein 1987 pp 123 124 lindemann p 270 slaton opened hearings on june 12 in addition to receiving presentations from both sides with new arguments and evidence slaton visited crime scene and reviewed over 10 000 pages of documents this included various letters including one written by judge roan shortly before he died asking slaton to correct his mistake oney pp 489 499 slaton also received more than 1 000 death threats during hearing former governor joseph brown warned slaton in all frankness if your excellency wishes to invoke lynch law in georgia and destroy trial by jury way

while hearings of petition to commute were in progress watson sent a friend to governor with promise that if slaton allowed frank to hang watson would be his friend which would result in his becoming united states senator and master of georgia politics for twenty years to come woodward p 440 slaton produced a 29 page report in first part he criticized outsiders who were unfamiliar with evidence especially press in north he defended trial court s decision which he felt was sufficient for a guilty verdict he summarized points of state s case against frank that any reasonable person would accept and said of conley that it is hard to conceive that any man s power of fabrication of minute details could reach that which conley showed unless it be truth after having made these points slaton s narrative changed course and asked rhetorical question did conley speak truth oney pp 499 500 leonard dinnerstein wrote slaton based his opinions primarily upon inconsistencies he had discovered in narrative of jim conley dinnerstein 1987 p 127 two factors stood out to slaton transporting of body to basement and murder notes oney pp 500 501 transport of body during initial investigation police had noted undisturbed human excrement in elevator shaft which conley said he had left there before murder use of elevator on monday after murder crushed excrement which slaton concluded was an indication that elevator could not have been used as described by conley casting doubt on his testimony during commutation hearing slaton asked dorsey to address this issue dorsey said that elevator did not always go all way to bottom and could be stopped anywhere frank s attorney rebutted this by quoting conley who said that elevator stops when it hits bottom slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to factory concluding that every time elevator made trip to basement it touched bottom slaton said if elevator was not used by conley and frank in taking body to basement then explanation of conley cannot be accepted oney pp 495 496 501 murder notes murder notes had been analyzed before at extraordinary motion hearing handwriting expert albert s osborn reviewed previous evidence at commutation hearing and commented for first time that notes were written in third person rather than first person he said that first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be final statements of a dying phagan he argued this was type of error that conley would have made rather than frank as conley was a sweeper and not a cornell educated manager like frank oney p 482 conley s former attorney william smith had become convinced that his client had committed murder smith produced a 100 page analysis of notes for defense he analyzed speech and writing patterns and spelling grammar repetition of adjectives and favorite verb forms he concluded in this article i show clearly that conley did not tell truth about those notes oney p 483 slaton compared murder notes conley s letters to annie maude carter and his trial testimony throughout these documents he found similar use of words like play lay love and he also found double adjectives such as long tall negro tall slim build heavy man and good long wide piece of cord in his hands oney p 433 slaton was also convinced that murder notes were written in basement not in frank s office slaton accepted defense s argument that notes were written on dated order pads signed by a former employee that were only kept in basement dinnerstein 1987 p 128 slaton wrote that employee signed an affidavit stating that when he left company in 1912 he personally packed up all of duplicate orders and sent them down to basement to be burned this evidence was never passed upon by jury and developed since trial golden pp 267 269 timing and physical evidence slaton s narrative touched on other aspects of evidence and testimony that suggested reasonable doubt for example he accepted defense s argument that charges by conley of perversion were based on someone coaching him that jews were circumcised he accepted defense s interpretation of timeline oney p 501 citing evidence produced at possibility that stover did not see frank because she did not proceed further than outer wrote therefore monteen stover must have arrived before mary phagan and while monteen stover was in room it hardly seems possible under evidence that mary phagan was at that time being murdered golden pp 268 269 slaton also said that phagan s head wound must have bled profusely yet there was no blood found on lathe ground nearby in elevator or steps leading downstairs he also said that phagan s nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from basement dinnerstein 1987 pp 127 128 slaton also commented on conley s story that conley was watching out for arrival of a lady for frank on day of murder conclusion on monday june 21 1915 slaton released order to commute frank s murder conviction to life imprisonment slaton s legal rationale was that there was sufficient new evidence not available at original trial to justify frank s actions oney p 502 he wrote commutation was headline news atlanta mayor jimmy woodward remarked that larger part of population believes frank guilty and that commutation was a mistake oney p 503 in response slaton invited press to his home that afternoon telling them he also told reporters that he was certain that conley was actual murderer slaton privately told friends that he would have issued a full pardon if not for his belief that frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence reaction of public public was outraged a mob threatened to attack governor at his home a detachment of georgia national guard along with county policemen and a group of slaton s friends who were sworn in as deputies dispersed mob john m slaton 1866 1955 new georgia encyclopedia slaton had been a popular

hearing was pending journal called for a new trial saying that to execute frank based on atmosphere both within and outside courtroom would amount to judicial murder other newspapers in state followed suit and many ministers spoke from pulpit supporting a new trial l o bricker pastor of church attended by phagan s family said that based on awful tension of public feeling it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair fearless and impartial trial oney pp 381 382 on october 12 1913 new york sun became first major northern paper to give a detailed account of frank trial in discussing charges of antisemitism in trial it described atlanta as more liberal on subject than any other southern cities it went on to say that antisemitism did arise during trial as atlantans reacted to statements attributed to frank s jewish supporters who dismissed phagan as nothing but a factory girl paper said anti semitic feeling was natural result of belief that jews had banded to free frank innocent or guilty supposed solidarity of jews for frank even if he was guilty caused a gentile solidarity against him oney p 366 on november 8 1913 executive committee of american jewish committee headed by louis marshall addressed frank case they did so following judge roan s reconsideration motion and motivated by issues raised in sun they chose not to take a public stance as a committee instead deciding to raise funds individually to influence public opinion in favor of frank albert lasker a wealthy advertising magnate responded to these calls to help frank lasker contributed personal funds and arranged a public relations effort in support of frank in atlanta during time of extraordinary motion lasker coordinated frank s meetings with press and coined slogan truth is on march to characterize efforts of frank s defense team he persuaded prominent figures such as thomas edison henry ford and jane addams to make statements supporting frank

york times became involved about same time as lasker organizing a prolonged campaign advocating for a new trial for frank both ochs and lasker attempted to heed louis marshall s warnings about antagonizing of southern people and engender feeling that north is criticizing courts and people of georgia dinnerstein writes that these attempts failed because many georgians interpreted every item favorable to frank as a hostile act dinnerstein 1987 pp 91 92 tom watson editor of jeffersonian had remained publicly silent during frank s trial among watson s political enemies was senator hoke smith former owner of atlanta journal which was still considered to be smith s political instrument when journal called for a reevaluation of evidence against frank watson in march 19 1914 edition of his magazine attacked smith for trying to bring courts into disrepute drag down judges to level of criminals and destroy confidence of people in orderly process of law dinnerstein 1987 p 97 watson also questioned whether frank expected extraordinary favors and immunities because of his race and questioned wisdom of jews to risk good name of whole race to save decadent offshoot of a great people oney p 383 subsequent articles concentrated on frank case and became more and more impassioned in their attacks c vann woodward writes that watson pulled all stops southern chivalry sectional animus race prejudice class consciousness agrarian resentment state pride when describing public reaction to frank historians mention class and ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging complexity of case and difficulty in gauging importance of his jewishness class and northern background historian john higham writes that economic resentment frustrated progressivism and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of lynch law hatred of organized wealth reaching into georgia from outside became a hatred of jewish wealth historian nancy maclean writes that some historians have argued that this was an american dreyfus affair which she said could be explained only in light of social tensions unleashed by growth of industry and cities in turn of century south these circumstances made a jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than other leading suspect in case a black worker maclean p 918 albert lindemann said that frank on trial found himself in a position of much latent tension and symbolism stating that it is impossible to determine extent to which antisemitism affected his image he concluded that frank was seen as a representative of yankee capitalism
