hurricane cristobal was a moderately strong atlantic tropical cyclone that affected multiple landmasses from puerto rico to iceland in late august and early september 2014 slow to develop and plagued by unfavorable wind shear for most of its life storm formed on august 23 near caicos islands from a long tracked tropical wave moving generally northward cristobal gradually intensified despite a ragged appearance on satellite imagery and passed midway between bermuda and north carolina on august 27 while accelerating toward northeast next day cristobal achieved its peak strength as a category 1 hurricane a colder environment converted cristobal into an extratropical cyclone on august 29 but it retained much of its strength as it sped across northern atlantic and struck iceland on september 1 before its classification as a tropical cyclone disturbance that would become cristobal dropped heavy rainfall over puerto rico locally reaching widespread flooding and scattered landslides affected territory with 19 major rivers exceeding minor flood stage system went on to douse island of hispaniola with torrential rains leading to at least four drowning deaths in haiti and dominican republic floodwaters damaged or destroyed over 800 houses and temporarily isolated 23 communities in dominican republic while about 640 families were displaced in haiti another person was killed by floodwaters in turks and caicos hurricane generated strong surf and dangerous rip currents along u s east coast killing two swimmers in maryland and new jersey and leading to large numbers of lifeguard rescues later extratropical remnants of cristobal buffeted iceland with heavy rain and gusty winds causing flooding around capital city of reykjavik meteorological history hurricane cristobal originated from a westward tracking tropical wave which emerged from western coast of africa on august 14 accompanied for several days by an expanse of clouds some cyclonic turning was evident as disturbance approached leeward islands by august 21 but a hurricane hunters flight tasked with investigating system did not reveal a strong circulation at surface system failed to consolidate as it traversed puerto rico and hispaniola but on august 23 further reconnaissance data confirmed formation of a tropical depression just south of caicos islands nascent cyclone slowly moved north northwestward toward a weakness in subtropical ridge moderate wind shear in area kept convection over depression disorganized and outflow limited and storm only gradually intensified depression strengthened into tropical storm cristobal at 06 00 utc on august 24 while located just north of mayaguana in bahamas but its structure was vertically tilted and broad weak steering currents kept cristobal s forward motion slow and erratic and storm remained heavily affected by shear with most deep convection displaced from center on august 25 system turned toward north northeast in response to a mid level trough to north despite a ragged cloud pattern characterized by an exposed low level center and a distinct lack of banding features cristobal intensified into a category 1 hurricane at 00 00 utc on august 26 as indicated by aircraft observations newly upgraded hurricane headed along a general northward path and for next couple days pockets of dry air kept prevented further intensification convection fluctuated in intensity and coverage and early on august 27 national hurricane center remarked that satellite presentation resembles a subtropical cyclone however later that same day hurricane showed signs of increased development while located midway between bermuda and cape hatteras north carolina in particular its cloud pattern became much more symmetric and some cloud tops cooled to 70 degc 95 degf around same time cristobal accelerated toward northeast as it became embedded within mid latitude westerlies ahead of an advancing shortwave trough an area of relatively warm cloud tops at center of a central dense overcast gave way to an eye feature evident on visible satellite imagery on august 28 rapidly gaining latitude cristobal reached its peak intensity at 18 00 utc with winds of 85 mph 140 km h roughly due south of halifax nova scotia shortly thereafter hurricane began to degrade as it moved over significantly colder waters and began to encounter further dry air signalling beginning of its transition to an extratropical cyclone cristobal s circulation soon began to interact with a frontal boundary and deep convection became distanced well to north of center consequently hurricane lost its tropical identity by 12 00 utc on august 29 just north of 44degn baroclinic processes preserved much of extratropical cyclone s intensity allowing it to maintain hurricane force winds until august 30 speeding generally northeastward storm slowly weakened over northern atlantic making landfall on iceland on september 1 cristobal merged with another storm system north of country by next day impact antilles right thumb 300px satellite image of pre cristobal disturbance over puerto rico and on august 22 as cristobal s parent wave moved over puerto rico it engaged with an abnormally moist air mass to produce torrential rains totaling more than highest rainfall totals were enhanced by orographic lift over mountainous terrain a rain gauge near recorded a peak total of majority of which fell on august 24 luis munoz marin international airport near san juan reported of precipitation in total 19 rivers reached minor flood stage and five reached moderate flood stage some of them inundated adjacent roadways and urban areas heavy rains triggered multiple landslides at least one of which forced a family to evacuate floods cut electricity to nearly 17 000 customers and left 7 000 without clean drinking water after putting some 18 filtration plants out of service in some cases however rains proved beneficial refilling reservoirs after an abnormally dry summer only northwest corner of puerto rico escaped hydrological issues gusty winds caused minor damage to trees and tree branches in territory moderate to heavy rainfall also affected u s virgin islands amounting to on saint thomas and on saint croix island of hispaniola also received damaging rains from slow moving storm la romana dominican republic recorded of rain in 24 hours on august 23 and 24 result being destructive flooding floods isolated 23 towns from outside world and damaged or destroyed more than 800 dwellings especially in eastern and northeastern parts of nation just over 4 100 individuals were forced to leave their homes and seek refuge with friends and family in santo domingo province three people required rescue from their stricken car after trying to cross swollen isabela river two people were killed in dominican republic one of them after trying to drive across a flooded river in hato mayor province in neighboring haiti flooding totally destroyed four homes and heavily damaged 28 others with a total of about 640 families left temporarily homeless at least two people in country were swept away by rushing waters and many others sustained injuries shortly after storm s genesis tropical storm warnings were issued for central and southeastern bahamas and turks and caicos islands advisories were discontinued by august 25 heavy rain fell over region reaching on island of where one person drowned in ensuing floods floodwaters on north caicos ran deep blocking access to some communities governor peter beckingham reported extensive damage to people s property and possessions throughout overseas territory elsewhere a tropical storm watch was issued for bermuda on august 25 and ultimately discontinued about three days later two cruise ships left bermuda early to avoid storm and another two postponed their scheduled stops there threat of storm combined with a lack of passengers due to cruise ship diversions resulted in suspension of ferry service cristobal ultimately passed well to northwest of island producing breezy conditions and heightened surf offshore hurricane lashed east coast of united states with high swells and rip currents prompting widespread swimming restrictions and bans a teenaged male virginia resident died in a drowning incident at ocean city maryland less than an hour after lifeguards went off duty in a 24 hour period ocean city beach patrol rescued about 120 people caught in rip currents just off coast rough seas capsized a boat forcing coast guard to rescue its three occupants another young male drowned at sandy hook new jersey a wave reportedly knocked him down in shallow water before a rip current pulled inexperienced swimmer farther out dangerous swimming conditions extended north to new england beaches leading to numerous lifeguard rescues in southern iceland extratropical remnants of cristobal produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall leading to extensive flooding in capital city of reykjavik fire department there
