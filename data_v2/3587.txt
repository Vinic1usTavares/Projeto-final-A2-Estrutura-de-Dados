hd 28185 is a yellow dwarf star similar to our sun located about 128 6 light years away from earth in constellation eridanus designation hd 28185 refers to its entry in henry draper catalogue star is known to possess one long period extrasolar planet distance and visibility according to measurements from gaia spacecraft hd 28185 has a parallax of 25 3642 milliarcseconds which corresponds to a distance of 39 43 parsecs 128 6 light years since star is located further than 25 parsecs from earth it is not listed in gliese catalogue of nearby stars with an apparent magnitude of 7 81 star is not visible with naked eye though it can be seen using binoculars stellar characteristics hd 28185 is similar to our sun in terms of mass radius and luminosity star is on main sequence and is generating energy by fusing hydrogen in its core spectral type of implies hd 28185 is cooler than sun like majority of extrasolar planet host stars hd 28185 is metal rich relative to sun containing around 173 of solar abundance of iron star rotates slower than sun with a period of around 30 days compared to 25 4 days for sun based on star s chromospheric activity hd 28185 is estimated to have an age of around 2 900 million years on other hand evolutionary models give an age of around 7 500 million years and a mass 0 99 times that of our sun higher luminosity and longer rotation period favour an older age for star planetary system in 2001 an extrasolar planet similar in size to jupiter designated hd 28185 b was discovered in orbit around star with a period of 1 04 years unlike many long period extrasolar planets it has a low orbital eccentricity planet experiences similar insolation to earth which has led to speculations about possibilities for habitable moons in addition numerical simulations suggest that low mass planets located in gas giant s trojan points would be stable for long periods planet s existence was independently confirmed by magellan planet search program in 2008 star also shows evidence of a long term radial velocity trend which may indicate presence of an additional outer companion see also 51 pegasi iota notes references external links category eridanus constellation category g type main sequence stars category planetary systems category durchmusterung objects
