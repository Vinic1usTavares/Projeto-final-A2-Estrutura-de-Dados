accounts agree about her birth to shama courtesan and her death in vithoba temple when badshah of bidar sought her however characters of sadashiva malagujar her alleged father and hausa maid do not appear in all accounts early life kanhopatra was a daughter of a rich prostitute and courtesan named shama or who lived in town of near pandharpur site of vithoba s chief temple apart from kanhopatra

courtesan some authors believe that she may have also worked as a prostitute path to devotion sadashiva malagujar kanhopatra s supposed father heard of kanhopatra s beauty and wished to see her dance but kanhopatra refused accordingly sadashiva started to harass kanhopatra and shama shama tried to convince him that he was father of kanhopatra and thus should spare them but sadashiva did not believe her as he continued his harassment shama s wealth slowly depleted eventually shama apologised to sadashiva and offered to present kanhopatra to him kanhopatra however fled to pandharpur disguised as a maid with help of her aged maid hausa in some legends hausa described as a varkari is credited for kanhopatra s journey to devotion other accounts credit varkari pilgrims who passed kanhopatra s house on their way to temple of vithoba in pandharpur according to one story for example she asked a passing varkari about vithoba varkari said that vithoba is generous wise beautiful and perfect his glory is beyond description and his beauty surpasses that of lakshmi goddess of beauty kanhopatra further asked if vithoba would accept her as a devotee varkari assured her that vithoba would accept her as he accepted maid kubja in hindu mythology kubja is described as a hunchback handmaid of evil king kamsa who is prophesied to be killed by his nephew god krishna kubja welcomes krishna with whom god vithoba is identified in mathura kingdom of kamsa and anoints him with saffron and sandal in return krishna makes kubja young and beautiful again kubja offers herself to krishna and thus is accepted in spite of her low stature sinful king ajamila and so called untouchable saint chokhamela this assurance strengthened her resolve to go to pandharpur in versions of legend where sadashiva does not appear kanhopatra immediately leaves for pandharpur singing praises of vithoba with varkari pilgrims or coaxes her mother to accompany her to pandharpur when kanhopatra first saw
