mountains wherein it lies are called mountains reception while different worlds described it as a good buy rpgnet gave it a slightly more favorable rating of nearly 6 8 good latter day d d writer james wyatt described it as first super adventure and lamented that with another hundred pages of fleshing out it could have been as memorable as landmark temple of elemental evil jim bambra of white dwarf reviewed adventure in magazine s open box feature and gave it an overall rating of 5 out of 10 commenting that while presentation of module was quite good 8 10 it seemed to be hastily thrown together bambra gave adventure playability and enjoyment ratings of 5 10 and skill and complexity ratings of 6 10 he felt adventure was very mundane and lacks any real cohesion bambra noted that parts of adventure were created for tournament play tournament section deals with getting into city and he felt rest of module seemed to be tacked on to that he did like mini campaign included in adventure and ideas included on how to expand on it however he felt that any dungeon master who used dwellers of forbidden city would have to expend so much effort to make it more than just a series of encounters that they were better off starting from scratch bambra concluded that this adventure was just not worth considering with all other better quality modules available from tsr dwellers of forbidden city was ranked 13th greatest dungeons dragons adventure of all time by dungeon magazine for 30th anniversary of dungeons dragons game in 2004 judge eric l boyd described it as a classic adventure in which cook created a lost city jungle in great tradition of edgar rice burroughs players battle their way into city through a labyrinth of traps and monsters or find their own way into sprawling jungle cloaked ruins cook provides a host of backgrounds to motivate exploration of city but map itself is motivation enough judge wolfgang baur editor of dungeon magazine described adventures thus this adventure may be best remembered for its monsters it was from forbidden city that d d gained aboleth mongrel man tasloi and yuan ti aboleth that guarded one of entrances to city was worshipped by local mongrelmen as a god reviews ares magazine 12 see also list of dungeons dragons modules references category 1981 books category greyhawk modules
