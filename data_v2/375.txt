similarly stated gregor s fans will cheer promise of future visits on a more negative note peg glisson writes for children s literature that those who have not read first gregor will be at a slight disadvantage collins tries to weave necessary details from gregor s first visit to underworld into this one but it definitely slows early chapters down and is not completely satisfying ed sullivan of booklist claims fans will not be disappointed with this exciting action packed sequel although he also warns readers unfamiliar with first novel will be at a disadvantage as collins assumes knowledge of characters and developments from first book ccbc also praised book for its portrayal of strong and healthy sibling relationships as it continued saga of two contemporary siblings navigating their way through unfamiliar territory card says gregor s parents inability to care for their children after return of his father in first book sets stage for this second journey in which counsel of adults is well meant but morally ambiguous and gregor s own wisdom must carry day that continuing realism wraps mile a minute adventure in a satisfyingly complex political and social network and provides whole with a compelling emotional foundation throughout motivations and growth of individual characters drive action glisson writes as well of how gregor has matured since his last adventure and
