t box brain 1 is a transcription factor protein important in vertebrate embryo development it is encoded by tbr1 gene this gene is also known by several other names t brain 1 tbr 1 tes 56 and tbr1 is a member of tbr1 subfamily of t box family transcription factors which share a common dna binding domain other members of tbr1 subfamily include eomes and tbx21 tbr1 is involved in differentiation and migration of neurons and is required for normal brain development tbr1 interacts with various genes and proteins in order to regulate cortical development specifically within layer vi of developing six layered human cortex studies show that tbr1 may play a role in major neurological diseases such as alzheimer s disease ad parkinson s disease pd and autism spectrum disorder asd discovery tbr1 was identified in 1995 by nina ireland laboratory of developmental neurobiology center at university of california san francisco gene initially named tes 56 was found to be largely expressed in vesicles of developing forebrain of mice protein product of tes 56 was discovered to be homologous to protein a t box transcription factor which plays a role in establishing symmetry during embryonic development thus due to its relation to t box genes such as tbx 1 tbx 2 tbx 3 tes 56 was renamed tbr1 human tbr1 gene and encoded protein human tbr1 gene is located on q arm of positive strand of chromosome 2 it is 8 954 base pairs in length tbr1 is one of three genes that make up tbr1 subfamily of t box genes two other genes that form tbr1 subfamily are eomes also known as tbr2 and tbx21 also known as t bet tbr1 is also known as t box brain protein t brain 1 and tes 56 encoded protein consists of 682 amino acid residues and has a predicted molecular weight of 74 053 da it is composed of 6 exons functions tbr1 is a protein called a transcription factor that binds to dna and regulates transcription of genes into mrna it is expressed in postmitotic projection neurons and is critical for normal brain development tbr1 has been shown to be expressed in developing olfactory bulb tbr1 has also been observed in developing cerebral cortex tbr1 has several functions these include involvement in developmental process brain development neuronal differentiation axon guidance and regulation of neurons in developing neocortex neuronal differentiation tbr1 along with pax6 and tbr2 has a role in glutamatergic projection neuron differentiation glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity dependent manner excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate as opposed to inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps each associated with one of aforementioned transcription factors first starts out with expression of pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at ventricular surface in next step pax6 is downregulated and tbr2 is expressed as cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell likewise in final step tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as tbr1 signals transition into a postmitotic projection neuron modulation of nmdar in cultured hippocampal neurons tbr1 and calcium calmodulin dependent serine kinase cask interact with cask interacting nucleosome assembly protein cinap to modulate expression of n methyl d aspartic acid receptor subunit 2b nr2b by acting on its promoter region tbr1 is a transcriptional regulator of an essential subunit of nmda receptors axon guidance cells that stop dividing post mitotic and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development are important in laying groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in early development of cerebral cortex it is largely expressed in post mitotic neurons of preplate which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move as a transcription factor tbr1 modulates expression of reln which encodes reln protein that forms part of extracellular matrix of cells thus through regulation of reln expression tbr1 regulates formation of matrix through which neurons migrate without tbr1 neurons fail to migrate properly tissue and cellular distribution thumb corticogenesis in wild type mice similar neuronal migration occurs in humans in development of six layered cerebral cortex being a transcription factor a protein that binds to specific dna sites and thereby regulates activity of specific genes tbr1 is localized in nucleus where cell s dna is located tbr1 is expressed in neurons rather than gabaergic neurons tbr1 is expressed mainly in early born postmitotic neurons of developing cerebral cortex in particular preplate and layer vi neurons preplate forms architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate successive migrations of neurons divide preplate such that its inner cells form cortical plate while its outer cells form marginal zone cortical plate and marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers known as neocortex present in mature cerebral cortex these layers are numbered i vi with layer vi being deepest and forming first while remaining layers grow outward from it from v to i layers ii vi develop from cortical plate and layer i forms from marginal zone subplate intermediate zone subventricular zone and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers high expression of tbr1 is seen in marginal zone cortical plate and subplate of developing cortex whereas little expression is seen in subventricular zone no tbr1 expression has been observed in ventricular zone other regions of tbr1 expression are olfactory bulbs and olfactory nuclei lateral hypothalamus region nucleus non human orthologs orthologs of human tbr1 gene have been identified in chimpanzee dog cow rat mouse and zebrafish thumb corticogenesis in reeler mutant mice tbr 1 mutation results in similar abnormalities in cortical migration through reduction of reelin expression mice in mice tbr1 has been found to function in development of brain eye immune system mesoderm and placenta it is also involved in glutamatergic neuronal differentiation in developing mouse brain it was discovered that tbr 1 is expressed by postmitotic cortical neurons in mice and in humans one target gene of tbr1 in mouse brain is reln or reelin tbr 1 mutant mice have been found to have reduced reln expression resulting in improper neuronal migration particularly in cajal retzius cells of marginal zone other studies in mice have found that tbr1 is a repressor or fezf2 it has also been found to negatively regulate corticospinal tract formation zebrafish studies in zebrafish danio show that tbr1 is highly conserved across species tbr1 cdna clones from zebrafish were acquired by screening a zebrafish embryo using a phosphorus labeled probe tbr1 found in zebrafish zf tbr1 has 83 97 amino acid identity to orthologs in humans hu tbr1 xenopus x eomes and mice mu tbr1 zebrafish tbr1 is only expressed in forebrain not in other regions of zebrafish embryo lancelets evolution of tbr1 has been studied in also known as lancelets a t box containing cdna was isolated in lancelet and found to possess a t domain orthologous to that of t brain subfamily of t box genes specifically tbr1 however lancelets lack a true brain and no tbr1 transcripts were found in neural tissue of lancelet this suggests that neuronal role of tbr1 evolved in vertebrates after lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of vertebrates gene regulation tbr1 both positively and negatively regulates gene expression in postmitotic neurons genes regulated by tbr1 fezf2 is a gene that is regulated by tbr1 fezf2 expression is observed in layer v of cerebral cortex cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers fezf2 expression is restricted to layer v for proper development and migration of neurons of corticospinal tract which is derived from layer v neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control recent studies show that tbr1 expressed in layer vi binds directly to fezf2 gene preventing fezf2 expression in layer vi in this manner tbr1 acts as a transcription repressor of fezf2 mutation of tbr1 results in fezf2 expression in layer vi and malformation of corticospinal tract abnormal activation of tbr1 in layer v eliminates corticospinal tract formation bhlhb5 is a gene marker in mouse brain which is involved in differentiation of caudal identity in layer v neurons of developing cortex and is regulated by tbr1 it is expressed at high levels in caudal regions but is not generally observed in frontal cortex tbr1 is expressed at very high levels in frontal cortex and very lower levels in caudal regions using tbr1 null mutants it was found that bhlhb5 is up regulated in absence of tbr1 this up regulation of bhlhb5 led to conclusion that tbr1 suppresses caudal identity while promoting frontal identity gene auts2 is also regulated by tbr1 autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene auts2 is a marker of frontal identity in developing cortex and has been linked to mental retardation and autism auts2 is a target of transcription factor tbr1 in neocortex tbr1 is involved in both binding and activation of auts2 gene co regulatory proteins tbr1 forms a complex with cask and regulates gene expression in cortical development tbr1 binds to kinase gk domain of cask it was determined that c terminal domain of tbr1 in crucial and solely capable of this process through luciferase reporter assays of neurons in hippocampus it was found that increased tbr1 cask complex expression results in enhanced promoter activity in genes downstream of tbr1 such as nmdar subunit 2b nmdar2b glycine transporter interleukin 7 receptor il 7r and ox 2 genes nmdar2b experienced greatest change in activity tbr1 and cask also play an important role in activation of reln gene one study suggests that cask acts as a of tbr1 interacting with cinap cask interacting nucleosome assembly protein to form a complex with tbr1 tbr1 cask cinap complex regulates expression of nmdar2b and reln which both play important roles in long term potentiation sox5 is another co regulatory protein of tbr1 sox5 is a marker of layer vi neurons in neocortex it aids in suppression of layer v neuron identity within layer vi cortical neurons through suppression of fezf2 tbr1 is involved in downstream regulation of sox5 sox5 expression was reduced in tbr1 null mutants it has been found that sox5 interacts with tbr1 to regulate fezf2 transcription in layer vi cortical neurons transcription factors that regulate expression of tbr1 studies suggest that af9 protein acts as a repressor of tbr1 in upper layers of six layer developing cerebral cortex thereby confining tbr1 to lower cortical layers preplate subplate layer vi this process is regulated through interaction of af9 with methyltransferase dot1l which methylates histone h3 lysine 79 h3k79 af9 association with dot1l enhances methylation of h3k79 at tbr1 transcription start site thereby interfering with rna polymerase ii activity and reducing tbr1 expression mutants of af9 experience increased of h3k79 and increased tbr1 expression clinical significance tbr1 has been implicated in alterations in brain that may lead to alzheimer s disease ad and parkinson s disease pd tbr1 expressing mice showed that cholinergic neurons of basal forebrain degeneration of which are involved in development of ad and pd migrate from ventral pallium to this was confirmed using tbr1 null mice in future researchers plan to explore role of amyloid precursor protein app in neuronal migration and linkage to these diseases reduced function of nmda receptors play a role in schizophrenia this diminished function of nmda receptor may be correlated with reduced expression of nmda receptor 2b subunit nr2b which has also been linked to schizophrenia tbr1 in complex with protein cinap is responsible for regulating transcription of nr2b gene it was hypothesized in one 2010 study that reduced tbr1 and cinap expression may be responsible for reduced expression of nr2b subunit observed in brains of postmortem schizophrenics however tbr1 and cinap expression were not significantly reduced in postmortem brains suggesting that synthesis and processing of nr2b via tbr1 is not responsible for reduced nr2b expression in schizophrenics tbr1 expression has been shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine prenatal cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both gaba neuron migration from basal to dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in dorsal forebrain this exposure also decreased tbr1 and tbr2 expression however further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed tbr1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation therefore in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed tbr1 is also used in immunohistochemical techniques in neurological research it has been used to identify layer vi developing cortical neurons as well as eminence pallium and dorsal forebrain presence of tbr1 in stem cells responding to telencephalon injury implicates normal function of these cells in this region of brain mutations of this gene have also been associated with medulloblastoma this gene has also been known to cause a rare phenotype known as tbr1 spectrum disorder which consists of autism spectrum disorder learning and intellectual disabilities and visual epilepsy less than 100 confirmed cases have been reported and it s associated variants are currently classified as a variants of unknown significance although this gene has strong ties to autism spectrum disorder variants can occur in a dominant and recessive manner both types have been known to cause problems but dominant form is most common see also t box family tbr2 tbx21 references
