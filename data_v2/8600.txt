was launched on 1 august 1915 but due to shifting construction priorities in time of war she was not completed until 10 may 1917 by which time it was too late for her to see any significant operations in world war i at time british naval intelligence believed ship was commissioned so late because she had had parts removed to repair derfflinger after battle of jutland in june 1916 in actuality construction proceeded slowly because of labor shortages sms hindenburg was last battlecruiser completed for imperial german navy and as such had a very short career she was fully operational by 20 october 1917 but this was too late to see any major operation in world war i on 17 november hindenburg and along with light cruisers of ii scouting group were acting as distant support for german minesweepers off german coast when minesweepers were attacked by british warships british raiders included new battlecruisers and however raid was brief by time hindenburg and moltke arrived on scene

battlecruisers had reached a position approximately 60 kilometers southwest of bergen when moltke lost her inner starboard propeller without resistance from water propeller less shaft began spinning faster and faster until one of engine gears flew apart shrapnel from broken machinery damaged several boilers and tore a hole in hull ship was dead in water ship s crew effected temporary repairs which allowed ship to steam at however it was decided to take ship under tow by battleship despite this setback hipper continued northward by 14 00 hipper s force had crossed convoy route several times but had found nothing at 14 10 hipper turned his ships southward by 18 37 german fleet had made it back to defensive minefields surrounding their bases it was later discovered that convoy had left port a day later than expected by german planning staff later planned operations thumb hindenburg steams to scapa flow on 11 august 1918 hipper was promoted to admiral and given command of entire

destroyers one on flanders and another on shipping in thames estuary hindenburg and other four battlecruisers were to support thames attack after both strikes fleet was to concentrate off dutch coast where it would meet grand fleet in battle while fleet was consolidating in wilhelmshaven war weary sailors began deserting en masse as von der tann and derfflinger passed through locks that separated
