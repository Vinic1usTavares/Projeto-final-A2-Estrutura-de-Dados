during celebrations in illinois he had been to see treasury secretary william g mcadoo and mint director raymond t baker neither had any objection to legislation though mcadoo had explained that problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected and many were returned to mint for melting after telling of his meeting with officials wheeler explained to committee that coins would be purchased by state treasurer of illinois and so there would be no returns james l slayden of texas asked what cost to federal government would be but wheeler did not know slayden asked what had been cost for 1916 1917 mckinley birthplace memorial dollar and ohio s william a ashbrook chairman of committee said that cost of dies had been borne by group purchasing coins from government ashbrook proposed amending bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by illinois wheeler had no objection and stated that to avoid returns it might be best if issue was limited to 100 000 coins rather than 200 000 in original bill ashbrook then asked if coins were to be sold at a premium by centennial committee and wheeler denied this indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar this concluded public hearing on bill with committee to take further action in executive session on march 12 ashbrook submitted a report on behalf of his committee recommending passage of bill once it had been amended to reduce authorized mintage from 200 000 to 100 000 and to add a statement that united states government would not be responsible for cost of dies wheeler presented bill on floor of house of representatives on april 6 1918 he was quizzed by north carolina s claude kitchin who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by committee whether mcadoo and baker had approved bill and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state s centennial there was not wheeler reassured kitchin as to unanimity of committee and approval by officials but did not answer centennial question definitively instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues louisiana purchase exposition dollar and panama pacific commemorative coins ashbrook intervened assuring kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it kitchin had no more questions and house approved bill without a recorded vote h r was transmitted to senate where it was referred to committee on banking and currency that committee s chairman oklahoma s robert l owen reported it back with an amendment to full senate where bill was considered on may 21 1918 house passed bill had said laws relating to minor coinage of united states cent and nickel would apply to coin this was changed to state that laws relating to subsidiary silver coinage which half dollar was would apply bill was passed as amended without objection later in day illinois senator james hamilton lewis made a statement which was inserted in congressional record at this point applauding passage of honor to his home state and noting that more than a hundred thousand of her sons were then being deployed to battlefields of world war i since versions two houses had passed were not identical bill returned to house of representatives where on may 25 arizona s carl hayden successfully moved that house agree to senate amendment speaker champ clark felt

federal shield an olive branch is seen but without any arrows representing war even though these symbols are often paired on u s coins anthony swiatek and walter breen suggested their presence on a

seal of illinois secretary mcadoo had originally rejected submissions acting mint director mary m o reilly wrote to philadelphia mint superintendent adam m joyce on june 24 1918 relaying treasury secretary s concerns mcadoo specifically direct ed that illinois state motto be deleted from scroll in eagle s beak on reverse to be replaced with national one joyce was told to follow provisions of coinage act of 1873 requiring that on one side there be word liberty a design emblematic of it and year of striking with other side an eagle with name of country and denomination of coin despite

liberty half dollar first issued 1916 later commentators have praised coin taxay deemed obverse undoubtedly finest work morgan ever did in his forty eight years with mint head is not merely well drawn there is in it a depth of feeling and introspective mood that almost makes observer feel he is intruding on great man writers on commemorative coins including arlie slabaugh and david m also admired illinois piece q david bowers deemed sinnock s reverse finest work he ever did for a legal tender coin not excluding roosevelt dime 1946 and franklin half dollar 1948 posthumous bowers noted that border of both sides of coin consists of beads and pellets an attractive substitute for denticles art historian cornelius vermeule in his 1971 book on artistry of american coins and medals wrote that morgan s interpretation has captured restless plasticity of o connor s bust yet another indication of benefits for coin design of good monumental models in sculpture he noted of sinnock s reverse little burst of sun at right is almost a bow to roty saint gaudens weinman developments outside philadelphia mint in american numismatic taste and iconography in generation following 1900 sinnock s composition can be called conventional but entire aura of coin reflects american art after civil war and this is perhaps truly appropriate for only pre 1954 commemorative coin to honor abraham lincoln
