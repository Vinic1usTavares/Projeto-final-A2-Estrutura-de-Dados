production given hasbro s framework for littlest pet shop cahills pitched their adaptation of property hasbro originally felt discouraged over having show set at pet store finding exchange of animals they thought would come from that disconcerting cahills saw studio s definition of such stores as antiquated convincing them that most modern locations provide grooming and day care services as opposed to merely selling pets production followed quickly to their surprise studio defined only blythe and pets as characters so cahills sought to expand human character s fictional universe designing blythe s friends mrs twombly and biskit twins julie explained that she and her husband s preference for quirky comedy inspired that of show while show is aimed at a demographic of young girls julie said that she and writers attempt to cater to boys of same age and parent viewers simultaneously original music for show is accomplished by film and television composers daniel ingram and steffan andrews ingram wrote that urban setting of littlest pet shop prompted use of a modern style of music score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for same reason ingram found hasbro s pushing of limitations for music in daytime television a source of pride each 22 minute episode takes approximately a year to complete three to four episodes are produced simultaneously storyboard
