first day of pre production on album bassist mark hoppus asked an engineer to explain pro tools to him as it was first time band would record their music digitally he began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with software when guitarist tom delonge and drummer travis barker arrived they too began adding new tracks to project song was written in one day i think if i sit there and try to analyze everything what would be cool here or there i just feel like i get so far away from what i would do and i think your gut instinct is usually best thing said barker at time lyrics were written with hoppus and delonge going into separate rooms hoppus writing choruses and delonge writing verses two had not spoken to each other about lyrics ahead of time and it turned out that two had both written about sex when put together song represents lustful side of sex during verses passionate side in bridge and romantic side in chorus creating a juxtaposition between both voices it has been interpreted as a description for failed romance one that illustrates a scenario of lust ambivalence and regret for barker song s drum track was super in respect to john bonham we were kind of messing around with verse it s like well i want to do a four bar drum intro and just see how it works for song and we never second guessed it we were like that sounds rad according to engineer ryan hewitt track contains four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing song was recorded part by part committing to different sounds by changing relative levels eq and compression throughout and engineers would slightly move microphones used to record barker s drum kit to tailor natural ambience of home it was recorded in upon playback of a rough mix of song engineer automated music to fade at song s conclusion but mistakenly forgot to do same for vocal tracks hoppus who had been listening to beach boys at time liked a cappella interplay of their voices all agreed to keep it in final version of song composition thumb left 170px alt a man plays a drum kit in front of an american flag drummer travis barker was influenced by john bonham on song song is composed in key of e major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 173 beats per minute vocal range spans from e3 to b4 feeling this opens with flanged drums although computer technology offered it during album s production according to hoppus band opted to produce effect old school way opting for two tape machines originally taking root as a faster paced drum n bass inspired track barker imitated that genre s groove on open hi hats influence of john bonham is most explicit in song s first few seconds in which barker performs eighth note triplets on his bass drum much like led zeppelin song good times bad times 1969 following a sample from captain america 1990 get ready for action song moves into a stabbing guitar rhythm over verses which are half barked and contain delivery reminiscent of hip hop shooman 2010 p 121 harmony rich chorus of song which contains refrain fate fell short this time smile fades in summer place your hand in mine i ll leave when i wanna is replete with a syncopated latin flavored backbeat shooman 2010 p 120 in chorus barker plays a cowbell which he initially included as a joke believing hoppus and delonge would hate it song is particularly memorable for a section of chorus of song right before bridge begins in which guitarist tom delonge sings vocals loudly and off key according to liner notes for blink 182 delonge stated that recording was done in a living room at home previously mentioned with microphones away end of song is a melodic duet between band s two vocalists both singing conflicting but harmonizing parts release blink 182 first performed feeling this alongside other new songs from blink 182 during their performances at 2003 reading and leeds festivals band picked feeling this as first single because they felt it representative of transition they had undergone since their fourth studio album take off your pants and jacket 2001 a slightly different version of song had been released previously as part of soundtrack for video game madden nfl 2004 under erroneous title action barker explained in an interview that action just sounded kind of dorky to us like we would always call it feeling this and then

first love andy doerschuk of drum praised barker s fat syncopated beat and noted elements of bonham as well as james brown s drummers rolling stone jenny eliscu made note of its catchy hooks while stephen thompson writing for a v club considered it among many songs on album that were straightforwardly conventional music video thumb alt a decaying building formerly a jail clip was shot at abandoned lincoln heights jail north of downtown los angeles video follows students at a dystopian based correctional facility who rebel and take over establishment intertwined with shots of band performing outside prison in a cage providing a soundtrack to chaos shooman 2010 p 129 hoppus described their idea for facility it s kind of a combination of prep school and reform school and it s very repressed and kids are being held down there is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regimen and kids lash out and take over school and destroy place band s main goal for video was for it to resemble an art piece much in same way they viewed production of album to keep in line with tone to this end they enlisted director david lachapelle lachapelle s input which ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching school kids to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic moves down hallways was regarded by band as completely wacked out and twisted which is exactly what we love in narrative boys and girls are separated at school and sexually repressed and release their energies when they meet between a glass window clip was shot at abandoned lincoln heights jail
