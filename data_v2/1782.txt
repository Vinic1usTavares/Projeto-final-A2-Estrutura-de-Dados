began speaking of cliffhanger it became a really fun challenge out of that cliffhanger says aubuchon came some really positive things that propel a lot of storytelling in second season and writers came up with a pretty cool way for tom mason to get off that spaceship again you ll always catch people after a huge trauma saying oh it wasn t that bad or it was fun or it was cool falling off that cliff says aubuchon truth is at first it was like oh my god should i just say i can t do this job ultimately though i think it turned out cool series lead noah wyle received several phone calls after first season finale aired number one question was what hell were you doing getting on that spaceship he said that they wrote themselves into a corner moon bloodgood who plays dr anne glass says she was sort of daunted but impressed by writing aubuchon added that tom mason s capture helped writer s change character slightly he stated tom comes away from that experience feeling used and manipulated it wasn t experience he expected he thought he was going to be having a nice conversation with an extraterrestrial being it turned out to be worse than that more than that i won t say but that s what made it fun greg beeman who directed episode spoke about remi aubuchon s hiring he said that remi had a lot of ideas about how to keep good stuff we d established in season 1 and diminish things that weren t as strong steven spielberg s original conception of falling skies was that characters in series would be nomadic idea for second season was to create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag tag tents chris who was director of photography in first season was unable to return due to commitments on another series and nate goodman was hired aubuchon and beeman discussed what was a head for characters this season and soon after beeman called connor jessup who plays ben mason and said i ve just heard what plans are for you for this season and my strong advice is that you get a trainer and start eating your wheaties you are in a huge storyline is going to revolve around you you re a warrior you re a skitter killer and you re a badass jessup hired a trainer that very day reception ratings in its original american broadcast worlds apart was seen by an estimated 4 46 million household viewers according to nielsen media research episode was down 24 from its

stated skies has made bad guys intriguing and now if it can only get serious about character development with good ones humans then second season will be a big improvement maureen ryan of huffington post compared episode to first season by saying season 2 is a different animal a much leaner and meaner machine that allows sentiment to be present but unexpressed and depicts a darker world in which innocence is a luxury that no one can truly afford chuck barney declared sunday s explosive two hour opener boldly delivers on promise by tnt producers to rev up both pace and firepower in season 2
