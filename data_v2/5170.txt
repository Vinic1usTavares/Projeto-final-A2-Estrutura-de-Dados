battle of port louis was a minor naval engagement of french revolutionary wars fought on 11 december 1799 at mouth of tombeau river near port louis on french indian ocean island of ile de france later known as mauritius preneuse had originally been part of a powerful squadron of six frigates sent to indian ocean in 1796 under command of contre amiral pierre cesar charles de sercey but squadron dispersed in 1798 and by summer of 1799 preneuse was only significant french warship remaining in region battle was culmination of a three month raiding cruise by 40 gun french navy frigate preneuse commanded by captain jean matthieu adrien lhermitte ordered to raid british commerce in mozambique channel lhermitte s cruise had been eventful with an inconclusive encounter with a squadron of small british warships in algoa bay on 20 september and an engagement with 50 gun hms jupiter during heavy weather on 9 11 october returning to ile de france in december lhermitte steered for port louis but was intercepted by british blockade squadron comprising 74 gun ship of line hms tremendous and 50 gun hms adamant unable to reach safety lhermitte evaded pursuit long enough to drive preneuse onto a beach at mouth of tombeau after a brief exchange of fire wrecked frigate was surrendered and british boarding parties in ship s boats rowed inshore to preneuse removed survivors and burnt remains watching from shore as last of his command burned on beach sercey subsequently retired from military service background in 1796 british royal navy dominance in east indies during french revolutionary wars was challenged by arrival of a squadron of six french navy frigates commanded by contre amiral pierre cesar charles de sercey among these ships was new 40 gun frigate preneuse commanded by captain jean matthieu adrien lhermitte preneuse had not sailed from france with sercey instead passing independently through atlantic and uniting with squadron at port louis on ile de france sercey deployed his squadron to dutch east indies but suffered frustration at action of 9 september 1796 and bali strait incident of january 1797 and subsequently returned to base at port louis there squadron began to fracture with a succession of ships sent back to france or detached on independent missions preneuse separated in march 1798 carrying messages of support and 86 military volunteers for tipu sultan of kingdom of mysore an enemy of british in southern india who sought to form an alliance with france lhermitte s instructions emphasised subtlety in operation but on 20 april he attacked british port of tellicherry and seized east indiaman merchant ships and raymond this alerted british to preneuse s mission and although reinforcements were landed safely at mangalore on 24 april diplomatic relations between british and mysore collapsed leading to fourth anglo mysore war following year in which tipu sultan was killed and his kingdom absorbed into british india lhermitte then sailed to rejoin sercey and corvette brule gueule at batavia in dutch east indies for a planned junction with an allied spanish squadron at manila this combined force then attacked an east india company convoy gathering in pearl river in january 1799 but in ensuing macau incident they were driven off by royal navy escort squadron dispirited sercey returned westwards to ile de france narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large british squadron blockading port on arrival he discovered that preneuse and brule gueule were only ships remaining of his original command others having

france on 26 september carrying condemned political prisoners corvette was eventually wrecked on pointe du raz with heavy loss of life preneuse was ordered to operate against british trade off coast of southeast africa sailing from port louis on 4 august lhermitte focused his efforts on mozambique channel and approaches to british cape colony and on 20 september encountered a squadron anchored in algoa bay comprising 24 gun naval storeship hms camel 16 gun hms rattlesnake 1791 and schooner surprise former ships lying with their masts and rigging removed this force was supporting an expeditionary army under general francis dundas fighting third xhosa war camel was laden with military supplies but neither ship was prepared for battle with a 30 of camel s sailors and 15 from rattlesnake trapped on shore by surf lhermitte approached anchored ships at 18 00 flying false danish colours and anchored nearby a ship s boat from camel approached new arrival rapidly realising that preneuse was a hostile frigate and returning to their ship lieutenant william fothergill most senior officer with convoy fired warning shots close to frigate which lhermitte ignored both british ships then prepared for action at 20 30 preneuse began to approach rattlesnake and fothergill opened fire immediately joined by camel lhermitte returned fire focusing its broadside on camel by midnight camel had taken several shot in hull causing widespread flooding and crew ceased firing to man pumps lhermitte apparently believed that camel had abandoned fight and he switched fire towards rattlesnake engagement continuing until 03 30 at which point lhermitte slipped his anchor and pulled out of range remaining in bay until 10 00 before standing out to sea british losses were two killed and twelve wounded both camel and rattlesnake badly damaged it was later reported in french sources that lhermitte believed schooner surprise to be a well armed naval brig prompting his withdrawal preneuse s loss in action was around 40 killed and wounded and frigate was reported to be badly damaged messages to this effect were hastily sent to commander at cape captain george losack who sent 50 gun hms jupiter in pursuit on 9 october after spending night with convoy in algoa bay jupiter discovered preneuse at and gave chase sea was turbulent due to a strong gale from northwest and chase continued into evening before captain william granger was able to fire ranging shot at french ship lhermitte responded with his granger rapidly gained on damaged preneuse but state of sea made it impossible for him to safely open his lower deck gunports and a long range duel continued at high speed throughout night and much of following two days at 14 00 on 10 october granger was finally close enough to bring lhermitte to action but found that with his 24 pounder guns unusable he was restricted to his upper deck 12 pounder guns which were no match for lhermitte s main battery as a result rigging on jupiter was rapidly shot away and british ship fell back for urgent repairs and preneuse was able to take opportunity to escape granger returned to table bay on 16 october thumb 300px right

these ships had been sent specifically to intercept preneuse arriving at port louis on 7 december and successfully intercepting merchant french vessels benjamin and and spanish nuestra senora del carmen four days later they sighted approaching frigate and chased it northeast adamant pressing so close that lhermitte could not escape and was forced to drive frigate on shore at mouth of tombeau river within range of a large shore battery at 15 00 lhermitte ordered masts on preneuse to be cut away and frigate and battery then opened fire on adamant which was carefully sailing through coastal shoals in an effort to engage beached french ship for more than two hours hotham s ship worked its way inshore until at 17 30 it was well positioned to open fire unleashing its broadside on wrecked preneuse by 17 45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and lhermitte struck his colours preneuse had surrendered but was likely damaged beyond repair hotham and osborn discussed situation and determined to destroy wreck to deny it to french to this end three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under lieutenant edward grey sent in to attack preneuse at 20 00 this party came under fire from batteries but was able to successfully access battered french frigate at 21 00 finding that only officers and a handful of sailors remained others having been given opportunity to escape to shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war among captives was lhermitte who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to british squadron as a prisoner grey then set wrecked ship alight before returning to adamant having executed his orders without losing a single man aftermath as preneuse had gone ashore near port louis sercey had come to observe engagement and therefore witnessed destruction of last of his squadron of 1796 a commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to france and there retired from his commission later returning to his family and settling on ile de france action temporarily left french with no naval forces in east indies at all although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to british indian ocean trade routes only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in region during war was frigate was intercepted and captured at battle of mahe shortly after arrival in 1801 although substantial reinforcements did reach ile de france before outbreak of napoleonic wars in 1803 lhermitte subsequently came under criticism from historians for his failure to inflict greater damage on light force in algoa bay william james described it as a somewhat discreditable action granger was also heavily criticised for his performance in action on 11 october william laird clowes considered that no explanation of jupiter s failure can be given while james wrote of action with jupiter that undoubtedly it was a cause of triumph to captain l hermite and well calculated to wipe away disgrace
