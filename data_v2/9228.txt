1905 and shifted west in 1907 and 1923 washington state legislature created state highway board in 1905 and appropriated funds to construct but not maintain twelve highways in sparsely settled areas of state main highways in more populated areas would continue to be entirely under county control though sometimes built with 50 state aid six of these highways were east west crossings of cascades including one in corridor currently served by u s route 12 state road 5 cowlitz pass state road climbing east from a point near via cowlitz river over cowlitz pass and down towards yakima 5 for building of a state wagon road in yakima and lewis counties as follows to wit beginning at a point in center of public highway running from town of napavine to klickitat prairie in lewis county washington at point nearest to south east corner of section 10 in township 12 north of range 1 east of willamette meridian and running thence by way of klickitat prairie and riffe postoffice in a generally easterly course up cowlitz river and its tributaries to summit of cascade mountains at cowlitz pass thence easterly towards town of north yakima to a point in yakima county intersecting with a public highway leading to town of north yakima said road to be known and designated as cowlitz pass state road sum of 26 000 a 1907 amendment renamed state road 5 cowlitz natches road moved cascade crossing north to carlton pass and defined portion east of pass to follow bumping river and naches river to a point near naches east of mouth of american river this replaced part of state road 1 north yakima and natches state road which had been defined in 1897 to cross cascades north of chinook pass and included in 1905 appropriations state road no 5 or cowlitz natches road this road shall begin at a point in center of public highway running from town of napavine to klickitat prairie in lewis county washington at point nearest to southeast corner of section 10 in township 12 north of range 1 east w m and shall run thence over present surveyed line on such state road by way of sic prairie and riffe postoffice up cowlitz river and its tributaries and over summit of cascade mountains at carlton pass thence over such surveyed line for said road down bumping river and natches river to a point which bears south 73 degrees and 24 minutes east and is distant from corner of sections 27 28 33 and 34 in township 15 north range 16 east w m in yakima county washington under a 1909 law state highway board surveyed a connected network of proposed state roads included was a westerly extension of sr 5 via chehalis to south bend and aberdeen and an easterly extension to pullman a route from yakima southeast and east via tri cities to idaho was also surveyed mostly as an extension of state road 8 columbia river road 2nd extension over most feasible route of state road no 5 westerly through city of chehalis to cities of south bend in pacific county and aberdeen in chehalis county and easterly to city of pullman in whitman county 3rd extension over most feasible route of state road no 8 westerly to city of vancouver and easterly to city of walla walla and thence to eastern boundary of asotin county 6th a road beginning at a point on proposed extension of state road no 7 in vicinity of cle elum in kittitas county leading thence as nearly as practicable along yakima valley to an intersection with proposed extension of state road no 8 in benton county legislature added most of these routes to state highway system in 1913 when they formed a two tiered system of primary and secondary roads primary roads were completely controlled by state including maintenance and received only names while secondary roads kept their numbers and county maintenance national park highway replaced state road 5 west of riffe and extended as surveyed to and beyond south bend and mcclellan pass highway replaced state road 1 and continued via state road 5 to yakima majority of route from yakima via connell to pullman was not added at that time it was finally taken over in 1937 as secondary state highways 11a and 11b only route via tri cities forming part of inland empire highway continued from yakima to idaho east of pomeroy original survey had curved south using state road 16 to near oregon state line this was bypassed by 1913 designation which instead continued directly east to clarkston unlike earlier state roads these primary roads mostly followed existing passable county roads incomplete roadway between riffe and american river remained as part of secondary state road 5 and legislature designated surveyed route from national park highway near raymond north to aberdeen as secondary state road 20 in 1915 thumb right us 12 through white pass a 1923 restructuring of system re assigned numbers to almost all primary state highways state road 5 became a primary route and was greatly expanded taking over entire mcclellan pass highway and national park highway east of pacific highway former secondary state road 5 was realigned starting from near packwood heading north instead of east alongside ohanapecosh river to old mcclellan pass highway at cayuse pass west of summit of cascades new state road 5 named national park highway system now included four roads in vicinity of mount rainier national park but as road across cascades at chinook pass was not yet built these roads did not connect with each other also included in this numbering was designation of inland empire highway including yakima to clarkston as state road 3 a primary state highway to be known as state road no 5 or national park highway system is established as follows beginning at city of tacoma thence by most feasible route in a southeasterly direction through elbe and ashford to rainier national park gate also from a junction in city of elbe thence in a southerly direction through morton kosmos thence in a westerly direction through riffe and ethel to a junction with state road no 1 or pacific highway at or in vicinity of jackson prairie also from a junction at or near kosmos in lewis county in a northeasterly direction through lewis in lewis county through sheepskull gap thence in a northwesterly direction through enumclaw auburn kent to a connection with state road no 2 in vicinity of renton also from a junction at sheepskull gap in a southeasterly direction to yakima in 1925 a spur was added to state road 9 olympic highway looping around olympic peninsula connecting elma to pacific highway at grand mound and creating a shortcut between cowlitz river route and aberdeen olympic highway from elma west to aberdeen had been added to state highway system in 1905 west of and 1913 east of montesano as part of u s highway system laid out in 1925 and finalized in late 1926 u s route 410 connected aberdeen with clarkston following olympic highway state road 9 to olympia pacific highway state road 1 concurrent with us 99 to tacoma national park highway system state road 5 to yakima and inland empire highway state road 3 to clarkston this differed from present us 12 between elma and naches in that it followed route through olympia and tacoma rather than along cowlitz river however despite being part of state highway system since 1897 us 410 s crossing of cascades first between columbia river gorge and snoqualmie pass was not opened to traffic until 1931 a shortcut from near packwood east across white pass to naches very close to original plan for east half of state road 5 was added to state highway system in 1931 as another branch of highway roadway between packwood and cayuse pass added to state highway system on a different alignment in 1905 was finally completed in 1940 and white pass highway was dedicated on august 12 1951 opening a shortcut between southwest washington and yakima thumb left us 12 crossing wishkah river when u s highways were first established in 1926 us 12 ended in miles city montana and most of us 12 s current routing in washington was followed by us 410 u s route 12 was extended westward in stages an extension to lewiston idaho was approved on june 19 1962 at various times in early 1960s states of idaho washington and oregon submitted plans for further westward extension to american association of state highway officials aasho to either vancouver washington or boardman oregon or a plan submitted in 1963 had highway going only as far as pasco but all of these plans were rejected washington introduced a new system of sign route numbers in 1964 while us 410 was still signed as such present us 12 became state route 8 between us 410 at elma and us 99 i 5 at grand mound and state route 14 between us 99 i 5 at chehalis and us 410 at naches extension of us 12 to aberdeen was finally approved on june 20 1967 with us 12 taking over much of us 410 s former routing however where us 410 had crossed cascades at chinook pass us 12 used all weather white pass replacing sr 8 and sr 14 signs were changed in late december 1967 and bypassed segments of us 410 became a new sr 8 between elma and olympia and sr 410 between tacoma and naches in 1985 us 12 was moved onto i 182 while its former route through kennewick was replaced with an extension of sr 240 bypass of walla walla was opened on october 17 1973 despite local opposition that compared new elevated freeway to berlin wall since early 2000s wsdot has been constructing a four lane divided highway to replace segments of us 12 between tri cities and walla walla 180 million project was broken up into eight phases of which six have been completed between 2004 and 2012 final two phases which will bypass wallula junction and touchet were funded in 2015 statewide construction package and are scheduled to open in 2020 when complete us 12 will be relocated onto new highway and us 730 will be extended to a new interchange near wallula major intersections see also u s route 410 references external links us 12 at washington state highways
