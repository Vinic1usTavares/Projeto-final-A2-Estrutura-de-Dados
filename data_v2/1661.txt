william morris with help of an elocution tutor bevan gradually began to overcome stammer that he had suffered with since childhood bevan remained at college until 1921 attending at a time when a number of his contemporaries from south wales including jim griffiths were also students at college however some historians have questioned how influential college was on his political development he

aneurin bevan and walter conway conway is in middle of picture aneurin is second from right on back row and his brother billy is second right on front row bevan was one of founding members of query club with his brother billy and walter conway conway was a local miner who had been elected to bedwellty board of guardians and offered bevan advice on overcoming his stammer stating if you can t say it you don t know it bevan followed his advice often practising his speeches to his friends in order to perfect his speech and wording and remarked that conway s words were best advice i ever had query club started in 1920 or 1921 and they met in tredegar they would collect money each week for any member who needed it club intended to break hold that tredegar iron and coal company had on town

one of leaders of south wales miners miners remained on strike for six months bevan was largely responsible for distribution of strike pay in tredegar and formation of council of action an organisation that helped to raise money and provided food for miners parliament mp for ebbw vale in 1928 bevan won a seat on monmouthshire county council in tredegar central division he lost seat in

easily held seat at 1929 general election bevan gained more than twice votes of liberal candidate william griffiths receiving 20 000 votes to griffiths 8 000 in keeping with his background bevan described his initial thoughts on house of commons as a shrine to most conservative of all religions ancestor worship in parliament he soon became noticed as a harsh critic of those he felt opposed working man and woman his targets included conservative winston churchill and liberal david lloyd george as well as ramsay macdonald and margaret from his own labour party he targeted latter for her unwillingness to increase unemployment benefits he had solid support from his constituency being one of few labour mps to be unopposed in 1931 general election and this support grew through 1930s and period of great depression soon after he entered parliament bevan was briefly attracted to british union of fascists leader oswald mosley s arguments becoming one of 17 signatories of mosley memorandum in context of macdonald government s repeated economic crises including doubling of unemployment levels in january 1931 he wrote a letter to government on behalf of mosley group that raised concerns over its failure to deal with unemployment mosley broke from labour party to form his own political party but bevan refused to defect and instead announced he had no intention of leaving labour bevan s association with mosley would be used against him in subsequent years by his political rivals he married fellow socialist mp jennie lee in 1934 after pair had met in london described as more left wing than nye lee became a considerable influence on bevan s political career they were early supporters of socialists in spanish civil war and bevan visited country in 1938 in 1936 he joined board of new socialist newspaper tribune his agitations for a united socialist front of all parties of left including communist party of great britain led to his brief expulsion from labour party from march to november 1939 along with stafford cripps c p trevelyan and three others bevan and cripps had previously been threatened with disciplinary action by party for sharing a stage with a communist speaker and all party members were threatened with expulsion if they were associated with popular front bevan and another expelled mp george strauss appealed against decision bevan was readmitted to party on 20 december 1939 after agreeing to refrain from conducting or taking part in campaigns in opposition to declared policy of party he strongly criticised british government s rearmament plans in face of rise of hitler s germany saying to labour conference in autumn 1937 if immediate international situation is used as an excuse to get us to drop our opposition to rearmament programme of government next phase must be that we must desist from any industrial or political action that may disturb national unity in face of fascist aggression along that road is endless retreat and at end of it a voluntary totalitarian state with ourselves erecting barbed wire around you cannot collaborate you cannot accept logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament and at same time evade implications of collaboration all along line when occasion demands it however labour conference voted to drop its opposition to rearmament when winston churchill said that labour party should refrain from giving hitler impression that britain was divided bevan rejected this as sinister fear of hitler is to be used to frighten workers of britain into silence in short hitler is to rule britain by proxy if we accept contention that common enemy is hitler and not british capitalist class then certainly churchill is right but it means abandonment of class struggle and subservience of british workers to their own employers opposition to war time government by march 1938 bevan was writing in tribune that churchill s warnings about german intentions for czechoslovakia were a of majestic harmony compared to prime minister neville chamberlain s thin listless trickle bevan now called unsuccessfully for a popular front against fascism under leadership of labour party including even anti fascist tories when government introduced voluntary national service in december 1938 bevan argued that labour should demand nationalisation of armaments industry support democratic government of spain and sign an anglo soviet pact in return for its support when labour supported government s scheme with no such conditions bevan denounced labour for imploring people on recruiting platforms to put themselves under leadership of their opponents military training act 1939 reintroduced conscription six months later and bevan joined rest of labour party in opposing it calling it complete abandonment of any hope of a successful struggle against weight of wealth in great britain he emphasised that government had no arguments to persuade young men to fight except merely in another squalid attempt to defend themselves against redistribution of international swag in august 1939 came molotov ribbentrop pact a non aggression pact between nazi and russian governments that shocked democratic governments around world in parliament bevan argued that this was logical outcome of government s foreign policy he wanted war to be not just a fight against fascism but a war for socialism bevan was relieved that country had united against nazi germany in fight against fascism to provide a common enemy away from working class he was a strong critic of chamberlain arguing that his old rival winston churchill should become prime minister during second world war he was one of main leaders of left in commons opposing wartime coalition government bevan opposed heavy censorship imposed on radio and newspapers and wartime defence regulation 18b which gave home secretary powers to intern citizens bevan called for nationalisation of coal industry and advocated opening of a second front in western europe to help soviet union in its fight with germany in one of his most noted speeches made against churchill he railed that prime minister wins debate after debate and loses battle after battle churchill would later label bevan a squalid nuisance churchill was a frequent target of bevan s who already held a dislike of him following his intervention in tonypandy riots and 1926 united kingdom general strike which bevan considered heavy handed bevan believed that key to war was involvement of russia and considered churchill was too focused on intervention of united states bevan also feared that allowing churchill to continue unopposed and unchallenged in parliament during war would leave him almost unbeatable for labour party in future elections historian max hastings described bevan s role in parliament during war as his figures were accurate but his scorn was at odds with spirit of moment full of gratitude as was prime minister his fierce opposition made him unpopular with some portions of public at time his wife later described how couple would frequently receive parcels filled with excrement at their home bevan was critical of leadership of british army which he felt was class bound and inflexible after general neil ritchie s retreat across cyrenaica early in 1942 and his disastrous defeat by general erwin rommel at gazala bevan made one of his most memorable speeches in commons in support of a motion of censure against churchill government prime minister must realise that in this country there is a taunt on everyone s lips that if rommel had been in british army he would still have been a sergeant there is a man in british army who flung 150 000 men across ebro in spain michael dunbar he is at present a sergeant he was chief of staff in spain he won battle of ebro and he is a sergeant dunbar had been recommended for a commission but rejected it himself to remain with his unit bevan was subject to further disciplinary action in 1944 when he deliberately voted against labour s stance on new defence regulations he also voiced criticism of trade union leaders which drew complaints from both miners federation and trades union congress an administrative committee voted 71 to 60 in favour of retaining bevan as an mp although it was announced that party discipline was to be strengthened in future he believed that second world war would give britain opportunity to create a new society he often quoted an 1855 passage from karl marx that was published in new york times in 1865 redeeming feature of war is that it puts a nation to test as exposure to atmosphere reduces all mummies to instant dissolution so war passes supreme judgment upon social systems that have outlived their vitality at beginning of 1945 general election campaign bevan told his audience that his goal was to eliminate any opposition to labour programme we have been dreamers we have been sufferers now we are builders we enter this campaign at this general election not merely to get rid of tory majority we want complete political extinction of tory party and twenty five years of labour government government 1945 general election resulted in a landslide victory for labour party giving it a large enough majority to allow implementation of party s manifesto commitments and to introduce a programme of far reaching social reforms that were collectively dubbed welfare state these reforms were achieved in face of great financial difficulty following war new prime minister clement attlee appointed bevan as minister of health with a remit that also covered housing thus responsibility for instituting a new and comprehensive national health service as well as tackling country s severe post war housing shortage was given to bevan youngest member of attlee s cabinet in his first ministerial position at age of 47 although described in times as an outstanding back bench critic and one of labour s most brilliant members in debate his appointment was regarded as a relative surprise given his previous disciplinary issues bevan had clashed frequently with attlee during his time as an mp believing that labour leader failed to apply enough pressure on tory government during war he had also seen disputes with some of attlee s closest allies ernest bevin and herbert morrison who were appointed foreign secretary and leader of house respectively however attlee commented that bevan was starting with me with a clean sheet following his appointment foot vol 2 ch 1 p 25 bevan tested this new found solidarity early on by arriving to a royal banquet at st james s palace wearing a navy lounge suit he earnt a rebuke from attlee but bevan contended that his welsh mining constituency did not send him to parliament to dress up and he declined to wear formal attire at further buckingham palace functions allan michie god save queen p 159 1952 minister of health 1945 1951 thumb upright bevan talking to a patient at park hospital manchester day nhs came into being free national health service was paid for directly through public money bevan had been inspired by tredegar medical aid society in his hometown where residents would pay a subscription that would fund access for all of town s inhabitants to have free access to medical services such as nursing or dental care this system proved so popular that 20 000 people supported organisation during 1930s in 1947 bevan stated all i am doing is extending to entire population of britain benefits we had in tredegar for a generation or more we are going to tredegar ise you government income was increased for welfare state expenditure by a large increase in marginal tax rates for wealthy business owners in particular as part of what labour government largely saw as redistribution of wealth created by working class from owners of large scale industry to workers bevan argues that percentage of tax from personal incomes rose from 9 in 1938 to 15 in 1949 but lowest paid a tax rate of 1 up from 0 2 in 1938 middle income brackets paid 14 to 26 up from 10 to 18 in 1938 higher earners paid 42 up from 29 and top earners 77 up from 58 in 1938 in place of fear p 146 if you earned over ps800 000 per annum in 2005 money terms ps10 000 in 1948 you paid 76 7 income tax having been a member of cottage hospital management committee around 1928 and serving as chairman in 1929 30 bevan had received an insight into management of health services by local authorities which proved to be a bedrock of his work in founding national health service on appointed day 5 july 1948 bevan s national health service act 1946 came into force on day bevan attended a ceremony at park hospital trafford now trafford general at which he symbolically received keys to hospital scheme was achieved having overcome political opposition from both conservative party and from within his own party confrontation with british medical association bma was led by charles hill who published a letter in british medical journal describing bevan as a complete and uncontrolled dictator members of bma had dubbed him tito of tonypandy they threatened to derail national health service scheme before it had even begun as medical practitioners continued to withhold their support just months before launch of service after eighteen months of ongoing dispute between ministry of health and bma bevan finally managed to win over support of vast majority of medical profession by offering a couple of minor concessions including allowing consultants to keep their own private practices but without compromising fundamental principles of his national health service proposals bevan later gave famous quote that to broker deal i stuffed their mouths with gold some 2 688 voluntary and municipal hospitals in england and wales were nationalised and came under bevan s supervisory control as health minister bevan said conservative opposition of national health service scheme feared that sudden access to free health care would be overrun in its early stages this proved true as service went vastly over budget in its inaugural year and attlee was forced to make a radio address to nation in an attempt to limit strain on system bevan countered that initial overspending was down to years of underinvestment in british medical system prior to second world war by start of 1950s early overspending had come to an end housing reform thumb upright statue of bevan in cardiff by robert thomas when bevan was made a minister in 1945 he envisioned social housing sector as a housing service similar to national health service ensuring that everyone had access to decent and affordable homes with people still having option to live in owner occupation or private sector if they so chose with grants made available to owner occupiers and private landlords to bring dwellings up to decent standards removal of criteria of working class from local authority housing provision was seen as a first step widening access to council housing that was becoming an ever larger part of uk housing stock and which made up a majority of new homes built after war aim was to create new homes and communities with a place for all sections of society substantial bombing damage with over 700 000 homes needing repair in london alone and continued existence of pre war slums in many parts of country made task of housing reform particularly challenging for bevan indeed these factors exacerbated by post war restrictions on availability of building materials and skilled labour collectively served to limit bevan s achievements in this area bevan was also limited due to his desire for new homes to be bigger and of better quality than ones they were being built to replace based on recommendations of a 1943 report by dudley committee and a shortage of skilled workers to undertake work 1946 saw completion of 55 600 new homes this rose to 139 600 in 1947 and 227 600 in 1948 while this was not an insignificant achievement 850 000 homes built in four years immediately after war ended was biggest housing programme ever introduced bevan s rate of house building was seen as less of an achievement than that of his conservative indirect successor harold macmillan who was able to complete some 300 000 new homes a year as minister for housing in 1950s these numbers were reached by lowering quality standards originally put forward by bevan with council houses featuring gardens being largely dropped in favour of tower blocks and flats macmillan was also able to concentrate full time on housing crisis instead of being obliged like bevan to combine his housing portfolio with that for health which for bevan took higher priority he once stated tongue in cheek that he devoted five minutes a week to housing at a party rally in 1948 during a speech bevan stated that is why no amount of and no attempts at ethical or social seduction can eradicate from my heart a deep burning hatred for tory party that inflicted those bitter experiences on me so far as i am concerned they are lower than vermin they condemned millions of first class people to semi starvation comment inspired creation of vermin club by angry conservatives who attacked bevan for years for metaphor labour party deputy leader herbert morrison complained that bevan s attack had backfired for his words did much more to make tories work and vote than conservative central office could have done it was later claimed that his words had cost labour more than two million votes in 1951 with retirement of ernest bevin bevan was a leading candidate for foreign secretary prime minister attlee rejected bevan in favour of herbert morrison because he distrusted his personality in his biography of bevan john campbell wrote bevan s impetuous temperament undiplomatic tone and reputation as an extreme left winger combined to make foreign office seem last place a prudent prime minister would think of putting him at any time his vermin speech still resonated imagination shuddered at a repetition of that on international stage john campbell nye bevan a biography 1987 p 229 minister of labour and national service 1951 bevan was instead appointed minister of labour in january 1951 in place of george isaacs move was seen by some as a sideways or backwards step although a potential rearmament program was expected to make post of future importance during his tenure he helped to secure a deal for railwaymen which provided them with a significant pay increase however three months after his appointment hugh gaitskell introduced a proposal of prescription charges for dental care and spectacles created to save a potential ps25m to meet financial demands imposed by korean war an infuriated bevan stated that he would never be a member of a government that imposed charges on national health service labour mp david marquand has stated that savings were introduced by gaitskell simply to impose his will upon bevan who he saw as a political rival bevan resigned from his position two weeks later stating both proposed changes and increase in military expenditure that necessitated need for such proposals two other ministers john freeman and harold wilson resigned at same time bevan received unanimous support for his actions from his local labour constituency leaders later same year labour party were defeated at general election after bevan left health ministry in 1951 he could never regain his level of success and feuded with fellow labour leaders using his strong political base as a weapon historian kenneth o morgan says bevan alone kept flag of left wing socialism aloft throughout which gave him a matchless authority amongst constituency parties and in party conference kenneth o morgan labour in power 1985 p 57 opposition thumb aneurin bevan speaking in in 1952 bevan s last decade saw his political position weaken year by year as he failed to find a winning issue that would make use of his skills in 1952 bevan published in place of fear most widely read socialist book of period according to a highly critical right wing labour mp anthony crosland according to times literary supplement book was a with meanderings into many side tracks of mr bevan s private and public experience in opening page of book bevan begins a young miner in a south wales colliery my concern was with one practical question where does power lie in this particular state of great britain and how can it be attained by workers in march 1952 a poorly prepared bevan came off worse in an evening commons debate on health with conservative backbencher iain macleod whose performance led churchill to appoint him as minister of health some six weeks after debate out of office bevan soon exacerbated split within labour party between right and left for next five years he was leader of left wing of labour party who became known as they criticised high defence expenditure especially for nuclear weapons called for better relations with soviet union and opposed party leader clement attlee on most issues according to richard crossman bevan hated in fighting which you have to do in politics he wasn t cut out to be a leader he was cut out to be a prophet in april 1954 bevan resigned from labour parliamentary committee having being rebuked by attlee after accusing labour leader of surrendering to american pressure over a proposed multi national defence organisation in asia and pacific he later said that he had resigned his position to call attention to fact that their movement was in grave crisis and stated his belief that he would be have been party chairman by following year if he had remained in july of same year bevan announced his intention to stand for election as treasurer of labour party against hugh gaitskell his nomination received a severe blow on same day it was announced when two unions that traditionally sided with left national union of mineworkers and amalgamated engineering union pledged their support for his opponent although unsuccessful in his bid he did celebrate 25 years as mp for ebbw vale in march 1955 when britain was preparing for operation grapple testing of its first hydrogen bomb bevan led a revolt of 57 labour mps and abstained on a key vote parliamentary labour party voted 141 to 113 to withdraw whip from him but it was restored within a month due to his popularity after 1955 general election attlee retired as labour leader bevan contested leadership against both morrison and labour right winger gaitskell but it was gaitskell who emerged victorious with more than half of ballots bevan s remark that i know right kind of political leader for labour party is a kind of desiccated calculating machine was assumed to refer to gaitskell although bevan denied it commenting upon gaitskell s record as chancellor of exchequer as having proved this bevan also failed in a bid to become deputy leader losing out to jim griffiths he instead stood again for role of party treasurer and was duly elected beating george brown despite bevan s criticism of new party leader gaitskell decided to appoint him as shadow colonial secretary and then shadow foreign secretary in 1956 bevan was as critical of egyptian president colonel nasser s seizure of suez canal on 26 july 1956 as he was of subsequent anglo french military response he compared nasser with ali baba and forty thieves from one thousand and one nights callaghan john british labour party and international relations socialism and war p 233 he was a vocal critic of conservative government s actions in suez crisis noticeably delivering high profile speeches at a protest rally in trafalgar square on 4 november 1956 and criticising government s actions and arguments in commons on 5 december 1956 bevan accused government of a policy of bankruptcy and despair stating at trafalgar rally we are stronger than egypt but there are other countries stronger than us are we prepared to accept for ourselves logic we are applying to egypt if nations more powerful than ourselves accept absence of principle anarchistic attitude of eden and launch bombs on london what answer have we got what complaint have we got if we are going to appeal to force if force is to be arbiter to which we appeal it would at least make common sense to try to make sure beforehand that we have got it even if you accept that abysmal logic that decadent point of view we are in fact in position today of having appealed to force in case of a small nation where if it is appealed to against us it will result in destruction of great britain not only as a nation but as an island containing living men and women therefore i say to anthony i say to british government there is no count at all upon which they can be defended they have besmirched name of britain they have made us ashamed of things of which formerly we were proud they have offended against every principle of decency and there is only one way in which they can even begin to restore their tarnished reputation and that is to get out get out get out bevan dismayed many of his supporters when he suddenly reversed his opposition to nuclear weapons speaking at 1957 labour party conference he decried unilateral nuclear disarmament saying it would send a british foreign secretary naked into conference chamber this statement is often misconstrued bevan argued that unilateralism would result in britain s loss of allies and one interpretation of his metaphor is that nakedness would come from lack of allies not lack of weapons according to journalist paul routledge donald bruce a former mp and parliamentary private secretary and adviser to bevan had told him that bevan s shift on disarmament issue was result of discussions with soviet government where they advised him to push for british retention of nuclear weapons so they could possibly be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with united states in 1957 bevan richard crossman and labour party s general secretary morgan phillips sued spectator magazine for libel after one of its writers described them as drinking heavily during an italian socialist party conference article wrote that three men puzzled italians by their capacity to fill themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee although italians were never sure british delegation were sober they always attributed to them an immense political acumen three won their case and obtained financial damages of ps2 500 each crossman later acknowledged that they had perjured themselves to do so roy jenkins wrote of his former colleagues in aneurin bevan in portraits and miniatures 2011 that they sailed to victory on unfortunate combination of lord chief justice goddard s prejudice against anti hanging and generally libertarian spectator of those days and perjury of plaintiffs subsequently exposed in crossman s endlessly revealing diaries geoffrey wheatcroft wrote in guardian 18 march 2000 lies and libel fifteen years later crossman boasted in my presence that they had indeed all been heavily and that at least one of them had been blind drunk dominic lawson wrote in independent chris huhne s downfall is another example of amazing risks a politician will take 4 february 2013 crossman s posthumously published diaries revealed that story was accurate and in 1978 brian inglis on what papers say revealed that crossman had told him a few days after case that they had committed perjury mihir bose in britain s libel laws malice aforethought history today 5 may 2013 quotes bevan s biographer john campbell to effect that case had destroyed career of young journalist involved jenny nicholson in 1959 bevan was elected as deputy leader of labour party succeeding griffiths his last speech in house of commons in debate of 3 november 1959 on queen s speech referred to difficulties of persuading electorate to support a policy which would make them less well off in short term but more prosperous in long term death bevan had said i would rather be kept alive in efficient if cold altruism of a large hospital than expire in a gush of warm sympathy in a small one he checked into royal free hospital in london at end of 1959 to undergo surgery for an ulcer but malignant stomach cancer was discovered instead after a lengthy period in hospital he returned home and announced he would not be returning to politics in near future so as to be able to recuperate and plan an extended holiday bevan died at 4 10pm on 6 july 1960 at age of 62 at his home farm chesham buckinghamshire his remains were cremated at gwent crematorium in in a private family ceremony an open air service was held in his constituency of ebbw vale and was presided over by donald soper jennie lee explained in a letter to michael foot that bevan had specifically chosen to have a non religious funeral and not a christian service because he was a firm humanist in his 2014 biography nick thomas symonds described an outpouring of national mourning that followed bevan s death daily herald stated that some mps were seen to be crying in parliament and described how there was sorrow at every street corner in south wales valleys harold macmillan ended his prime minister s questions session in parliament two days after bevan s death by paying tribute to opposition mp describing him as a great
