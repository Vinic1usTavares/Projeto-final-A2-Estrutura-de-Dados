to solomon r guggenheim museum jonas skarssen chairman of ibbc reveals to his senior men white and wexler that bank had calvini killed so that they could deal with his sons to buy missile guidance systems in which bank has invested since bank knows that salinger and whitman are close to finding their assassin they send a hit team to kill him at a meeting between him and his handler wexler wexler leaves and is arrested by ornelas as salinger speaks to assassin a shootout at guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attempt to kill them with automatic weapons they escape but assassin is

calvini to avenge their father s murder by bank salinger is left stunned his investigation pursuit and determination to bring down ibbc have led him to nothing during closing credits it is indicated that bank is successfully continuing with its operations despite death of its chairman as skarssen had predicted to salinger before he was killed however with new and more aggressive chairman it is hinted that ibbc s increased expansion and aggression will ultimately lead to its downfall as shown by last panel revealing beginnings of a united states senate investigation headed by whitman cast clive owen as louis salinger naomi watts as eleanor whitman armin mueller stahl as wilhelm wexler ulrich thomsen as jonas skarssen brian f o byrne as consultant michel as viktor haas patrick as martin

detective bernie ward sun as detective gloria hubbard steven randazzo as al moody tibor feldman as dr isaacson james rebhorn as new york d a remy auberjonois as sam ian burfield as thomas schumer axel milberg as klaus diemer ben whishaw as rene production screenplay was written by eric warren singer after he developed an interest in banking scandals from 1980s and 90s he was looking for a paranoid thriller vibe from that period godfather iii was really only film up to this point that dealt with banking scandals because it was really gangster warfare on a corporate level and i thought that was best part of film later reviewers compared it directly to parallax view 1974 and all president s men 1976 ridley scott initially expressed an interest in directing film and studio agreed to finance project only for scott to drop out a year later tom tykwer got involved through his agent but decided a contemporary setting would work better in april 2007 clive owen agreed to perform in international he said script interested him because he was reminded of those 70s paranoia pictures and because it combined a factual intelligent basis with an international thriller plot following july actress naomi watts was cast opposite owen in august film received us 5 4 million from toward its budget following month its funding increased to 7 9 million based on board s assessment that two thirds of international would be produced in germany and that a number of germans were in important roles such as actors armin mueller stahl and axel milberg cinematographer frank griebe and production designer uli hanisch filming began in berlin on 10 september 2007 part of production took place in babelsberg studios clive owen called shoot out scene one of most exquisitely executed sequences i ve been involved in tom tykwer planned scene in detail and toured museum with principals months in advance lobby entrance scene was filmed in solomon r guggenheim museum in new york but for shooting sequences a wide life size replica including an audio visual exhibition with works of julian was built in germany this set was too large for studio so it was instead built in a disused locomotive warehouse outside berlin its construction took ten weeks having filmed in real museum interior and on sound stage in germany film crew had to track lights and camera angles carefully throughout to ensure continuity scene includes a sequence in which protagonist sends a huge art chandelier hanging from ceiling crashing to ground entire stunt was created using computer generated imagery themes clive owen discussing film s relevance said it ultimately does ask questions about whether banks use people s money appropriately and if they re completely sound institutions more baldly put philip french reviewing film in observer surmised sentiment as let s kill all bankers a modern day version of dick butcher s first thing we do let s kill all lawyers from shakespeare s henry vi part ii salinger s owen central revelation is that world is governed by anonymous forces staffed by disposable individuals powerlessness of ordinary citizen is symbolised by huge impersonal buildings that villains inhabit film draws on a number of macabre incidents from international banking bank of credit and commerce international crisis in 1991 murder of roberto calvi an alleged banker to sicilian mafia in london in 1982 and assassination by poisoning of georgi markov in london in 1978 bank is making large loans to rogue states and simultaneously acting as their munitions broker script offers chilling insight that creditors are real winners of any conflict a o scott commented on opportunity to make a film critical of international finance that multinational weapons manufacturers can be portrayed as more decent civic minded and principled than global financiers surely says something about state of world reception box office international was first screened on 5

on rotten tomatoes consensus statement reads international boasts some electric action sequences and picturesque locales but is undone by its preposterous plot metacritic gives film a 52 rating based on 34 reviews in his review for guardian peter bradshaw wrote i felt occasionally that owen s rumpled performance is in danger of becoming a little one note but this is still an unexpectedly well made thriller with brainpower as well as firepower philip french in his review for observer called film a slick fast moving conspiracy thriller and gunfight in guggenheim spectacular in his review for independent anthony quinn wrote it s reasonably efficient entertaining and strenuously playing catch up with bourne movies flat footed owen doesn t look as good as matt damon sprinting through city streets and editing doesn t match paul greengrass s whiplash pace new yorker magazine s david denby wrote and there s a big hole in middle of movie director tom tykwer and screenwriter eric warren singer forgot to make their two crusaders human beings in his review for new york post lou lumenick wrote there an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that tykwer german director who reinvented euro thriller with run lola run a decade ago has been far surpassed by paul greengrass and bourne adventures yet thankfully lacking rampant and nonsensical roller coaster style of editing where no shot lingers for longer than a nano second a o scott in his review for new york times wrote international in contrast is so undistinguished that moments you remember best are those that you wish another more original director had tackled citing climatic shoot out in guggenheim hailed by other critics as spectacular scott wonders if another such as brian de palma could have turned into a fugue of architectural paranoia in his review for los angeles times kenneth turan wrote it s got some effective moments and aspects but film goes in and out of plausibility and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole claudia puig in her review for usa today wrote dialogue by screenwriter eric warren singer is spotty there are some great pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false roger ebert gave film three out of four stars and wrote clive owen makes a semi believable hero not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely he s handsome and has obligatory macho stubble but he has a quality that makes you worry a little about him entertainment weekly gave film a b rating and lisa schwarzbaum wrote star of pic may well be nyc s guggenheim museum and istanbul s grand bazaar both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends film earned an average rating of three stars from five from french critics according to allocine reviewing film for le monde which gave film one star jacques mandelbaum said that modern destructive forces of political fantasy and derivative finance which power film s plot should have created sparks but in reality film along while film constituted a thrilling geographic tour of genre tropes it forgot to focus on characters and mood references external links category 2009 films category
