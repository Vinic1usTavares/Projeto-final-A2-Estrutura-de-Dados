operation shed light was a crash development project in aerial warfare initiated in 1966 by united states air force to increase ability to accurately strike at night or in adverse weather during 1960s united states military worked hard to interdict movement of men and materiel along ho chi minh trail north vietnamese were experts in use of weather and darkness to conceal their movement and understanding superiority of american air power put their skills immediately to good use us forces seeking to impede steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during day with poor results united states air force focused toward nuclear weapons and delivery of such munitions against static strategic targets had spent little effort in expanding its tactical capabilities since end of world war ii operation shed light sought to rectify this by bringing together improved tactics and technology programs were subsequently centered on improved communication and navigation aids for all weather and night flying sensor equipment for seeing through clouds foliage and darkness improved equipment and methods for target marking and battlefield illumination and aircraft and tactics to utilize these developments in end few of programs would yield applicable results and most of aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity most applicable developments were those that could be such as work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment origins united states air force had largely redirected its efforts to matter of strategic deterrence in period between korean war and deployment to southeast asia as a result it had few serious capabilities for plethora of conventional missions that became readily apparent with expanding us commitment to southeast asia schlight 1988 p 227 dedicated attack aircraft were virtually nonexistent with exception of korean war era a 1 skyraider us navy was still using type at time and us air force had itself been long interested in type with this further reinforced as a result of its advisory role in south vietnam baugher joseph f american military aircraft 18 october 2001 service of ad skyraider with us air force access date 17 october 2007 us supported republic of vietnam air force was in fact using it as their primary aircraft by 1965 mesko 1987 p 38 these aircraft had directly replaced aging f8f bearcats in 1962 and decision was made in 1964 to transition to type from then standard t 28 trojans mesko 1987 p 26 8 as a result of orientation toward nuclear war tactical air strikes were flown almost exclusively by us air force between 1964 and 1966 using a variety of fighter bombers intended initially for delivery of small strategic and tactical nuclear weapons these types included f 100 super sabre f 4 phantom ii and even f 104 starfighter f 100 had two fighter bomber variants in service at time f 100c and f both of which were capable of carrying a nuclear store and only latter of which was primarily for use as a strike aircraft and not a fighter f 100c had largely been passed to united states air national guard and by 1965 less than two hundred of aircraft were capable of using cluster bombs or even largely standard aim 9 sidewinder air to air missile knaack 1986 p 121 2 f a fighter bomber version of another fighter though capable of utilizing conventional air to ground stores was intended as a nuclear weapon delivery platform knaack 1986 p 182 only f 4c and f 4d were available as a true multirole aircraft and f 4c had still been used firstly as a fighter when deployed to theater knaack 1986 p 266 only other major non fighter type in use early on in conflict was b 57 canberra strikes in laos were even conducted for a time using f 102 delta dagger modified with infrared sensors and using its internal rocket armament these strikes proved largely fruitless and were quickly discontinued pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 4 realizing need for more dedicated attack aircraft air force combed its inventory and looked to invest in new types it found itself with an odd selection of obsolete new and experimental aircraft and grasped for immediate solutions to try and coordinate this effort a task force was established by lt general james ferguson then deputy chief of staff for research and development dubbed operation shed light it began on 7 february 1966 as a means of coordinating a wide variety of technological and other projects and programs that were being pursued in order to improve united states air force s night fighting capabilities outlined in task force s charter as of april were following identify current equipment techniques and procedures being used by usaf in southeast asia identify planned modifications and new equipment being developed for southeast asia survey exploratory advanced development and operational support projects having a potential application to problem indicating current programs or schedules identify voids in our capabilities or efforts recommend courses of action to improve and or provide new attack capability in 1966 1967 and longer term united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1a 7 in all shed light task force identified nine new weapon systems and seventy seven research and development tasks in first five months of operation pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 7 over next 5 10 years it hoped to have a fully functional self contained night attack aircraft a single type that would meet operational need and would be functionally useful in other similar situations initial programs shed light s initial programs were broken down into a number of categories most important being communication and navigation systems sensors and illumination and target marking equipment also detailed were proposed aircraft modifications and tactics communication and navigation issues of communication and navigation were identified under shed light that air strikes could not be called in effectively and or guided to target reduced effectiveness of air power overall united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1c 9 11 15 a variety of communication system improvements and navigational aids including improvements to long range navigation loran system specifically loran d were incorporated into shed light mission united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1c 31 sensors thumb 250px right artist s interpretation of an a 1e aircraft with podded llltv sensors to be developed under shed light were broken into three categories low light level tv llltv forward looking infrared flir and forward looking radar flr united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1c 41 two llltv systems were in development initially both were podded designed to be added to aircraft already in usaf inventory first produced by victor under project 1533 was llltv only but had provision for a laser range finder it was intended for a 1e skyraider second produced by westinghouse under project contained both llltv and a laser ranger finder it was intended for either a 1e or b 57 canberra series united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1c 46 48 note smith 1966 p 94 mentions this program but as project 1553 one is likely a typo second unit would eventually be fitted to b 57b two programs were named projects tropic moon i and tropic moon ii respectively pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 10 11 tropic moon i system was essentially obsolete before it was deployed and tests quickly confirmed this only 4 a were so equipped results from tropic moon ii b were almost as discouraging with 456 trucks detected on 182 sorties for only 39 confirmed kills both systems were removed from theatre by end of 1968 pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 20 thumb 250px right artist s depiction of a b 26 with lonesome tiger flir a prototype flir unit had been tested under project red sea in a dc 3 at eglin afb and later in an ac 47 in south vietnam in september 1965 using technology developed from those tests project lonesome tiger was initiated testing a flir unit on two b 26 invader aircraft climate was found to have serious effects on units especially humidity and this fit was not to be put into widespread use united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1c 55 59 improvised mounting of starlight scope s in bomb bay of b 26 is also mentioned in oral history reports and this fit was found to be largely impractical kittinger 1974 p 1973 p 51 illumination equipment and target marking battlefield illumination was of key importance within original shed light programs dominant aerial flare at time was mk 24 mod 0 developed by us navy reliability of units however were in question as was availability perhaps of greater concern was existing test data in 1966 that suggested pilot disorientation and flare placement were serious issues project night owl conducted in 1954 testing flares dropped from f 86 sabre aircraft led to twenty five percent of pilots reporting experiencing some level of vertigo united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1b 13 ironically initial studies showed that in correcting this problem issues of insufficient illumination were experienced united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1b 44 a new flare designated mlu 32 b99 also referred to as was put into development new flare burned at 5 million candle power for over five minutes and produced a signal that could be heard by pilots indicating when it was about to burn out additionally navy s mk 33 mod 0 flare warhead for 5 mk 16 zuni rocket motor was tested under shed light united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1c 83 5 projected delays in procurement of mlu 32 b99 led to a proposal to test swedish lepus flare as an interim measure lepus flare was tested but found to be inferior to mlu 32 b99 united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 14 issues surrounding flares led to exploration of other methods of battlefield illumination battlefield illumination airborne system or bias employed two banks of xenon arc lamps 28 total fitted to a modified c aircraft united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1c 87 a cooling system was installed on left side of aircraft to help dissipate heat generated system was deployed to vietnam but it was found that lamps provided a perfect target for enemy gunners and system was discontinued adcock 1992 p 18 initially it had been proposed that a similar system be installed on more capable c 130 but experience during operational trials brought whole program to a halt more unorthodox methods were also explored international developed a so called quartz chamber which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel converting chemical energy into light system was planned to be evaluated within a year and installed in a similar arrangement to more conventional bias a plan codenamed moonshine was also put forward moonshine was to be a joint effort with nasa to determine feasibility of a geosynchronous satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 8 ground target marking which was a key tactic for day time strikes was investigated project 2531 was to investigate target marking munitions and looked into warheads for mk 40 2 75 rocket motor using a variety of materials united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 39 these were to be loaded with compounds developed under us navy s target illumination and recovery aid tiara program initially they used modified high explosive warheads but found amount of compound that could be contained provided poor results united states volume ii operation shed light study report 1966 p iic 147 8 shed light task force noted that a lighter case for these compounds was in development a combination of red phosphorus and a flare was investigated in an attempt to provide a system that could be used at night or during day united states volume ii operation shed light study report 1966 p iic 145 aircraft and tactics thumb 250px right artist s depiction of f 111 scna key aircraft intended to be developed under shed light was to be a self contained night attack aircraft or scna scna would have necessary night sensors and weapon delivery capability to find and strike targets at night one first pass without use of visible artificial illumination united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1d 35 however to provide an interim capability idea of using a hunter killer concept using aircraft capable of spotting targets at night and more or less unmodified conventional strike aircraft was proposed united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1d 80 2 this method had many identified disadvantages including need for specialized aircraft and capability differences between hunter and killer that might affect their combined operation need for specialized aircraft was further exposed by fact that only three aircraft at all suitable for hunter role were available to us military in southeast asia as of 1966 these included army s ov 1b mohawk and usaf s rf 4c phantom ii and rb 57e canberra aircraft united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1d 93 98 there were only two rb 57e aircraft in country at time under a special reconnaissance project codenamed patricia lynn and aircraft were essentially experimental they also featured vi flir units which was an older technology than those being developed under shed light smith 1966 p 8 rf 4c had benefit of being of a similar capability to strike aircraft at time and a modified hunter version given a designation rf 4c h was to be developed replacing camera equipment with llltv flir and side looking radar slar units united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 30 a three phase program had been outlined as early as 1966 for development of scna first would be a slower bomber or cargo aircraft followed by a jet aircraft of some type f 111 was originally slated to become key scna aircraft pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 10 it was ultimately hoped it would incorporate final versions of all three types of sensors llltv flir and flr developed under program united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1b 41 in initial study an rf 111 was also supposed to be available in 3 7 year time frame for use in hunter killer pairing united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1d 106 this time frame led initial study report to propose using ov 10 bronco aircraft in interim measure but decided against it because of inability of ov 10 to carry all desired sensor equipment united states volume i operation shed light study report 1966 p 1e 17 23 as it turned out that while rf 111a did enter testing in december 1967 it was not easily convertible to and from existing f 111a configuration air force looked for alternatives but revised rf program was terminated because of a funding shortage in september 1969 and rf 111a program was cut for good by march 1970 knaack 1986 p 233 thumb 250px right schematic of proposed as 2d bomb bay configuration with decision not to use ov 10 and desire for an immediate

report august 1967 1966 p 15 difficulties in funding getting aircraft from us navy and delays in completing modifications led usaf to scrap s 2 based scna in january 1968 f 111 would initially have a mixed record in southeast asia when a detachment of six aircraft from 474th tactical fighter wing were deployed to takhli rtafb in thailand in early 1968 as part of operation combat lancer remaining aircraft were returned to united states in november after logging 55 missions but at cost of three f 111a s lost in combat eventually aircraft redeemed itself when two squadrons 48 f from 474th deployed to takhli in september 1972 in order to participate in aerial offensive against north vietnam under operation linebacker ii during this deployment f 111s operated day and night in all weather conditions and without electronic countermeasures escort and relied on less aerial refueling support than other tactical aircraft eventually over 4000 missions were logged by two f 111 equipped units at cost of six aircraft lost in combat and two lost to operational causes thornborough tony 1993 osprey aerospace 1993 f 111 aardvark usaf s ultimate strike aircraft however by this point in time

besides automated nature of lau 74 a unit only required one loadmaster to operate it two aircraft serial numbers 54 691 and 54 698 were first designated nc 123k in 1968 and then redesignated ac 123k in 1969 from individual aircraft records cards set provided as part of information received 24 may 2007 pursuant to freedom of information act request from air force historical research agency united states air force maxwell afb al these nc ac 123ks were first deployed operationally at osan in south korea between august and october 1968 and flying in support of operations against north korean infiltrators approaching by boat operations in korea met with a certain level of success and as a result nc ac 123ks were transferred to south vietnam in november 1968 once in south vietnam aircraft were engaged in missions against transport of materiel along ho chi minh trail and in mekong delta region aircraft operated there until january 1969 when they were redeployed to ubon rtab thailand two missions a night were flown from ubon with two a 1 escorts from nakhon phanom rtab often referred to simply as nkp flying cover and providing additional firepower initial escort had been provided by f 4s but difference in speed and capabilities had made protecting lower and slower flying nc ac 123ks difficult smith undated p 41 3 area of responsibility for first six months was approximately east southeast from nkp after that area of coverage was a river in southern laos two aircraft were returned to united states to hurlburt field florida in may 1969 where a second round of training occurred four crews attended a ground school in greenville texas and returned to hurlburt where they flew aircraft for first time in october 1969 two crews flew aircraft to a second deployment at ubon other two crews arrived in early november after attending jungle survival training at clark ab in philippines missions over laos commenced final phases of program are slightly unclear some sources have missions terminating in early july 1970 and aircraft flying to bone yard at davis monthan afb where they were returned to c 123k standard then returned to south vietnam still wearing their camouflage and black undersides for transport duty description of designation in official documentation supports this by saying that nc 123k is similar to c 123k but partially from ac 123k modified to an attack configuration to permit general cargo handling and troop movement united states 1974 p a 18 however official history states that combat operations ceased 11 may 1969 with no mention of second deployment second deployment is mentioned in associated documentation but only as to when aircraft were scheduled to arrive in thailand not when they departed boerschig jr black spot special activities report 1969 pg 5 also official aircraft records show both aircraft as transferred to napier field alabama where they were still listed as an nc 123k as of december 1972 purpose of this transfer is unclear that official history notes an munitions accident on 19 march 1969 in chronology but without any details as to fate of aircraft or which aircraft was affected adds additional confusion it is also suggested that black spot aircraft were never intended to be used in combat however as of 1966 twenty production aircraft were planned for a total cost of 64 7 states shed light program package documentation volume ii 1966 p c1 19 equivalent to million in there was even a recommendation that c 130 hercules be added to program and used instead united states volume i operation

tropic moon iii thumb 400px right layout of tropic moon iii b 57g aircraft shed light s second phase eventually turned out to be based on b 57 b 57 aircraft had already been deployed to southeast asia and had been subject of initial sensor evaluations under tropic moon ii tropic moon iii was envisioned as an scna that made up for gross shortcomings of tropic moon i and ii tropic moon iii involved a completely new set of systems up to date and infinitely more capable than those previously installed an entire new aircraft sub variant b 57g was developed for purpose with a redefined nose to house new sensor package development of aircraft experienced major delays during which it was equipped with a laser target designated to be used with then new first generation pave way laser guided bombs pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 29 in end tropic moon iii proved to be a capable system both with conventional ordnance and laser guided weapons day and night however advent of side firing gunship threatened system b 57g conducted its first combat missions in october 1970 during operation commando hunt v pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 66 kill rates per sortie between ac e and b 57g made it clear which system was dominant in role of truck hunter in reference to primary targets of campaign pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 64 during course of operation b 57g s claimed over 2 000 trucks destroyed mostly as a result of using precision guided weaponry nalty 2005 p 156 in same period ac 130s were credited with destroying six times this number of trucks nalty 2005 p 160 while b 57g operations continued this led to an attempt to modify system to incorporate gunship elements one b 57g was modified to house a special bomb bay installation of one emerson tat 161 turret with a single m61 20mm cannon as a gunship under project pave gat this system proved to still be inferior to capabilities of ac 130 pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 45 9 in addition to their laser guided ordnance tropic moon iii b also used a variety of conventional ordnance including m36 incendiaries cluster dispensers and iron bombs pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 70 these other systems were used in light of a shortage of precision guided munitions available b 57g was removed from theatre in may 1972 coinciding with withdrawal of bulk of us air elements plans remained for continuation of b 57g program and there were proposals for multiple wings of aircraft to operate in concert with ac 130s and similar aircraft post conflict spending cuts ended this pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 91 2 other associated programs other programs were also associated with shed light either coming under its wide reaching charter or otherwise being observed similar mission requirements meant other services were working on developing their own equipment and shed light task force was under orders from start to survey all other development see original 1966 charter us army had been managing a piece of equipment referred to as s 202 which combined four ir cameras a display and operator chains an artificial illumination component described as covert uv using ultraviolet light to provide illumination and a freeze display function under project night life s 202 it was to be tested on a s 61 helicopter by early 1967 project itself was being funded by advanced research projects agency arpa united states volume i operation shed

was some discontent among some of its major participants general john d ryan commander in chief of pacific air forces complained following poor showings from tropic moon ii program that he was tired of buying everything they send us he then requested that his staff draft a message that would allow him to send this thing tropic moon ii b 57b to conus continental united states even in regards to development of tropic moon iii aircraft aeronautical systems division was forced to admit that myriad of delays in that program had been caused by reduced quality control springing from crash nature of program pfau and greenhalgh 1978 p 42 shed light was a crash development project and was largely unguided it was tasked with research and development of almost any piece of equipment that might help with mission outlined in its charter as a result few of programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on conflict developments under shed light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under project gunship notably under gunship ii and gunship iii they were fitted with many of sensors developed under shed light but took on a life all their own shed light s most
