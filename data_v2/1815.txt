thumb right 236px south african singer miriam makeba popularised a number of songs that protested apartheid apartheid regime in south africa began in 1948 and lasted until 1994 it involved a system of institutionalized racial segregation and white supremacy and placed all political power in hands of a white minority opposition to apartheid manifested in a variety of ways including boycotts non violent protests and armed resistance music played a large role in movement against apartheid within south africa as well as in international opposition to apartheid impacts of songs opposing apartheid included raising awareness generating support for movement against apartheid building unity within this movement and presenting an alternative vision of culture in a future democratic south africa lyrical content and tone of this music reflected atmosphere that it was composed in protest music of 1950s soon after apartheid had begun explicitly addressed peoples grievances over pass laws and forced relocation following sharpeville massacre in 1960 and arrest or exile of a number of leaders songs became more downbeat while increasing censorship forced them to use subtle and hidden meanings songs and performance also allowed people to circumvent more stringent restrictions on other forms of expression at same time songs played a role in more militant resistance that began in 1960s soweto uprising in 1976 led to a renaissance with songs such as soweto blues encouraging a more direct challenge to apartheid government this trend which intensified into 1980s with racially mixed fusion bands testing laws of apartheid before these were dismantled with release of nelson mandela in 1990 and eventual restoration of majority rule in 1994 through its history anti apartheid music within south africa faced significant censorship from government both directly and via south african broadcasting corporation additionally musicians opposing government faced threats harassment and arrests musicians from other countries also participated in resistance to apartheid both by releasing music critical of south african government and by participating in a cultural boycott of south africa from 1980 onward examples included biko by peter gabriel sun city by artists united against apartheid and a concert in honour of nelson mandela s 70th birthday prominent south african musicians such as miriam makeba and hugh masekela forced into exile also released music critical of apartheid and this music had a significant impact on western popular culture contributing to moral outrage over apartheid scholars have stated that anti apartheid music within south africa although it received less attention worldwide played an equally important role in putting pressure on south african government background and origins racial segregation in south africa had begun with arrival of dutch colonists in south africa in 1652 and continued through centuries of british rule thereafter racial separation increased greatly after british took complete control over south africa in late 19th century and passed a number of laws early in 1900s to separate racial groups 1923 natives urban areas act forced black south africans to leave cities unless they were there to work for white people and excluded them from any role in government system of apartheid was implemented by afrikaner national party np after they were voted into power in 1948 and remained in place for 46 years white minority held all political power during this time apartheid meant separateness in afrikaans language and involved a brutal system of racial segregation black south africans were compelled to live in poor townships and were denied basic human rights based on idea that south africa belonged to white people a prominent figure in implementation of apartheid laws was hendrik verwoerd who was first minister for native affairs and later prime minister in np government there was significant resistance to this system both within and outside south africa opposition outside country often took form of boycotts of south africa within country resistance ranged from loosely organised groups to tightly knit ones and from non violent protests to armed opposition from african national congress through this entire process music played a large role in resistance music had been used in south africa to protest racial segregation before apartheid began in 1948 anc had been founded in 1912 and would begin and end its meetings with its anthem nkosi sikelel iafrika an early example of music in resistance to racial segregation another such example was iland act by r t caluza which protested native land act and was also adopted as an anthem by anc commentator michela vershbow has written that music of movement against apartheid and racial segregation reflected widening gap between different racial groups and was also an attempt to communicate across it music in south africa had begun to have explicitly political overtones in 1930s as musicians tried to include african elements in their recordings and performances to make political statements in 1940s artists had begun to use music to criticise state not directly in response to racial segregation but as a response to persecution of artists artists did not see their music as being directly political miriam makeba would state people say i sing politics but what i sing is not politics it is truth south african music thumb right alt dorothy masuka singer dorothy masuka pictured here in 2015 who wrote udr malan unomthetho onzima dr malan s government is harsh 1950s pass laws and resettlement as apartheid government became more entrenched in 1950s musicians came to see their music as more political in nature led partly by a campaign of african national congress to increase its support anc activist and trade unionist vuyisile mini was among pioneers of using music to protest apartheid he penned ndodemnyama we verwoerd watch out verwoerd in xhosa poet jeremy cronin stated that mini was embodiment of power that songs had built within protect movement mini was arrested in 1963 for political crimes and sentenced to death fellow inmates described him as singing ndodemnyama as he went to gallows song achieved enduring popularity being sung until well after apartheid government had collapsed by artists such as makeba and afrika bambaataa protests songs became generally more popular during 1950s as a number of musicians began to voice explicit opposition to apartheid udr malan unomthetho onzima dr malan s government is harsh by dorothy masuka became well known as did a number of songs by other women composers written as part of a campaign against carrying passes which required black citizens to carry a document at all times showing their racial and tribal identity in 1954 np government passed bantu resettlement act which along with 1950 group areas act forcibly moved millions of south africans into townships in racially segregated zones this was part of a plan to divide country into a number of smaller regions including tiny impoverished where black people were to live in 1955 settlement of sophiatown was destroyed and its 60 000 inhabitants moved many to a settlement known as meadowlands sophiatown had been a center of african jazz music prior to relocation move was inspiration for writing of song meadowlands by strike as with many other songs of time it was popularised both within and outside country by miriam makeba makeba s song sophiatown is gone also referred to relocation from sophiatown as did bye bye sophiatown by sun valley sisters music not directly related to movement was also often harnessed during this period south african communist party would use such music for its fundraising dances and song a strong police force was sung by lookouts to provide warnings of police presence and liquor raids 1960s sharpeville massacre and militancy thumb a painting of sharpeville massacre of march 1960 sharpeville massacre occurred on 21 march 1960 and in its aftermath apartheid was intensified and political dissent increasing suppressed anc and pan africanist conference were banned and 169 black leaders were tried for treason a number of musicians including makeba hugh masekela abdullah ibrahim jonas gwangwa chris mcgregor and kippie went into exile some such as makeba and masekela began using their music to raise awareness of apartheid those musicians that remained found their activities constrained new townships that black people had been moved to lacked facilities for recreation and large gatherings of people were banned south african broadcasting corporation tightened its broadcasting guidelines preventing subversive music from being aired a recording by masuka referring to killing of patrice lumumba led to a raid on her studio and her being declared a wanted individual preventing her from living in south africa for next 30 years new townships that black people were moved to despite their dreary nature also inspired politically charged music a trend which continued into 1970s in soweto by minerals has been described as an infectious celebration of a place and of ability of its residents to build a community there bellowing of bull 1968 by winston ngozi was a jazz anthem that also expressed political energy of period theatrical performances incorporating music were also a feature of townships often narrowly avoiding censorship cultural isolation forced by apartheid led to artists within south africa creating local adaptations of popular genres including rock music soul and jazz as government became increasingly harsh in its response to growing protests resistance shifted from being completely non violent towards armed action nelson mandela and other anc leaders founded umkhonto we sizwe mk a militant wing of anc which began a campaign of sabotage during this period music was often referred to as a weapon of struggle among mk members in training camps a song called we will leave our parents became very popular invoking as it did pain of leaving their homes toyi toyi chant also became popular during this period and was frequently used to generate a sense of power among large groups to intimidate government troops 1970s anc cultural groups and soweto uprising thumb alt man seated at piano jazz pianist abdullah ibrahim pictured here in 2011 composed mannenberg an instrumental piece that invoked themes of freedom and cultural identity in early 1970s anc held to belief that its primary activity was political organising and that any cultural activity was secondary to this this belief began to shift with establishment of mayibuye cultural ensemble in 1975 and amandla cultural ensemble later in 1970s mayibuye was established as a growing number of anc activists argued that cultural events needed to form a part of their work and could be used to raise awareness of apartheid gather support and drive political change group was established by anc activists barry feinberg and ronnie who named it after slogan mayibuye iafrika let africa return group consisted of several south african performers and used a mixture of songs poetry and narrative in their performance which described life under apartheid government and their struggle against it songs were often performed in three or four part harmony group performed more than 200 times across europe and were seen as cultural arm of anc group experienced personal and organisational difficulties and disbanded in 1980 in 1976 government of south africa decided to implement use of afrikaans as medium of instruction in all schools instead of english in response high school students began a series of protests that came to be known as soweto uprising 15 000 20 000 students took part police caught unprepared opened fire on protesting children 700 people were estimated to have been killed and over a thousand injured killings sparked off several months of rioting in soweto townships and protests became an important moment for anti apartheid movement hugh masekela wrote soweto blues in response to massacre and song was performed by miriam makeba becoming a standard part of makeba s live performances for many years soweto blues was one of many melancholic songs composed by masekela during this period that expressed his support of anti apartheid struggle along with been gone far too long mama and coal train songs written after soweto uprising were generally political in nature but used hidden meaning to avoid suppression especially as movement against apartheid gained momentum a song by band juluka used a metaphor of fighting bulls to suggest fall of apartheid many songs of this period became so widely known that their lyrics were frequently altered and adapted depending on circumstances making their authorship collective pianist abdullah ibrahim used purely musical techniques to convey subversive messages by incorporating melodies from freedom songs into his improvisations ibrahim also composed mannenberg described as most powerful anthem of struggle in 1980s which had no lyrics but drew on a number of aspects of black south african culture including church music jazz marabi and blues to create a piece that conveyed a sense of freedom and cultural identity importance that anti apartheid movement among south african exiles increased in late 1970s driven partly by activities of mayibuye amandla cultural ensemble drew together among militant anc activities living in angola and elsewhere in this period influenced by mayibuye as well as world black festival of arts and culture that was held in nigeria in 1977 as with mayibuye group tried to use their performances to raise awareness and generate support for anc however they relied chiefly on new material composed by their own members such as jonas gwangwa popular songs performed by group were selected for or adapted to a militaristic and faster tone and tempo at same time tenor of groups performance tended to be more affirmative and less antagonistic and sarcastic than that of mayibuye members often struggled to balance their commitments to ensemble with their military activities which were often seen as their primary job some such as mini daughter of vuyisile mini were killed in military action while they were performing with amandla such artists also faced pressure to use their performance solely in service of political movement without monetary reward amandla had carefully crafted performances of music and theater with a much larger ensemble than mayibuye which included a jazz band influence of these groups would last beyond 1970s a culture and resistance conference was held in botswana in 1982 and anc established a department of arts and culture in 1985 1980s direct confrontation thumb border right alt hugh masekela musician hugh masekela who composed hugely popular bring him back home after receiving a letter from nelson mandela 1980s saw increasing protests against apartheid by black organisations such as united democratic front protest music once again became directly critical of state examples included longile tabalaza by roger lucey which attacked secret police through lyrics about a young man who is arrested by police and dies in custody protesters in 1980s took to streets with intention of making country ungovernable and music reflected this new militancy major protests took place after inauguration of a tri parliament which had separate representation for indians colored people and white south africans but not for black south africans in 1984 and in 1985 government declared a state of emergency music became more radical and more urgent as protests grew in size and number now frequently invoking and praising guerrilla movements that had gained steam after soweto uprising song shona sheila s day originally about domestic workers was adapted to refer to guerrilla movement toyi toyi was once again used in confrontations with government forces afrikaner dominated government sought to counter these with increasingly frequent states of emergency during this period only a few afrikaners expressed sentiments against apartheid voelvry movement among afrikaners began in 1980s in response with opening of shifty mobile recording studio voelvry sought to express opposition to apartheid in afrikaans goal of voelvry musicians was to persuade afrikaner youth of changes their culture had to undergo to achieve racial equality prominent members in this phenomenon were ralph rabie under stage name johannes andre du toit and racially integrated bands playing various kinds of fusion became more common as 1980s progressed their audiences came from across racial lines itself a subversive act as racial segregation was still embedded in law racially mixed juluka led by johnny clegg remained popular through 1970s and early 1980s government tried to harness this popularity by sponsoring a multi lingual song titled together we will build a brighter future but release during a period of great political unrest caused further anger at government and protests forced song to be withdrawn before commercial sales were made thumb singer yvonne chaka chaka pictured in 2012 was among many musicians featured on peace song released to celebrate release of nelson mandela in 1990 among most popular anti apartheid songs in south africa was bring him back home nelson mandela by hugh masekela nelson mandela was a great fan of masekela s music and on masekela s birthday in 1985 smuggled out a letter to him expressing his good wishes masekela was inspired to write bring him back home in response sam writes that reception of mandela s letter and writing of bring him back home marked masekela being labelled an anti apartheid activist mandela was also invoked in black president by brenda fassie composed in 1988 this song explicitly invoked mandela s eventual presidency mandela was released in 1990 and went on a post freedom tour of north america with winnie in boston he danced as bring him back home was played after his speech mandela s release triggered a number of celebratory songs these included a peace song composed by and featuring a number of artists including masekela fassie and yvonne chaka chaka proceeds from this piece went

beatles rolling stones and walker brothers after sharpeville massacre in 1960 musicians union in uk announced a boycott of government first south african activist to receive widespread attention outside south africa was steve biko when he died in police custody in 1977 his death inspired a number of songs from artists outside country including from tom paxton and peter hamill most famous of these was song biko by peter gabriel u2 lead singer bono was among people who said that song was first time he had heard about apartheid musicians from other parts of africa also wrote songs to support movement nigeria s sonny okosun drew attention to apartheid with songs such as fire in soweto described by los angeles times as an incendiary reggae jam cultural boycott a cultural boycott of apartheid government had been suggested in 1954 by english anglican bishop trevor huddleston in 1968 united nations passed a resolution asking members to cut any cultural educational and sporting ties with racist regime thereby bringing pressure to bear on musicians and other performers to avoid playing in south africa in 1980 un passed a resolution allowing a cultural boycott of south africa resolution named nelson mandela and his profile was raised further by anc deciding to focus its campaign on him in 1982 20 years after he had been imprisoned in 1983 special aka released their song free nelson mandela an optimistic finale to their debut album which was generally sombre song was produced by elvis costello and had a backing chorus composed of members of specials and beat which created a mood of joyous solidarity lyrics to song were written by jerry dammers dammers also founded british branch of organisation artists united against apartheid song was quickly embraced by movement against apartheid it was used by un and anc and demonstrators would frequently sing it during marches and rallies chorus was catchy and straightforward making it easy to remember dammers utilised association with anti apartheid movement to popularise song by putting an image of mandela on front of cover for album and placing information about apartheid regime on back in late 1980s paul simon caused controversy when he chose to record his album graceland in south africa along with a number of black african musicians he received sharp criticism for breaking cultural boycott in 1987 he claimed to have received clearance from anc however he was contradicted by dali tambo son of anc president oliver tambo and founder of artists united against apartheid as a way out of fracas hugh masekela who had known simon for many years proposed a joint musical tour which would include songs from graceland as well as from black south african artists miriam makeba was among musicians featured on graceland tour masekela justified tour saying that cultural boycott had led to a lack of growth in south african music however when group played in uk at royal albert hall there were protests outside in which dammers participated along with billy bragg and paul weller songs performed on tour included soweto blues sung by makeba along with many other anti apartheid songs sun city

springsteen and miles davis to come together to record single sun city which was released in 1985 single achieved its aim of stigmatising resort album was described as most political of all of charity rock albums of 1980s sun city was explicitly critical of foreign policy of u s president ronald reagan stating that he had failed to take firm action against apartheid as a result only about half of american radio stations played sun city meanwhile sun city was a major success in countries where there was little or no radio station resistance to record or its messages reaching no 4 in australia no 10 in canada and no 21 in uk a number of prominent anti apartheid songs were released in years that followed stevie wonder released it s wrong and was also arrested for protesting against apartheid

day respectively other acts performing at concert included stevie wonder whitney houston sting salt n pepa dire straits and eurythmics event was broadcast to a tv audience of approximately 600 million people political aspects of concert were heavily censored in united states by fox television network which rebranded it as use of music to raise awareness about apartheid paid off a survey after concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24 three fourths knew of nelson mandela and supported his release from prison although cultural boycott had succeeded in isolating apartheid government culturally it also affected musicians who had worked against apartheid within south africa thus johnny clegg and savuka were forbidden from playing at concert lyrical and musical themes lyrics of anti apartheid protest music often used subversive meanings hidden under innocuous lyrics partially as a consequence of censorship that they experienced purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning tendency to use hidden meaning increased as government grew less tolerant from 1950s to 1980s popular protest songs of 1950s often directly addressed politicians ndodemnyama we verwoerd by mini told hendrik verwoerd to verwoerd beware of advancing blacks while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included phrase hey strydom a way strydom now that you have touched women you have struck a rock you have dislodged a boulder and you will be crushed following sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of government and more mournful thina sizwe included references to stolen land was described as depicting emotional desolation while senzeni na what have we done achieved same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics thereby avoiding censors soweto uprising marked a turning point in movement as songs written in 1980s again became more direct with appearance of musicians such as lucey who believed in an in your face tell it like it is approach lyrics from this period included calls such as they are lying to themselves arresting us killing us won t work we ll still fight for our land and whites don t negotiate with us so let s fight thumb alt musician playing guitar in concert vusi mahlasela pictured at a concert in 2008 was among those who stated that there was no distinction between singing about personal life and political matters a number of south african freedom songs had musical origins in or choir music which combined elements of christian hymns with traditional south african musical forms songs were often short and repetitive using a call and response structure music was primarily in indigenous languages such as xhosa or zulu as well as in english melodies used in these songs were often very straightforward songs in movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in south africa re them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid this trend had begun decades previously when south african jazz musicians had added african elements to jazz music adapted from united states in 1940s and 1950s voelvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional afrikaans songs and symbols groups affiliated with black consciousness movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music jazz fusion group for example used traditional rhythms of people to communicate pride in african culture often with music that was not explicitly political while musicians such as makeba performing outside south africa felt an obligation to write political lyrics musicians within country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and for instance love songs because struggle of living a normal life was also a political one vusi mahlasela would write in 1991 so who are they who say no more love poems now i want to sing a song of love for that woman who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child lyrical and musical tone of protest songs varied with circumstances they were written and composed in lyrics of bring him back home for example mention mandela walking hand in hand with winnie mandela then his wife melody used in song is upbeat and anthem like it employs a series of trumpet riffs by masekela supported by grand series of chords music review website allmusic describes melody as filled with sense of camaraderie and celebration that are referred to in lyrics vocal choir during joyous chorus is extremely moving and life affirming in contrast lyrics of soweto blues refer to children s protests and resulting massacre in soweto uprising a review stated that song had searingly righteous lyrics that cut to bone musically song has a background of mbaqanga guitar bass and multi grooved percussion makeba uses this as a platform for vocals that are half sung and half spoken similar to blues music censorship and resistance thumb johnny clegg was frontman for juluka and its successor savuka both bands faced persecution for being mixed race groups apartheid government greatly limited freedom of expression through censorship reduced economic freedom and reduced mobility for black people however it did not have resources to effectively enforce censorship of written and recorded material government established directorate of publications in 1974 through publications act but this body only responded to complaints and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it less than one hundred pieces of music were formally banned by this body in 1980s thus music and performance played an important role in propagating subversive messages however government used its control of south african broadcasting corporation to prevent undesirable songs from being played which included political or rebellious music and music with blasphemous or overtly sexual lyrics and to enforce its ideal of a cultural separation between racial groups in addition to physical separation it had created radio and television broadcasts were area specific such that members of different racial groups received different programs and music was selected keeping ideology of government in mind music that used slang or more than one language faced censorship artists were required to submit both their lyrics and their music to be scrutinised by sabc committee which banned thousands of songs as a result of practices of sabc record companies began putting pressure on their artists to avoid controversial songs and often also made changes to songs they were releasing individuals were expected to racially segregate their musical choices as well mixed race bands were sometimes forced to play with some members behind a curtain and people who listened to music composed by members of a different race faced government suspicion many black musicians faced harassment from police jonas gwangwa stated that performers were often stopped and required to explain their presence in white localities black musicians were forbidden from playing at venues when alcohol was sold and performers were required to have an extra night pass to be able to work in evenings further restrictions were placed by government each time it declared a state of emergency and internal security legislation was also used to ban material music from artists outside country was also targeted by censors all songs by beatles were banned in 1960s and stevie wonder s music was banned in 1985 after he dedicated his oscar award to mandela two independent radio stations capital radio and radio 702 came into being in 1979 and 1980 respectively since these were based in independent homelands of transkei and bophutatswana respectively they were nominally not bound by government s regulations although they tended to follow decisions of directorate they also played music by bands such as juluka which were not featured by sabc neither station however played sun city when it was released in 1985 as owners of sun city resort had partial ownership of both stations a large number of musicians including masekela and makeba as well as abdullah ibrahim and vusi mahlasela were driven into exile by apartheid government songs written by these people were prohibited from being broadcast as were all songs that opposed apartheid government most of anti apartheid songs of period were censored by apartheid government bring him back home was banned in south africa by government upon its release nonetheless it became a part of number of musical voices protesting apartheid regime and became an important song for anti apartheid movement in late 1980s it was declared to be clean by south african government following mandela s release from prison in 1990 artists within south africa sometimes used subtle lyrics to avoid censors song weeping for his band bright blue by dan heymann a reluctant army conscript used nkosi sikelel iafrika an anthem of anc that had been banned as backdrop for symbolic lyrics about a man living in fear of an oppressive society censor failed to notice this and song became immensely popular reaching no 1 on government s own radio station similarly jazz musicians would often incorporate melodies of freedom songs into their improvisations yvonne chaka chaka used phrase winning my dear love in place of winnie mandela while a compilation album released by shifty records was titled a in our which literally meant a tangerine in our kebab but represented phrase anarchy in our society a play on words that was not picked up by censors keith would later state that he had submitted fake lyrics replacing controversial terms with innocuous similar sounding ones some artists however avoided explicitly political music altogether scholar michael has written that even when musicians avoided political messages achieving financial success despite lack of education poverty urban squalor and other difficulties was certainly a triumph and that such success was part of struggle to live normally under apartheid other bands used more direct lyrics and faced censorship and harassment as a result savuka a multi racial band were often arrested or had their concerts raided for playing their song asimbonanga which was dedicated to biko mandela and others associated with anti apartheid movement a musical tour by voelvry musicians faced significant opposition from government major surveillance and threats from police sparked trouble at beginning of tour which created issues over suitable venues and musicians were forced to play in abandoned buildings after roger lucey wrote a song critical of secret police he received threatening visits by them late at night and had tear gas poured into an air conditioning unit during one of his concerts lucey s producers were intimidated by security forces and his musical recordings confiscated lucey himself abandoned his musical career song was banned and an individual could be jailed for five years for owning a copy of it musician and public speaker mzwakhe mbuli faced more violent reactions he was shot at and a grenade was thrown at his house after release of his first album change is pain in 1986 he was arrested and tortured album was banned concerts of juluka were sometimes broken up by police and musicians were often arrested under pass laws of apartheid government when they were stopped black musicians were often asked to play for police to prove that they were in fact musicians analysis commentators have stated that as with many social movements music played a large role in resistance to apartheid writing in inquiries journal scholar michela vershbow writes that although music of anti apartheid movement could not and did not create social change in isolation it acted as a means of unification as a way of raising awareness of apartheid and allowed people from different cultural background to find commonality protest songs were often used by anti apartheid movement as a means of building unity and inspiring its followers according to vershbow communal ownership of liberation songs and of their message within different movements allows for them to strengthen mobilise and unify a community music and cultural performances were put to several uses by south african diaspora such as anc cultural ensembles mayibuye and amandla groups themselves intended their performances to raise awareness of apartheid outside south africa sometimes described as raising consciousness and to generate support for their activities as well as to raise funds for anc in addition they filled role of presenting an alternative vision of culture in a future democratic south africa music scholar anne schumann writes that music protesting apartheid became a part of western popular culture and moral outrage about apartheid in west was influenced by this music cultural boycott and criticism that paul simon received for breaking it was an example of how closely connected music had become to politics with respect to apartheid there has been occasional tension between those musicians who went into exile and were therefore able to perform for and raise awareness among much larger audiences and anti apartheid musicians who remained in south africa latter group has received significantly less popular attention though vershbow states that it played an equally important role in movement and schumann argues that it was responsible for putting significant pressure on apartheid government role of music in social change in south african is examined in documentary film amandla a revolution in four part harmony released in 2002 film focuses specifically on liberation music of struggle against white domination scholars have suggested that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to play a part in cultural resistance to apartheid music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of south africans than written material partly due to restrictions placed by apartheid music poetry and storytelling also formed part of everyday life of a number of south africans and protest songs emerged from these traditions in addition poetry was traditionally seen by some south africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable prominent examples following is a partial list of songs ordered chronologically that have been described by scholars and commentators as
