gorgon class monitors were a class of monitors in service with royal navy during world war i and her sister ship were originally built as coastal defence ships for royal norwegian navy as hnoms nidaros and hnoms bjorgvin respectively but requisitioned for british use gorgon commissioned first in june 1918 and bombarded german positions and other targets in occupied flanders she fired last shots of war by royal navy into belgium on 15 october 1918 she was offered for sale after war but was used as a target ship when there were no takers she was sold for scrap in 1928 glatton was destroyed by a magazine explosion only days after she was completed in september 1918 while in dover harbour she remained a hazard to shipping until wreck was partially salvaged and remains moved out of way during 1925 26 background norwegians ordered two coast defence vessels in january 1913 from british shipbuilder armstrong whitworth for delivery in twenty four months to supplement older and es of coastal defence ships their dimensions were limited to a length overall of and a beam of to fit in drydock at horten armstrong s design was for a ship with a designed displacement of with an armament of two 50 calibre armstrong guns mounted in single turrets fore and aft four 50 calibre guns were also mounted in single turrets two of which were superfiring over main turrets and others were on each side of superstructure anti torpedo boat defense would be provided by six guns mounted in superstructure two submerged torpedo tubes were also to be mounted armour belt protected most of waterline and was thick but tapered towards ends protective deck was thick and ran full length of ship buxton p 106 purchase and adaptation at outbreak of world war i in august 1914 both ships were under construction at armstrong whitworth elswick nidaros had already been launched and bjorgvin was launched only days after start of war however when world war i broke out royal navy requisitioned most warships under construction in britain for foreign powers and refunded two thirds of ps370 000 purchase price for each ship already paid by norwegians two ships were renamed as glatton and gorgon after earlier breastwork monitors of 1871 their completion was greatly delayed by changes made by british which included modifying boilers to use both oil and coal and conversion of twelve double bottom tanks to carry oil this work began on 9 january 1915 but was suspended following may although it was estimated that only another ten to twelve months of work remained to allow for faster progress to be made on large light cruisers and that were building in armstrong s naval yard downriver buxton p 107 general characteristics in september 1917 work was resumed to a new design that added a large anti torpedo bulge along about 75 of hull s length gorgons displaced at deep load as built almost more than originally designed they had a length of a beam of at maximum although her main hull only had a beam of and a draught of buxton pp 107 113 propulsion they were powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines which developed from four yarrow boilers that gave a maximum speed of addition of bulges cost in speed but prevented extra weight resulting from all of these changes from deepening her draft they carried of coal and of fuel oil which gave them a range of at buxton p 113 armament no changes were made to layout of main and secondary armament as designed for norwegians but guns specified by norwegians could not use standard british ammunition and had to be relined to do so 240 mm guns were known as bl mk xii gun after modification turrets were modified to give a maximum elevation of 40deg and be depressed to 5deg they fired a 8 shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of using a supercharge these guns were longest ranged guns other than bl 18 inch mk i naval guns mounted in s and that could range used by royal navy during war they had a rate of fire of two rounds per minute ships carried 130 shells per gun other than modifications to guns to use british ammunition no changes were made to secondary armament guns had a maximum depression of 5deg and a maximum elevation of 20deg they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of which gave a maximum range of they could fire three rounds per minute each gun was provided with 100 high explosive shells and 100 common pointed capped shells magazine for two side guns was shared between them with a shell room directly under each turret boiler room was directly in front of magazine and engine room behind it 100 mm guns and torpedo tubes planned by norwegians were both omitted and a large tripod mast was fitted behind single funnel to carry directors for both 6 inch and 9 2 inch guns one qf 3 inch 20 cwt anti aircraft gun was mounted on each centreline 6 inch turret this had a maximum depression of 10deg and a maximum elevation of 90deg it fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12 14 rounds per minute they had a maximum effective ceiling of they also carried four 3 pounder hotchkiss guns with 300 rounds per gun and two or four 2 pounder guns with 1 000 rounds per gun on high angle mounts armour thumb left glatton in drydock note depth of torpedo bulge addition of anti torpedo bulges were only changes made to protection scheme of gorgons armour used throughout was krupp cemented armour unless otherwise noted waterline armour belt was seven inches thick between fore and aft turrets but tapered to towards bow and towards stern above it was a strake of four inch armour that covered area between turrets up to upper deck that increased to six inches abreast wing barbettes high tensile steel deck was only one inch thick amidships on flat but increased to two inches as it curved down to meet main armour belt forward of a turret it increased to as it sloped downwards to bow aft of y turret it also increased to two inches then three inches over steering gear and as it curved down towards stern before meeting a bulkhead at rear of ship main gun barbettes and turret faces were all thick but turret sides were 6 inches in thickness with three inch krupp non cemented armour knc roofs secondary gun turrets and barbettes were also six inches thick with two inch roofs conning tower was eight inches thick with a three inch knc roof buxton pp 108 113 construction both ships were built by armstrong whitworth at elswick was laid down first on 26 may 1913 but was not launched until 8 august 1914 she commissioned after her sister on 31 august 1918 but was not formally completed after finishing her trials until 9 september was laid down on 11 june 1913 but was launched before her sister on 9 june 1914 and commissioned first as well on 1 may 1918 although she did not complete her trials until 4 june total costs including all alterations were 242 for glatton and 197 for gorgon although there was no obvious reason for disparity unless some of glatton s costs had been charged against gorgon as lead ship of class a truer cost would be about ps645 000 for each this was almost double original cost and made them more expensive than any of other monitors buxton p 109 history gorgon gorgon was first to go into action as she bombarded german artillery positions in belgium at end of july 1918 she bombarded bridge on 28 and 29 september but produced a single near miss she fired at german artillery batteries again on 14 october but had to retreat hurriedly when she was straddled by heavy german return fire and she was hit by splinters from near misses next day she bombarded another bridge last rounds fired by a royal navy warship at targets in occupied belgium buxton pp 109 10 she was sent to portsmouth after end of war where she was made available to investigate cause of her sister ship glattons magazine explosion conway s p 47 she was paid off on 31 august 1919 and joined reserve fleet in september she was offered back to norwegians but they rejected her as unsuitable to their requirements especially since she was now too broad for their dock at horten several attempts were made to sell her but she was disarmed in 1922 and used as a target ship to evaluate effects of bombs bursting underwater near a ship and effects of six inch gunfire she was finally sold for scrap on 26 august 1928 and broken up at former naval dockyard at pembroke glatton after completion glatton sailed for dover on 11 september 1918 to prepare for offensive planned for later that month on evening of 16 september glattons midships 6 inch magazine had a low order explosion that ignited cordite stored there flames shot through roof of q turret starboard and started to spread aft forward magazines were flooded but rear magazines were unable to be flooded as flames blocked access to controls presence of ammunition ship only away risked a massive explosion that would devastate dover if glattons rear magazine exploded and set off ammunition vice admiral keyes ordered destroyer to torpedo glatton in an attempt to flood magazine before it detonated cossacks torpedoes were not powerful enough and glatton remained afloat still burning keyes then ordered destroyer to fire on glatton with her torpedoes they were aimed at hole blown in glatton s starboard side by cossacks second torpedo and caused glatton to capsize until her masts and superstructure rested on harbor bottom dousing fire buxton p 110 casualties were heavy 60 men were killed outright and 124 were injured of whom 19 later died of their burns a court of enquiry held immediately afterwards found that explosion had occurred in midships 6 inch magazine situated between boiler and engine rooms cause was less easy to establish but court noted that stokers were in habit of piling red hot clinker and ashes from boilers against bulkhead directly adjoining magazine magazine was well insulated with of cork covered by wood planking 3 4 inch 1 9 cm thick and provided with special cooling equipment so it was not likely that cordite had spontaneously gorgons magazine was emptied and examined red lead paint on bulkhead was blistered beneath lagging and tests at national physical laboratory demonstrated that it had been subject to temperatures of at least recorded temperatures inside magazine did not exceed and a test of red hot ashes was inconclusive other tests did reveal that cork could give off flammable fumes under high heat and pressurized air buxton pp 111 12 as a precaution gorgons cork lagging was stripped out and replaced by silicate wool which revealed real cause part of cork was missing and folded newspapers were found in empty space furthermore a number of rivets were entirely missing which meant that 1 2 inch 12 7 mm holes were present which could have dropped hot ashes onto newspapers forced draught pressure in boiler room would have supplied air through rivet holes which would have caused cork to give off flammable gases and eventually ignite cordite charges buxton p 112 glatton remained in dover harbour an obstruction to shipping with her hull visible at low tide as harbour board could not afford ps45 000 quoted on average by salvage companies work finally began in may 1925 as some of silt were removed from underneath glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away all holes on her topside had to be sealed and air pumped into each compartment at a rate of per minute to restore her buoyancy first attempt to lift her began on 2 december 1925 and was successful in breaking suction holding her to bottom in combination with rising tide slowly she was moved taking advantage of tides until on 16 march 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to western pier of submarine harbour close by shore total cost was considerably more than originally estimated but still far less than that quoted by salvage companies at no more than ps12 000 there she remains buried by landfill underneath current car ferry terminal buxton pp 112 13 her bell was salvaged and is on display at harbour board offices see also notes references external links category monitor classes category world war i monitors of
