background and writing kubah was inspired by indonesian history beginning in 1940s and continuing until 1980s following national revolution from 1945 to 1949 country was set in a state of political turmoil and abject poverty which became increasingly severe towards end of 1950s by early 1960s pki and other leftist parties had support of president sukarno giving them greater power pki membership grew quickly in this period aided by a hyperinflation and widespread poverty on 1 october 1965 a group of indonesian national armed forces members calling themselves 30 september movement killed six army generals and announced that president was under their power coup was quashed following day contemporary reports indicated that pki had been behind g30s a position endorsed by indonesian government as a result hundreds of thousands of registered and suspected pki members were killed or exiled over following decade effectively destroying party by 1974 buru held some 10 000 prisoners while others were held elsewhere or forced to stay abroad political prisoners began to be released by 1970s but saw systematic discrimination at all levels of society they found themselves under surveillance and with little hope of employment kubah was second novel written by ahmad tohari who had been in senior high school when g30s announced its coup a devout muslim who had trained as a doctor and ran a islamic boarding school in central java tohari began to focus on writing when his first novel di kaki bukit cibalak on foothill of cibalak 1978 won a prize from jakarta arts council he finished kubah in two months first making a thematic overview for each chapter and then developing it further while writing he deliberately left novel s ending open to interpretation intending for readers to think for themselves themes kubah is an early example of literature dealing with g30s and pki although earlier examples exist former indonesian president abdurrahman wahid described it as first to deal with reconciliation between pki members and general indonesian society after g30s an issue which was hyper sensitive at time historian anna greta nilsson hoadley writes that kubah explored why a person would be motivated to join party emphasizing poverty cultural pressure and active propaganda by pki in end karman is ultimately an innocent victim who only joined party to improve his own standing even after his release karman remains in a state of fear marked by a prisoner s vulnerability literary critics maman s mahayana sofyan and achmad dian wrote that in this sense karman becomes representative of all pki members who were arrested following g30s mahayana writing elsewhere sees karman as undergoing an existential quest to establish his identity seemingly finding an answer in pki but ultimately becoming trapped by them mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with novel s opening in which tohari provides a four line quote from an old javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on he finds karman s dealing with raftsman kastagethek while escaping from government most explicit expression of tohari s intent unlike karman kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty leading karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in islam mahayana thus argued that kubah was meant as dawah or islamic preaching with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of god conveyed through characters dialogue and actions release and reception kubah was originally published by jakarta based pustaka jaya in 1980 unlike di kaki bukit cibalak and most of tohari s later novels it had not been serialised first since 1995 it has been published by gramedia

and maturing indonesian culture an award which included a trophy and rp 1 million in prize money mahayana found it worthy of this prize praising kubah use of flashback and complicated issues it raised wahid at time an active islamic intellectual with ulama wrote in 1980 that kubah had poorly realised its potential he characterised it as a beginner s work lacking suspense overly moralistic and predictable tohari s trilogy ronggeng dukuh paruk dancer of paruk village 1981 1985 which has proven to be his most famous also dealt with g30s and pki however unlike kubah parts of ronggeng dukuh
