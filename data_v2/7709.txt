hoxne hoard is largest hoard of late roman silver and gold discovered in britain and largest collection of gold and silver coins of fourth and fifth centuries found anywhere within roman empire it was found by eric lawes a metal detectorist in village of hoxne in suffolk england in 1992 hoard consists of 14 865 roman gold silver and bronze coins and approximately 200 items of silver tableware and gold jewellery objects are now in british museum in london where most important pieces and a selection of rest are on permanent display in 1993 treasure valuation committee valued hoard at ps1 75 million roughly equivalent to ps in hoard was buried in an oak box or small chest filled with items in precious metal sorted mostly by type with some in smaller wooden boxes and others in bags or wrapped in fabric remnants of chest and fittings such as hinges and locks were recovered in excavation coins of hoard date it after ad 407 which coincides with end of britain as a roman province owners and reasons for burial of hoard are unknown but it was carefully packed and contents appear consistent with what a single very wealthy family might have owned it is likely that hoard represents only a part of wealth of its owner given lack of large silver serving vessels and of some of most common types of jewellery hoxne hoard contains several rare and important objects such as a gold body chain and silver gilt pepper pots piperatoria including empress pepper pot hoard is also of particular archaeological significance because it was excavated by professional archaeologists with items largely undisturbed and intact find helped to improve relationship between metal detectorists and archaeologists and influenced a change in english law regarding finds of treasure archaeological history discovery and initial excavation hoard was discovered in a farm field about southwest of village of hoxne in suffolk on 1992 tenant farmer peter whatling had lost a hammer and asked his friend eric lawes a retired gardener and amateur metal detectorist to help look for it while searching field with his metal detector lawes discovered silver spoons gold jewelry and numerous gold and silver coins after retrieving a few items he and whatling notified landowners suffolk county council and police without attempting to dig out any more objects following day a team of archaeologists from suffolk archaeological unit carried out an emergency excavation of site entire hoard was excavated in a single day with removal of several large blocks of unbroken material for laboratory excavation area was searched with metal detectors within a radius of from find spot peter whatling s missing hammer was also recovered and donated to british museum british museum collection database hammer accessed 21 july 2010 hoard was concentrated in a single location within completely decayed remains of a wooden chest objects had been grouped within chest for example pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside one another and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing but overall amount of disturbance was low it was possible to determine original layout of artefacts within container and existence of container itself due to lawes prompt notification of find which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists excavated hoard was taken to british museum discovery was leaked to press and sun newspaper ran a front page story on 19 november alongside a picture of lawes with his metal detector full contents of hoard and its value were still unknown yet newspaper article claimed that it was worth ps10 million in response to unexpected publicity british museum held a press conference at museum on 20 november to announce discovery newspapers lost interest in hoard quickly allowing british museum curators to sort clean and stabilise it without further disruption from press initial cleaning and basic conservation was completed within a month of its discovery inquest and valuation thumb alt silver tigress with engraved flame like stripes springing

broken off handle from an unknown best known single piece out of some 15 000 in hoard a coroner s inquest was held at lowestoft on 3 september 1993 and hoard was declared a treasure trove meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden with intention of being recovered at a later date under english common law anything declared as such belongs to crown if no one claims title to it however customary practice at time was to reward anyone who found and promptly reported a treasure trove with money equivalent to its market value money being provided by national institution that wished to acquire treasure in november 1993 treasure trove reviewing committee valued hoard at ps1 75 million roughly equivalent to ps in which was paid to lawes as finder of treasure and he shared it with farmer peter whatling three years later treasure act 1996 was enacted by parliament which allowed finder tenant and landowner to share in any reward subsequent archaeological investigations suffolk county council archaeological service surveyed field in september 1993 after it was ploughed finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins all considered part of same hoard frend p 389 both earlier iron age and later mediaeval materials were also discovered but there was no evidence of a roman settlement in vicinity a follow up excavation of field was carried out by suffolk county council archaeological service in 1994 in response to illegal metal detecting near hoard find hoard burial hole was re excavated and a single post hole was identified at southwest corner this may have been location of a marker post to enable depositors of cache to locate and recover it in future soil was removed in spits for analysis in area around find spot and metal detectors were used to locate metal artefacts this excavation recovered 335 items dating to roman period mostly coins but also some box fittings a series of late bronze age or early iron age post holes were found which may have formed a structure however no structural features of roman period were detected coins discovered during 1994 investigation were spread out in an ellipse centred on hoard find spot running east west up to a distance of on either side this distribution can be explained by fact that farmer carried out deep ploughing in 1990 in an east west direction on part of field where hoard was found farmer had ploughed in a north south direction since 1967 or 1968 when land was cleared for agricultural use but absence of coins north and south of find spot suggests that ploughing before 1990 had not disturbed hoard items discovered hoard is mainly made up of gold and silver coins and jewellery amounting to a total of of gold and of silver it had been placed in a wooden chest made mostly or entirely of oak that measured approximately cm 23 7x11 8 in within chest some objects had evidently been placed in smaller boxes made of yew and cherry wood while others had been packed in with woollen cloth or hay chest and inner boxes had decayed almost completely after being buried but fragments of chest and its fittings were recovered during excavation main objects found are 569 gold coins solidi 14 272 silver coins comprising 60 miliarenses and 14 212 siliquae 24 bronze coins nummi 29 items of jewellery in gold 98 silver spoons and ladles a silver tigress made as a handle for a vessel 4 silver bowls and a small dish 1 silver beaker 1 silver vase or juglet 4 pepper pots including empress pepper pot toiletry items such as toothpicks 2 silver locks from decayed remains of wooden or leather caskets traces of various organic materials including a small ivory pyxis coins hoxne hoard contains 569 gold solidi struck between reigns of valentinian i 364 75 and honorius 393 423 14 272 silver coins including 60 miliarenses and 14 212 siliquae struck between reigns of constantine ii 337 40 and honorius and 24 bronze nummi it is most significant coin find from end of roman britain and contains all major denominations of coinage from that time as well as many examples of clipped silver coinage typical of late roman britain only find from roman britain with a larger number of gold coins was eye hoard found in 1780 or 1781 for which there are poor records largest single romano british hoard was hoard of 54 951 third century coins but these were debased radiates with little precious metal content frome hoard was unearthed in somerset in april 2010 containing 52 503 coins minted between 253 and 305 also mostly debased silver or bronze larger hoards of roman coins have been found at misrata libya and reputedly also at evreux france 100 000 coins and croatia 300 000 coins gold solidi are all close to their theoretical weight of 4 48 g of a roman pound fineness of a solidus in this period was 99 gold total weight of solidi in hoard is almost exactly 8 roman pounds suggesting that coins had been measured out by weight rather than number analysis of siliquae suggests a range of fineness of between 95 and 99 silver with highest percentage of silver found just after a reform of coinage in 368 of siliquae 428 are locally produced imitations generally of high quality and with as much silver as official siliquae of period however a handful are cliche forgeries where a core of base metal has been wrapped in silver foil historical spread and minting coins are only items in hoxne hoard for which a definite date and place of manufacture can be established all of gold coins and many of silver coins bear names and portraits of emperor in whose reign they were minted most also retain original mint marks that identify where they were minted illustrating roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design coins manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources trier arles and lyon in gaul ravenna milan aquileia rome in modern italy siscia modern croatia sirmium modern serbia thessaloniki greece constantinople cyzicus nicomedia and antioch modern turkey coins were minted under three dynasties of roman emperors earliest are successors of constantinian dynasty followed by emperors and finally theodosian emperors collegiate system of rule or consortium imperii meant that imperial partners would mint coins in each other s names at mints under their jurisdiction overlapping reigns of eastern and western emperors often allow changes of type to be dated to within part of a reign so latest coins in hoard of western ruler honorius 393 423 and his challenger constantine iii 407 11 can be demonstrated to belong to earlier parts of their reigns as they correspond to lifetime of eastern emperor arcadius who died in 408 thus coins provide a terminus post quem or earliest possible date for deposition of hoard of 408 british museum collection database coin accessed 21 july 2010 siliquae in hoard were struck mainly at western mints in gaul and italy it is unknown whether this is because coins from further east rarely reached britain through trade or because eastern mints rarely struck siliquae production of coins seems to follow location of imperial court at time for instance concentration of trier coins is much greater after 367 perhaps associated with gratian moving his court to trier table of mints and periods of gold solidi in hoxne hoard mint 364 7 367 75 375 8 378 88 388 95 394 402 402 8 total aquileia 2 2

edge clipped to some degree this is typical of roman silver coin finds of this period in britain although clipped coins are very unusual through rest of roman empire clipping process invariably leaves imperial portrait intact on front of coin but often damages mint mark inscription and image on reverse possible reasons for clipping coins are controversial possible explanations include fraud a deliberate attempt to maintain a stable ratio between gold and silver coins or an official attempt to provide a new source of silver bullion while maintaining same number of coins in circulation huge number of clipped coins in hoxne hoard has made it possible for archaeologists to observe process of coin clipping in detail coins were evidently cut face up to avoid damaging portrait average level of clipping is roughly same for coins dating from 350 onwards gold jewellery thumb upright alt frontal view of a grey female bust with four gold bands of many fine links two draped over shoulders and

british museum collection database body chain mount coin accessed 21 july 2010 all jewellery in hoard is gold and all gold items in hoard are jewellery other than coins none of jewellery is unequivocally masculine although several pieces might have been worn by either gender such as rings there are one body chain six necklaces three rings and nineteen bracelets total weight of gold jewellery is about and average metal content of jewellery pieces is 91 5 gold about 22 carat with small proportions of silver and copper in metal most important gold item in hoard is body chain which consists of four finely looped gold chains made using loop in loop method called fox tail in modern jewellery and attached at front and back to plaques at front chains have terminals in shape of lions heads and plaque has jewels mounted in gold cells with a large amethyst surrounded by four smaller garnets alternating with four empty cells which probably held pearls that have decayed at back chains meet at a mount centred on a gold solidus of gratian r 375 383 which has been converted from an earlier use probably as a pendant and which may have been a family heirloom body chains of this type appear in roman art sometimes on goddess venus or on nymphs some examples have erotic contexts but they are also worn by respectable high ranking ladies they may have been regarded as a suitable gift for a bride hoxne body chain worn tightly would fit a woman with a bust size of few body chains have survived one of most complete is from early byzantine era found in egypt and it also is in british

includes stylised dolphins other four are relatively plain loop in loop chains although one has a chi rho symbol on clasp only christian element in jewellery necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in roman period with a pendant but no pendants were found in hoard three rings were originally set with gems which might have been natural gemstones or pieces of coloured glass however these were taken from rings before they were buried perhaps for re use rings are of similar design one with an oval bezel one with a circular bezel and one with a large oblong bezel there were 19 bracelets buried in hoard including three matching sets of four made of gold many similar bracelets have survived but sets of four are most unusual they may have been worn two on each arm or possibly were shared by two related women one set has been decorated by gold with lateral and transverse grooves other two sets bear pierced work geometric designs another five bracelets bear hunting scenes common in late roman decorative art three have designs executed in pierced work whereas two others are in repousse one bracelet is sole gold item in hoard to carry an inscription it reads in latin meaning use happily lady juliane expression felix or sometimes uti felix is second most common inscriptional formula on items from roman britain and is used to wish good luck well being and joy formula is not specifically christian but it sometimes occurs in an explicitly christian context for example together with a chi rho symbol jewellery may have represented reserve items rarely or never used from collection of a wealthy woman or family some of most common types of jewellery are absent such as brooches pendants and ear rings items set with gems are notably missing although they were very much in taste of day catherine johns former senior curator for roman britain at british museum speculates that current or favourite jewellery of owner was not included in hoard silver items thumb alt a short handled spoon with fine detail marked in bowl of spoon of a cat headed two legged fish tailed creature surrounded by fleur de lys silver gilt cignus spoon decorated with a mythical marine creature hoard contains about 100 silver and silver gilt items number is imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts they include a statuette of a leaping tigress made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp four pepper pots piperatoria a beaker a vase or juglet a small jug four bowls a small dish and 98 silver spoons and ladles beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns and juglet has three gilded bands in contrast small bowls and dish are plain and it is presumed that owners of hoard had many more such items probably including large decorated dishes found in other hoards many pieces are gilded in parts to accentuate decoration technique of fire gilding with mercury was used as was typical at time piperatoria thumb alt 3 silvery objects two of recumbent animals one with prominent horns and a bust right piperatoria display of a selection of spice dispensers from hoard pepper pot on right depicts an elegant and learned lady pepper pots include one vessel finely modelled after a wealthy or imperial lady which soon became known as empress pepper pot woman s hair jewellery and clothing are carefully represented and gilding is used to emphasise many details she is holding a scroll in her left hand giving impression of education as well as wealth other pepper pots in hoard are modelled into a statue of hercules and antaeus an ibex and a hare and hound together not all such spice dispensers held pepper they were used to dispense other spices as well but are grouped in discussions as pepper pots each of those found in this hoard has a mechanism in base to rotate an internal disc which controls aperture of two holes in base when fully open containers could have been filled using a funnel when part open they could have been shaken over food or drink to add spices is generally translated as pepper pot and black pepper is considered most likely condiment these were used for pepper is only one of a number of expensive high status spices which these vessels might have dispensed however piperatoria are rare examples of this type of roman silverware and according to johns hoxne finds have significantly expanded date range typology and iconographic scope of type trade and use of pepper in this period has been supported with evidence of mineralized black pepper at three northern province sites recovered in 1990s and from vindolanda tablets which record purchase of an unspecified quantity of pepper for two denarii archaeological sites with contemporary finds have revealed spices including coriander poppy celery dill

decorated on her back but her underside is quite perfunctorily finished her stripes are represented by two engraved lines with a black niello inlay between them in most places not meeting engraved lines neither her elongated body nor distribution of stripes are accurate for species she has a long dorsal stripe running from skull along spine to start of tail which is typical of tabby cats rather than tigers figure has no stripes around her tail which thickens at end suggesting a thick fur tip as in a lion s tail which tigers do not have although roman art usually gives them one large collection of spoons includes 51 cochlearia which are small spoons with shallow bowls and long tapering handles with a pointed end which was used to pierce eggs and spear small pieces of food as romans did not use forks at table there are 23 which are much rarer having large rather shallow spoons with shorter bird headed handles and about 20 deep round spoons or small ladles and strainer spoons many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures many of spoons are decorated with a christian monogram cross or chi rho symbol and sometimes also with greek letters alpha and omega an appellation for jesus who is described as alpha and omega in book of revelation three sets of ten spoons and several other spoons are decorated with such christian symbols as is often case with roman silver spoons many also have a latin inscription on them either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life in total eight different people are named seven on spoons and one on single beaker in hoard aurelius ursicinus datianus euherius faustinus peregrinus quintus sanctus and silvicola most common name is aurelius ursicinus which occurs on a set of five cochlearia and five ladles it is unknown whether any of people named in these inscriptions would have been involved in hiding hoard or were even alive at time it was buried although only one of these inscriptions is explicitly christian vivas in deo inscriptions on silver spoons comprising a name followed by vivas or vivat usually can be identified as christian in other late roman hoards for example mildenhall treasure has five spoons three with chi rho monograms and two with vivas inscriptions vivas and vivas formula vir bone vivas also occurs on a spoon from thetford hoard but whereas thetford hoard spoons have mostly pagan inscriptions e g dei fau ni of god faunus mead begotten hoxne hoard does not have any inscriptions of a specifically pagan nature and hoard may be considered to have come from a christian household or households it often is assumed that roman spoons with chi rho monograms or vivas in deo formula are either christening spoons perhaps

one in shape of a crane like bird other with an empty socket probably for bristles for a makeup brush there are also a number of small items of uncertain function described as toiletry pieces some are picks others perhaps scrapers and three have empty sockets at one end which probably contained organic material such as bristle to make a brush size of these would be appropriate for cleaning teeth or applying cosmetics among other possibilities average purity of silver items is 96 remainder of metal is made up of copper and a small amount of zinc with trace amounts of lead gold and bismuth present zinc is likely to have been present in a copper brass used to alloy silver when objects were made and lead gold and bismuth probably were present in unrefined silver ore iron and organic materials iron objects found in hoard are probably remains of outer wooden chest these consist of large iron rings double spiked loops and hinges strap hinges probable components of locks angle brackets wide and narrow iron strips and nails organic finds are rarely well documented with hoards because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated hoxne organic finds included bone wood other plant material and leather small fragments were found from a decorated ivory pyxis a cylindrical lidded box along with more than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber all native to britain wood traces associated with iron fittings of outer chest established that it was made of oak silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew some wheat straw survived from padding between plain silver bowls which also bore faint traces of linen cloth leather fragments were too degraded for identification scientific analysis of finds initial metallurgical analysis of hoard was carried out in late 1992 and early 1993 by cowell and hook for procedural purposes of coroner s inquest this analysis used x ray fluorescence a technique that was applied again later to cleaned surfaces on specimens all 29 items of gold jewellery were analysed with silver and copper found to be present results were typical for roman silver in hoards of period in terms of presence of copper alloyed with silver to harden it and trace elements one repaired bowl showed a mercury based solder cowell and hook analysis of metal artefacts pp 175 184 in johns 2010 large of pierced gold opus showed traces of hematite on reverse side which probably would have been used as a type of jeweller s rouge this is

body chain have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler burial and historical background hoxne hoard was buried during a period of great upheaval in britain marked by collapse of roman authority in province departure of majority of roman army and first of a wave of attacks by anglo saxons attacks on italy by visigoths around turn of fifth century caused general stilicho to recall roman army units from gaul and britannia while stilicho held off visigoth attack western provinces were left defenceless against suebi alans and vandals who crossed frozen rhine in 406 and overran gaul remaining roman troops in britain fearing that invaders would cross channel elected a series of emperors of their own to lead defence first two such emperors were put to death by dissatisfied soldiery in a matter of months but third who would declare himself constantine iii led a british force across english channel to gaul in his bid to become roman emperor after scoring victories against barbarians in gaul constantine was defeated by an army loyal to honorius and beheaded in 411 meanwhile constantine s departure had left britain vulnerable to attacks from saxon and irish raiders after 410 roman histories give little information about events in britain writing in next decade saint jerome described britain after 410 as a province fertile of tyrants suggesting collapse of central authority and rise of local leaders in response to repeated raids by saxons and others by 452 a gaulish chronicler was able to state that some ten years previously britons which to this time had suffered from various disasters and misfortunes are reduced by power of saxons burial exactly who owned hoxne hoard and their reasons for burying it are not known and probably never will be however hoard itself and its context provide some important clues hoard evidently was buried carefully some distance from any buildings hoard very likely represents only a portion of precious metal wealth of person or people who owned it many common types of jewellery are missing as are large tableware items such as those found in mildenhall treasure it is unlikely that anyone would have possessed rich gold and silver items found in hoxne hoard without owning items in those other categories whoever owned hoard also would have had wealth in form of land livestock buildings furniture and clothing at most hoxne hoard represents a moderate portion of wealth of someone rich conversely it may represent a minuscule fraction of wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy appearance of names aurelius ursicinus and juliane on items in hoxne hoard need not imply that people by those names owned rest of hoard either at time of its burial or previously there are no historical references to an aurelius ursicinus in britain in this period while a marcus aurelius ursicinus is recorded in praetorian guard in rome in period 222 235 a soldier or official of late fourth or early fifth century would be more likely to take imperial nomen flavius rather than aurelius this leads tomlin to speculate name aurelius ursicinus might sound old fashioned it would certainly have been more appropriate to a provincial landowner than an army officer or government official there are a number of theories about why hoard was buried one is that hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe perhaps in response to one of many upheavals facing roman britain in early fifth century this is not only hypothesis however archaeologist peter guest argues that hoard was buried because items in it were used as part of a system of gift exchange and as britain separated from roman empire they were no longer required a third hypothesis is that hoxne hoard represents proceeds of a robbery buried to avoid detection late roman hoards thumb alt a large silver dish decorated in bas relief in three rings in center ring whose diameter is roughly 1 7 of whole

of dish around outermost ring humans and a faun are depicted as dancing making music drinking and enjoying other pastimes fourth century great dish from mildenhall treasure is a fine example of large silver tableware of sort missing at hoxne although it is believed owners also would have possessed such pieces hoxne hoard comes from later part of a century c 350 450 from which an unusually large number of hoards have been discovered mostly from fringes of empire such hoards vary in character but many include large pieces of silver tableware lacking in hoxne hoard dishes jugs and ewers bowls and cups some plain but many highly decorated two other major hoards discovered in modern east anglia in last century are from fourth century both are now in british museum mildenhall treasure from suffolk consists of thirty items of silver tableware deposited in late fourth century many large and elaborately decorated such as great dish water newton treasure from cambridgeshire is smaller but is earliest hoard to have a clearly christian character apparently belonging to a church or chapel assorted collection probably includes items made in britain kaiseraugst treasure from site at augusta raurica in modern switzerland now in basel contained 257 items including a banqueting service with sophisticated decoration esquiline treasure found in rome evidently came from a wealthy roman family of late fourth century and includes several large items including casket of most of esquiline treasure is in british museum as are bowls and dishes from carthage treasure which belonged to a known family in roman africa around 400 mildenhall kaiseraugst and esquiline treasures comprise large items of tableware other hoards however such as those found at thetford and consist mostly of coins jewellery and small tableware items these two hoards probably are pagan votive offerings a hoard from traprain law in scotland contains decorated roman silver pieces cut up and folded showing regard for value of their metal alone and may represent loot from a raid local context hoxne where hoard was discovered is located in suffolk in modern day east anglia although no large aristocratic villa has been located in hoxne area there was a roman settlement nearby from first through fourth centuries at scole about north west of hoxne at intersection of two roman roads one of these pye road today s a140 linked venta st edmund to colchester and londinium london field in which hoard was discovered was shown by 1994 excavation to probably have been cleared by early bronze age when it began to be used for agriculture and settlement some settlement activity occurred near hoard findspot by first half of first millennium bc but there is no evidence of roman buildings in immediate vicinity field where hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during early phase of roman period but apparent absence of fourth century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time hoxne hoard is not only cache of roman treasure to have been discovered in area in 1781 some labourers unearthed a lead box by river at clint farm in eye south of scole and south west of hoxne box contained about 600 roman gold coins dating to reigns of valens and valentinian i reigned 364 375 gratian 375 383 theodosius i 378 395 arcadius 395 408 and honorius 393 423 this was largest hoard of roman gold coins ever discovered in britain but coins were dispersed during 18th and 19th centuries and cannot now be easily be identified in coin collections as a result relationship if any between eye hoard and that in hoxne cannot be determined even if proximity suggests they may have been related soon after hoxne hoard was discovered there was speculation based on name faustinus engraved on one of spoons that it may have come from villa faustini that is recorded in itinerary v of antonine itinerary exact location of villa faustini is unknown but as it was first station after colchester it is believed to have been somewhere on pye road modern a140 and one of possible locations for it is modern village of scole only a couple of miles from hoxne this early theory has since been rejected however because faustinus was historically a common name and it only occurs on a single spoon in hoard furthermore logic of using inscriptions on individual items in hoard to determine ownership of hoard as a whole is considered flawed based on dating of coins in hoard majority of which belong to period 394 405 it also has been speculated that contents of hoard originally belonged to a military family that accompanied count theodosius to britain in 368 369 and which may have left with constantine iii in 407 acquisition display and impact thumb alt
