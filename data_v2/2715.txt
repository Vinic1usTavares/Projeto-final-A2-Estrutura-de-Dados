ordered as part of anglo german naval arms race they were fourth generation of german dreadnought battleships and they were built in response to british that had been ordered in 1909 konigs represented a development of earlier with primary improvement being a more efficient arrangement of main battery ships had also been intended to use a diesel engine on center propeller shaft to increase their cruising range but development of diesels proved to be more complicated than expected so an all steam turbine powerplant was retained kronprinz displaced as built and fully loaded with a length of a beam of and a draft of she was powered by three parsons steam turbines with steam provided by three oil fired and twelve coal fired schulz thornycroft water tube boilers which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of ship had a range of at a cruising speed of her crew numbered 41 officers and 1 095 enlisted men she was armed with ten sk l 50 guns arranged in five twin gun

mid 1914 fitting out work was completed by 8 november 1914 day she was commissioned into high seas fleet kronprinz was completed in november 1914 following her commissioning she joined iii battle squadron of high seas fleet gottfried von dalwigk zu lichtenfels served as ship s first commander kronprinz completed her sea trials on 2 january 1915 first operation in which she participated was an uneventful sortie by fleet into north sea on 29 30 march three weeks later on 17 18 april she and her sisters supported an operation in which light cruisers of ii scouting group laid mines off swarte bank another sweep by fleet occurred on 22 april two days later iii squadron returned to baltic for another round of exercises on 8 may an explosion occurred in center turret s right gun baltic exercises lasted until 13 may at which point iii squadron returned to north sea another minelaying operation was conducted by ii scouting group on 17 may with battleship again in support kronprinz participated in a fleet operation into north sea which ended without combat from 29 until 31 may 1915 in august feldt replaced dalwigk zu lichtenfels as ship s captain ship supported a minelaying

battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to target and had to withdraw other battlecruisers bombarded town of lowestoft unopposed but during approach to yarmouth they encountered british cruisers of harwich force a short gun duel ensued before harwich force withdrew reports of british submarines in area prompted retreat of i scouting group at this point admiral reinhard scheer who had been warned of sortie of grand fleet from its base in scapa flow also withdrew to safer german waters battle of jutland thumb maps showing maneuvers of british blue and german red fleets on 31 may 1 june 1916 alt

of i battle squadron shortly before 16 00 battlecruisers of i scouting group encountered british 1st battlecruiser squadron under command of david beatty opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw destruction of shortly after 17 00 and less than half an hour later by this time german battlecruisers were steaming south to draw british ships toward main body of high seas fleet at 17 30 konigs crew spotted both i scouting group and 1st battlecruiser squadron approaching german battlecruisers were steaming to starboard while british ships steamed to port at 17 45 scheer ordered a two point turn to port to bring his ships closer to british battlecruisers and a minute later order to open fire was given kronprinzs sisters opened fire on british battlecruisers but kronprinz was not close enough to engage them instead she and ten other german battleships fired at 2nd light cruiser squadron kronprinz fired at from 17 51 to 18 00 at ranges of then shifted her fire to fast battleship at 18 08 at a range of 17 000 m kronprinz fired first with semi armor piercing shells to find range to her target then with standard armor piercing shells by time malaya drew out of range 13 minutes later only one hit had been reported by kronprinzs gunners according to naval historian john campbell this hit was more likely flash of guns seen through haze and smoke during this period several salvos fell close to kronprinz though none struck her kronprinz again reached a firing position against malaya at 18 30 but was only able to fire for six minutes before british ship again pulled away thumb left a konig class battleship firing her main guns at jutland by claus bergen shortly after 19 00 several british destroyers attempted a torpedo attack against leading ships of german line destroyer fired a pair of torpedoes at kronprinz at a range of though both missed german cruiser had been disabled by a shell from british battlecruiser and rear admiral paul behncke in konig ordered his four ships to maneuver to cover stricken cruiser simultaneously british iii and iv light cruiser squadrons began a torpedo attack on german line while advancing to torpedo range they smothered wiesbaden with fire from their main guns kronprinz and her sisters fired heavily on british cruisers but failed to drive them off in ensuing melee british armored cruiser was struck by several heavy caliber shells from german dreadnoughts one salvo penetrated ship s ammunition magazines and in a massive explosion destroyed cruiser john campbell notes that although defences destruction is usually attributed to battlecruiser there is a possibility that it was kronprinzs fire that destroyed ship after destruction of defence kronprinz shifted her fire to british cruiser was badly damaged and forced to withdraw from battle she was unable to reach port and was abandoned following morning by 20 00 german line was ordered to turn eastward to disengage from british fleet markgraf directly ahead of kronprinz had engine problems and fell out of formation then fell in behind kronprinz between 20 00 and 20 30 kronprinz and other iii squadron battleships engaged british 2nd light cruiser squadron as well as battleships of grand fleet kronprinz attempted to find range by observing british muzzle flashes but worsening visibility prevented her gunners from acquiring a target as a result she held her fire in this period kronprinz was violently shaken by several near misses at 20 18 scheer ordered fleet to turn away a third time to escape from murderous british gunfire this turn reversed order of fleet and placed kronprinz toward end of line after successfully withdrawing from british scheer ordered fleet to assume night cruising formation though communication errors between scheer aboard and lead ship caused delays fleet fell into formation by 23 30 with kronprinz 14th vessel in line of 24 capital ships thumb painting of a konig class ship under fire at jutland by claus

and other battleships turned away to avoid torpedoes one torpedo fired by destroyer exploded about behind kronprinz in battleship s wake both obedient and reported a hit on kronprinz though she was undamaged by near miss heavy fire from german battleships forced british destroyers to withdraw high seas fleet had managed to punch through british light forces and subsequently reached horns reef by 04 00 on 1 june and wilhelmshaven a few hours later i squadron battleships took up defensive positions in outer roadstead while kronprinz and stood ready just outside entrance to wilhelmshaven in course of battle kronprinz had fired 144 armor piercing and semi armor piercing rounds from her main battery guns though exact numbers of each are unknown ship did not fire her secondary 15 cm or 8 8 cm guns during entire engagement of four konig class ships only kronprinz escaped damage during battle subsequent operations on 18 august 1916 kronprinz took part in an operation to bombard sunderland admiral scheer attempted a repeat of original 31 may plan two serviceable german battlecruisers and supported by three dreadnoughts were to bombard coastal town of sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy beatty s battlecruisers rest of fleet including kronprinz would trail behind and provide cover british were aware of german plans and sortied grand fleet to meet them by 14 35 admiral scheer had been warned of grand fleet s approach and unwilling to engage whole of grand fleet just eleven weeks after decidedly close call at jutland turned his forces around and retreated to german ports kronprinz participated in two uneventful fleet operations one a month prior on 16 july to north of helgoland and one into north sea on 18 20 october kronprinz and rest of iii squadron were sent to baltic directly afterward for training which lasted until 2 november upon returning from baltic kronprinz and rest of iii squadron were ordered to cover retrieval of a pair of u boats that were stranded on danish coast on return trip on 5 november 1916 kronprinz was torpedoed by british submarine near horns reef torpedo struck ship beneath forward most gun turret and allowed approximately of water into ship kronprinz maintained her speed and reached port following day she was placed in drydock at imperial dockyard in wilhelmshaven for repairs which lasted from 6 november to 4 december during this period bernhard took command of vessel after returning to iii squadron kronprinz took part in squadron training in baltic before conducting defensive patrols in german bight in early 1917 ship became flagship of deputy commander of squadron at that time rear admiral karl during training maneuvers on 5 march 1917 kronprinz was accidentally rammed by her sister ship in heligoland bight collision caused minor flooding in area abreast of her forward superfiring turret kronprinz shipped some of water she again went into drydock in wilhelmshaven from 6 march to 14 may on 11 september kronprinz was detached for training in baltic she then joined special unit for operation albion operation albion in early september 1917 following german conquest of russian port of riga german navy decided to eliminate russian naval forces that still held gulf of riga admiralstab navy high command planned an operation to seize baltic island of osel and specifically russian gun batteries on sworbe peninsula on 18 september order was issued for a joint operation with army to capture osel and moon islands primary naval component was to comprise flagship moltke along with iii battle squadron of high seas fleet v division included four konig class ships and was by this time augmented with new battleship bayern vi division consisted of five kaiser class battleships along with nine light cruisers three torpedo boat flotillas and dozens of mine warfare ships entire force numbered some 300 ships supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins invasion force amounted to

anchored off osel in tagga bay and disembarked soldiers by 05 50 konig opened fire on russian coastal artillery emplacements joined by moltke bayern and other three konig class ships simultaneously kaiser class ships engaged batteries on sworbe peninsula objective was to secure channel between moon and dago islands which would block only escape route of russian ships in gulf both grosser kurfurst and bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions with minimal damage to former bayern was severely damaged and had to be withdrawn to kiel for repairs after bombardment kronprinz departed area for wiek where she refueled ship passed through irben strait on 16 october on 16 october it was decided to detach a portion of invasion flotilla to clear russian naval forces in moon sound these included two russian pre dreadnoughts to this end kronprinz and konig along with cruisers and and a number of smaller vessels were sent to engage russian battleships they arrived by morning of 17 october but a deep russian minefield thwarted their progress germans were surprised to discover that 30 5 cm guns of russian battleships out ranged their own 30 5 cm guns russian ships managed to keep range long enough to prevent german battleships from being able to return fire while still firing effectively on german ships and germans had to take several evasive maneuvers to avoid russian shells by 10 00 minesweepers had cleared a path through minefield and kronprinz and konig dashed into bay at around 10 15 kronprinz opened fire on tsarevitch and bayan and scored hits on both konig meanwhile dispatched slava russian vessels were hit dozens of times until at 10 30 russian naval commander admiral bakhirev ordered their withdrawal on 18 october kronprinz was slightly grounded though damage was not serious enough to necessitate withdrawal for repairs by 20 october fighting on islands was winding down moon osel and dago were in german possession previous day admiralstab had ordered cessation of naval actions and return of dreadnoughts to high seas fleet as soon as possible on 26th kronprinz was more seriously grounded on return trip to kiel she managed to reach kiel on 2 november and subsequently wilhelmshaven repairs were effected from 24 november to 8 january 1918 advance of 23 april 1918 on 27 january kaiser directed that ship be renamed kronprinz wilhelm in honor of crown prince ship was formally renamed on 15 june 1918 30th anniversary of kaiser s reign by this time german light forces had begun raiding coal convoys between britain and norway prompting grand fleet to detach battleships to escort shipments germans were now presented with an opportunity for which they had been waiting entire war a portion of numerically stronger grand fleet was separated and could be isolated and destroyed admiral franz von hipper now fleet commander planned operation i scouting group with its accompanying light cruisers and destroyers would attack one of large convoys while rest of high seas fleet would stand by ready to attack british battle squadron at 05 00 on 23 april 1918 german fleet including kronprinz departed from schillig roadstead hipper ordered wireless transmissions be kept to a minimum to prevent radio intercepts by british intelligence at 06 10 german battlecruisers had reached a position approximately southwest of bergen when moltke lost her inner starboard propeller which severely damaged ship s engines crew effected temporary repairs that allowed ship to steam at but it was decided to take ship under tow despite this setback hipper continued northward by 14 00 hipper s force had crossed convoy route several times but had found nothing at 14 10 hipper turned his ships southward by 18 37 german fleet had made it back to defensive minefields surrounding their bases it was later discovered that convoy had left port a day later than expected by german planning staff kronprinz saw no further major activity for remainder of war during this period rear admiral ernst goette and now rear admiral feldt flew their flags ship ship during their tenures as squadron deputy commander vessel went to imperial dockyard in kiel in mid september for periodic maintenance fate kronprinz wilhelm and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at end of october 1918 days before armistice was to take effect bulk of high seas fleet was to have sortied from their base in wilhelmshaven to engage british grand fleet scheer by now grand admiral grossadmiral of fleet intended to inflict as much damage as possible on british navy in order to retain a better bargaining position for germany despite expected casualties many of war weary sailors felt operation would disrupt peace process and prolong war on morning of 29 october 1918 order was given to sail from wilhelmshaven following day starting on night of 29 october sailors on and then on several other battleships including kronprinz wilhelm mutinied unrest ultimately forced hipper and scheer to cancel operation informed of situation kaiser stated i no longer have a navy thumb upright 1 6 scuttled german fleet at scapa flow alt a map designating locations where german ships were sunk following capitulation of germany in november 1918 most of high seas fleet under command of rear admiral ludwig von reuter were interned in british naval base in scapa flow prior to departure of german fleet admiral adolf von trotha made clear to reuter that he could not allow allies to seize ships under any conditions fleet rendezvoused with british light cruiser which led ships to allied fleet that was to escort germans to scapa flow massive flotilla consisted of some 370 british american and french warships once ships were interned their guns were disabled through removal of their breech blocks and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and men fleet remained in captivity during negotiations that ultimately produced treaty of versailles reuter believed that british intended to seize german ships on 21 june 1919 which was deadline for germany to have signed peace treaty unaware that deadline had been extended to 23rd reuter ordered ships to be sunk at next opportunity on morning of 21 june british fleet left scapa flow to conduct training maneuvers and at 11 20 reuter transmitted order to his ships kronprinz wilhelm sank at 13 15 british guard detail panicked in their attempt to prevent germans from scuttling ships british soldiers aboard a nearby drifter shot and killed a stoker from kronprinz wilhelm in total guards killed nine germans and wounded twenty one remaining crews totaling some 1 860 officers and enlisted men were imprisoned kronprinz wilhelm was never raised for scrapping unlike most of other capital ships that were scuttled kronprinz wilhelm and two of her sisters had sunk in deeper water than other capital ships which made a salvage attempt more difficult outbreak of world war ii in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations and after war it was determined that salvaging deeper wrecks was financially impractical rights to future salvage operations on wreck were sold to britain in 1962 depth in which three battleships sank insulated them from radiation released by use of atomic weapons as a result kronprinz wilhelm and her sisters are one of few remaining sources of radiation free steel ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices kronprinz wilhelm and other vessels on bottom of scapa flow are a popular dive site and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from wrecks in 2017 marine archaeologists from orkney research centre for archaeology conducted extensive surveys of kronprinz wilhelm and nine other wrecks in area including six other german and three british warships archaeologists mapped wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as part of an effort to determine how wrecks are deteriorating wreck at some point came into ownership of firm scapa flow salvage which sold rights to vessel to tommy clark a diving contractor in 1981 clark listed wreck for sale on ebay with a buy it now price of ps250 000 with auction lasting until 28 june 2019 three other wrecks those of markgraf konig and light cruiser all also owned by clark were also placed for sale wrecks of kronprinz wilhelm and her two sisters ultimately sold for ps25 500 apiece to a company from middle east while karlsruhe sold to a private buyer
