atlantic hurricane overall hurricane left between 6 000 and 12 000 fatalities in united states number most cited in official reports is 8 000 most of these deaths occurred in and near galveston texas after storm surge inundated coastline with 8 to 12 ft 2 4 to 3 7 m of water in addition to number killed storm destroyed about 7 000 buildings of all uses in galveston which included 3 636 destroyed homes every dwelling in city suffered some degree of damage hurricane left approximately 10 000 people in city homeless out of a total population of nearly 38 000 disaster ended golden era of galveston as hurricane alarmed potential investors who turned to houston instead in response to storm three engineers designed and oversaw plans to raise gulf of mexico shoreline of galveston island by and erect a seawall on august 27 1900 a ship east of windward islands detected a tropical cyclone first observed during annual season initially at tropical storm status it remained mostly stagnant in intensity while moving steadily west northwestward and entered northeastern caribbean sea on august 30 storm made landfall in dominican republic as a weak tropical storm on september 2 it weakened slightly while crossing hispaniola before re emerging into caribbean sea later that day on september 3 cyclone struck modern day santiago de cuba province and then slowly drifted along southern coast of cuba upon reaching gulf of mexico on september 6 storm strengthened into a hurricane significant intensification followed and system peaked as a category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph 230 km h on september 8 early on next day it made landfall to south of houston texas cyclone weakened quickly after moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity late on september 9 storm turned east northeastward and became extratropical over iowa on september 11 extratropical system strengthened while accelerating across midwestern united states new england and eastern canada before reaching gulf of saint lawrence on september 13 after striking newfoundland later that day extratropical storm entered far north atlantic ocean and weakened with remnants last observed near iceland on september 15 great storm brought flooding and severe thunderstorms to portions of caribbean especially cuba and jamaica it is likely that much of south florida experienced tropical storm force winds though mostly minor damage occurred hurricane force winds and storm surge inundated portions of southern louisiana though cyclone left no significant structural damage or fatalities in state hurricane brought strong winds and storm surge to a large portion of east texas with galveston suffering brunt of impact farther north storm and its remnants continued to produce heavy rains and gusty winds which downed telegraph wires signs and trees in several states fatalities occurred in other states including fifteen in ohio six in wisconsin two in illinois two in new york one in massachusetts and one in missouri damage from storm throughout united states exceeded 34 million remnants also brought severe impact to canada in ontario damage reached about 1 35 million with 1 million to crops remnants of hurricane caused at least 52 deaths and possibly as many as 232 deaths in canada mostly due to sunken vessels near newfoundland and french territory of saint pierre throughout its path storm caused more than 35 4 million in damage meteorological history system is believed to have started as a tropical wave moving off western coast of africa this was because of limited observational methods available to contemporary meteorologists with ship reports being only reliable tool for observing hurricanes first formal sighting of tropical storm occurred on august 27 about east of windward islands when a ship encountered an area of unsettled weather over next couple of days system moved west northwestwards and is thought to have maintained its intensity as a weak tropical storm before it passed through leeward islands and into caribbean sea during august 31 on september 1 father lorenzo gangoite director of belen college observatory in havana cuba noted that storm was in its formative stages with only vague indications of a small tropical cyclone to southwest of saint croix during that day system passed to south of puerto rico before it made landfall near bani dominican republic early on september 2 moving west northwestward storm crossed island of hispaniola and entered into windward passage near saint marc haiti several hours later system made landfall on cuba near santiago de cuba during september 3 before it moved slowly west northwestward across island and emerged into straits of florida as a tropical storm on september 5 as system emerged into straits of florida gangoite observed a large persistent halo around moon while sky turned deep red and cirrus clouds moved northwards this indicated to him that tropical storm had intensified and that prevailing winds were moving system towards coast of texas however united states weather bureau disagreed with this forecast as they expected system to recurve and make landfall in florida before impacting american east coast an area of high pressure over florida keys ultimately moved system northwestward into gulf of mexico where favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures allowed storm to intensify into a hurricane thumb right 325px hurricane track from september 1 to 10 alt an alternative style track map focusing on storm s path from september 1 10 in eastern gulf of mexico on september 6 ship louisiana encountered hurricane whose captain t p halsey estimated that system had wind speeds of 100 mph 160 km h hurricane continued to strengthen significantly while heading west northwestward across gulf of mexico on september 7 system reached its peak intensity with estimated sustained wind speeds of 145 mph 230 km h which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on modern day saffir simpson scale that day weather bureau realized that storm was continuing west northwestward across gulf of mexico rather than turning northward over florida and east coast of united states however weather bureau director willis moore insisted that cyclone was not of hurricane intensity hurricane weakened slightly on september 8 and recurved to northwest as it approached coast of texas while weather bureau office in galveston began observing hurricane force winds by 22 00 utc cyclone made landfall around 8 00 p m cst on september 8 02 00 utc on september 9 to south of houston as a category 4 hurricane while crossing galveston island and west bay eye passed southwest of city of galveston hurricane quickly weakened after moving inland falling to tropical storm intensity late on september 9 storm lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over iowa by 12 00 utc on september 11 moving rapidly east northeastward extratropical system re intensified becoming equivalent of a category 1 hurricane over ontario on september 12 extratropical remnants reached gulf of saint lawrence early following day after crossing newfoundland and entering far northern atlantic hours later remnants of hurricane weakened and were last noted near iceland on september 15 background city of galveston formally founded in 1839 had weathered numerous storms all of which city survived with ease in late 19th century galveston was a booming town with population increasing from 29 084 people in 1890 to 37 788 people in 1900 city was fourth largest municipality in terms of population in state of texas in 1900 and among highest per capita income rates in united states galveston had many ornate business buildings in a downtown section called strand which was considered wall street of southwest city s position on natural harbor of galveston bay along gulf of mexico made it center of trade in texas and one of busiest ports in nation with this prosperity came a sense of complacency as residents believed any future storms would be no worse than previous events in fact galveston weather bureau section director isaac cline wrote an 1891 article in galveston daily news that it would be impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike island a quarter of a century earlier nearby town of indianola on matagorda bay was undergoing its own boom then in 1875 a powerful hurricane blew through nearly destroying town indianola was rebuilt though a second hurricane in 1886 caused most of town s residents move elsewhere many galveston residents took destruction of indianola as an object lesson on threat posed by hurricanes galveston is built on a low flat island little more than a large sandbar along gulf coast these residents proposed a seawall be constructed to protect city but majority of population and city s government dismissed their concerns cline further argued in his 1891 article in galveston daily news that a seawall was not needed due to his belief that a strong hurricane would not strike island as a result seawall was not built and development activities on island actively increased its vulnerability to storms sand dunes along shore were cut down to fill low areas in city removing what little barrier there was to gulf of mexico preparations on september 4 galveston office of weather bureau as it was then called began receiving warnings from bureau s central office in washington d c that a tropical disturbance had moved northward over cuba at time they discouraged use of terms such as tornado or hurricane to avoid panicking residents in path of any storm event weather bureau forecasters had no way of knowing storm s trajectory as weather bureau director willis moore implemented a policy to block telegraph reports from cuban meteorologists at belen observatory in havana considered one of most advanced meteorological institutions in world at time due to tensions in aftermath of spanish american war moore also changed protocol to force local weather bureau offices to seek authorization from central office before issuing storm warnings weather bureau forecasters believed that storm had begun a northward curve into florida and that it would eventually turn northeastward and emerge over atlantic as a result central office of weather bureau issued a storm warning in florida from cedar key to miami on september 5 by following day a hurricane warning was in effect along coast from cedar key to savannah georgia while storm warnings were displayed from charleston south carolina to kitty hawk north carolina as well as from pensacola florida to new orleans louisiana cuban forecasters adamantly disagreed with weather bureau saying hurricane would continue west one cuban forecaster predicted hurricane would continue into central texas near san antonio in galveston on morning of september 8 swells persisted despite only partly cloudy skies largely because of unremarkable weather few residents saw cause for concern few people evacuated across galveston s bridges to mainland and majority of population was unconcerned by rain clouds that began rolling in by midmorning according to his memoirs galveston weather bureau director isaac cline personally traveled by horse along beach and other low lying areas to warn people of storm s approach however these accounts by cline and his brother galveston meteorologist joseph l cline have been in dispute since although isaac cline is credited with issuing a hurricane warning without permission from bureau s central office author erik larson points to isaac cline s earlier insistence that a seawall was unnecessary and his notion that an intense hurricane could not strike island even considering it simply an absurd delusion to believe otherwise further no other survivors corroborated these accounts impact caribbean antigua reported a severe thunderstorm passing over on august 30 with lower barometric pressures and of rain on island in puerto rico storm produced winds up to at san juan heavy rains fell in cuba in association with cyclone including a peak 24 hour total of in

of british pounds united states great galveston hurricane made landfall on september 9 1900 near galveston texas it had estimated winds of 140 mph 220 km h at landfall making cyclone a category 4 storm on modern day saffir simpson scale hurricane caused great loss of life with a death toll of between 6 000 and 12 000 people number most cited in official reports is 8 000 giving storm third highest number of deaths of all atlantic hurricanes after great hurricane of 1780 and hurricane mitch in 1998 galveston hurricane of 1900 is deadliest natural disaster to strike united states this loss of life can be attributed to fact that officials for weather bureau in galveston brushed off reports and they did not realize threat more than 34 million in damage occurred throughout united states with about 30 million in galveston county texas alone if a similar storm struck in 2010 damage would be approximately 104 33 billion 2010 usd based on normalization a calculation that takes into account changes in inflation wealth and population in comparison costliest united states hurricanes hurricane katrina in 2005 and hurricane harvey in 2017 both caused about 125 billion in damage

in canadian waters is estimated to be between 52 and 232 making this at least eighth deadliest hurricane to affect canada large discrepancy between fatality figures is due to fact that many people were reported missing thus exact number of deaths is unknown aftermath city of galveston was effectively obliterated with city in ruins and railroads to mainland destroyed survivors had little to live on until relief arrived on september 9 galveston city officials established central relief committee for galveston storm sufferers crc chaired by mayor walter c jones crc was composed of subcommittees for specifics aspects of relief efforts including burial of deceased correspondence distribution of food and water finances hospitalization and rehabilitation for injured and public safety dead bodies were so numerous that burying all of them was impossible initially bodies were collected by dead gangs and then given to 50 african american men who were forcibly recruited at gunpoint to load them onto a barge about 700 bodies were taken out to sea to be dumped however after gulf currents washed many of bodies back onto beach a new solution was needed funeral pyres were set up on beaches or wherever dead bodies were found and burned day and night for several weeks after storm authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain distraught men conscripted for gruesome work of collecting and burning dead with thousands dead and roughly 2 000 survivors leaving city and never returning according to a morrison and fourmy company survey galveston initially experienced a significant population decline between 1907 and 1914 congregation b nai israel rabbi henry cohen and philanthropist jacob schiff spearheaded galveston movement cohen schiff and others created movement to draw jewish immigrants away from crowded area along east coast and toward cities farther west such as galveston although approximately 10 000 jewish immigrants arrived in galveston during this period few settled in city or island but about one fourth of them remained in texas 1910 census reported a population of 36 891 people in galveston although a decline from 1900 census population loss of thousands of
