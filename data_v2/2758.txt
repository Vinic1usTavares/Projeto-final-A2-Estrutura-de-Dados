sphecius grandis also called western cicada killer is a species of cicada killer wasp sphecius western species shares same nesting biology as its fellow species eastern cicada killer s speciosus s grandis like all other species of genus sphecius mainly provides cicadas for its offspring it forms nest aggregations and mates and broods once in a year in july and early august wasp is on average to in length and is amber yellow with yellow rings on its abdomen wasps in genus sphecius are not habitually aggressive and use their venom mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning place them in brood cells and lay eggs in cells s grandis is endemic to central america mexico and western united states and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of sphecius western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females but generally die after only a couple of days sphecius grandis can be distinguished from s convallis pacific cicada killer wasp by coloration pattern of gastral tergites formerly two species were distinguished on basis of number of tergites with yellow markings five in s grandis and three in s convallis but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish two species however they can be distinguished by density of punctation on first and second tergites taxonomy western cicada killer was first described by american naturalist thomas say in 1824 in madera canyon arizona as grandis its species name is latin adjective grandis meaning large it is one of five species of genus sphecius in north america more recently it has been suspected that western cicada killer represents more than one species it co occurs with eastern cicada killer s speciosus and pacific cicada killer s convallis at big bend national park in texas there three wasps hunt and nest in same locales and eastern and western cicada killers hunt same cicada species analysis of mitochondrial dna showed that western cicada killer contains two divergent clades which may represent distinct species two clades appeared to be split by rocky mountains with one occurring mainly to south and east other to west description ranging in size from in length western cicada killer is very similar to its eastern cousin sphecius speciosus with a rufous black hue to body amber stripes and a yellow abdomen western cicada killer has rufous spots on its first to second tergites and yellow markings can generally be found from first to fifth although there is some variation on average female forewing length lies between females are larger than males and live for a year a time just long enough to produce a brood whereas males die in only a few days just enough time to impregnate a female in steven j phillips book a natural history of sonoran desert he referred to them as superficially resembling huge yellowjackets or hornets and stated that they are powerful fliers with compound eyes phillips 1999 p 346 on average males weigh and females are far heavier at vander wall 1990 p 38 probably because of additional weight of ovaries developing eggs and nutritional reserves nevertheless ratio between flight muscle mass and body mass is same for both sexes identification distinguishing s grandis from other four new world species of sphecius s convallis s hogardii s speciosus s spectabilis is difficult female s convallis was originally distinguished from female s grandis by yellow marks from first to third gastral tergites on s convallis and yellow marks on all tergites for s grandis however this was found to be insufficient for correct identification because positions of markings can vary among different wasps of same species charles w holliday and joseph r coelho devised a new key in 2004 to identify sphecius species examining 4 451 wasps among five new world species and noting that 98 of female s convallis wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four or fewer and s grandis had 98 yellow markings from tergites one to five or more 2 percent of s grandis that overlapped with s convallis were determined by density of punctation in colour of first tergum against second markings on s grandis males were found to be same as on females thermoregulation it has been found that western cicada killer wasp is capable of thermoregulation which enables them to maintain territories during day a study by joseph r coelho showed that during territorial patrolling species had a high and regulated thorax temperature experiments found that wasp has ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that abdomen is generally kept colder than thorax dead wasps that were placed in sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants life cycle emergence and mating after hatching offspring feed on tissue of cicadas provided by their mother males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in july to early august when they mate and brood english naturalist charles darwin postulated that pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve chances of male mating timing of emergence of females has evolved to correspond with similar emergence of cicada species of area tibicen duryi and t parallela which they hunt for provisioning of their nests many have yellow markings located on their tergites dorsal portion although some have been found only from first to fifth tergites thumb sphecius speciosus eastern cicada killer shares many behavioral similarities with sphecius grandis because males emerge earlier than females males compete for mating territories surrounding nests in which females are located during a fight males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling evans 2007 p 35 another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into air which is thought to be a demonstration of strength as a general rule larger male more predominant he is in battles age influences success in defense and security of territory younger wasp greater chance of a successful takeover of territory some small males even engage in non territorial mating tactics and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival on emergence from nest female is sexually receptive but does not choose her mate but instead copulates with first male of her species that finds her once female has mated she rebuffs all advances by other wasps nesting and perching males perch after emerging from their nest they pick out an area close to a nest with females inside and guard territory around it so as to have a better chance of mating they tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps pebbles wood weeds grass blades and low tree branches males assume an alert posture ready for a challenge from another male or from a predator one study by a behavioral ecologist john alcock showed that a large majority of marked wasps returned to same perch day after day and two males swapped between two different sites species rarely perches on ground it shares same nesting biology as s speciosus all cicada killers are ground nesting insects and nest aggregations can contain up to hundreds of nests each with a single provisioning female their tunnel is mainly made in well drained bare sandy soil frequently under sidewalks but is generally in full sunlight approximately 90 of its life is spent underground as a larva it rarely infests grounds that are rich in vegetation in order for them to get more sun mounds are easily recognizable by their distinctive u shaped digging entrance feeding and hunting habits sphecius grandis has very similar nesting and feeding habits to other members of its genus most notably sphecius speciosus as with s speciosus female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks helped by calls of cicada males and paralyses insect by piercing central nervous system with her stinger she drags cicadas back to her nest to place them in brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell females carry cicadas that are on average 88 heavier than their own body mass it has been hypothesised that cicada killers may also have ability to capture cicadas mid flight there are approximately two or more cicadas to each brood cell when larvae hatch cicada provides nutrition for offspring to feed on wasps preferentially hunt for female cicadas because they have more consumable tissue but male cicadas are easier to locate which explains systemic bias towards male kills they chiefly hunt for tibicen duryi tibicen dealbata and tibicen parallela cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation which allows them to hunt for cicadas during day when cicadas are most prominent species is mostly harmless to humans some males when emerging early fly into trees to feed on sap and species has been known to feed on nectar stings of this species received a lethality rating of 46 lc measured by lc lc lethal capacity mg venom in insect ld50 of venom g size of mammal receiving dose and ld lethal dose 2009 p 1030 geographical distribution western cicada killers are found at a higher altitude than most other sphecius species and are sympatric with species s convallis and s speciosus even though s grandis are on average found at higher altitudes than s convallis a study showed that mean elevation for s grandis was 755 m 23 3 m compared with lower results of s speciosus 219 m 4 7 m s convallis 582 m 30 9 m and s hogardii 18 m 5 m species is nearctic and neotropic found from central america to western united states evans 2007 p 34 in new mexico california and every state west of rocky mountains except wyoming as well as kansas oklahoma and nebraska s grandis is most commonly found in riparian zones it has been observed in such places in mexico as baja california norte baja california sur coahuila nuevo leon tamaulipas and yucatan and also in granada nicaragua costa rica and honduras interaction with humans sphecius grandis wasps frequently interact with humans because of their tendency to make their nests in backyards gardens and sidewalks pest control is mostly unneeded as they nest in areas with little to no vegetation usually ignore people and females are not aggressive tending to save their venom for their cicada prey but will sting if they are grabbed or stepped on despite their large size being largest wasp to inhabit california their sting has been reported as being between merely numbing and sharp to moderate males while smaller are naturally more aggressive and less tolerant of disturbance references bibliography external links sphecius grandis at discover life
