2001 india cyclone was third strongest tropical cyclone in terms of barometric pressure to form in arabian sea on record only cyclones gonu in 2007 and in 2019 were stronger storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of somalia on may 18 over following few days system gradually organized into a tropical depression tracking eastward towards coastline of southwestern india storm slowly intensified shortly before reaching shore system turned north and later west away from land after taking this turn storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm attaining its peak intensity on may 24 with winds of 215 km h 130 mph 3 minute winds and a barometric pressure of 932 mbar hpa at time this ranked cyclone as strongest known storm in arabian sea after stalling several hundred kilometres offshore storm weakened over cooler waters that it had by may 27 system weakened to a cyclonic storm and by this time was approaching northwestern coastline of india near gujarat following day storm made landfall in saurashtra region as a deep depression with winds of 55 km h 35 mph 3 minute winds depression quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated early on may 29 although a powerful cyclone over water storm had relatively little impact over land in valsad district two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by storm however losses were more extensive offshore between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during storm meteorological history origins of 2001 india cyclone can be traced to a tropical disturbance over arabian sea on may 18 following day system was determined to be relatively stationary near island of socotra although deep convection was associated with disturbance there was no evidence of a low level circulation by may 20 disturbance slowly moved towards southeast in response to an upper level trough over india overall structure gradually improved as good outflow developed a mid level circulation finally developed late on may 21 prompting joint typhoon warning center jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert several hours later they began monitoring system as a tropical depression with identifier 01a however operational advisories were not issued until cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm intensity by morning of may 22 india meteorological department imd also took notice of system situated in a region favoring tropical cyclone development about southwest of mumbai india storm rapidly developed by afternoon of may 22 jtwc estimated that 01a attained winds of 120 km h 75 mph equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale additionally a wide eye developed within center of circulation during this intensification phase throughout most of may 22 strengthening slowed considerably as it paralleled southwestern coast of india initially it was feared that storm would move inland as a powerful cyclone however a ridge over northern arabian sea caused storm to turn westward back over open water once further away from land cyclone resumed intensification becoming a rare category 3 equivalent storm by morning of may 24 later that morning 01a attained its peak intensity with winds of 205 km h 125 mph according to jtwc however imd considered storm to be slightly stronger estimating that it attained winds of 215 km h 130 mph by three minute sustained winds along with a barometric pressure of 932 mbar hpa 27 52 inhg at time of peak intensity cyclone displayed a well defined eye and excellent outflow although a powerful storm it quickly weakened as conditions became hostile for tropical cyclone development strong wind shear tore convection away from cyclone and caused it to become disorganized within 48 hours system had degraded to a tropical storm and was situated roughly west southwest of mumbai weakening trend lessened shortly thereafter but still continued operationally jtwc issued their final advisory on cyclone on may 28 as it weakened to a tropical depression over open waters once powerful cyclone now devoid of all convection tracked towards northwestern coast of india during afternoon of may 29 cyclone rapidly regenerated as it made landfall in gujarat jtwc estimated that it crossed coastline with winds of 100 km h 65 mph not long after moving overland system rapidly weakened and dissipated over india within several hours preparations and impact ahead of storm all ports in gujarat including kandla one of largest in country were closed as a precautionary measure on may 25 over 10 000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in threatened region throughout india a total of 118 800 people were evacuated and 100 000 more were evacuated in pakistan indian military was placed on standby to undertake search and rescue missions immediately after storms passage fourteen districts of gujarat were placed on red alert highest level of preparedness seven emergency control centers were set up across country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about approaching storm several relief agencies were already positioned in region in response to a magnitude 6 9 earthquake in january of that year that killed over 20 000 people additional disaster relief teams were deployed to region to further prepare residents for cyclone food water and other necessities were stored and ready to be provided to victims of storm large swells produced by storm affected a large portion of western indian coastline especially in city of bombay in valsad district two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by storm offshore between 1 500 and 2 000 fishing vessels had lost contact with mainland later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of cyclone records operationally cyclone was considered to be a category 4 equivalent storm by jtwc with peak winds of 215 km h 130 mph this would have made system first recorded storm of that intensity on record in arabian sea however in post storm analysis it was discovered that 1 minute winds did not exceed 205 km h 125 mph next storm to reach this intensity was cyclone gonu in 2007 north indian ocean cyclone season which became first known super cyclonic storm in region upon attaining its peak intensity storm attained a barometric pressure of 932 mbar hpa lowest in region at time cyclone was ranked as strongest in arabian sea for six years until it was surpassed by gonu in 2007 which attained a minimum pressure of 920 mbar hpa in 2010 cyclone phet surpassed 2001 cyclone as second strongest storm in region attaining winds of 240 km h 145 mph according to jtwc see also 2001 north
