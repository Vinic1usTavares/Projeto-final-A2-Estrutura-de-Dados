doom a first person shooter game by id software was released in december 1993 and is considered one of most significant and influential titles in video game history development began in november 1992 with programmers john carmack and john romero artists adrian carmack and kevin cloud and designer tom hall late in development hall was replaced by sandy petersen and programmer dave taylor joined music and sound effects were created by bobby prince doom concept was proposed in late 1992 after release of wolfenstein 3d and its sequel spear of destiny john carmack was working on an improved 3d game engine from those games and team wanted to have their next game take advantage of his designs several ideas were proposed including a new game in their commander keen series but john proposed a game about using technology to fight demons inspired by dungeons dragons campaigns team played initial months of development were spent building prototypes while hall created doom bible a design document for his vision of game and its story after id released a grandiose press release touting features that team had not yet begun working on doom bible was rejected in favor of a plotless game with no design document at all over next six months hall designed levels based on real military bases romero built features and artists adrian and cloud created textures and demons based on clay models they built hall s level designs however were deemed uninteresting and romero began designing his own levels hall increasingly frustrated with his limited influence was fired in july he was replaced by petersen in september and team worked increasingly long hours until game was completed in december 1993 doom was self published by id on december 10 1993 and immediately downloaded by thousands of players design thumb john carmack in 2006 alt black and white photo of head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses concept in may 1992 id software released wolfenstein 3d later called grandfather of 3d shooters specifically first person shooters because it established fast paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in genre and greatly increased genre s popularity immediately following its release most of team began work on a set of new wolfenstein episodes spear of destiny as episodes used same game engine as original game id co founder and lead programmer john carmack instead focused on technology research for company s next game just as he had experimented with creating a 3d game engine prior to development of wolfenstein 3d between may and spear of release in september 1992 he created several experimental engines including one for a racing game before working on an enhanced version of wolfenstein engine to be licensed to raven software for their game shadowcaster for this engine he developed several enhancements to wolfenstein engine including sloped floors textures on floors and ceilings in addition to walls and fading visibility over a distance resulting engine was much slower than wolfenstein one but was deemed acceptable for an adventure game like shadowcaster following release of spear of destiny and completion of shadowcaster engine id software discussed what their next title would be they wanted to create another 3d game using carmack s new engine as a starting point but were largely tired of wolfenstein lead designer tom hall was especially weary of it and pushed for team to make another game in commander keen series team had created seven episodes in series in 1990 91 as their first games but planned third set of episodes had been dropped in favor of wolfenstein 3d while carmack was initially interested in idea rest of team was not they collectively felt that platforming gameplay of series was a poor fit for carmack s fast paced 3d engines and especially after success of wolfenstein were interested in pursuing more games of that type additionally other two co founders of id were not interested in creating another keen game john romero designer of wolfenstein was not interested in doing another cutesy game and lead artist adrian carmack preferred to create art in a darker style than keen games john carmack soon lost interest in keen idea as well instead coming up with his own concept a game about using technology to fight demons inspired by dungeons dragons campaigns team played combining styles of evil dead ii and aliens concept originally had a working title of green and pissed which was also name of a concept hall had proposed prior to wolfenstein but carmack soon named proposed game after a line in film color of money what s in case in here doom team agreed to pursue doom concept and development began in november 1992 initial development team was composed of five people programmers john carmack and john romero artists adrian carmack and kevin cloud and designer tom hall they moved offices to a dark office building which they named suite 666 and drew inspiration from noises coming from dentist s office next door they also cut ties with apogee software who had given them initial advance money for creating their first game commander keen in invasion of vorticons and through which they had published shareware versions of their games to date while they had a good personal relationship with owner scott miller they felt that they were outgrowing publisher cloud who was involved in id s business dealings pushed for id to take over shareware publishing duties themselves after investigating and finding that apogee was unable to reliably handle volume of customers buying id s games through apogee he convinced others that increased sales revenue would make up for problems of handling their own publishing two companies parted amicably and doom was set to be self published development thumb upright right john romero in 2012 alt face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses early in development rifts in team began to appear hall who despite having wanted to develop a different game remained lead designer and creative director for company did not want doom to have same lack of plot as wolfenstein 3d at end of november he delivered a design document which he named doom bible that described plot backstory and design goals for project his design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on moon open a portal from which aliens emerge over a series of levels player discovers that aliens are demons hell also steadily infects level design as atmosphere becomes darker and more terrifying while romero initially liked idea john carmack not only disliked it but dismissed idea of having a story at all story in a game is like story in a porn movie it s expected to be there but it s not that important rather than a deep story john carmack wanted to focus on technological innovations dropping levels and episodes of wolfenstein in favor of a fast continuous world tom disliked idea but romero sided with carmack although john carmack was lead programmer rather than a designer he was becoming seen in company as most important source of ideas company considered taking out key person insurance on carmack but no one else hall spent next few weeks reworking doom bible to work with carmack s technological ideas while rest of team planned how they could implement them his adjusted vision for plot had player character assigned to a large military base on an alien planet tei tenga at start of game as first of four player character soldiers named buddy played cards with others scientists on base accidentally open a portal to hell through which demons poured through killing other soldiers he envisioned a six episode structure with a storyline involving traveling to hell and back through gates which demons used and destruction of planet for which players would be sent to jail buddy was named after hall s character in a dungeons dragons campaign run by john carmack that had featured a demonic invasion hall was forced to rework doom bible again in december however after john carmack and rest of team had decided that they were unable to create a single seamless world with hardware limitations of time which contradicted much of new document at start of 1993 id put out a press release by hall touting buddy s story about fighting off demons while knee deep in dead trying to eliminate demons and find out what caused them to appear press release proclaimed new game features that john carmack had created as well as other features including multiplayer gaming features that had not yet been started on by team or even designed company told computer gaming world that doom would be wolfenstein times a million early versions were built to match doom bible a pre alpha version of first level included other characters at a table and movable rolling chairs based on ones at id office initial versions also retained arcade elements present in wolfenstein 3d like score points and score items but those were removed early in development as they felt unrealistic and not in keeping with tone other elements such as a complex user interface an inventory system a secondary shield protection and lives were modified and slowly removed over course of development thumb right sandy petersen in 2004 upright soon however doom bible as a whole was rejected romero wanted a game even more brutal and fast than wolfenstein which did not leave room for character driven plot hall had created additionally team did not feel that they needed a design document at all as they had not created one for prior games doom bible was discarded altogether several ideas were retained including starting off in a military base as well as some locations items and monsters but story was dropped and most of design was removed as team felt it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay some elements such as weapons a hub system of maps and monorails later appeared in later doom or id games work continued and a demo was shown to computer gaming world in early 1993 who raved about it john carmack and romero however disliked hall s military base inspired level design romero especially felt that while john carmack had originally asked for realistic levels as they would make engine run quickly that hall s level designs were uninspiring he felt that boxy flat levels were too similar to design and did not show off everything engine could do he began to create his own more abstract levels beginning with a curving staircase into a large open area in what became second level of final game which rest of team felt was much better hall was upset with reception to his designs and how little impact he was having as lead designer romero has since claimed that hall was also still uninterested in doom concept at all hall was also upset with how much he was having to fight with john carmack in order to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements such as flying enemies he began to spend less time working in office and in response john carmack proposed that he be fired from id romero initially resisted as it would mean that hall would not receive any proceeds but in july he and other founders of id fired hall who went to work for apogee hall was replaced in september ten weeks before doom was released by game designer sandy petersen despite misgivings over his relatively high age of 37 compared to other early 20s employees and his religious background team also added a third programmer dave taylor petersen and romero designed rest of levels for doom with different aims team felt that petersen s designs were more technically interesting and varied while romero s were more aesthetically interesting romero s level design process was to build a level or part of a level starting at beginning then play through it and iterate on design so that by time he was satisfied with flow and playability of level he had played it a thousand times first level made by romero was last created intended to show off new elements of engine ending screen of each level like in wolfenstein 3d displays a par time for level as set by romero in late 1993 after multiplayer component was coded development team began playing four player multiplayer games matches which romero termed deathmatch he proposed adding a cooperative multiplayer mode as well according to romero deathmatch mode was inspired by fighting games team frequently played street fighter ii fatal fury and art of fighting during breaks while developing elaborate rules involving trash talk and smashing furniture or equipment romero later stated that you could say that japanese fighting games fueled creative impulse to create deathmatch in our shooters programming thumb a computer doom was programmed largely in ansi c language with a few elements in assembly language on next computers running nextstep operating system data including level designs and graphics files is stored in wad files short for where s all data this allows for any part of design to be changed without needing to adjust engine code carmack had been impressed by modifications made by fans of wolfenstein 3d and wanted to support that with an easily swappable file structure and released map editor online romero and carmack spent early stage of development focusing on engine features instead of game concept had required levels to be a flat plane with walls at same height and at right angles while doom world was still a variation on a flat plane in that two traversable areas could not be on top of each other it could have walls and floors at any angle or height allowing greater level design variety fading visibility in shadowcaster was improved by adjusting color palette by distance darkening far surfaces and creating a grimmer more realistic appearance this concept was also used for lighting system rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using ray tracing engine calculates light level of a section of a level which can be as small as a single stair step based on its distance from light sources it then darkens color palette of that section s surface textures accordingly romero used map editing tool he developed to build grandiose areas with these new possibilities and came up with new ways to use carmack s lighting engine such as strobe lights he also programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms in first half of 1993 carmack worked on improving graphics engine after romero s level designs started to cause engine problems he researched and began to use binary space partitioning to quickly select portion of a level that player could see at any given time in march 1993 team stopped work on doom to spend three weeks building a super nintendo entertainment system port of wolfenstein 3d after contractor hired for port had made no progress taylor along with programming other features added cheat codes some such as were based on ideas their fans had come up with while eagerly awaiting game by late 1993 doom was nearing completion and player anticipation was high spurred on by a leaked press demo john carmack began to work on multiplayer component within two weeks he had two computers playing same game over internal office network soon office was playing four player deathmatch games graphics and sound thumb right model of spider mastermind adrian carmack was lead artist for doom with kevin cloud as an additional artist additionally don ivan punchatz was hired to create package art and logo and his son gregor punchatz created some of monsters doom was style of game that adrian carmack had wanted to create since id was founded one with a dark style and demons he and cloud designed monsters to be nightmarish and developed a new technique for animating them intent was to have graphics that were realistic and dark as opposed to staged or rendered so a mixed media approach was taken to artwork unlike wolfenstein where carmack had drawn every frame of animation for nazi enemy sprites for doom artists sculpted models of some of enemies out of clay and took pictures of them in stop motion from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in game images were then digitized and converted to 2d characters with a program written by john carmack adrian carmack made clay models for player character cyberdemon and baron of hell before deciding that problems of keeping clay consistent under lighting while moving models through animations was too great later he had practical effects specialist gregor punchatz build latex and metal sculptures of arch vile mancubus spider mastermind and revenant demons punchatz got materials from hardware and hobby stores and used what he called rubber band and chewing gum effects weapons were toys with parts combined from different toys to make more guns they scanned themselves as well using cloud s arm as model for player character s arm holding a gun and adrian s snakeskin boots and wounded knee for in game textures romero was body model used for cover while trying to work with a male model to get a reference photograph for don ivan punchatz to work from romero became frustrated while trying to convey to him how to pose as if marine was going to be attacked by an infinite amount of demons romero posed shirtless as a demonstration of look he was trying for and that photograph was one used by punchatz electronic arts s deluxe paint ii was used in creation of sprites like they had for wolfenstein 3d id hired bobby prince to create music and sound effects romero directed prince to make music in techno and metal styles many of songs were directly inspired by songs from popular metal bands such as alice in chains and pantera prince felt that more ambient music would work better especially given hardware limitations of time on what sounds he could produce and produced numerous tracks in both styles in hopes of convincing romero romero however still liked metal tracks and added both styles prince did not make music for specific levels most of music was composed before levels they were eventually assigned to were completed instead romero assigned each track to each level late in development unlike music sound effects for enemies and weapons were created by prince for specific purposes prince designed them based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon and then adjusted sound effects to match completed animations sound effects for monsters were created from animal noises and prince designed all sound effects to be distinct on limited sound hardware of time even when many sound effects were playing at once release because id planned to self publish doom as it neared completion they had to set up systems to sell it jay wilbur who had been brought on as ceo and sole member of business team planned marketing and distribution of doom he felt that mainstream press was uninterested and as id would make most money off of copies they sold directly to customers up to 85 percent of planned us 40 price he decided to leverage shareware market as much as possible buying only a single ad in any gaming magazine instead he reached out directly to software retailers offering them copies of first doom episode for free allowing them to charge any price for it in order to spur customer interest in buying full game directly from id dooms original release date was third quarter of 1993 which team did not meet by december 1993 team was working non stop with several employees sleeping at office programmer dave taylor claimed that work gave him such a rush that he would pass out from intensity id began receiving calls from people interested in game or angry that it had missed its planned release date as hype for game had been building online at midnight on friday december 10 1993 after working for 30 straight hours team uploaded first episode to internet letting interested players distribute it for them so many users were connected to first network that they planned to upload game to university of wisconsin parkside ftp network that even after network administrator increased number of connections while on phone with wilbur id was unable to connect forcing them to kick all other users off to allow id to upload game when upload finished thirty minutes later 10 000 people attempted to download it at once crashing university s network within hours other university networks were banning doom multiplayer games as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems development release versions while doom was in development five pre release versions were given names or numbers and shown to testers or press 0 2 alpha february 4 1993 an early version
