fourth provides an account of jesus s life and accompanying doctrines sadler maintained that teachings of book were essentially christian and entirely harmonious with known scientific facts although sadler had left adventist church by time urantia book was published its teachings are broadly consistent with some aspects of adventist theology such as soul sleep and annihilationism journalist brook wilensky lanford argues in her 2011 profile of urantia movement that sadler s departure from adventist church gave him desire to build a new religious movement citing emphasis that sadler placed on discussion of garden of eden in urantia book as evidence of his desire to start anew sadler hoped that content of revelation would convince people of its worth and did not attempt to win supporters by emphasizing its author wilensky lanford argues that sadler attempted to avoid placing an individual at center of his beliefs owing to his disappointment in ellen white however gardner believes that sadler placed his faith in wilfred kellogg as he had in white until her death in 1939 sadler s wife lena was a regular forum participant one member subsequently objected to sadler s leadership alleging that he became hungry for power after his wife s death in early 1950s urantia foundation was established to publish urantia book hubert wilkins a friend of sadler who had a keen interest in book contributed initial funding for publication costs rather than create an organized religion foundation s leadership opted for what they called slow growth early adherents sought to educate people about book s teachings rather than found a church like organization sadler also disavowed proselytizing and publicity although he wrote several works about content of urantia book in 1958 sadler published a defense of book citing his experience exposing frauds and maintaining that book was free of contradictions since his death several reading groups seminars and churches have been established to study book and to spread its message authorship of urantia papers is disputed journalist brad gooch argues in his 2002 profile of urantia movement that sadler was author of urantia book citing similarities between some of its passages and contents of sadler s earlier writings gardner believes that sadler wrote part of papers but heavily edited and revised most of them he also contends that sadler refused to include some material provided to him for inclusion in book and that he plagiarized from other works ken a supporter of urantia foundation contends that statistical evidence of text and sadler s other works indicates that he did not write or extensively edit urantia book final years in 1952 sadler s final book courtship and love was published by macmillan publishers he wrote another title a doctor talks with his patient but after it was rejected by a publisher he decided to stop writing in march 1957 sadler was appointed as superintendent of

his accurate prediction of advent of organ transplantation decades before practice became commonplace members of urantia movement have also held high opinions of sadler sometimes idolizing him in her 2003 profile of urantia movement lewis states that descriptions of sadler by members of movement could suggest that he possessed charismatic authority and is revered as chosen gooch deems sadler moses of urantia movement and casts him as one of america s homegrown religious leaders an original along lines of joseph smith he also applauds sadler s writings about mediums describing sadler s book truth about spiritualism as one of strongest attacks ever written on fraudulent mediums and their methods gooch believes there is a contradiction between sadler s advocacy of science and reason and his support of avant garde theological inter planetary contents of urantia book gardner describes sadler s life story as riveting and summarizes him as an intelligent gifted person who proved to be gullible about alleged supernatural revelations he contends that sadler eventually developed megalomania that was unrecognized by those around him and argues that sadler succumbed to hubris and began to believe that he was a prophet divinely chosen as founder and leader of a new religion lewis disputes this characterization maintaining that sadler and those around him sought only to clarify and
