hurricane alice is only known atlantic hurricane to span two calendar years and one of only two named atlantic tropical cyclones along with tropical storm zeta of 2005 to do so twelfth tropical cyclone and eighth hurricane of 1954 atlantic hurricane season alice developed on december 30 1954 from a trough of low pressure in central atlantic ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status after passing through leeward islands on january 2 1955 alice reached peak winds of 90 mph 150 km h before encountering cold air and turning to southeast it dissipated on january 6 over southeastern caribbean sea alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path saba and anguilla were affected most with total damage amounting to 623 500 1955 usd there was an earlier hurricane named alice in season operationally lack of definitive data prevented u s weather bureau from declaring system a hurricane until january 2 it received name alice in early 1955 though re analysis of data supported extending its track to previous year resulting in two tropical cyclones of same name in one season meteorological history a cold front moved southeastward from east coast of united states on december 23 1954 and passed over bermuda two days later a strong anticyclone developed behind cold front and on december 26 a trough extended southward from cold front anticyclone moved southeastward as trough and cold front moved eastward trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered upper level flow to that of an easterly flow convection increased over trough as it moved over relatively warm waters about 1 degc above normal and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along northern portion of trough system continued to organize as it moved to west and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation it is estimated system developed into a tropical depression on december 30 while located 770 miles 1245 km east northeast of barbuda in lesser antilles though operationally system was believed to have become a tropical depression on december 31 with a narrow ridge of high pressure to its north depression moved west southwestward atmospheric conditions were unusually favorable for time of year due to ridge of high pressure preventing cold air from reaching central atlantic ocean this allowed depression to intensify into a tropical storm later on december 30 based on direct observations there were few direct observations for following days but it is estimated storm intensified into a hurricane on december 31 while located about 475 miles 770 km east northeast of barbuda on january 1 1955 a ship within 10 miles 16 km of center reported hurricane force winds and a pressure of 987 mbar based on this report and several other ship reports system was recognized as a tropical low by san juan weather bureau office hurricane continued to southwest and entered caribbean sea on january 2 after passing between saint martin and saint barthelemy a portion of eyewall moved over saint martin and saba based on near hurricane force winds from affected islands an information bulletin named system as hurricane alice while in northeastern caribbean sea throughout its track alice was a small tropical cyclone with a diameter of only around 60 miles 95 km reconnaissance aircraft flew into hurricane alice on january 3 and confirmed existence of tropical cyclone by reporting winds between 60 and 65 mph 95 to 105 km h and a warm core center it is estimated alice continued to intensify as it tracked southwestward in caribbean sea and attained peak winds of 80 mph 130 km h while located about 95 miles 150 km west northwest of montserrat while near its peak hurricane developed a ring of convection around its eye and alice maintained peak winds for about 24 hours until cold air from north weakened it extratropical cyclogenesis occurred north of bermuda on january 3 which weakened high pressure system to north of alice and turned flow in caribbean sea to that of cold northwesterly winds alice turned to southeast on january 4 and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter convection gradually became disorganized and after weakening to a tropical depression on january 5 alice dissipated on january 6 while located about 100 miles 160 km west northwest of grenada impact naming and records right thumb surface weather analysis of hurricane alice on january 3 1955 subsequent to confirmation of existence of hurricane alice u s weather bureau office in san juan puerto rico warned islands of northern lesser antilles to prepare for strong winds and rough seas hurricane alice produced moderate to strong winds across islands peaking at 81 mph 130 km h in saint barthelemy and 75 mph 120 km h in saba hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across several islands including a peak of 11 27 inches 286 mm in 48 hours recorded at saba due to its small size only a few islands received significant effects from hurricane saint barthelemy saba anguilla sint eustatius and saint kitts reported damage from hurricane totaling 623 500 1955 usd 4 7 million 2006 usd damage was heaviest on saba and anguilla occurring primarily to shipping facilities and crops 626 houses were destroyed or severely damaged on anguilla as well damage was caused mostly by heavy rainfall and rough seas not direct action of wind passage of hurricane alice greatly troubled economies of small affected islands additionally outer rainbands of storm alleviated dry conditions on puerto rico which had persisted since previous october no deaths were reported this storm formed on december 30 however in days before satellites meteorologists had to rely on reports from ships and islands in atlantic to locate and track storms this information was often sketchy two cyclones including a category 2 hurricane operationally went undetected in 1954 it was officially recognized as a significant tropical cyclone on january 2 1955 at time national weather service used same naming list each year so name given to this storm was alice and it was designated as a part of 1955 atlantic hurricane season however it was found during post storm analysis that storm had actually formed on december 30 and was instead a part of 1954 season therefore season had two storms named alice first storm of season and last had alice been discovered before end of calendar year it would have been named irene next name on 1954 list some reports named this storm alice2 to avoid confusion with earlier alice from june 1954 alice formed later in calendar year than any atlantic tropical cyclone on record forming six hours later in season than tropical storm zeta in 2005 alice was one of only eight atlantic tropical cyclones to form in month of december alice was first of two atlantic tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years other being 2005 s zeta hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist in month of january and strongest to do so see also 1955 atlantic
