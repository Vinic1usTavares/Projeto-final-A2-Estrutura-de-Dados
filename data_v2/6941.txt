was perhaps derived from malay word for cat kucing or from cochin an indian trading port on malabar coast and a generic term in china and british india for trading harbour some hindu artefacts can be seen today at sarawak state museum however another source reported that kuching city was previously known as sarawak before brooke arrived settlement was renamed to sarawak proper during kingdom

one unlikely theory based on a story on miscommunication according to story james brooke arrived in kuching on his yacht royalist he then asked his local guide about name of town local guide mistakenly thought that brooke was pointing towards a cat and so had said word kuching however ethnic malays in sarawak have always used term for cats cognate with filipino pusa instead of standard malay word kucing despite this etymological discrepancy sarawakians have adopted animal as a symbol of their city some source also stated that it was derived from a fruit called mata kucing euphoria mata kucing is similar to that of fruit a fruit that grows widely in malaysia and indonesia there was also a hill in city that was named after fruit which is called bukit mata kuching a british woman
