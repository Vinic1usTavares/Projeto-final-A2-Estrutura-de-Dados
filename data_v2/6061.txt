further elaborated albeit minor her beyonce s verse about falling for a guy from bk as in jay s brooklyn stomping grounds offers a rare moment of commentary on couple which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers song opens with t i rhyming lines and glorifying profound love between a thug and a as song progresses each member of destiny s child describes their own favorite type of man later harmonizing together for chorus midway through song lil wayne s verse contains a reference to rapper b g williams is last artist to sing her solo lines which were described as

vocal delivery further concluding that t i and wayne get comprehensively owned new york times writer kelefa sanneh described track as part of album s lovable material and went on saying it takes a ludicrous premise and turns it into sharp coldblooded electro pop andy battaglia writing for a v club felt that song and cater 2 u make sassy end runs around notions of womanly subservience but their best musical moments hide in tiny melismatic twirls instead of hooks guardian writer caroline sullivan described track as juddering while bbc s nick reynolds called it good fun in a review of song tom breihan an editor of pitchfork media wrote that soldier would have been a perfectly acceptable album track on writing s on wall 1999 but noted that its sound was different from songs played on mainstream pop radio praising trio for their vocal performances he continued soldier might not carry with it shock of new but it s still a nice little single women of destiny s child don t sound slightest bit convincing singing about how they need thug boyfriends but they wind their voices around a gorgeous hook exactly as well as they always have t i and lil wayne stop by not saying anything but sounding cool and tough and unflappable doing it it s pretty good but don t expect it to set your world on fire barbara ellen of observer said song was of exemplary standard of band s previous albums survivor 2001 and writing s on wall describing it as an overt bid for street cred entertainment weeklys tom sinclair felt that t i and lil wayne bring little to party with their contribution to
