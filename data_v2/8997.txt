indre wijdefjorden national park is located in a steep fjord landscape in northern spitsbergen in svalbard norway it covers inner part of wijdefjorden longest fjord on svalbard national park was established on 9 september 2005 and covers of which is on land and is sea marine environment changes vastly from mouth of fjord through a still cold water basin becoming deeper before reaching glacier mittag lefflerbreen at inner most sections of fjord on both sides of wijdefjorden there is high arctic steppe vegetation dominated by grasses and extremely dry basic earth there are some areas dominated by exposure of mineral earth area around fjord has a vegetation which is unique and not preserved in other areas of svalbard along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs it is most exclusive flora in svalbard there are several exclusive species in national park including puccinellia svalbardensis gentianella tenella and kobresia simpliciuscula of larger fjords on svalbard wijdefjorden is least affected by humans although a trapping station has been built at austfjordnes geography thumb left map of national park indre wijdefjorden national park covers of which is on land and is sea making it smallest national park in svalbard it is located in steep fjord landscape on both sides of inner indre parts of wijdefjorden wide fjord on spitsbergen at length wijdefjorden is longest fjord on svalbard it is located on northern coast of spitsbergen between andree land to west dickson land to south and ny friesland to east inner parts of wijdefjorden split into two with eastern long part known as austfjorden east fjord and shorter as vestfjorden west fjord at end of austfjorden is glacier mittag lefflerbreen inner parts of fjord receive some of lowest precipitation of archipelago combined with exposed basic earth this results in europe s only high arctic steppe only other area with this landscape is north of canadian arctic archipelago rock bed on each side of fjord is different on west side there are devonian deposits while there is bedrock on east side resulting in different vegetation on each side aasheim 2008 129 fjord has a unique shape it has a wide mouth thus name but at there is a shallow section which is deep this reduces circulation in inner parts of fjord which have a cold water basin deep aasheim 2008 130 average july temperatures range from and in january temperatures are normally between arctic climate results in permafrost which can be up to deep aasheim 2008 19 north atlantic current moderates svalbard s temperatures particularly during winter giving it up to higher winter temperature than similar latitudes in continental russia and canada keeping surrounding waters open and navigable most of year shelter of mountains gives inland fjord areas less temperature difference than coast torkilsen 1984 98 99 history area around wijdefjorden was first used by russian and later norwegian trappers cabin at was erected in 1910 and two years later cabin at was built trappers considered area to have few polar bears but much fox they could also supplement catch with common eider in 1928 a season of trapping gave about 50 arctic foxes in 1932 area s special vegetation was protected which was assimilated into national park when it was created since 1980s trapping has again been taken up and governor of svalbard has one cabin at austfjordnes that can be rented for a season of trapping of larger fjords on svalbard wijdefjorden is least affected by humans during considerations prior to establishment of national park there was a conflict with mining industry svalbard minerals had found baryte within national park borders and arktikugol holds two mining claim areas just south of national park national park was established on 9 september 2005 it completed a several year long plan to increase amount of protected areas of svalbard from 55 to 65 which had two years earlier resulted in nordenskiold land national park sassen bunsow land national park and nordre isfjorden national park management establishment of national park and protection is based on svalbard environmental protection act which takes its mandate from requirements in svalbard treaty to protect environment of archipelago aasheim 2008 47 overall responsibility for protection lies with norwegian ministry of environment which has delegated management to norwegian directorate for nature management and governor of svalbard latter performs all day to day practical management including registration and inspection in aspects related to cultural heritage governor reports to norwegian directorate for cultural heritage and in issues relating to pollution to norwegian pollution control authority while it has no authority norwegian polar institute performs monitoring mapping and research traditionally mining industry in svalbard has had more rights to operations within protected areas than in mainland norway where all such activities would be completely banned indre wijdefjorden has most strict regulations with a total ban on construction of buildings and facilities laying of cables and roads earthwork drainage drilling blasting and excavation of petroleum gas and minerals aasheim 2008 53 it is authorities goal that svalbard is to be one of best managed wilderness areas in world aasheim 2008 57 svalbard and thus national park is on norway s tentative list for nomination as a unesco world heritage site nature vegetation on both sides of fjord is high arctic steppe which is characterized by grasses it is caused by extremely low precipitation basic earth with salt deposits in surface and large areas of exposed mineral earth area around fjord has a unique vegetation which has not preserved in other areas of svalbard along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs it is most exclusive flora in svalbard there are several unique species in national park including which is featured in national park s logo and for which svalbard is only known location in europe puccinellia svalbardensis gentianella tenella and kobresia simpliciuscula there is breeding ground for pink footed goose within park although svalbard ptarmigan can also be found aasheim 2008 40 animals that can be found in park include polar bear svalbard reindeer and arctic fox both fauna and flora are affected by cold temperatures and extreme light conditions activity is at a stand still during polar night which lasts for many months during summer months of midnight sun help accelerate natural processes aasheim 2008 27 nature in area is especially susceptible to global warming models show that winter temperatures will increase more than summer temperatures resulting in more precipitation because vegetation requires little rain and much wind this may result in major changes recreation entrance to national park is available by boat in wijdefjorden from north or over land from and from south during winter area is accessible from longyearbyen either by snowmobile or by ski there are several older trapper cabins in park and some of these are lent to residents of longyearbyen aasheim 2008 131 except for a lake with arctic char there are few destinations within park although park can be used as a basis for other destinations this includes trips to perriertoppen svalbard s second highest peak and glacier because of shape of park there is little good hiking within park except for walking along beaches on either side of fjord it is possible to see entire national park from mittag lefflerbreen which can be hiked to from pyramiden aasheim 2008 132 freedom to roam is strong in norwegian culture and law and also applies to svalbard however there more restrictions on archipelago aasheim 2008 75 freedom includes right to tent but this must be done at least from any cultural monuments as far as possible tenting must occur on vegetation free land tenting for more than one week at a site requires a permit from governor beaches have large amounts of driftwood from siberia which can be used for campfires with same location restrictions as tenting aasheim 2008 81 as in all norwegian national parks motorized land transport is banned however on svalbard this does not include snowmobiles on other hand cycling is banned aasheim 2008 82 governor can however enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within national park use of helicopters and aircraft for sight seeing are also prohibited aasheim 2008 83 polar bears are protected but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self defense as a last resort should they attack aasheim 2008 77 most flora and fauna are protected right to gather established with freedom to roam does not apply in national parks although there are some exceptions hunting is permitted after explicit permit from governor and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists aasheim 2008 83 fishing is not permitted although dispensations can be given aasheim 2008 84 all tourists traveling to svalbard must pay a tourist tax of 150 norwegian krone which is entirely used for conservation tax is included in all ship and air tickets to archipelago which residents can get refunded aasheim 2008 56 everyone roaming outside of settlements must report to governor aasheim 2008 80 this includes requirement to sign a special insurance policy to cover any search and rescue costs governor would incur should it be necessary aasheim 2008 81 references bibliography category national parks of svalbard category protected
