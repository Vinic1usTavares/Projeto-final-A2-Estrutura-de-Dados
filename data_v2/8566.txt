attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd is a mental disorder of neurodevelopmental type it is characterized by difficulty paying attention excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences which are otherwise not appropriate for a person s age individuals with adhd can also display problems with regulating emotions symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old are present for more than six months and cause problems in at least two settings such as school home or recreational activities in children problems paying attention may result in poor school performance additionally there is an association with other mental disorders and substance misuse although it causes impairment particularly in modern society many people with adhd can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding known as despite being most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents exact cause is unknown in majority of cases genetic factors are estimated to make up about 75 of risk nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk it does not appear to be related to style of parenting or discipline it affects about 5 7 of children when diagnosed via dsm iv criteria and 1 2 when diagnosed via icd 10 criteria as of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51 1 million people globally rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed adhd is diagnosed approximately two times more often in boys than in girls although disorder is often overlooked in girls because their symptoms differ from those of boys about 30 50 of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2 5 of adults have condition in adults inner restlessness rather than hyperactivity may occur they often develop coping skills which make up for some or all of their impairments condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions as well as to distinguish from high levels of activity that are still within range of normative behaviors adhd management recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of counseling lifestyle changes and medications british guideline only recommends medications as a first line treatment in children who have severe symptoms and for medication to be considered in those with moderate symptoms who either refuse or fail to improve with counseling though for adults medications are a first line treatment canadian and american guidelines recommend behavioral management first line in preschool aged children while medications and behavioral therapy together is recommended after that treatment with stimulants is effective for at least 14 months however their long term effectiveness is unclear and there are potentially serious side effects medical literature has described symptoms similar to those of adhd since 18th century adhd its diagnosis and its treatment have been considered controversial since 1970s controversies have involved clinicians teachers policymakers parents and media topics include adhd s causes and use of stimulant medications in its treatment most healthcare providers accept adhd as a genuine disorder in children and adults and debate in scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated condition was officially known as attention deficit disorder add from 1980 to 1987 while before this it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood signs and symptoms adhd impulsivity difficulty paying close attention to details has trouble holding attention on tasks has trouble organizing tasks and activities loses things necessary for tasks appears forgetful in daily activities has a shorter attention span and is easily distracted difficulty with structured schoolwork difficulty completing tasks that are tedious or time consuming unable to sit still fidgets in seat leaves seat in inappropriate situations takes risks with little thought for dangers on go or driven by a motor talking more than others often answers quickly has trouble waiting their turn interrupts or intrudes on conversations inattention hyperactivity restlessness in adults disruptive behavior and impulsivity are common in adhd academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships symptoms can be difficult to define as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin according to fifth edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm v symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of same age and they must cause significant problems functioning in at least two settings e g social school work or home criteria must have been met prior to age twelve in order to receive a diagnosis of adhd this requires more than 5 symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity impulsivity for those under 17 and more than 4 for those over 16 years old subtypes adhd is divided into three subtypes predominantly inattentive adhd pi or adhd i predominantly hyperactive impulsive adhd ph or adhd hi and combined type adhd c a person with adhd inattentive type has most or all of following symptoms excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition be easily distracted miss details forget things and frequently switch from one activity to another have difficulty maintaining focus on one task become bored with a task after only a few minutes unless doing something they find enjoyable have difficulty focusing attention on organizing or completing a task have trouble completing or turning in homework assignments often losing things e g pencils toys assignments needed to complete tasks or activities appear not to be listening when spoken to daydream become easily confused and move slowly have difficulty processing information as quickly and accurately as others struggle to follow instructions have trouble understanding details overlooks details a person with adhd hyperactive impulsive type has most or all of following symptoms excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition fidget or squirm a great deal talk nonstop dash around touching or playing with anything and everything in sight have trouble sitting still during dinner school and while doing homework be constantly in motion have difficulty performing quiet tasks or activities be impatient blurt out inappropriate comments show their emotions without restraint and act without regard for consequences have difficulty waiting for things they want or waiting their turn in games often interrupt conversations or others activities girls with adhd tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms pertaining to inattention and symptoms of hyperactivity tend to go away with age and turn into inner restlessness in teens and adults with adhd people with adhd of all ages are more likely to have problems with social skills such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships this is true for all subtypes about half of children and adolescents with adhd experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10 15 of non adhd children and adolescents people with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction they also may drift off during conversations miss social cues and have trouble learning social skills difficulties managing anger are more common in children with adhd as are poor handwriting and delays in speech language and motor development although it causes significant difficulty many children with adhd have an attention span equal to or better than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interesting associated disorders in children adhd occurs with other disorders about two thirds of time some commonly associated conditions include epilepsy tourette s syndrome autism spectrum disorder asd this disorder affects social skills ability to communicate behaviour and interests anxiety disorders have been found to occur more commonly in adhd population intermittent explosive disorder learning disabilities have been found to occur in about 20 30 of children with adhd learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders and academic skills disorders adhd however is not considered a learning disability but it very frequently causes academic difficulties obsessive compulsive disorder ocd can co occur with adhd and shares many of its characteristics intellectual disabilities reactive attachment disorder substance use disorders adolescents and adults with adhd are at increased risk of substance abuse this is most commonly seen with alcohol or cannabis reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in brains of adhd individuals this makes evaluation and treatment of adhd more difficult with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their greater risks sleep disorders and adhd commonly co exist they can also occur as a side effect of medications used to treat adhd in children with adhd insomnia is most common sleep disorder with behavioral therapy preferred treatment problems with sleep initiation are common among individuals with adhd but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in morning melatonin is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia oppositional defiant disorder odd and conduct disorder cd which occur with adhd in about 50 and 20 of cases respectively they are characterized by antisocial behaviors such as stubbornness aggression frequent temper tantrums deceitfulness lying and stealing about half of those with hyperactivity and odd or cd develop antisocial personality disorder in adulthood brain imaging supports that conduct disorder and adhd are separate conditions primary disorder of vigilance which is characterized by poor attention and concentration as well as difficulties staying awake these children tend to fidget yawn and stretch and appear to be hyperactive in order to remain alert and active sluggish cognitive tempo sct is a cluster of symptoms that potentially comprises another attention disorder it may occur in 30 50 of adhd cases regardless of subtype stereotypic movement disorder mood disorders especially bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder boys diagnosed with combined adhd subtype are more likely to have a mood disorder adults with adhd sometimes also have bipolar disorder which requires careful assessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditions restless legs syndrome has been found to be more common in those with adhd and is often due to iron deficiency anemia however restless legs can simply be a part of adhd and requires careful assessment to differentiate between two disorders people with adhd have an increased risk of persistent bed wetting a 2016 systematic review found a well established association between adhd and obesity asthma and sleep disorders and tentative evidence for association with celiac disease and migraine while another 2016 systematic review did not support a clear link between celiac disease and adhd and stated that routine screening for celiac disease in people with adhd is discouraged intelligence overall studies have shown that people with adhd tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient iq tests significance of this is controversial due to differences between people with adhd and difficulty determining influence of symptoms such as distractibility on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity in studies of adhd higher iqs may be over represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower iqs despite those with adhd scoring on average nine points lower on standardized intelligence measures studies of adults suggest that differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problems causes most adhd cases are of unknown causes it is believed to involve interactions between genetics environment and social factors certain cases are related to previous infection or trauma to brain genetics twin studies indicate that disorder is often inherited from one s parents with genetics determining about 74 of cases siblings of children with adhd are three to four times more likely to develop disorder than siblings of children without disorder genetic factors are also believed to be involved in determining whether adhd persists into adulthood typically a number of genes are involved many of which directly affect dopamine neurotransmission those involved with dopamine include dat drd4 and dbh other genes associated with adhd include and bdnf a common variant of a gene called 3 is estimated to be responsible for about 9 of cases and when this variant is present people are particularly responsive to stimulant medication 7 repeat variant of dopamine receptor d4 drd4 7r causes increased inhibitory effects induced by dopamine and is associated with adhd drd4 receptor is a g protein coupled receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase drd4 7r mutation results in a wide range of behavioral phenotypes including adhd symptoms reflecting split attention evolution may have played a role in high rates of adhd particularly hyperactive and impulsive traits in males some have hypothesized that some women may be more attracted to males who are risk takers increasing frequency of genes that predispose to hyperactivity and impulsivity in gene pool others have claimed that these traits may be an adaptation that help males face stressful or dangerous environments with for example increased impulsivity and exploratory behavior in certain situations adhd traits may have been beneficial to society as a whole even while being harmful to individual high rates and heterogeneity of adhd may have increased reproductive fitness and benefited society by adding diversity to gene pool despite being detrimental to individual in certain environments some adhd traits may have offered personal advantages to individuals such as quicker response to predators or superior hunting skills people with down syndrome are more likely to have adhd drd4 gene is both linked to novelty seeking and adhd in people of kenya 7r allele of this gene results in better health in those who are nomadic but not those who are living in one spot environment in addition to genetics some environmental factors might play a role in causing adhd alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which can include adhd or symptoms like it children exposed to certain toxic substances such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls may develop problems which resemble adhd exposure to organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and phosphate is associated with an increased risk however evidence is not conclusive exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase risk of adhd extreme premature birth very low birth weight and extreme neglect abuse or social deprivation also increase risk as do certain infections during pregnancy at birth and in early childhood these infections include among others various viruses measles varicella zoster encephalitis rubella 71 there is an association between long term but not short term use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and adhd at least 30 of children with a traumatic brain injury later develop adhd and about 5 of cases are due to brain damage some studies suggest that in a small number of children artificial food dyes or preservatives may be associated with an increased prevalence of adhd or adhd like symptoms but evidence is weak and may only apply to children with food sensitivities united kingdom and european union have put in place regulatory measures based on these concerns in a minority of children or allergies to certain foods may worsen adhd symptoms research does not support popular beliefs that adhd is caused by eating too much refined sugar watching too much television parenting poverty or family chaos however they might worsen adhd symptoms in certain people society youngest children in a class have been found to be more likely to be diagnosed as having adhd possibly due to their being developmentally behind their older classmates this effect has been seen across a number of countries they also appear to use adhd medications at nearly twice rate as their peers in some cases diagnosis of adhd may reflect a dysfunctional family or a poor educational system rather than problems with individuals themselves in other cases it may be explained by increasing academic expectations with a diagnosis being a method for parents in some countries to get extra financial and educational support for their child typical behaviors of adhd occur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abuse social construct theory of adhd suggests that because boundaries between normal and abnormal behavior are socially constructed i e jointly created and validated by all members of society and in particular by physicians parents teachers and others it then follows that subjective valuations and judgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and thus number of people affected this could lead to situation where dsm iv arrives at levels of adhd three to four times higher than those obtained with icd 10 thomas szasz a supporter of this theory has argued that adhd was invented and then given a name pathophysiology current models of adhd suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of brain s neurotransmitter systems particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine dopamine and norepinephrine pathways that originate in ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus project to diverse regions of brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes dopamine pathways and norepinephrine pathways which project to prefrontal cortex and striatum are directly responsible for modulating executive function cognitive control of behavior motivation reward perception and motor function these pathways are known to play a central role in pathophysiology of adhd larger models of adhd with additional pathways have been proposed brain structure thumb upright 1 3 left prefrontal cortex is often affected in adhd in children with adhd there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures with a proportionally greater decrease in volume in left sided prefrontal cortex posterior parietal cortex also shows thinning in adhd individuals compared to controls other brain structures in prefrontal striatal cerebellar and prefrontal striatal thalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without adhd subcortical volumes of accumbens amygdala caudate hippocampus and putamen appears smaller in individuals with adhd compared with controls inter hemispheric asymmetries in white matter tracts have also been noted in adhd youths suggesting that disruptions in temporal integration may be related to behavioral characteristics of adhd neurotransmitter pathways previously it was thought that elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with adhd was part of pathophysiology but it appears that elevated numbers are due to adaptation to exposure to stimulants current models involve dopamine pathway and locus coeruleus system adhd possess treatment efficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems note da dopamine lc locus coeruleus vta ventral tegmental area serotonin 5 hydroxytryptamine there may additionally be abnormalities in glutamatergic or cholinergic pathways executive function and motivation symptoms of adhd arise from a deficiency in certain executive functions e g attentional control inhibitory control and working memory executive functions are a set of cognitive processes that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviors that facilitate attainment of one s chosen goals executive function impairments that occur in adhd individuals result in problems with staying organized time keeping excessive procrastination maintaining concentration paying attention ignoring distractions regulating emotions and remembering details people with adhd appear to have unimpaired long term memory and deficits in long term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory criteria for an executive function deficit are met in 30 50 of children and adolescents with adhd one study found that 80 of individuals with adhd were impaired in at least one executive function task compared to 50 for individuals without adhd due to rates of brain maturation and increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older adhd impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood adhd has also been associated with motivational deficits in children children with adhd often find it difficult to focus on long term over short term rewards and exhibit impulsive behavior for short term rewards diagnosis adhd is diagnosed by an assessment of a child s behavioral and mental development including ruling out effects of drugs medications and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for symptoms it often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns it may be viewed as extreme end of one or more continuous human traits found in all people whether someone responds to medications does not confirm or rule out diagnosis as imaging studies of brain do not give consistent results between individuals they are only used for research purposes and not diagnosis in north america dsm 5 criteria are used for diagnosis while european countries usually use icd 10 with dsm iv criteria a diagnosis of adhd is more likely than with icd 10 criteria it is classified as neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder additionally it is classified as a disruptive behavior disorder along with oppositional defiant disorder conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder a diagnosis does not imply a neurological disorder associated conditions that should be screened for include anxiety depression oppositional defiant disorder conduct disorder and learning and language disorders other conditions that should be considered are other neurodevelopmental disorders tics and sleep apnea diagnosis of adhd using quantitative electroencephalography qeeg is an ongoing area of investigation although value of qeeg in adhd is currently unclear in united states food and drug administration has approved use of qeeg to evaluate adhd approved test uses ratio of eeg theta to beta activity to guide diagnosis however at least five studies have failed to replicate finding self rating scales such as adhd rating scale and vanderbilt adhd diagnostic rating scale are used in screening and evaluation of adhd diagnostic and statistical manual as with many other psychiatric disorders formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria in united states these criteria are defined by american psychiatric association in dsm based on dsm criteria there are three sub types of adhd adhd predominantly inattentive type adhd pi presents with symptoms including being easily distracted forgetful daydreaming disorganization poor concentration and difficulty completing tasks adhd predominantly hyperactive impulsive type presents with excessive and restlessness hyperactivity difficulty waiting and remaining seated immature behavior destructive behaviors may also be present adhd combined type is a combination of first two subtypes this subdivision is based on presence of at least six out of nine long term lasting at least six months symptoms of inattention hyperactivity impulsivity or both to be considered symptoms must have appeared by age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment e g at home and at school or work symptoms must be inappropriate for a child of that age and there must be clear evidence that they are causing social school or work related problems international classification of diseases in tenth revision of international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd 10 by world health organization symptoms of hyperkinetic disorder are analogous to adhd in dsm 5 when a conduct disorder as defined by icd 10 is present condition is referred to as hyperkinetic conduct disorder otherwise disorder is classified as disturbance of activity and attention other hyperkinetic disorders or hyperkinetic disorders unspecified latter is sometimes referred to as hyperkinetic syndrome in implementation version of icd 11 disorder is classified under attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and hyperkinetic disorder no longer exists adults adults with adhd are diagnosed under same criteria including that their signs must have been present by age of six to twelve questioning parents or guardians as to how person behaved and developed as a child may form part of assessment a family history of adhd also adds weight to a diagnosis while core symptoms of adhd are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults it is estimated that between 2 5 of adults have adhd around 25 50 of children with adhd continue to experience adhd symptoms into adulthood while rest experiences fewer or no symptoms currently most adults remain untreated many adults with adhd without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganized life and some use non prescribed drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism other problems may include relationship and job difficulties and an increased risk of criminal activities associated mental health problems include depression anxiety disorder and learning disabilities some adhd symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children while children with adhd may climb and run about excessively adults may experience an inability to relax or they talk excessively in social situations adults with adhd may start relationships impulsively display sensation seeking behavior and be short tempered addictive behavior such as substance abuse and gambling are common dsm v criteria do specifically deal with adults unlike those in dsm iv which were criticized for not being appropriate for adults those who presented differently may lead to claim that they outgrew diagnosis having adhd symptoms since childhood is usually required to be diagnosed with adult adhd however a proportion of adults who meet criteria for adhd would not have been diagnosed with adhd as children most cases of late onset adhd develop disorder between ages of 12 16 and can therefore be considered early adult or adolescent onset adhd differential diagnosis adhd symptoms which are related to other of hopelessness low self esteem or unhappiness loss of interest in hobbies or regular activities fatigue sleep problems difficulty maintaining attention change in appetite irritability or hostility low tolerance for stress thoughts of death unexplained feeling of anxiety irritability occasional feelings of panic or fear being inability to pay attention tire easily low tolerance for stress difficulty maintaining manic state excessive happiness hyperactivity racing thoughts aggression excessive talking grandiose delusions decreased need for sleep inappropriate social behavior difficulty maintaining attention in depressive state same symptoms as in depression section symptoms of adhd such as low mood and poor self image mood swings and irritability can be confused with dysthymia cyclothymia or bipolar disorder as well as with borderline personality disorder some symptoms that are due to anxiety disorders antisocial personality disorder developmental disabilities or mental retardation or effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap with some adhd these disorders can also sometimes occur along with adhd medical conditions which can cause adhd type symptoms include hyperthyroidism seizure disorder lead toxicity hearing deficits hepatic disease sleep apnea drug interactions untreated celiac disease and head injury primary sleep disorders may affect attention and behavior and symptoms of adhd may affect sleep it is thus recommended that children with adhd be regularly assessed for sleep problems sleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from classic ones of yawning and rubbing eyes to hyperactivity and inattentiveness obstructive sleep apnea can also cause adhd type symptoms rare tumors called and may cause similar symptoms to adhd biomarker research reviews of adhd biomarkers have noted that platelet monoamine oxidase expression urinary norepinephrine urinary and urinary phenethylamine levels consistently differ between adhd individuals and healthy control these measurements could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers for adhd but more research is needed to establish their diagnostic utility urinary and blood plasma phenethylamine concentrations are lower in adhd individuals relative to controls and two most commonly prescribed drugs for adhd amphetamine and methylphenidate increase phenethylamine biosynthesis in treatment responsive individuals with adhd lower urinary phenethylamine concentrations are also associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in adhd individuals electroencephalography eeg is not accurate enough to make diagnosis management management of adhd typically involves counseling or medications either alone or in combination while treatment may improve long term outcomes it does not get rid of negative outcomes entirely medications used include stimulants atomoxetine alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonists and sometimes antidepressants in those who have trouble focusing on long term rewards a large amount of positive reinforcement improves task performance adhd stimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with adhd behavioral therapies there is good evidence for use of behavioral therapies in adhd and they are recommended first line treatment in those who have mild symptoms or are preschool aged psychological therapies used include input behavior therapy cognitive behavioral therapy cbt interpersonal psychotherapy family therapy school based interventions social skills training behavioral peer intervention organization training parent management training and neurofeedback parent training may improve a number of behavioral problems including oppositional and behaviors it is unclear if neurofeedback is useful there is little high quality research on effectiveness of family therapy for adhd but evidence that exists shows that it is similar to community care and better than a placebo adhd specific support groups can provide information and may help families cope with adhd training in social skills behavioral modification and medication may have some limited beneficial effects most important factor in reducing later psychological problems such as major depression criminality school failure and substance use disorders is formation of friendships with people who are not involved in delinquent activities regular physical exercise particularly aerobic exercise is an effective add on treatment for adhd in children and adults particularly when combined with stimulant medication although best intensity and type of aerobic exercise for improving symptoms are not currently known in particular long term effects of regular aerobic exercise in adhd individuals include better behavior and motor abilities improved executive functions including attention inhibitory control and planning among other cognitive domains faster information processing speed and better memory parent teacher ratings of behavioral and socio emotional outcomes in response to regular aerobic exercise include better overall function reduced adhd symptoms better self esteem reduced levels of anxiety and depression fewer somatic complaints better academic and classroom behavior and improved social behavior exercising while on stimulant medication augments effect of stimulant medication on executive function it is believed that these short term effects of exercise are mediated by an increased abundance of synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine in brain medication stimulant medications are pharmaceutical treatment of choice they have at least some effect on symptoms in short term in about 80 of people methylphenidate appears to improve symptoms as reported by teachers and parents stimulants may also reduce risk of unintentional injuries in children with adhd there are a number of non stimulant medications such as atomoxetine and clonidine that may be used as alternatives or added to stimulant therapy there are no good studies comparing various medications however they appear more or less equal with respect to side effects stimulants appear to improve academic performance while atomoxetine does not atomoxetine due to its lack of addiction liability may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational or compulsive stimulant use there is little evidence on effects of medication on social behaviors long term effects of adhd medication have yet to be fully determined magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that long term treatment with amphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with adhd a 2018 review found greatest short term benefit with methylphenidate in children and amphetamines in adults guidelines on when to use medications vary by country united kingdom s national institute for health and care excellence nice recommending use for children only in severe cases though for adults medication is a first line treatment however most united states guidelines recommend medications in most age groups medications are not recommended for preschool children of stimulants can occur and result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness this is particularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on school aged children causing some practitioners to use weight based or benefit based off label dosing instead while stimulants and atomoxetine are usually safe there are side effects and contraindications to their use there is low quality evidence of an association between methylphenidate and both serious and non serious harmful side effects when taken by children and adolescents careful monitoring of children while taking this medication is recommended a large overdose on adhd stimulants is commonly associated with symptoms such as stimulant psychosis and mania although very rare at therapeutic doses these events appear to occur in approximately 0 1 of individuals within first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy administration of an antipsychotic medication has been found to effectively resolve symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis regular monitoring has been recommended in those on long term treatment stimulant therapy should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication decrease possible growth delay and reduce tolerance long term misuse of stimulant medications at doses above therapeutic range for adhd treatment is associated with addiction and dependence untreated adhd however is also associated with elevated risk of substance use disorders and conduct disorders use of stimulants appears to either reduce this risk or have no effect on it safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear antipsychotics may also be used to treat aggression in adhd diet dietary modifications are not recommended as of 2019 by american academy of pediatrics due to insufficient evidence though some evidence supports benefit in a small proportion of children with adhd a 2013 meta analysis found less than a third of children with adhd see some improvement in symptoms with free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food coloring these benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are simultaneously being treated with adhd medications this review also found that evidence does not support removing other foods from diet to treat adhd a 2014 review found that an elimination diet results in a small overall benefit a 2016 review stated that use of a gluten free diet as standard adhd treatment is not advised a 2017 review showed that a few foods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not responding to medication while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food coloring as standard adhd treatment is not advised chronic deficiencies of iron magnesium and iodine may have a negative impact on adhd symptoms there is a small amount of evidence that lower tissue zinc levels may be associated with adhd in absence of a demonstrated zinc deficiency which is rare outside of developing countries zinc supplementation is not recommended as treatment for adhd however zinc supplementation may reduce minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used with amphetamine for treatment of adhd there is evidence of a modest benefit of omega 3 fatty acid supplementation but it is not recommended in place of traditional medication prognosis adhd persists into adulthood in about 30 50 of cases those affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms children with adhd have a higher risk of unintentional injuries one study from denmark found an increased risk of death among those with adhd due to increased rate of accidents effects of medication on functional impairment and quality of life e g reduced risk of accidents have been found across multiple domains but executive function deficits have a limited respond to adhd medications rates of smoking among those with adhd are higher than in general population at about 40 epidemiology adhd is estimated to affect about 6 7 of people aged 18 and under when diagnosed via dsm iv criteria when diagnosed via icd 10 criteria rates in this age group are estimated at 1 2 children in north america appear to have a higher rate of adhd than children in africa and middle east this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency if same diagnostic methods are used rates are more or less same between countries it is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls this difference between sexes may reflect either a difference in susceptibility or that females with adhd are less likely to be diagnosed than males rates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both united kingdom and united states since 1970s prior to 1970 it was rare for children to be diagnosed with adhd while in 1970s rates were about 1 this is believed to be primarily due to changes in how condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in how common condition is it is believed that changes to diagnostic criteria in 2013 with release of dsm 5 will increase percentage of people diagnosed with adhd especially among adults history thumb upright 1 6 timeline of adhd diagnostic criteria prevalence and treatment hyperactivity has long been part of human condition sir alexander crichton describes mental restlessness in his book an inquiry into nature and origin of mental derangement written in 1798 he made observations about children showing signs of being inattentive and having fidgets first clear description of adhd is credited to george still in 1902 during a series of lectures he gave to royal college of physicians of london he noted both nature and nurture could be influencing this disorder alfred tredgold proposed an association between brain damage and behavioral or learning problems which was able to be validated by encephalitis epidemic from 1917 through 1928 terminology used to describe condition has changed over time and has included in dsm i 1952 minimal brain dysfunction in dsm ii 1968 hyperkinetic reaction of childhood and in dsm iii 1980 attention deficit disorder add with or without hyperactivity in 1987 this was changed to adhd in dsm iii r and dsm iv in 1994 split diagnosis into three subtypes adhd inattentive type adhd hyperactive impulsive type and adhd combined type these terms were kept in dsm 5 in 2013 other terms have included minimal brain damage used in 1930s in 1934 benzedrine became first amphetamine medication approved for use in united states methylphenidate was introduced in 1950s and dextroamphetamine in 1970s use of stimulants to treat adhd was first described in 1937 charles bradley gave children with behavioral disorders benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behavior until 1990s many studies implicated prefrontal striatal network as being smaller in children with adhd during this same period a genetic component was identified and adhd was acknowledged to be a persistent long term disorder which lasted from childhood into adulthood adhd was split into current three subtypes because of a field trial completed by lahey and colleagues controversy adhd its diagnosis and its treatment have been controversial since 1970s controversies involve clinicians teachers policymakers parents and media positions range from view that adhd is within normal range of behavior to hypothesis that adhd is a genetic condition other areas of controversy include use of stimulant medications in children method of diagnosis and possibility of overdiagnosis in 2009 national institute for health and care excellence while acknowledging controversy states that current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on dominant view of academic literature in 2014 keith conners one of early advocates for recognition of disorder spoke out against overdiagnosis in a new york times article in contrast a 2014 peer reviewed medical literature review indicated that adhd is underdiagnosed in adults with widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries states within countries races and ethnicities some suspect factors other than presence of symptoms of adhd are playing a role in diagnosis some sociologists consider adhd to be an example of medicalization of deviant behavior that is turning of previously issue of school performance into a medical one most healthcare providers accept adhd as a genuine disorder at least in small number of people with severe symptoms among healthcare providers debate mainly centers on diagnosis and treatment in much greater number of people with mild symptoms references further reading external links national institute of mental health on adhd new zealand moh guidelines for assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity
