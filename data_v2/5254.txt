adaptation of novella following 1951 s thing from another world thing went through several directors and writers each with different ideas on how to approach story filming lasted roughly 12 weeks beginning in august 1981 and took place on refrigerated sets in los angeles as well as in juneau alaska and stewart british columbia of film s 15 million budget 1 5 million was spent on rob bottin s creature effects a mixture of chemicals food products rubber and mechanical parts turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form thing was released in 1982 to very negative reviews it was described as instant junk a wretched excess and proposed as most hated film of all time reviews both praised special effects achievements and criticized their visual repulsiveness while others focused on poor characterization film earned 19 6 million during its theatrical run many reasons have been cited for its failure to impress audiences competition from films such as e t extra terrestrial which offered an optimistic take on alien visitation a summer that had been filled with successful science fiction and fantasy films and an audience living through a recession diametrically opposed to things nihilistic tone film found an audience when released on home video and television in years since it has been reappraised as one of best science fiction or horror films ever made and has gained a cult following filmmakers have noted its influence on their work and it has been referred to in other media such as television and video games thing has spawned a variety of merchandise including a 1982 novelization haunted houses board games and sequels in comic books a video game of same name and a 2011 prequel film of same name plot actor role in antarctica a norwegian

their distrust and share a bottle of scotch production development thumb left upright alt an elderly caucasian man with a gray mustache and gray receding hair faces camera with a neutral expression director john carpenter in 2001 development of film began in mid 1970s when producers david foster and lawrence turman suggested an adaptation of 1938 john w campbell novella who goes there to universal pictures it had been loosely adapted once before in howard hawks s and christian nyby s 1951 film thing from another world but foster and turman wanted to develop a project that stuck more closely to source material screenwriters hal barwood and matthew robbins held rights to make an adaptation but passed on opportunity to make a new film so universal obtained rights from them in 1976 wilbur stark had purchased remake rights to 23 rko pictures films including thing from another world from three wall street financiers who did not know what to do with them in exchange for a return when films were produced universal in turn acquired rights to remake film from stark resulting in him being given an executive producer credit on all print advertisements posters television commercials and studio press material john carpenter was first approached about project in 1976 by co producer and friend stuart cohen but carpenter was mainly an independent film director so universal chose texas chain saw massacre 1974 director tobe hooper as they already had him under contract producers were ultimately unhappy with hooper and his writing partner kim henkel s concept after several more failed pitches by different writers and attempts to bring on other directors such as john landis project was put on hold even so success of ridley scott s 1979 science fiction horror film alien helped revitalize project at which point carpenter became loosely attached following his success with his influential slasher film halloween 1978 carpenter was reluctant to join project as he thought hawks s adaptation would be difficult to surpass although he considered film s monster to be cohen suggested that he read original novella carpenter found creepiness of imitations conducted by creature and questions it raised interesting carpenter drew parallels between novella and agatha christie s mystery novel and then there were none 1939 and noted that story of who goes there was timely for him meaning he could make it true to his day as hawks had in his time carpenter a fan of hawks s adaptation paid homage to it in halloween and he watched thing from another world several times for inspiration before filming began carpenter and cinematographer dean cundey first worked together on halloween and thing was their first big budget project for a major film studio after securing writer and crew film was stalled again when carpenter nearly quit believing that a passion project of his el diablo 1990 was on verge of being made by emi films producers discussed various replacements including walter hill sam peckinpah and michael ritchie but development of el diablo was not as imminent as carpenter believed and he remained with thing universal initially set a budget of 10 million with 200 000 for creature effects which at time was more than studio had ever allocated to a monster film filming was scheduled to be completed within 98 days universal s production studios estimated that it would require at least 17 million before marketing and other costs as plan involved more set construction including external sets and a large set piece for original scripted death of bennings which was estimated to cost 1 5 million alone as storyboarding and designs were finalized crew estimated they would need at least 750 000 for creature effects a figure universal executives agreed to after seeing number of workers employed under rob bottin special make up effects designer associate producer larry franco was responsible for making budget work for film he cut filming schedule by a third eliminated exterior sets for on site shooting and removed bennings s more extravagant death scene cohen suggested reusing destroyed american camp as ruined norwegian camp saving a further 250 000 when filming began in august thing had a budget of 11 4 million and indirect costs brought it to 14 million effects budget ran over eventually totalling 1 5 million forcing elimination of some scenes including nauls s confrontation of a creature dubbed box thing by end of production carpenter had to make a personal appeal to executive ned tanen for 100 000 to complete a simplified version of blair thing final cost was 12 4 million and overhead costs brought it to 15 million writing thumb upright alt a black and white photo of a young caucasian man

thing before carpenter became involved including logan s run 1967 writer william f nolan novelist david wiltse and hooper and henkel whose draft was set at least partially underwater and which cohen described as a moby dick like story in which captain did battle with a large non shapeshifting creature as carpenter said in a 2014 interview they were just trying to make it work writers left before carpenter joined project he said scripts were awful as they changed story into something it was not and ignored chameleon like aspect of thing carpenter did not want to write project himself after recently completing work on escape from new york 1981 and having struggled to complete a screenplay for philadelphia experiment 1984 he was wary of taking on writing duties preferring to let someone else do it once carpenter was confirmed as director several writers were asked to script thing including richard matheson nigel kneale and deric washburn bill lancaster initially met with turman foster and cohen in 1977 but he was given impression that they wanted to closely replicate thing from another world and he did not want to remake film in august 1979 lancaster was contacted again by this time he had read original who goes there novella and carpenter had become involved in project lancaster was hired to write script after describing his vision for film and his intention to stick closely to original story to carpenter who was a fan of lancaster s work on bad news bears 1976 lancaster conceived several key scenes in film including norris thing biting dr copper and use of blood tests to identify thing which carpenter cited as reason he wanted to work on film lancaster said he found some difficulty in translating who goes there to film as it features very little action he also made some significant changes to story such as reducing number of characters from 37 to 12 lancaster said that 37 was excessive and would be difficult for audiences to follow leaving little screen time for characterization he also opted to alter story s structure choosing to open his in middle of action instead of using a flashback as in novella several characters were modernized for contemporary audiences macready originally a meteorologist became a tough loner described in script as 35 helicopter pilot likes chess hates cold pay is good lancaster aimed to create an ensemble piece where one person emerged as hero instead of having a doc savage type hero from start lancaster wrote approximately 30 to 40 pages but eventually struggled writing film s second act and it took him several months to complete script after it was finished lancaster and carpenter spent a weekend in northern california refining script each having different takes on how a character should sound and comparing their ideas for scenes lancaster s script opted to keep creature largely concealed throughout film and it was bottin who convinced carpenter to make it more visible to have a greater impact on audience lancaster s original ending had both macready and childs turn into thing in spring characters are rescued by helicopter greeting their saviors with hey which way to a hot meal carpenter thought this ending was too shallow in total lancaster completed four drafts of screenplay novella concludes with humans clearly victorious but concerned that birds they see flying toward mainland may have been infected by thing carpenter opted to end film with survivors slowly freezing to death to save humanity from infection believing this to be ultimate heroic act lancaster wrote this ending which eschews a twilight zone style twist or destruction of monster as he wanted to instead have an ambiguous moment between pair of trust and mistrust fear and relief casting kurt russell was involved in production before being cast helping carpenter develop his ideas russell was last actor to be cast in june 1981 by which point second unit filming was starting in juneau alaska carpenter had worked with russell twice before but wanted to keep his options open discussions with studio involved using actors christopher walken jeff bridges or nick nolte who were either unavailable or declined and sam shepard who showed interest but was never pursued tom atkins and jack thompson were strong early and late contenders for role of macready but decision was made to go with russell in part carpenter cited practicality of choosing someone he had found reliable before and who would not balk at difficult filming conditions it took russell about a year to grow his hair and beard out for role at various points producers met with brian dennehy kris kristofferson john heard ed harris tom berenger jack thompson scott glenn fred ward peter coyote tom atkins and tim mcintire some passed on idea of starring in a monster film while dennehy became choice to play copper each actor was to be paid 50 000 but after more established russell was cast his salary increased to 400 000 geoffrey holder carl weathers and bernie casey were considered for role of childs and carpenter also looked at isaac hayes having worked with him on escape from new york ernie hudson was front runner and was almost cast until they met with keith david thing was david s first significant film role and coming from a theater background he had to learn on set how to hold himself back and not show every emotion his character was feeling with guidance from richard masur and donald moffat in particular masur and david discussed their characters in rehearsals and decided that they would not like each other for blair team chose then unknown wilford brimley as they wanted an everyman whose absence would not be questioned by audience until appropriate time intent with character was to have him become infected early on off screen so that his status would be unknown to audience concealing his intentions carpenter wanted to cast donald pleasence but it was decided that he was too recognizable to accommodate role t k carter was cast as nauls but comedian franklyn also came in to read for role instead he delivered a lengthy speech about character being a stereotype after which meeting ended thumb upright alt an elderly caucasian male with a long white mustache he is wearing a cowboy hat and striped waistcoat while holding a microphone he is standing in front of a screen actor wilford brimley in 2012 he was cast for his everyman persona that would allow audiences not to notice his absence from story until right time bottin lobbied hard to play palmer but it was deemed impossible for him to do so alongside his existing duties as character has some comedic moments universal brought in comedians jay leno garry shandling and charles fleischer among others but opted to go with actor david clennon who was better suited to play dramatic elements clennon had read for bennings character but he preferred option of playing palmer s blue collar stoner to a white collar science man powers boothe lee van jerry orbach and kevin conway were considered for role of garry and richard mulligan was also considered when production experimented with idea of making character closer to macready in age masur also read for garry but he asked to play clark instead as he liked character s dialogue and was also a fan of dogs masur worked daily with jed and his handler clint rowe during rehearsals as rowe was familiarizing jed with sounds and smells of people this helped masur s and jed s performance on screen as dog would stand next to him without looking for his handler masur described his character as one uninterested in people but who loves working with dogs he went to a survivalist store and bought a flip knife for his character and used it in a confrontation with david s character masur turned down a role in e t extra terrestrial to play clark william daniels and dennehy were both interested in playing dr copper and it was a last second decision by carpenter to go with richard dysart in early drafts windows was called sanchez and later sanders name windows came when actor for role thomas waites was in a costume fitting and tried on a large pair of dark glasses which character wears in film norbert weisser portrays one of norwegians and jed appears uncredited as dog thing only female presence in film is voice of macready s chess computer voiced by carpenter s then wife adrienne barbeau russell described all male story as interesting since men had no one to posture for without women foster franco and lancaster along with other members of crew make a cameo appearance in a recovered photograph of norwegian team camera operator ray stella stood in for shots where needles were used to take blood telling carpenter that he could do it all day franco also played norwegian wielding a rifle and hanging out of helicopter during opening sequence anita dann served as casting director filming thing was storyboarded extensively by mike ploog and mentor huebner before filming began their work was so detailed that many of film s shots replicate image layout completely cundey pushed for use of anamorphic format aspect ratio believing that it allowed for placing several actors in an environment and making use of scenic vistas available while still creating a sense of confinement within image it also enabled use of negative space around actors to imply something may be lurking just off screen thumb left alt a distance shot near juneau alaska area is covered in untouched white snow with mountain peaks in distance to right of image nearer photographer is an uncovered outcrop of rocks principal photography began in august 1981 in juneau alaska principal photography began on august 24 1981 in juneau alaska filming lasted approximately 12 weeks carpenter insisted on two weeks of rehearsals before filming as he wanted to see how scenes would play out this was unusual at time because of expense involved filming then moved to universal lot where outside heat was over internal sets were climate controlled to to facilitate their work team considered building sets inside an existing refrigerated structure but were unable to find one large enough instead they collected as many portable air conditioners as they could closed off stage and used and to add moisture to air after watching a roughly assembled cut of filming to date carpenter was unhappy that film seemed to feature too many scenes of men standing around talking he rewrote some already completed scenes to take place outdoors to be shot on location when principal photography moved to stewart british columbia carpenter was determined to use authentic locations instead of studio sets and his successes on halloween and fog 1980 gave him credibility to take on much bigger budget production of thing a film scout located an area just outside stewart along canadian coast which offered project both ease of access and scenic value during day on december 2 1981 roughly 100 american and canadian crew members moved to area to begin filming during journey there crew bus slid in snow toward unprotected edge of road nearly sending it down a embankment some of crew stayed in small mining town during filming while others lived on residential barges on portland canal they would make drive up a small winding road to filming location in alaska where exterior outpost sets were built sets had been built in alaska during summer atop a rocky area overlooking a glacier in preparation for snow to fall and cover them they were used for both interior and exterior filming meaning they could not be heated above freezing inside to ensure there was always snow on roof outside temperature was so low that camera lenses would freeze and break crew had to leave cameras in freezing temperatures as keeping them inside in warmth resulted in foggy lenses that took hours to clear filming greatly dependent on weather took three weeks to complete with heavy snow making it impossible to film on some days it took eight hours to rig explosives necessary to destroy set in film s finale keith david broke his hand in a car accident day before he was to begin shooting david attended filming next day but when carpenter and franco saw his swollen hand they sent him to hospital where it was punctured with two pins he returned wearing a surgical glove beneath a black glove that was painted to resemble his complexion his left hand is not seen for first half of film carpenter filmed norwegian camp scenes after end scenes using damaged american base as a stand in for charred norwegian camp explosive destruction of base required camera assistants to stand inside set with explosives which were activated remotely assistants then had to run to a safe distance while seven cameras captured base s destruction filmed when heavy use of special effects was rare actors had to adapt to having carpenter describe to them what their characters were looking at as effects would not be added until post production there were some puppets used to create impression of what was happening in scene but in other cases cast would be looking at a wall or an object marked with an x art director john j lloyd oversaw design and construction of all sets as there were no existing locations used in film cundey suggested that sets should have ceilings and pipes seen on camera to make spaces seem more claustrophobic post production several scenes in script were omitted from film sometimes because there was too much dialogue that slowed pace and undermined suspense carpenter blamed some of issues on his directorial method noting that several scenes appeared to be repeating events or information another scene featuring a snowmobile chase pursuing dogs was removed from shooting script as it would have been too expensive to film one scene present in film but not script features a monologue by macready carpenter added this partly to establish what was happening in story and because he wanted to highlight russell s heroic character after taking over camp carpenter said that lancaster s experience writing ensemble pieces did not emphasize single characters since halloween several horror films had replicated many of scare elements of that film something carpenter wanted to move away from for thing he removed scenes from lancaster s script that had been filmed such as a body suddenly falling into view at norwegian camp which he felt were too cliched approximately three minutes of scenes were filmed from lancaster s script that elaborated on characters backgrounds a scene with macready absentmindedly inflating a blow up doll while watching norwegian tapes was filmed but was not in finished film doll would later appear as a jump scare with nauls other scenes featured expanded or alternate deaths for various characters in finished film fuchs s charred bones are discovered revealing he has died off screen but an alternate take sees his corpse impaled on a wall with a shovel nauls was scripted to appear in finale as a partly assimilated mass of tentacles but in film he simply disappears carpenter struggled with a method of conveying to audience what assimilation by creature actually meant lancaster s original set piece of bennings s death had him pulled beneath a sheet of ice by thing before resurfacing in different areas in various stages of assimilation scene called for a set to be built on one of universal s largest stages with sophisticated hydraulics dogs and flamethrowers but it was deemed too costly to produce a scene was filmed with bennings being murdered by an unknown assailant but it was felt that assimilation leading to his death was not explained enough short on time and with no interior sets remaining a small set was built maloney was covered with k y jelly orange dye and rubber tentacles monster gloves for a different creature were repurposed to demonstrate partial assimilation carpenter filmed multiple endings for thing including a happier ending because editor todd ramsay thought that bleak nihilistic conclusion would not test well with audiences in alternate take macready is rescued and given a blood test that proves he is not infected carpenter said that stylistically this ending would have been cheesy editor verna fields was tasked with reworking ending to add clarity and resolution it was finally decided to create an entirely new scene which omitted suspicion of childs being infected by removing him completely leaving macready alone this new ending tested only slightly better with audiences than original and production team agreed to studio s request to use it it was set to go to print for theaters when producers carpenter and executive helena hacker decided that film was better left with ambiguity instead of nothing at all carpenter gave his approval to restore ambiguous ending but a scream was inserted over outpost explosion to posit monster s death universal executive sidney sheinberg disliked ending s nihilism and according to carpenter said think about how audience will react if we see thing die with a giant orchestra playing carpenter later noted that both original ending and ending without childs tested poorly with audiences which he interpreted as film simply not being heroic enough music ennio morricone composed film s score as carpenter wanted thing to have a european musical approach carpenter flew to rome to speak with morricone to convince him to take job by time morricone flew to los angeles to record score he had already developed a tape filled with an array of synthesizer music because he was unsure what type of score carpenter wanted morricone wrote complete separate orchestral and synthesizer scores and a combined score which he knew was carpenter s preference carpenter picked a piece closely resembling his own scores that became main theme used throughout film he also played score from escape from new york for morricone as an example morricone made several more attempts bringing score closer to carpenter s own style of music in total morricone produced a score of approximately one hour that remained largely unused but was later released as part of film s soundtrack carpenter and his longtime collaborator alan howarth separately developed some synth styled pieces used in film in 2012 morricone recalled i ve asked carpenter as he was preparing some electronic music with an assistant to edit on film why did you call me if you want to do it on your own he surprised me he said i got married to your music this is why i ve called you then when he showed me film later when i wrote music we didn t exchange ideas he ran away nearly ashamed of showing it to me i wrote music on my own without his advice naturally as i had become quite clever since 1982 i ve written several scores relating to my life and i had written one which was electronic music and carpenter took electronic score carpenter said morricone did all orchestrations and recorded for me 20 minutes of music i could use wherever i wished but without seeing any footage i cut his music into film and realized that there were places mostly scenes of tension in which his music would not work i secretly ran off and recorded in a couple of days a few pieces to use my pieces were very simple electronic pieces it was almost tones it was not really music at all but just background sounds something today you might even consider as sound effects design creature effects things special effects were largely designed by bottin who had previously worked with carpenter on fog 1980 when bottin joined project in mid 1981 pre production was in progress but no design had been settled on for alien artist dale had created some preliminary paintings of creature s look but he left project after being hospitalized following a traffic accident before he could develop them further with bottin carpenter conceived thing as a single creature but bottin suggested that it should be constantly changing and able to look like anything carpenter initially considered bottin s description of his ideas as too weird and had him work with ploog to sketch them instead as part of thing s design it was agreed anyone assimilated by it would be a perfect imitation and would not know they were thing actors spent hours during rehearsals discussing whether they would know they were thing when taken over clennon said that it did not matter because everyone acted looked and smelled exactly same before being taken over at its peak bottin had a 35 person crew of artists and technicians and he found it difficult to work with so many people to help manage team he hired erik jensen a special effects line producer who he had worked with on howling 1981 to be in charge of special make up effects unit bottin s crew also included mechanical aspect supervisor dave kelsey make up aspect coordinator ken diaz gunnar and bottin s longtime friend margaret who managed painting and hair work thumb left alt a creature bearing face of a dog lies on floor various unnatural formations such as legs and tentacles are present on its body thing assimilating dogs stan winston was brought in to help complete effect it was operated on a raised set with puppeteers working below in designing thing s different forms bottin explained that creature had been all over galaxy this allowed it to call on different attributes as necessary such as stomachs that transform into giant mouths and spider legs sprouting from heads bottin said pressure he experienced caused him to dream about working on designs some of which he would take note of after waking one abandoned idea included a series of dead baby monsters which was deemed too gross bottin admitted he had no idea how his designs would be implemented practically but carpenter did not reject them carpenter said what i didn t want to end up with in this movie was a guy in a suit i grew up as a kid watching science fiction monster movies and it was always a guy in a suit according to cundey bottin was very sensitive about his designs and worried about film showing too many of them at one point as a preemptive move against any censorship bottin suggested making creature s violent transformations and appearance of internal organs more fantastical using colors decision was made to tone down color of blood and viscera although much of filming had been completed by that point creature effects used a variety of materials including mayonnaise corn microwaved bubble gum and k y jelly during filming then 21 year old bottin was hospitalized for exhaustion double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer caused by his extensive workload bottin himself explained he would hoard work opting to be directly involved in many of complicated tasks his dedication to project saw him spend over a year living on universal lot bottin said he did not take a day off during that time and slept on sets or in locker rooms to take some pressure off his crew bottin enlisted aid of special effects creator stan winston to complete some of designs primarily dog thing with insufficient time to create a sophisticated mechanical creature winston opted to create a hand puppet a cast was made of makeup artist lance anderson s arm and head around which dog thing was sculpted in oil based clay final foam latex puppet worn by anderson featured radio controlled eyes and cable controlled legs and was operated from below a raised set on which kennel was built slime from puppet would leak onto anderson during two days it took to film scene and he had to wear a helmet to protect himself from explosive squibs simulating gunfire anderson pulled tentacles into dog thing and reverse motion was used to create effect of them slithering from its body winston refused to be credited for his work insisting that bottin deserved sole credit winston was given a thank you in credits instead thumb alt

were unaware that fumes from rubber foam chemicals inside puppet were flammable fire ignited fumes creating a large fireball that engulfed puppet it suffered only minimal damage after fire had been put out and crew successfully filmed scene stop motion expert randall william cook developed a sequence for end of film where macready is confronted by gigantic blair thing cook created a miniature model of set and filmed wide angle shots of monster in stop motion but carpenter was not convinced by effect and used only a few seconds of it it took 50 people to operate actual blair thing puppet

conscious that showing too much would reveal its artificial nature breaking illusion each encounter with creature was planned for areas where they could justify using a series of small lights to highlight particular creature model s surface and textures cundey would illuminate area behind creature to detail its overall shape he worked with panasonic and a few other companies to develop a camera capable of automatically adjusting light exposure at different film speeds he wanted to try filming creature at fast and slow speeds thinking this would create a more interesting visual effect but they were unable to accomplish this at time for rest of set cundey created a contrast by lighting interiors with warmer lights hung overhead in conical shades so that they could still control lighting and have darkened areas on set outside was constantly bathed in a cold blue light that cundey had discovered being used on airport runways reflective surface of snow and blue light helped create impression of coldness team also made use of flamethrowers and magenta hued flares used by actors to create dynamic lighting team originally wanted to shoot film in black and white but universal was reluctant as it could affect their ability to sell television rights for film instead cundey suggested muting colors as much as possible inside of sets was painted in neutral colors such as gray and many of props were also painted gray while costumes were a mix of somber browns blues and grays they relied on lighting to add color albert whitlock provided matte painted backdrops including scene in which americans discover giant alien spaceship buried in ice a scene where macready walks up to a hole in ice where alien had been buried was filmed at universal while surrounding area including alien spaceship helicopter and snow were all painted carpenter s friend john wash who developed opening computer simulation for escape from new york designed computer program showing

film exhibitors in early 1982 they wanted reassurance that thing was a first rate production capable of attracting audiences cohen and foster with a specially employed editor and universal s archive of music put together a 20 minute showreel emphasizing action and suspense they used available footage including alternate and extended scenes not in finished film but avoided revealing special effects as much as possible reaction from exclusively male exhibitors was generally positive and universal executive robert told cohen that studio was counting on things success as they expected e t extra terrestrial to appeal only to children while finalizing film universal sent carpenter a demographic study showing that audience appeal of horror films had declined by 70 over previous six months carpenter considered this a suggestion that he lower his expectations of film s performance after one market research screening carpenter queried audience on their thoughts and one audience member asked well what happened in very end which one was thing when carpenter responded that it was up to their imagination audience member responded oh god i hate that after returning from a screening of e t extra terrestrial audience s silence at a thing trailer caused foster to remark we re dead response to public pre screenings of thing resulted in studio changing somber black and white advertising approved by producers to a color image of a person with a glowing face tagline was also changed from man is warmest place to hide written by stephen frankfort who wrote alien tagline in space no one can hear you scream to ultimate in alien terror trying to capitalize on aliens audience carpenter attempted to make a last minute change of film s title to who goes there to no avail week before its release carpenter promoted film with clips on late night with david letterman in 1981 horror magazine fangoria held a contest encouraging readers to submit drawings of what thing would look like winners were rewarded with a trip to universal studios on its opening day a special screening was held at hollywood pacific theatre presided over by elvira mistress of dark with free admission for those in costume as monsters box office thing was released in united states on june 25 1982 during its opening weekend film earned 3 1 million from 840 theaters an average of 3 699 per theater finishing as number eight film of weekend behind supernatural horror poltergeist 4 1 million which was in its fourth weekend of release and ahead of action film megaforce 2 3 million it dropped out of top 10 grossing films after three weeks it ended its run earning a total of 19 6 million against its 15 million budget making it only 42nd highest grossing film of 1982 it was not a box office failure nor was it a hit since its release cultural historians and critics have attempted to understand what led to things initial failure to connect with audiences in a 1999 interview carpenter said audiences rejected thing for its nihilistic depressing viewpoint at a time when united states was in midst of a recession when it opened it was competing against critically and commercially successful e t extra terrestrial 619 million a more family friendly film released two weeks earlier that offered a more optimistic take on alien visitation carpenter described it as complete opposite of his film thing opened on same day as science fiction film blade runner which debuted as number two film that weekend with a take of 6 1 million and went on to earn 33 8 million it was also regarded as a critical and commercial failure at time others blamed an oversaturation of science fiction and fantasy films released that year including conan barbarian 130 million poltergeist 121 7 million road warrior 34 5 million star trek ii wrath of khan 97 million and tron 33 million some analysts blamed universal s poor marketing which did not compete with deluge of promotion for prominent films released that summer another factor was r rating it was given restricting audience to those over age of 17 unless accompanied by an adult poltergeist received a pg rating allowing families and younger children to view it critical response film received negative reviews on its release and hostility for its cynical anti authoritarian tone and graphic special effects cinefantastique printed an issue with thing on its cover asking is this most hated movie of all time some reviewers were dismissive of film calling it quintessential moron movie of 80 s instant junk and a wretched excess alan spencer called it a cold and sterile horror movie attempting to cash in on genre audience against optimism of e t reassuring return of star trek ii technical perfection of tron and sheer integrity of blade runner plot was criticized as boring and undermined by special effects los angeles timess linda gross said that thing was bereft despairing and nihilistic and lacking in feeling meaning characters deaths did not matter spencer said it featured sloppy continuity lacked pacing and was devoid of warmth or humanity david ansen of newsweek felt film confused use of effects with creating suspense and that it lacked drama by sacrificing everything at altar of gore chicago readers dave kehr considered dialogue to be banal and interchangeable making characters seem and sound alike washington posts gary arnold said it was a witty touch to open with thing having already overcome norwegian base defeating type of traps seen in 1951 version while new yorks david denby lamented that thing s threat is only shown externally without focusing on what it is like for someone who thinks they have been taken over roger ebert considered film to be scary but offering nothing original beyond special effects while new york timess vincent canby said it was entertaining only if viewer needed to see spider legged heads and dog autopsies reviews of actors performances were generally positive while criticizing depictions of characters they portrayed ebert said they lacked characterization offering basic stereotypes that existed just to be killed and spencer called characters bland even though actors do best they can with material times richard schickel singled russell out as stalwart hero where other characters were not as strongly or wittily characterized and variety said that russell s heroic status was undercut by suicidal attitude adopted toward film s finale other reviews criticized implausibilities such as characters wandering off alone kehr did not like that men did not band together against thing and several reviews noted a lack of camaraderie and romance which arnold said reduced any interest beyond special effects film s special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive reviews called bottin s work genius noting designs were novel unforgettable colorfully horrific and called him a master of macabre arnold said that chest chomp scene demonstrated appalling creativity and subsequent severed head scene was madly macabre comparing them to aliens chest and severed head scenes variety called it most vividly gruesome horror film to ever stalk screens conversely denby called them more disgusting than frightening and lamented that trend of horror films to open human body more and more bordered on obscenity spencer said that bottin s care and pride in his craft was shown in effects but both they and schickel found them to be overwhelming and squandered without strong characters and story even so canby said that effects were too phony looking to be disgusting canby and arnold said creature s lack of a single discernible shape was to its detriment and hiding it inside humans made it hard to follow arnold said that 1951 version was less versatile but easier to keep in focus gross and spencer praised film s technical achievements particularly cundey s frostbitten cinematography sound editing and morricone s score spencer was critical of carpenter s direction saying it was his futile attempt to give audience what he thinks they want and that carpenter was not meant to direct science fiction but was instead suited to direct traffic accidents train wrecks and public floggings ansen said that atrocity for atrocity s sake was ill becoming of carpenter thing was often compared to similar films particularly alien invasion of body snatchers 1978 and thing from another world ebert and denby said that thing seemed derivative compared to those films which had portrayed story in a better way variety called it inferior to 1951 version arnold considered thing as end result of alien raising requirement for horrific spectacle thing from another world actor kenneth tobey and director christian nyby also criticized film nyby said if you want blood go to slaughterhouse all in all it s a terrific commercial for j b scotch tobey singled out visual effects saying they were so explicit that they actually destroyed how you were supposed to feel about characters they became almost a movie in themselves and were a little too horrifying in phil hardy s book science fiction 1984 a reviewer described film as a surprising failure and called it carpenter s most unsatisfying film to date review noted that narrative seems little more than an excuse for various set pieces of special effects and russell s hero is no more than a cypher compared to tobey s rounded character in howard hawks thing clennon said that introductory scenes for characters omitted from film made it hard for audiences to connect with them robbing it of some of broader appeal of alien accolades thing received nominations from academy of science fiction fantasy and horror films for best horror film and best special effects but lost to poltergeist and e t extra terrestrial respectively film was nominated in razzie awards for worst musical score post release aftermath impact on carpenter was immediate he lost job of directing 1984 science fiction horror film firestarter because of things poor performance his previous success had gained him a multiple film contract at universal but studio opted to buy him out of it instead he continued making films afterward but lost confidence and did not openly talk about things failure until a 1985 interview with starlog where he said i was called a pornographer of violence i had no idea it would be received that way thing was just too strong for that time i knew it was going to be strong but i didn t think it would be too strong i didn t take public s taste into consideration shortly after its release wilbur stark sued universal for 43 million for slander breach of contract fraud and deceit alleging he incurred a financial loss by universal failing to credit him properly in its marketing and by showing his name during end credits a less prestigious position stark also said that he contributed greatly to screenplay david foster responded that stark was not involved with film s production in any way and received proper credit in all materials stark later sued for a further 15 million over foster s comments outcome of lawsuits is unknown home media while thing was not initially successful it was able to find new audiences and appreciation on home video and later on television sidney sheinberg edited a version of film for network television broadcast which added narration and a different ending where thing imitates a dog and escapes ruined camp carpenter disowned this version and theorized that sheinberg had been mad at him for not taking his creative ideas on board for theatrical cut thing was released on dvd in 1998 and featured additional content such as thing terror takes shape a detailed documentary on production deleted and alternate scenes and commentary by carpenter and russell an hd dvd version followed in 2006 containing same features and a blu ray version in 2008 featuring just carpenter and russell commentary and some behind scenes videos available via picture in picture during film a 2016 blu ray release featured a 2k resolution restoration of film overseen by dean cundey as well as including previous features such as commentary and terror takes shape it added interviews with cast and crew and segments that focus on music writing editing ploog s artwork an interview with alan dean foster who wrote film s novelization and television broadcast version of thing that runs 15 minutes shorter than theatrical cut a 4k resolution restoration was released in 2017 on blu ray initially as a united kingdom exclusive with a limited run of 8 000 units restoration was created using original film negative and was overseen by carpenter and cundey mca released soundtrack for thing in 1982 varese sarabande re released it in 1991 on compact disc and compact cassette these versions eventually ceased being manufactured in 2011 howarth and larry hopkins restored morricone s score using updated digital techniques and arranged each track in order it appears in film album also includes tracks composed by carpenter and howarth for film a remastered version of score was released on vinyl on february 23 2017 a deluxe edition included an exclusive interview with carpenter thematic analysis central theme of thing concerns paranoia and mistrust fundamentally film is about erosion of trust in a small community instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by possibility of someone not being who they say they are or that your best friend may be your enemy it represents distrust that humans always have for somebody else and fear of betrayal by those we know and ultimately our bodies theme remains timely because subject of paranoia adapts to age thing focuses on being unable to trust one s peers but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions developed in an era of cold war tensions between united states and soviet union film refers to threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction diaboliques daniel clarkson fisher notes that macready destroys chess computer after being checkmated and similarly vows to destroy thing even at expense of team cold war style isolationism hurts group while a lack of trust destroys it screen rants michael edward taylor draws allusions between thing and accusatory red scares and mccarthyism as film conveys an anti communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation slant magazines john said men display a level of post vietnam war 1955 1975 fatigued rejection of conventional social norms each defined by their own eccentricities thumb upright left alt a street view of a wide white building in center is a large sign that says pacific street in front is lined with parked cars work of writer h p lovecraft was an inspiration for john carpenter s work shapeless undefinable thing has been compared to lovecraft s indescribable otherworldly forces lancaster s script eschews female characters because he believed that a female character was a love interest who inevitably gets in way atlantics noah berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films females are excluded allowing thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man or being homosexual indeed several involve penetration tentacles and in norris s case opened up at stomach to birth his own replica slasher genre favors female stars as they are perceived as weaker and therefore more empathetic providing a cathartic release when they defeat villain but in thing men are not meant to survive vices patrick marlborough considered thing to be a critical take on masculinity identifying thing requires intimacy confession and empathy to out creature but masculinity prevents this as an option trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth men are unable to confront truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure berlatsky noted that macready avoids emotional attachments and is most paranoid allowing him to be hero this detachment works against him in finale which leaves macready locked in a futile mistrust with childs each not really knowing other nerdist s kyle anderson and strange orrin grey analyzed thing as an example of author h p lovecraft s cosmic horror notion that ancient inhuman beings exist that do not care about humanity in any way this also includes fear of losing one s humanity and being consumed figuratively or literally by these ancient eldritch behemoths thing is a being beyond our understanding and possesses ability to destroy all life on earth quickly just as lovecraft left his creatures undescribed thing can be seen but its shape is mostly indescribable beyond realm of human knowledge grey said that macready represents a more traditional hollywood film protagonist but blair represents lovecraftian protagonist who succumbs to his fear of creature is driven insane by implications of its nature and eventually becomes what he fears thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions and ruthlessly pursues its goal grey describes creature as fear of loss of self it attacks consumes and imitates an individual perfectly with memories and behaviors original is subsumed by an alien copy that is virtually impossible to identify den of geek s mark harrison and ryan lambie said that essence of humanity is free will which is stripped away by thing possibly without individual being aware that they have been taken over in a 1982 interview when given option to describe thing as pro science like who goes there or anti science like thing from another world carpenter chose pro human stating it s better to be a human being than an imitation or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who s not necessarily evil but whose nature it is to simply imitate like a chameleon further allusions have been drawn between blood test scene and epidemic of hiv at time which could only be identified by a blood test since its release many theories have been developed to attempt to answer film s ambiguous ending shared by macready and childs several suggest that childs was infected citing dean cundey s statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to eyes of uninfected characters something absent from childs similarly others have noted a lack of visible breath from character in frigid air while both aspects are present in macready their absence in childs has been explained as a technical issue with filming during production carpenter considered having macready be infected and an alternate ending showed macready having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected russell has said that analyzing scene for clues is missing point he continued carpenter and i worked on ending of that movie together a long time we were both bringing audience right back to square one at end of day that was position these people were in they just didn t know anything they didn t know if they knew who they were i love that over years that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past of monster to see what movie was about which was paranoia carpenter summarised now i do know in end who thing is but i cannot tell you legacy critical reassessment in years following its release critics and fans have reevaluated thing as a milestone of horror genre a prescient

filmography he lamented that it took a long time for thing to find a wider audience saying if thing had been a hit my career would have been different i wouldn t have had to make choices that i made but i needed a job i m not saying i hate movies i did i loved making christine 1983 and starman 1984 and big trouble in little china 1986 all those films but my career would have been different
