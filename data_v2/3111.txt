school s second best sportsman behind only c b fry during his final year at repton he had a batting average of over 29 and took 56 wickets at an average of under 13 some of palairet s early success

of these games and on his first appearance scored a century against leicestershire somerset s achievements led to their admission to first class cricket for 1891 oxford s batting was described by oxford cricket historian geoffrey bolton as unreliable during 1891 palairet s second year at university palairet s batting average of 15 78 placed him fifth amongst his peers and he once again struggled in university match scoring two and eleven bolton 1962 pp 136 139 although he generally batted as part of middle order for oxford he invariably opened innings for somerset alongside his captain herbie hewett in this role he thrived for somerset his average for county in ten matches was 31 11 placing him among top ten batsmen in county championship he scored his debut century in first

wickets in each innings against lancashire a match in which he also scored a half century he recorded best bowling figures of his first class career in return match against lancashire taking six

century against nottinghamshire making 119 runs before being out leg before wicket to his old trainer attewell he fell just short of 1 000 first class runs in 1894 though two half centuries scored

gilbert jessop wisden match report indicates that dropping fry was a necessary decision but that hirst and jessop should both have played green 1980 pp 29 32 in a history of cricket altham is more direct in claiming that palairet should not have been chosen selectors it is now agreed made a questionable choice in preferring lionel palairet to an all rounder such as hirst altham swanton 1938 p 245 on his test debut palairet opened batting and scored six runs in first innings one of five victims to fall to jack saunders and hugh trumble in first 45 minutes of england s innings in second

his place with hirst and jessop restored to side green 1980 pp 32 35 australians batted throughout first day for a total of 324 runs overnight rain then made batting difficult and england totalled 183

between then and first world war club never finished higher than tenth in county championship foot 1986 p 218 palairet missed most of cricket in 1905 and 1906 to concentrate on his work as a land agent for earl of devon he played three times in 1905 against touring australians kent and warwickshire while in 1906 he played one match against yorkshire at end of 1906 woods who had captained somerset since 1894 retired despite his limited appearances over previous couple of years palairet was appointed as woods replacement for 1907 foot 1986 pp 82 84 during 1907 season palairet played in all of somerset s county championship matches and also appeared for county against touring south african side club struggled to find eleven eligible players for some of their matches and at one stage were forced to recall ted tyler to side tyler had not played for somerset for four years and had only played five matches since 1900 palairet himself had a disappointing year his batting average of 21 33 was lowest in any season in which he played ten or more matches he passed 50 in an innings on only three occasions one of these being 116 runs against kent at tonbridge final century of his first class career at end of season in which somerset finished fourteenth of sixteen teams in county championship palairet resigned captaincy at club s annual general meeting in an uncharacteristic outburst

one run in first innings and three in second palairet invariably wore a harlequins cricket cap during matches foot 1986 p 37 and was considered aloof by his colleagues roebuck 1991 p 48 in his complete first class career he scored 15 777 runs at an average of 33 63 including 27 centuries and took 143 wickets at a bowling average of 33 91 style and technique thumb right palairet s cover drive was featured in jubilee book of cricket alt a black and white picture of lionel palairet demonstrating a batting stroke often considered by commentators to be benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive graceful batting palairet won many plaudits for his style in his book jubilee book of cricket ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of palairet playing his shots and describes his methods in places using them as model which young players should adopt ranjitsinhji 1897 pp 53 151 157 185 301 he played predominantly off front foot and tended to be less effective on soft pitches he favoured shots on off side particularly off drive and cover drive during palairet s career bowlers favoured a tactic known as off theory of bowling ball just outside off stump strength of palairet s off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic fry suggests that early practice that palairet gained against attewell and martin who bowled accurately at stumps was a key factor in limiting his range of leg side shots he favoured lofted shots which were often compared to golf strokes for a time early in his career he attempted to play more powerfully but then returned to his forward style despite this he remained capable of hitting ball out of county ground in taunton and into river tone at one end or churchyard at other although considered a stylish batsman palairet was described by foot as having minimum of extrovert flourish and no quaint mannerisms both factors he considered relevant in palairet s limited test appearances throughout his career palairet shunned improvisation and played well established orthodox cricket shots he remained absolutely still at crease while preparing to play a shot a feature later seen in viv richards batting foot 1986 p 38 personal life palairet married caroline mabel laverton daughter of william henry laverton a prominent cricket patron in wiltshire in 1894 pair had two children evelyn mabel hamilton born in 1895 and henry edward hamilton following year palairet s brother richard played first class cricket for somerset between 1891 and 1902 albeit without as much success as lionel in addition to cricket palairet maintained an interest in a range of other sports a 1901 profile of him in baily s magazine records that foxhunting was his primary sporting interest after his retirement from cricket palairet became a prominent golfer in south west he was first chairman of devon county golf union upon its formation in 1911 captained devon at golf either side of
