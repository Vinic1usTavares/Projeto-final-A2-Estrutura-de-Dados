anne boleyn pronunciations with stress on second syllable were rare until recently and were not mentioned by reference works until 1960s see big book of beastly 2006 by charles harrington daniel everyman s english pronouncing dictionary 12th edition 1963 entry boleyn 1501 19 may 1536 was queen of england from 1533 to 1536 as second wife of king henry viii their marriage and her execution by beheading made her a key figure in political and religious upheaval that was start of english reformation anne was daughter of thomas boleyn 1st earl of wiltshire and his wife lady elizabeth howard and was educated in netherlands and france largely as a maid of honour to queen claude of france anne returned to england in early 1522 to marry her irish cousin james butler 9th earl of ormond marriage plans were broken off and instead she secured a post at court as maid of honour to henry viii s wife catherine of aragon early in 1523 anne was secretly betrothed to henry percy son of henry percy 5th earl of northumberland but betrothal was broken off when earl refused to support their engagement cardinal wolsey refused match in january 1524 and anne was sent back home to hever castle in february or march 1526 henry viii began his pursuit of anne she resisted his attempts to seduce her refusing to become his mistress which her sister mary had been it soon became one absorbing object of henry s desires to annul his marriage to catherine so he would be free to marry anne when it became clear that pope clement vii would not annul marriage breaking of catholic church s power in england began in 1532 henry granted anne marquessate of pembroke henry and anne formally married on 25 january 1533 after a secret wedding on 14 november 1532 on 23 may 1533 newly appointed archbishop of canterbury thomas cranmer declared henry and catherine s marriage null and void five days later he declared henry and anne s marriage valid shortly afterwards pope decreed sentences of excommunication against henry and cranmer as a result of this marriage and these excommunications first break between church of england and rome took place and church of england was brought under king s control anne was crowned queen of england on 1 june 1533 on 7 september she gave birth to future queen elizabeth i henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love elizabeth anne subsequently had three miscarriages and by march 1536 henry was courting jane seymour in order to marry seymour henry had to find reasons to end marriage to anne henry viii had anne investigated for high treason in april 1536 on 2 may she was arrested and sent to tower of london where she was tried before a jury of peers which included henry percy her former betrothed and her own uncle thomas howard 3rd duke of norfolk and found guilty on 15 may she was beheaded four days later modern historians view charges against her which included adultery incest and plotting to kill king as unconvincing some say that anne was accused of witchcraft but indictments make no mention of this charge after coronation of her daughter elizabeth anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of english reformation particularly through works of john foxe over centuries she has inspired or been mentioned in many artistic and cultural works and thereby retained her hold on popular imagination she has been called most influential and important queen consort england has ever had ives p xv as she provided occasion for henry viii to annul his marriage to catherine of aragon and declare english church s independence from rome early years anne was daughter of thomas boleyn later earl of wiltshire and earl of ormond and his wife lady elizabeth howard daughter of thomas howard 2nd duke of norfolk thomas boleyn was a well respected diplomat with a gift for languages he was also a favourite of henry vii of england who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad anne and her siblings grew up at hever castle in kent however siblings were born in norfolk at boleyn home at blickling a lack of parish records from period has made it impossible to establish anne s date of birth contemporary evidence is contradictory with several dates having been put forward by various historians an italian writing in 1600 suggested that she had been born in 1499 while sir thomas more s son in law william roper indicated a much later date of 1512 her birth is widely accepted by scholars and historians as being most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507 as with anne herself it is uncertain when her two siblings were born but it seems clear that her sister mary was older than anne mary s children clearly believed their mother had been elder sister argument that mary might have been younger sister is refuted by firm evidence from reign of queen elizabeth i that surviving boleyns knew mary had been born before anne not after see ives pp 16 17 and fraser p 119 mary s grandson claimed ormonde title in 1596 on basis she was elder daughter which elizabeth i accepted ives pp 16 p 119 their brother george was born around 1504 warnicke p p 15 thumb upright anne s sister mary boleyn academic debate about anne s birth date focuses on two key dates 1501 and 1507 eric ives a british historian and legal expert advocates 1501 date while retha warnicke an american scholar who has also written a biography of anne prefers 1507 key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter anne wrote sometime in 1514 she wrote it in french to her father who was still living in england while anne was completing her education at mechelen in burgundian netherlands now belgium ives argues that style of letter and its mature handwriting prove that anne must have been about thirteen at time of its composition while warnicke argues that numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that letter was written by a child in ives view this would also be around minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour as anne was to regent margaret of austria this is supported by claims of a chronicler from late 16th century who wrote that anne was twenty when she returned from france ives pp 18 20 these findings are contested by warnicke in several books and articles and evidence does not conclusively support either date date 1507 was accepted in roman catholic circles 16th century author william camden inscribed a date of birth of 1507 in margin of his miscellany date was generally favoured until late nineteenth century in 1880s paul friedmann suggested a birth date of 1503 art historian hugh paget in 1981 first placed anne boleyn at court of margaret of austria see eric ives s biography life and death of anne boleyn for most extensive arguments favoring 1500 1501 and retha warnicke s rise and fall of anne boleyn for her proposal of a birth year of 1507 there are two independent contemporary sources for 1507 date author gareth russell wrote a summary of evidence and relates that jane dormer duchess of feria wrote her memoirs shortly before her death in 1612 former lady in waiting and confidante to queen mary i wrote of anne boleyn she was convicted and condemned and was not yet twenty nine years of age william camden wrote a history of reign of queen elizabeth i and was granted access to private papers of lord burghley and to state archives in that history in chapter dealing with elizabeth s early life he records in margin that anne was born in 1507 anne s great great great grandparents included a lord mayor of london a duke an earl two aristocratic ladies and a knight one of them geoffrey boleyn had been a mercer and wool merchant before becoming lord mayor ives p 3 fraser pp 116 17 boleyn family originally came from blickling in norfolk north of norwich at time of anne s birth boleyn family was considered one of most respected in english aristocracy among her relatives she numbered howards one of preeminent families in land and one of her ancestors included king edward i of england according to eric ives she was certainly of more noble birth than jane seymour catherine howard and catherine parr henry viii s three other english wives ives p 4 she was better born than henry viii s three other english wives spelling of boleyn name was variable as common at time sometimes it was written as bullen hence bull heads which formed part of her family arms fraser p 115 at court of margaret of austria in netherlands anne is listed as boullan from there she signed letter to her father as anna de boullan ives plate 14 she is also referred to as anna this latinised form is used in most portraits of her anne s early education was typical for women of her class in 1513 anne was invited to join schoolroom of margaret of austria and her four wards her academic education was limited to arithmetic her family genealogy grammar history reading spelling and writing she developed domestic skills such as dancing embroidery good manners household management music needlework and singing anne learned to play games such as cards chess and dice she was also taught archery falconry horseback riding and hunting wilkinson p 12 netherlands and france thumb upright claude of france wife of francis i anne served as her maid of honour for nearly seven years anne s father continued his diplomatic career under henry viii in europe thomas boleyn s charm won many admirers including margaret of austria daughter of maximilian i holy roman emperor during this period margaret ruled netherlands on her nephew charles s behalf and was so impressed with boleyn that she offered his daughter anne a place in her household ordinarily a girl had to be twelve years old to have such an honour but anne may have been younger as archduchess affectionately referred to her as la petite fraser and ives argue that this appointment proves anne was probably born in 1501 but warnicke disagrees partly on evidence of anne s being described as petite see ives p 19 warnicke pp 12 3 anne made a good impression in netherlands with her manners and studiousness margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age warnicke p 12 and told sir thomas boleyn that his daughter was so presentable and so pleasant considering her youthful age that i am more beholden to you for sending her to me than you to me e w ives op cit anne stayed with margaret from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend henry viii s sister mary who was about to marry louis xii of france in october 1514 in

completed her study of french and developed interests in art fashion illuminated manuscripts literature music poetry and religious philosophy she also acquired knowledge of french culture dance etiquette literature music and poetry and came to gain experience in flirtation and game of courtly love starkey p 263 though all knowledge about anne s experiences in french court are conjecture even eric ives in his latest edition of biography conjectures that she was likely to have made acquaintance of king francis i s sister marguerite de navarre a patron of humanists and reformers marguerite de navarre was also an author in her own right and her works include elements of christian mysticism and reform that verged on heresy though she was protected by her status as french king s beloved sister she or her circle may have encouraged anne s interest in reform as well as in poetry and literature anne s education in france proved itself in later years inspiring many new trends among ladies and courtiers of england and it may have been instrumental in pressing their king toward culture shattering contretemps with papacy itself eric ives s latest version of his biography hypotheses that anne may have had evangelistic conviction and a strong spiritual inner life william forrest author of a contemporary poem about catherine of aragon complimented anne s passing excellent skill as a dancer here he wrote was a fresh young damsel that could trip and go fraser p 115 thumb left upright anne boleyn by hans holbein younger anne had been of average height and she had a slender build

tongue and a terrible temper weir p 47 anne exerted a powerful charm on those who met her though opinions differed on her attractiveness venetian diarist marino sanuto who saw anne when henry viii met francis i at calais in october 1532 described her as not one of handsomest women in world she is of middling stature complexion long neck wide mouth bosom not much raised eyes which are black and beautiful strong p 6 simon wrote to martin bucer in september 1531 that anne was young good looking of a rather dark complexion lancelot de carle called her beautiful with an elegant figure and a

polemicist nicholas sanders in 1586 half a century after anne s death anne boleyn was rather tall of stature with black hair and an oval face of a sallow complexion as if troubled with jaundice it is said she had a projecting tooth under upper lip and on her right hand six fingers there was a large wen under her chin and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat she was handsome to look at with a pretty mouth strong 6 ives 39 sanders held anne responsible for henry viii s rejection of catholic church and writing fifty years after her death was keen to demonise her sanders s description contributed to what biographer eric ives calls monster legend of anne boleyn ives p 39 though his details were fictitious they have formed basis for references to anne s appearance even in some modern textbooks warnicke p 247 anne s experience in france made her a devout christian in new tradition of renaissance humanism anne knew little latin and trained at a french court she was influenced by an evangelical variety of french humanism which led her to champion vernacular bible dowling 1991 p 39 while she would later hold reformist position that papacy was a

pleasant singing voice played lute and several other musical instruments well and spoke french fluently a remarkable intelligent quick witted young noblewoman that first drew people into conversation

to cavendish anne was sent from court to her family s countryside estates but it is not known for how long upon her return to court she again entered service of catherine of aragon percy was married to lady mary talbot to whom he had been betrothed since adolescence prior to her marriage to henry viii anne had befriended sir thomas wyatt who was one of greatest poets of tudor reign in 1520 wyatt married elizabeth cobham who by many accounts was not a wife of his choosing 6e k chambers sir thomas wyatt and some collected studies london 1933 p 138 richard thus in 1525 wyatt charged his wife with adultery and separated from her coincidentally historians believe that it was also year where his interest in anne intensified in 1532 wyatt accompanied royal couple to calais in france in 1526 henry viii became enamoured with anne and began his pursuit scarisbrick p 154 anne was a skillful player at game of courtly love which was often played in antechambers this may have been how she caught eye of henry who was also an experienced player some say that anne resisted king s attempts to seduce her refusing to become his mistress often leaving court for seclusion of hever castle but within a year he proposed marriage to her and she accepted both assumed an annulment could be obtained within a matter of months there is no evidence to suggest that they engaged in a sexual relationship until very shortly before their marriage henry s love letters to anne suggest that their love affair remained unconsummated for much of their seven year courtship henry s annulment it is probable that idea of annulment not divorce as commonly assumed had suggested itself to henry much earlier than this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure tudor claim to crown before henry s father henry vii ascended throne england was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to crown and henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over succession he and catherine had no living sons all catherine s children except mary died in infancy lacey p 70 catherine of aragon had first come to england to be bride to henry s brother arthur who died soon after their marriage since spain and england still wanted an alliance a dispensation was granted by pope julius ii on grounds that catherine was still a virgin marriage of catherine and henry took place in 1509 but eventually he became dubious about its validity due to catherine s inability to provide an heir being seen as a sign of god s displeasure his feelings for anne and her refusals to become his mistress probably contributed to henry s decision that no pope had a right to overrule bible this meant that he had been living in sin with catherine of aragon all these years though catherine hotly contested this and refused to concede that her marriage to arthur had been consummated it also meant that his daughter mary was a bastard and that new pope clement vii would have to admit previous pope s mistake and annul marriage henry s quest for an annulment became euphemistically known as king s great matter fraser p 133 anne saw an opportunity in henry s infatuation and convenient moral quandary she determined that she would yield to his embraces only as his acknowledged queen she began to take her place at his side in policy and in state but not yet in his bed graves p 132 scholars and historians hold various opinions as to how deep anne s commitment to reformation was how much she was perhaps only personally ambitious and how much she had to do with henry s defiance of papal power there is anecdotal evidence related to biographer george wyatt by her former lady in waiting anne fraser p 145 that anne brought to henry s attention a heretical pamphlet perhaps tyndale s obedience of a christian man or one by simon fish called supplication for beggars which cried out to monarchs to rein in evil excesses of catholic church she was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of church and actively protected scholars working on english translations of scriptures according to maria dowling anne tried to educate her waiting women in scriptural piety and is believed to have reproved her cousin mary shelton for having idle written in her prayer book dowling 1986 232 if cavendish is to be believed anne s outrage at wolsey may have personalised whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from france further most recent edition of ives s biography admits that anne may very well have had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth which spurred her on not just as catalyst but for henry s reformation though process took a number of years in 1528 sweating sickness broke out with great severity in london mortality rate was great and court was dispersed henry left london frequently changing his residence anne boleyn retreated to boleyn residence at hever castle but contracted illness her brother in law william carey died henry sent his own physician to hever castle to care for anne starkey p 331 and shortly afterwards she recovered it soon became one absorbing object of henry s desires to secure an annulment from catherine brigden p 114 henry had set his hopes upon a direct appeal to holy see acting independently of cardinal wolsey to whom he at first communicated nothing of his plans related to anne in 1527 william knight king s secretary was sent to pope clement vii to sue for annulment of his marriage to catherine on grounds that dispensing bull of pope julius ii permitting him to marry his brother s widow catherine had been obtained under false pretences henry also petitioned in event of his becoming free a dispensation to contract a new marriage with any woman even in first degree of affinity whether affinity was contracted by lawful or unlawful connection this clearly referred to anne starkey p 301 thumb left upright catherine of aragon henry s first wife and queen as pope was at that time prisoner of charles v holy roman

an ecclesiastical court in england with a special emissary lorenzo from pope himself to decide matter but pope never had empowered his deputy to make any decision pope was still a veritable hostage of charles v and charles v was loyal to his aunt catherine morris p 166 pope forbade henry to contract a new marriage until a decision was reached in rome not in england convinced that wolsey s loyalties lay with pope not england anne as well as wolsey s many enemies ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529 george cavendish wolsey s chamberlain records that servants who waited on king and anne

magnificent court she spent lavish amounts of money on gowns jewels head dresses ostrich feather fans riding equipment furniture and upholstery maintaining ostentatious display required by her status numerous palaces were renovated to suit her and henry s extravagant tastes ives pp 231 260 her motto was most happy and she had chosen a white falcon as her personal device anne was blamed for tyranny of her husband s government and was referred to by some of her subjects as king s whore or a naughty prostitute farquhar michael 2001 a treasure of royal scandals p 67 penguin books new york public opinion turned further against her following her failure to produce a son it sank even lower after executions of her enemies sir thomas more and bishop john fisher williams pp 137 138 downfall and execution 1536 thumb upright jane seymour became henry s third wife shortly after anne s execution on 8 january 1536 news of catherine of aragon s death reached king and anne who were overjoyed following day henry and anne wore yellow symbol of joy and celebration in england from head to toe and celebrated catherine s death with festivities starkey pp 549 51 scarisbrick p 436 in spain home country of catherine of aragon yellow was colour of mourning in addition to black e cobham brewer 1810 1897 dictionary of phrase and fable 1898 for this reason wearing of yellow by henry and anne may have been a symbol of mourning with mary s mother dead anne attempted to make peace with her starkey p 551 mary rebuffed anne s overtures perhaps because of rumours circulating that catherine had been poisoned by anne or henry these began after discovery during her embalming that catherine s heart was blackened modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not result of poisoning but of cancer of heart an extremely rare condition which was not understood at time queen pregnant again was aware of dangers if she failed to give birth to a son with catherine dead henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality at this time henry began paying court to jane seymour he gave her a locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and jane in presence of anne began opening and shutting it anne responded by ripping off locket with such force her fingers bled six wives of henry viii later that month king was unhorsed in a tournament and knocked unconscious for two hours a worrying incident that anne believed led to her miscarriage five days later scarisbrick p 452 another possible cause of miscarriage was an incident in which upon entering a room anne saw jane seymour sitting on henry s lap and flew into a rage whatever cause on day that catherine of aragon was buried at peterborough abbey anne miscarried a baby which according to imperial ambassador eustace chapuys she had borne for about three and a half months and which seemed to be a male child scarisbrick pp 452 53 starkey pp 552 53 chapuys commented she has miscarried of her saviour allison weir six wives of henry viii in chapuys opinion this loss was beginning of end of royal marriage starkey pp 553 54 given henry s desperate desire for a son sequence of anne s pregnancies has attracted much interest author mike ashley speculated that anne had two stillborn children after elizabeth s birth and before male child she miscarried in 1536 ashley p 240 most sources attest only to birth of elizabeth in september 1533 a possible miscarriage in summer of 1534 and miscarriage of a male child of almost four months gestation in january 1536 williams chapter 4 as anne recovered from her miscarriage henry declared that he had been seduced into marriage by means of a french term indicating either deception or spells his new mistress jane seymour was quickly moved into royal quarters this was followed by anne s brother george being refused a prestigious court honour order of garter given instead to sir nicholas carew williams p 142 charges of adultery incest and treason thumb right upright thomas cromwell anne s one time strong ally with whom she clashed over foreign policy and redistribution of church wealth portrait by hans holbein younger c 1532 anne s biographer eric ives and most other historians believe that her fall and execution were primarily engineered by her former ally thomas cromwell ives pp 319 329 see also starkey pp 559 569 and elton pp 252 53 who share this view conversations between chapuys and cromwell thereafter indicate cromwell as instigator of plot to remove anne evidence of this is seen in spanish chronicle and through letters written from chapuys to charles v anne argued with cromwell over redistribution of church revenues and over foreign policy she advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions and she favoured a french alliance cromwell insisted on filling king s depleted coffers while taking a cut for himself and preferred an imperial alliance ives pp 309 16 for these reasons ives suggests anne boleyn had become a major threat to thomas cromwell ives p 315 cromwell s biographer john schofield on other hand contends that no power struggle existed between anne and cromwell and that not a trace can be found of a cromwellian conspiracy against anne cromwell became involved in royal marital drama only when henry ordered him onto case schofield pp 106 108 schofield claims that evidence for power struggle between anne and cromwell which now dominates many modern accounts of anne s last weeks comprises fly by night stories from and spanish chronicle words of chapuys taken out of context and an untrustworthy translation of calendar of state papers cromwell did not manufacture accusations of adultery though he and other officials used them to bolster henry s case against anne warnicke pp 212 242 wooding p 194 historian retha warnicke questions whether cromwell could have or wished to manipulate king in such a matter such a bold attempt by cromwell given limited evidence could have risked his office even his life warnicke pp 210 212 warnicke observes neither chapuys nor modern historians have explained why if secretary cromwell could manipulate henry into agreeing to execution of anne he could not simply persuade king to ignore her advice on foreign policy henry himself issued crucial instructions his officials including cromwell carried them out clearly he was bent on undoing her by any means scarisbrick p 455 result historians agree was by more modern standards a legal travesty wooding pp 194 95 scarisbrick pp 454 55 fraser p 245 however modern lawyers have concluded that rules of time were not bent in order to assure anne boleyn s conviction there was no need to tamper with rules that guaranteed desired result since law at time like armies was an engine of state not a mechanism for justice towards end of april a flemish musician in anne s service named mark smeaton was arrested he initially denied being queen s lover but later confessed perhaps tortured or promised freedom another courtier henry norris was arrested on may day but being an aristocrat could not be tortured prior to his arrest norris was treated kindly by king who offered him his own horse to use on may day festivities it seems likely that during festivities king was notified of smeaton s confession and it was shortly thereafter alleged conspirators were arrested upon his orders norris denied his guilt and swore that queen anne was innocent one of most damaging pieces of evidence against norris was an overheard conversation with anne at end of april where she accused him of coming often to her chambers not to pay court to her lady in waiting madge shelton but to herself sir francis weston was arrested two days later on same charge as was william brereton a groom of king s privy chamber sir thomas wyatt a poet and friend of boleyns who was allegedly infatuated with her before her marriage to king was also imprisoned for same charge but later released most likely due to his or his family s friendship with cromwell sir richard page was also accused of having a sexual relationship with queen but he was acquitted of all charges after further investigation could not implicate him with anne final accused was queen anne s own brother george boleyn arrested on charges of incest and treason williams pp 143 144 he was accused of two incidents of incest november 1535 at whitehall and following month at eltham ives p 344 on 2 may 1536 anne was arrested and taken to tower of london by barge it is likely that anne may have entered through court gate in tower rather than traitors gate according to historian and author of life and death of anne boleyn eric ives in tower she collapsed demanding to know location of her father and broder as well as charges against her in what is reputed to be her last letter to henry dated 6 may she wrote four of accused men were tried in westminster on 12 may 1536 weston brereton and norris publicly maintained their innocence and only tortured smeaton supported crown by pleading guilty three days later anne and george boleyn were tried separately in tower of london before a jury of 27 peers she was accused of adultery incest and high treason hibbert pp 54 55 by treason act of edward iii adultery on part of a queen was a form of treason because of implications for succession to throne for which penalty was hanging drawing and quartering for a man and burning alive for a woman but accusations and especially that of incestuous adultery were also designed to impugn her moral character other form of treason alleged against her was that of plotting king s death with her lovers so that she might later marry henry norris henry percy 6th earl of northumberland sat on jury that unanimously found anne guilty when verdict was announced he collapsed and had to be carried from courtroom he died childless eight months later and was succeeded by his nephew on 14 may cranmer

was unconvincing accused were found guilty and condemned to death george boleyn and other accused men were executed on 17 may 1536 william kingston constable of tower reported anne seemed very happy and ready to be done with life henry commuted anne s sentence from burning to beheading and rather than have a queen beheaded with common axe he brought an expert swordsman from saint omer in france to perform execution on morning of 19 may kingston wrote her impending death may have caused her great sorrow for some time during her imprisonment poem oh death rock me asleep is generally believed to have been authored by anne and reveals that she may have hoped death would end her suffering o death rocke me asleep sources differ whether george or anne wrote it o death rock me asleep though consensus is that anne did so o death rock me asleep shortly before dawn she called kingston to hear mass with her and swore in his presence on eternal salvation of her soul upon holy sacraments that she had never been unfaithful to king she ritually repeated this oath both immediately before and after receiving sacrament of eucharist ives p356 on morning of friday 19 may anne was executed within tower precincts not upon site of execution memorial but rather according to historian eric ives on a scaffold erected on north side of white tower in front of what is now waterloo barracks ives p 423 based on contemporary lisle letters she wore a red petticoat under a loose dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur and a mantle of ermine williams p 146 accompanied by two female attendants anne made her final walk from queen s house to scaffold and she showed a devilish spirit fraser p 256 and looked as gay as if she was not going to die fraser p 256 anne climbed scaffold and made a short speech to crowd this version of her speech is found in foxe s actes and monuments and an almost identical version in ives 2005 in a 1 318 line poem written in french two weeks after anne s death lancelot de carle provides a moving account of her last words and their effect on crowd lancelot de carle a secretary to french ambassador antoine de castelnau was in london in may 1536 and was an eyewitness to her trial and execution john guy contends that crispin de who was an eyewitness to anne boleyn s trial and execution and lancelot de carle have been shown by french scholars to be same person poem

been queen of england on earth will today become a queen in heaven macculloch p 159 when charges were first brought against anne cranmer had expressed his astonishment to henry and his belief that she should not be culpable still cranmer felt vulnerable because of his closeness to queen and so on night before execution he declared henry s marriage to anne to have been void like catherine s before her he made no serious attempt to save anne s life although some sources record that he had prepared her for death by hearing her last private confession of sins in which she had stated her innocence

marguerite of angouleme who was a well known figure during renaissance and held strong religious views that she portrayed through poetry these women along with anne s immediate family members such as
