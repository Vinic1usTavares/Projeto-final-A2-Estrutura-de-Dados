restrictions digital rights management ipad does not employ digital rights management drm but os prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of apple s platform without authorization such as tv shows movies and apps also ipad s development model requires anyone creating an app for ipad to sign a non disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription critics argue apple s centralized app approval process and control of platform itself could stifle software innovation of particular concern to digital rights advocates is apple s ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any ipad at any time digital rights advocates including free software foundation electronic frontier foundation and computer engineer and activist brewster kahle have criticized ipad for its digital rights restrictions in april 2010 paul sweeting an analyst with gigaom was quoted by national public radio as saying with ipad you have anti internet in your hands it offers major media companies opportunity to essentially re create old business model wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content or a search engine discovering content for you but sweeting also thought that limitations imposed by apple impart feeling of a safe neighborhood saying apple is offering you a gated community where there s a guard at gate and there s probably maid service too laura article s author concludes as more consumers have fears about security on internet viruses and malware they may be happy to opt for apple s gated community russian government has switched from ipads to android devices over security concerns jailbreaking like certain ios devices ipad can be jailbroken depending on which version of ios it is running thus allowing applications and programs that are not authorized by apple to run on device once it is jailbroken users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through app
