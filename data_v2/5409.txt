s ballymun flats towers have since become associated with song though a lot of time was dedicated to lyrics music was improvised with co producer daniel lanois during a recording session for album group explored american music for joshua tree and as such running to stand still demonstrates folk rock and acoustic blues influences song was praised by critics many of them calling it one of record s best tracks it has since been included in regular set lists of four u2 concert tours in two different arrangements and with several possible thematic interpretations background running to stand still was written by u2 in context of heroin addiction epidemic in dublin of 1980s much like bad and to some extent wire had been from their 1984 album unforgettable fire bassist adam clayton has referred to song as bad part ii mccormick 2006 p 182 thin lizzy frontman phil lynott s decline and death from addiction also resonated with clayton at time thumb right 235px alt eleven storeys of a gray residential tower with a spiked fence and a lamp in foreground one of seven towers in ballymun flats until their 2014 album songs of innocence u2 had written relatively few songs directly related to their growing up in dublin often giving higher priority to works about troubles in northern ireland or to international concerns rafter 2001 pp 222 223 when they have written about dublin allusions to it have often been disguised cogan 2008 p 90 but running to stand still was one of those with specific dublin connections this lyric was a reference to ballymun flats a group of seven local authority high rise residential tower blocks built in ballymun neighborhood of dublin during 1960s paul hewson later known as u2 s lead vocalist bono had grown up on cedarwood road in adjacent glasnevin neighborhood in a house across fields behind towers near his friends and future artists hanvey later known as gavin friday and derek rowan later known as guggi flanagan 1995 pp 151 257 bono had played in towers foundations as they were being built then traveled in their elevators for novel experience over time poor maintenance lack of facilities for children transient tenancies and other factors caused social conditions and communal ties to break down in flats place began to stink of urine and vomit and glue and used needles were common sights as were appearances of garda siochana guggi later lived in towers during years that he was struggling personally with drugs it was through his exposure to people without hope in flats that bono began to develop his social consciousness bono may have used ballymun as inspiration without any explicit lyrical references to it for 1980 u2 song shadows and tall trees and later likened living in area to some of scenes portrayed in 1992 mike newell film into west driving by there in 1987 bono said see seven tall buildings there they re seven towers they have highest suicide rate in ireland after they discovered everywhere else in world that you don t put people living on top of each other we built them here writing and recording song s title phrase originated from bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going and brother responding it s like running to stand still bono had not heard phrase before and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction and effects of drug on body were like a writer later described title as a perfect distillation of dynamic of feeding on addiction bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts a man and a woman who lived in ballymun towers out of money and unable to pay rent due to their habit man became a heroin smuggler operating between dublin and amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday bono felt man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions as well as poor choices and bono wanted to illustrate how these poor conditions affected their lives resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly but instead emotional atmosphere that couple live in in doing so song is not judgmental and shows sympathy for woman a character monologue from wim wenders 1984 film paris texas was also a significant influence on bono s writing of song flanagan 1995 p 352 although lyrics of running to stand still were worked on a great deal musical composition was essentially improvised by band during recording process guitarist edge began playing some piano chords during a session for another song producer daniel lanois joined in on guitar and rest of group followed this initial improvised version incorporated all elements of final song structure and sound and feel of group playing in a room together without overdubs contributed to track s effectiveness hutchinson 2003 p 76 lou reed s walk on wild side and elton john s candle in wind both of which had served as end snippets for bad on unforgettable fire tour were loose inspirations influence of reed s works can be felt throughout song as can van morrison to an extent indeed in a published tribute following reed s 2013 death bono offered running to stand still as red handed proof of influence that reed and velvet underground had had upon u2 edge overdubbed song s slide acoustic guitar which was amplified through a blaster while working on guitar compositions in a lounge next to main studio of windmill lane studios lanois walked into room and impressed by sound of edge s playing wanted to record it on spot rather than in studio lanois brought edge headphones and plugged his guitar directly into microphone input of mixing console to record it producer said blaster was amplifying his slide guitar in a lovely way he had honed in on this sound and sort of altered eqs and controls so that it was pleasant to him composition and interpretation much of joshua tree showed band s fascination with american culture politics and musical forms and while lyrics of running to stand still were irish based musical arrangement for it began with touches of acoustic blues and country blues that represented an idiomatic stretch for group although producer brian eno was known for introducing european textural music into u2 s sound he also had a strong fondness for folk and gospel music indeed writers have seen echoes of bruce springsteen s stark acoustic 1982 album nebraska in song s sound running to stand still is a soft piano based ballad played in a key of d major at a tempo of 92 beats per minute see piano part and some of which are available in preview mode song follows a traditional verse chorus form in introduction and conclusion is a mournful slide acoustic guitar in eno and lanois production that rolling stone called both grim and dreamy most of piano part alternates between d and g chords an example of edge s longtime practice of composing around two chord progressions part gives song an elegiac feel jobling 2014 p 162 accompanying piano for much of song is lanois soft playing of a so called electric scrape guitar which he contributed to add texture soft echoing drums from larry mullen jr enter after second chorus a harmonica part from bono takes song to its faded conclusion bono s vocal range in song runs from a3 to d6 in song woman s addiction and misdirected desire for transcendence are reflected in lines such as she runs through streets with her eyes painted red and she will suffer needle chill bono s lyrics evoke helplessness and frustration in lines you ve got to cry without weeping talk without speaking scream without raising your voice title phrase is not used until last line of song this compositional technique relies upon delayed gratification and is heard in a few other popular songs such as cure s just like heaven and george michael s one more try edwards 2006 p 137 in liner notes to 20th anniversary reissue of joshua tree writer bill flanagan stated running to stand still is for anyone who feels trapped in an impossible circumstance by overwhelming responsibility uncut magazine writer andrew mueller noted that theme was effective in depicting drug as another bogus escape another fraudulent promise that there s ever any evading truth reception running to stand still earned critical praise upon joshua trees release which itself received very favourable reviews and went on to become group s best selling album rolling stone wrote after first few times through it you notice remarkable music it sounds like a lovely peaceful reverie except that this is a junkie s reverie and when that realization hits home gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power in

addiction joining likes of jefferson airplane s 1967 white rabbit neil young s 1972 needle and damage done martika s 1989 toy soldiers and third eye blind s 1997 semi charmed life mann 2005 p 98 irish music writer niall stokes considers running to stand still to be one of most important songs on joshua tree not only on its own merits as a mature and compelling haunting challenging piece of pop poetry but also because its moral ambiguity and lack of condemnation of its characters presaged chaotic direction band would take a few years later with achtung baby and zoo tv tour stokes 2005 p 70 rolling stones 2003 list of 500 greatest albums of all time which placed joshua tree at 26th said that while album is remembered for edge s trademark guitar sounds and group s spiritual quests running to stand still remains one of its most moving songs this latter sentiment was echoed by irish independent live performances throughout its live history running to stand still has nearly always

while bono sang song on b stage with a headset microphone bono mimed actions of a heroin addict rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during final lyric after which he would sing hallelujah over and over while reaching up into a pillar of white light brothers 1999 p 260 writer robyn brothers sees addition of hallelujah coda as indicating that while organized religion may act in role of a sedative a notion akin to other zoo tv themes role of personal faith may still have a desiring affirming and force at culmination of bullet blue sky to running to stand still sequence red

keyboards and bono on guitar during most of its performance on vertigo tour it once again followed bullet blue sky and culminated with a video clip of several articles of universal declaration of human rights being read after july 2005 it was replaced in that role and in set list by miss sarajevo during 19 june 2005 show on burmese democracy leader aung san suu kyi s birthday running to stand still included snippets of walk on a song originally written for her author steve stockman felt that in this tour s uses running to stand still was one of band s songs from 1980s that had lost its original meaning and was no longer about drug dealing in ballymun towers rather it was now being used to develop show s theme that a belief in faith and in human potential could overcome bleakest and most desperate situations in this it fit within vertigo tour s emphasis on coexistence and one campaign stockman 2005 pp 238 239 this assessment agreed to by an efestivals review and author john jobling has called new interpretation an anti persecution paean that was used to remove sting of bullet blue sky being used to criticize american behavior during iraq war jobling 2014 p 305 in contrast usa todays veteran rock writer edna gundersen found song s performance still established a devastating mood and new york daily news said that group thinned running to stand still to give it a new mourning two other u s reviewers remarked that song was lesser known to audiences with variety saying its inclusion helped band connect with past while avoiding cliche one tour performance of

create a self sustaining community of 30 000 people that would be more successful than original 1960s plan davenport 2008 pp 52 53 despite their failure as housing towers had left a long cultural legacy of which running to stand still was first and perhaps best known exemplar link between towers and song was mentioned in some tourist books about dublin former towers residents were not always happy with song lynn connolly whose 2006 memoir mun growing up in ballymun detailed her raising there in 1970s and 1980s readily acknowledged problems there and also wanted to get out at time connolly 2006 p 2 but she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at towers in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community which had been ignored by media she thus wrote regardless of what u2 say in their song running to stand still there was certainly more than one way out in a newspaper interview connolly suggested that song might have had a deleterious effect it doesn t take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person living alone in a flat in ballymun listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying she further noted that some websites erroneously state that bono grew up in ballymun itself and said perhaps it gave him a sort of street cred to associate himself with estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice safe respectable cedarwood road in glasnevin ballymun area was still so associated with running to stand still and drug problem of time that local backers of regeneration went to pains to point out recent progress a bono remark that it was dangerous to walk in ballymun at night found a good deal of publicity a fansite listing u2 related dublin area sights in 2004 mentioned ballymun s connection to song cautioning do not go here on foot this is a bad area u2 s official website noted that area was much changed now bono himself said he s very proud to come from ballymun area fansite subsequently modified its listing and said an on foot visit to ballymun was warranted see also list of covers of u2 songs running to stand still referencesfootnotesbibliography chapter 1
