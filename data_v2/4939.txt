peacock is a song by american singer katy perry taken from her third studio album teenage dream 2010 because song was filled with suggestive lyrics pertaining to male genitalia capitol records initially opposed idea of including it on her record similar to what happened with another song of hers i kissed a girl 2008 she refused to withdraw it from record peacock was panned by music critics and musically was compared to 1980s hit mickey by toni basil and gwen stefani s hollaback girl 2005 on march 26 2012 a remix version was released as promotional single on itunes despite not being released as a single song entered several music charts worldwide its least successful charting territory was united kingdom while it performed best in us topping billboard dance club songs chart for a week and has been certified platinum by riaa perry has performed peacock on several occasions including during her 2011 world tour california dreams tour when performing track singer usually wears colorful or glittery clothing production mikkel s eriksen tor erik hermansen and ester dean assisted perry in writing peacock for her third studio album teenage dream released in 2010 according to perry whole point of writing peacock was to play with words midway through recording album perry recalled saying to people she was working with look i ve got a lot of jewels but i really don t have crown i really don t have that full blown presentation so she then decided to get back into studio and work with stargate a production team co producing teenage dream during a late night session and made several more songs including firework and peacock originally singer s recording label capitol records was against inclusion of song as a track on teenage dream as they deemed peacock too controversial they were all a bit worried about word cock and it gave me deja vu because they did exact same thing with i kissed a girl perry stated unhappy with idea of making her music more family friendly she insisted on including songs label objected to they said we don t see it as a single we don t want it on album and i was like you guys are idiots when asked about peacock perry stated i m hoping it will be a gay pride anthem peacocks represent a lot of individuality it s not just like i wanna see your bulge and then she went on to clarify it does have word cock in it but art is also in fart it s all in how you look at it prior to release of teenage dream singer debuted peacock in early august 2010 when she performed it at mtv world stage in malaysia composition peacock is a dance pop song with an up tempo house music beat that lasts for three minutes and 51 seconds song is composed in key of d minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 138 beats per minute perry s vocal range spans over an octave from b3 to d5 lyrically track contains a double entendre with suggestive wording new york magazine writer willa paskin observed that perry did obvious with song s hook she used a common word for penis and made it mean penis paskin also wrote that peacock could perhaps be most outrageous example of an entirely obvious double entendre perry herself has considered it to be biggest innuendo in world during an interview with mtv news singer said that she is a fan of using puns and double entendres and often looks for ways to incorporate it into her material in song perry repeatedly asks to see their peacock if they are brave enough to do so its composition was compared to toni basil s cheerleader anthem mickey by many reviews as both songs are stomping jams bursting with double meanings leah greenblatt of entertainment weekly dubbed it a shamelessly silly revival of basil s 1980s hit rob sheffield from rolling stone noticed two songs shared a drum hook and thought of peacock as a sequel to gwen stefani s 2005 single hollaback girl critical reception track garnered generally negative reviews and criticism from critics who mostly criticized song s cock cock cock line greg kot from chicago tribune said that peacock adapting beat from basil s mickey into a suggestive metaphor barely qualifies as an off color joke let alone a song stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic found singer to have distinguished herself through desperate vulgarity erlewine concluded all this stylized provocation is exhausting and not just because there s so much of it none of it actually arousing it s tiring because at her heart perry is old fashioned and is invested in none of her aggressive teasing elysa gardner from usa today advised people who buy album to skip song in his negative review for album matthew cole of slant magazine found it difficult to think of a song more unrefined or more irritating than peacock he believed all reviews of teenage dream will discuss track which will be because it is potentially historic in its badness to point that once you ve heard it you too will have to describe it to other people just to convince yourself that it really exists spin magazine writer mikael wood remarked that song contains a double entendre that even a performer such as kesha could find crude writing in music website sputnikmusic rudy klapper said she would bet that peacock would never be seeing light of day primarily because it s a terrible song with a double entendre so blunt it would make ke ha blush klapper also said lyrics do not complement perry s writing skills washington post staff writer chris richards review of track was also negative talking about how hooks on teenage dream are catchy but quickly start to erode if listeners pay more attention to words he cited peacock as an example of this describing its chorus as an earworm of highest order he said some of lyrics are enough to make people clench their teeth chart performance despite not being released as a single peacock managed to chart in some territories song peaked at number fifty six on canadian hot 100 and performed similarly in czech
