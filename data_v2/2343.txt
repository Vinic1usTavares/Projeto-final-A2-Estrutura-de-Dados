board when events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality he panics and a fight breaks out between alex and his rival carter horton as a result several passengers are removed from plane including alex carter alex s best friend tod waggner carter s girlfriend terry chaney teacher valerie lewton and students billy hitchcock and clear rivers none of passengers except for clear believes alex about his vision until plane explodes on takeoff killing remaining passengers on board afterwards survivors are interrogated by two fbi agents who believe that alex had something to do with explosion thirty nine days later survivors attend a memorial service for victims that night a chain reaction causes tod to be strangled to death in his bath tub his death is deemed a suicide but alex does not believe that tod killed himself he and clear sneak into funeral home to see tod s body where they meet mortician william bludworth tony todd he tells them that they have cheated death s plan and death is now taking lives of those who were meant to die on plane next day alex and clear discuss what mortician said at a cafe although clear is skeptical alex believes that they can cheat death again if they look out for omens they encounter rest of survivors and when carter provokes alex terry breaks up with carter before storming off in anger and getting run over by a speeding bus after watching a news report on cause of explosion alex realizes that survivors are dying in order they were meant to die on plane he deduces that ms lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety thinking alex is up to no good ms lewton calls fbi agents who bring him in for questioning although alex is unable to convince agents of what is happening they decide to let him go nonetheless

march agent weine of robert and george waggner is directly named after universal horror film producer george waggner production development one thing we were all in agreement on from start is that we didn t want to do a slasher movie we didn t want a guy in a dark cloak or some kind of monster chasing after these kids that s been done again and again i became very excited when we decided to make world at large in service of death our antagonist everyday objects and occurrences then take on ominous proportions and it becomes less about whether or not our characters are going to die and more about how they will die and how they can delay their deaths entertainment value is in ride not in outcome and by placing premise of film on inevitability of death we play a certain philosophical note james wong on how he accepted directing and writing privileges for film original idea was written by jeffrey reddick as a spec script for x files in order to get a tv agent i was actually flying home to kentucky and i read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said don t take flight tomorrow i have a really bad feeling about it she switched flights and plane that she would have been on crashed said reddick i thought that s creepy what if she was supposed to die on that flight building on his idea reddick wrote script and got an agent but never submitted script to x files after a colleague at new line cinema suggested he write it as a feature film new line cinema bought jeffrey s treatment and hired him to write original draft of script which featured death as an unseen force after script was finished new line cinema submitted script to directors including writing partners james wong and glen morgan both writers were willing to make it into a film although they rewrote script to comply with their standards i believe that at one time or another we ve all experienced a sense of prescience we have a hunch a feeling and then that hunch proves true wong said we want to do for planes and air travel what jaws did for sharks and swimming morgan said main thing they wanted about death coming to get people is that you never saw a kind of a michael myers figure you never saw a killer and they liked that idea and they said okay go write it once we had a basic story i started cataloging strange coincidences in my own life for example i was in vancouver airport waiting for a flight when john denver came on over loudspeaker i remember saying to myself hey he just died in a plane crash that s a little weird we wrote that version of that experience into script producers craig perry and warren zide from zide perry productions helped with film s budget because both were similarly fascinated about idea of an invisible force executing its victims perry a fan of x files claimed that he responded to wong and morgan s work for one specific reason dread new line cinema accepted financing and distributing rights for film after reddick came to them personally casting thumb right a screenshot from film showing main cast from left to right kristen cloke as ms valerie lewton seann william scott as billy hitchcock kerr smith as carter horton amanda detmer as terry chaney ali larter as clear rivers devon sawa as alex browning and chad donella as tod waggner one of most important things we were looking for in casting was actors ability to play subtleties little things that a character doesn t say or do that create edge things that get under your skin and spook you morgan said about auditions alex browning last role cast went to canadian actor devon sawa who previously starred in 1999 film idle hands sawa said that when he read script on a plane he found himself peeking out window at engine every couple of minutes and he went down and met glen and jim and he thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas however morgan and wong were undecided about casting him for part so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works morgan was astounded by sawa s performance in idle hands and sawa was hired sawa described his role as in beginning alex was kinda loopy and cotter and you know probably not most popular guy in school i think he might have been a dork you know doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they re after two beautiful girls in school but there s no chance of that happening i guess after plane goes down his world completely changes devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible wong said he doesn t appear as if he s supremely self assured he s more of a regular kid who can take on complexities of role and become a hero perry was amazed by sawa s vulnerability in acting describing him as a very distinctive actor he s very loose and he s kind of a cut up when he s not on camera but moment camera s on i d never seen anybody to completely slide right through moment ali larter who starred in 1999 film varsity blues was cast as female lead clear rivers film shows how easy it is to turn on someone to blame someone when you re scared larter said it s also about trusting your intuitions and yourself she defined her part as that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself and had made a life within that she s an artist she lives by herself and she s kinda holding to her grip for what world has given her seann william scott famous for portraying steve in 1999 film american pie was hired as class clown billy hitchcock scott admired film and felt that it s as dark and eerie as any twilight zone he laughed at his role saying that he is lacking some social skills he doesn t have quite a few friends and he s like tag along scott was surprised when in script his character was written as fat writers eventually changed it for scott dawson s creek star kerr smith was cast as jock carter horton smith identified carter as your typical high school bully whose life depends on anger and mentioned fact that carter feared alex not having control of his own life kristen cloke morgan s wife was cast as teacher valerie lewton i have incredible respect for them said cloke jim s kind of director who knows exactly what he wants as an actor i can find a way to get there if i know specifically what i m going for and jim gives me that fact that he won t move on until he s got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment which allows me to experiment and try different things cloke described her part as strong and sassy in control after crash she comes unglued probably more than any of kids and it s a quick drastic change i had to understand psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that newcomers amanda detmer and chad e donella were cast as students terry chaney and tod waggner respectively when i first read script thing that struck me most was that characters were well written and relationships between them were strong and believable detmer said that s important because you have to care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them detmer defined terry as very put together and seems content to defer to carter to not make waves but stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her on other hand donella observed how similar his role was to himself i believe in fate i think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you re taken out earlier or later depending on game plan tony todd who played candyman in 1992 film candyman was cast as mortician william bludworth morgan initially wanted todd for role because he felt his deep voice would give film an eerie tone additional cast members included daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith as fbi agents agent weine and agent schreck brendan fehr christine chatelain and lisa marie caruk as students george waggner blake dreyer and christa marsh barbara tyson and robert wisden as barbara and ken browning alex parents and forbes angus as teacher larry murnau right thumb upright film mentioned john f kennedy international airport was location of flight 180 explosion but crew actually used vancouver international airport above for film filming with final destination cast filming took place on long island for plane scene and vancouver island for additional scenes cast members were filming other projects during production so filming schedules had to be moved repeatedly for all of cast to appear sawa restrained his appearance in guilty during production and even commented that he had to share a trailer with bill pullman because it was bigger and would make him look more famous smith who was a regular in dawson s creek had to hold episodes for film according to detmer her death scene being rammed by a speeding bus was filmed first because it was easy but much anticipated all death scenes were filmed using lifecasts of actual actors death scenes memorial forest scene and scenes in paris were all filmed in victoria additional scenes were filmed in toronto and san francisco for airport crew used vancouver international airport as a stand in for john f kennedy international airport airport mentioned in film effects plan behind scenes was to create an intriguing visual signature to serve subtleties of script and to help personify death production designer john willet developed concept of skewing sets what i ve tried to do with sets themselves with their design and with various color choices is to make things just a little unnatural willet explained nothing that calls attention to itself but instead creates a sense of uneasiness unsettling feeling that something s not quite right to achieve this mystique willet designed two versions of virtually every set one version was used before crash and other sets were used for scenes after jet explodes on skewed sets i force perspective either vertically or horizontally willet explained nothing is square and although you can t put your finger on it it just makes you feel like something is not right skewing was also part of overall design for color palette used in set decoration and costume design in real world colors are bright and rich willet said in skewed world they re washed out and faded nothing is obvious and it s only in overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic plane scene during which passengers die in mid air was created inside a very large sound stage three ton hydraulic gimbal was operated automatically we spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45 000 pounds and holds 89 people special effects supervisor terry sonderhoff explained used for filming on board sequences it could be shifted on gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side to side and 60 degrees front to back realistically conveying horror of airborne engine failure sawa said that screams of cast inside gimbal made it appear more real wong said you walk into studio and there s a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think what have i done i was afraid we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting a miniature model of boeing 747 airplane was created for explosion scene model one of most detailed miniature scenes in film was about 10 feet long and 7 feet wide and landing gear was made from all machined metals according to visual effects supervisor ariel velasco shaw miniature had to be launched about 40 feet up into air to make it look like a real boeing 747 exploded into a fireball if blowing up a four foot plane explosion must be a minimum of eight feet in air to film explosion in detail crew used three cameras running 120 frames per second and one camera running 300 frames per second if they had filmed using a real time camera succession of explosion would not be filmed in a particular order train scene in which carter s car is smashed by train was one of most difficult scenes to shoot car used for crash was a replica of original severed in half prior to filming according to sonderhoff in order to ensure safety of actors they had to make sure that there was no real sheet metal in car for death scenes crew used several lifecasts of actors and chocolate syrup for fake blood creating rube goldberg effect for ms lewton s death scene was most difficult to plan according to crew perry said that it was very hard to generate an atmosphere of dread to create suspense out of scenes that are common music soundtrack no official album accompanied motion picture however six songs are featured in film most prominent of which is rocky mountain high by john denver which is heavily highlighted throughout film reminding survivors that denver died in a plane crash song is heard either before an accident or a character s demise and is also played by a street performer alessandro juliani in french other songs featured in film include hundred grand by pete atherton during flight 180 memorial scene into void by nine inch nails during cafe scene all candles in world by jane siberry during carter s car scene as well as and when i die performed by joe 90 during end credits score final destination complete original motion picture score was released on march 17 2000 film s score was conducted by daytime emmy award winning composer shirley walker wong and morgan initially wanted walker to score film after having previously worked with her on their sci fi television series space above and beyond walker said morgan and wong are great believers in melody and having music for characters and situations they find themselves in of course atmosphere had to be there also especially for a film with as much suspense building as this film has score is mostly low key with exception of suspense and death scenes it was performed by a union orchestra obliging new line cinema to grant film its own score walker described her score as very theme driven conservative music that covers range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well defined melodies that evolve through storytelling main title piece used for opening credits was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at time what a treat for me to get to write a piece that calls you into movie and lets you know something bad is going to happen from get go walker said according to walker main title consumed most of her time due to its dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout score score was positively received by critics judge harold of dvd verdict wrote how sound effects dialogue and walker s wonderfully creepy and effective score are mixed together to form a very pleasing almost organic like whole mike long of dvd review said that shirley walker s eerie score comes across powerfully with a wide spatial integration derek germano of cinema laser wrote that walker s creepy musical score is really a winner and is one of things that will help to make final destination a minor genre classic
