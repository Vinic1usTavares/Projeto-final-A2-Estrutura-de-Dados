dramatic moment in one of novelle in boccaccio s decameron while hogarth had expected this work to be acclaimed as a masterpiece of dramatic painting work was met with criticism and ridicule in catalogue of exhibition of hogarth s works at tate gallery in 2007 criticism was described as some of most damning critical opprobrium artist ever suffered hallet p 212 analysis sigismunda mourning over heart of guiscardo illustrates a scene from first tale on day 4 of decameron a medieval collection of short stories novelle by italian author and poet giovanni boccaccio seated at an ornate wooden table wearing a pearl tiara and flowing silk is sigismunda called in boccaccio s original tale heroine of one of novelle pointon p 155 it is probable that hogarth modelled her on his wife jane she clasps a golden goblet containing heart of her murdered husband guiscardo guiscardo was a servant and page in court of sigismunda s father prince tancred of salerno ruggiero p 177 when sigismunda s father discovered that guiscardo and sigismunda had wed secretly he angrily ordered his men to murder low born guiscardo and had guiscardo s heart delivered to sigismunda in a golden cup despite having committed to die without shedding a tear she weeps as she realises her father has murdered her husband she adds poison to cup containing guiscardo s heart and commits suicide by drinking it hogarth claimed to have long been interested in story of sigismunda which had appeared in england in several versions by mid 18th century it had become popular after being translated in john dryden s 1699 volume of fables ancient and modern and adapted for english stage by james thomson in 1745 commissioning upright thumb richard grosvenor 1st earl grosvenor who commissioned painting in 1758 painting was one of hogarth s last works commissioned in 1758 by sir richard grosvenor james caulfeild 1st earl of charlemont had previously commissioned a painting from hogarth allowing hogarth to select subject and price for lord charlemont hogarth chose to paint satirical piquet or virtue in danger also known as lady s last stake after a 1708 play by colley cibber which with echoes of marriage a la mode shows an army officer offering an aristocratic lady a chance to recover fortune she has just lost by gambling with implication that if she loses again she will have to take him as her lover after grosvenor saw this painting in hogarth s studio in 1758 he asked hogarth to paint a picture for him as well under same terms hogarth chose a more serious topic for grosvenor s painting he is said to have painted sigismunda mourning over heart of guiscardo with aim of proving that he could equal works of old italian masters and intending painting to be one of his masterpieces in leg of table in painting a pug nosed figure is carved emerging from ornate decoration which is reminiscent of hogarth s self portrait artist painting comic muse from around 1757 and is perhaps hogarth s attempt to insert himself bodily into picture thereby making an overt connection between himself and old masters in 1758 sir thomas sebright 5th baronet had paid 5s in an old master auction for a painting of sigismunda supposedly by correggio hogarth doubted attribution and was later proved correct painting is now considered to be by francesco nevertheless hogarth priced his sigismunda in line with what was paid for correggio version and commensurate with time he had spent creating it at least two hundred days although it appears he was also working on finishing piquet during this period and this may have contributed to grosvenor s eventual loss of interest when hogarth presented piece to grosvenor he rejected it ostensibly because it was so striking and inimitable that constantly having it before one s eyes would be too often occasioning melancholy ideas to arise in one s mind in disgust hogarth released him from their bargain hogarth p 51 reception hogarth exhibited painting at society of artists in spring gardens in 1761 although press reports perhaps placed by hogarth and his supporters were enthusiastic sigismunda mourning over heart of guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked hogarth s attempt to emulate drama depicted in older italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous many critics were repulsed by shocking contrast between melancholy beauty of sigismunda and grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched it was said that hogarth placed an attendant next to painting to note remarks made by viewers changes to painting suggest that he may have responded to these criticisms by altering his work although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of changes were made before or after painting was exhibited one of fiercest critics of hogarth s work was critic and writer horace walpole walpole who had admired correggio compared hogarth s portrayal of sigismunda to that of a maudlin fallen virago timbs p p 406 and saw in it right
