playa de oro virus orov is a probable species of found in rodents oryzomys couesi and sigmodon mascotensis in mexican state of colima former is thought to be main host sequences of parts of virus s rna based genome have been determined they differ by 7 10 in amino acid composition and 22 24 in nucleotide composition from closely related viruses playa de oro virus was identified as a new species in 2008 and is most closely related to bayou virus catacamas virus muleshoe virus and black creek canal virus found in other species of oryzomys and sigmodon catacamas virus is found in a different population of oryzomys couesi and presence of different viruses in these two species has been used as an argument for classifying two populations of host as separate species history and occurrence playa de oro virus was first identified in rodents collected in 2004 as part of a survey of wild mammals at playa de oro in manzanillo colima western mexico discovery was published in 2008 by yong kyu chu and colleagues among 600 small mammals antibodies against hantavirus sin nombre virus were found in 23 individuals out of 358 studied of oryzomys couesi a rice rat that was most common species found six out of 87 of cotton rat sigmodon mascotensis and one out of 77 of pygmy mouse musculus in addition twelve o couesi and one s mascotensis yielded hantavirus rna viruses were found in males more often than in females because amino acid sequences in sequenced parts of virus s genome differed by as much as 7 to 10 from closely related hantaviruses chu and colleagues identified virus found at playa de oro as a new species called playa de oro virus or orov although authors could not prove that virus fulfilled all criteria for identifying a new virus species they argued that it was likely that it did fulfill those criteria it is currently treated as a probable species in genus hantavirus virology hantaviruses have a genome that consists of three segments of single stranded negative sense rna see rna virus replication called large l medium m and small s segments entire s segment and a fragment of m segment have been sequenced s segment consists of 1953 bases of which 1287 starting at position 43 code for protein in addition a second 192 base open reading frame occurs in middle of this sequence starting at position 122 as in several other hantaviruses among three specimens of o couesi sequence in this segment differed by only 1 and all changes were silent mutations amino acids of s segment differ by 7 to 10 from those of related hantaviruses bayou virus bayv from marsh rice rat oryzomys palustris catacamas virus catv from a honduras population of oryzomys couesi and black creek canal virus bccv from hispid cotton rat sigmodon hispidus nucleotide sequence differs by 24 from those viruses among 1537 base fragments of sequence of m segment several variable sites were observed including some non silent mutations sequence differs by 8 to 10 from bayv catv and bccv in terms of amino acids and by 22 in terms of nucleotides epidemiology and effects because orov occurs frequently in oryzomys couesi chu and colleagues suggested that it is primary host of virus and that infections in sigmodon mascotensis are result of spillover between these two rodent species which occur closely together hantavirus pulmonary syndrome disease caused by hantaviruses such as sin nombre virus has never been reported in mexico but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in yucatan and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species thus there is a potential risk of orov infection in humans before discovery of orov one hantavirus species had been identified in mexico el moro canyon virus from small rodent reithrodontomys megalotis relationships according to phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of both s and m segments orov is most closely related to clade formed by bayv catv bccv and muleshoe virus mul from hispid cotton rat in 2009 piet maes and colleagues proposed that closely related bayv bccv and mul be united into a single species chu and colleagues were surprised to find that same species oryzomys couesi harbored different viruses orov and catv though noted that subspecies infected by two viruses were different in 2010 delton hanson and colleagues suggested on basis of various lines of evidence including presence of different hantaviruses that western mexican populations of oryzomys couesi represent a different species oryzomys mexicanus references literature cited category
