blood is third studio album by american progressive rock band osi released by insideout music on april 27 2009 in europe and may 19 2009 in north america guitarist jim matheos and keyboardist and vocalist kevin moore started work on album in 2008 collaborating by email matheos would send moore a song idea which moore would edit and send back to matheos mike portnoy of dream theater who performed drums on office of strategic influence and free was replaced by porcupine tree drummer gavin harrison on blood matheos played bass guitar on album having hired guest musicians to perform bass duties on first two osi albums mikael akerfeldt of opeth and tim bowness of no man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track each critical reception of blood was generally positive more atmospheric and ambient tracks were praised more metal oriented tracks received mixed reactions moore s lyrics and harrison s drumming in particular were met with acclaim background on september 4 2008 keyboardist and vocalist kevin moore posted a news update to official chroma key website in it he stated that he had been working with guitarist jim matheos on a third osi album for several months now slowly but surely moore later stated that with osi he and matheos usually play it by ear we never really know if we re going to do another osi we never agree on it i don t remember ever agreeing to start a new one really but jim will send me an idea or something and we just start talking about it blood was written and recorded in same way as first two osi albums matheos and moore worked together on album long distance mainly by emailing each other files matheos would send moore song ideas from just a guitar riff to elaborate almost completed songs moore said then i ask what i can do and i mess around complete a verse and add a chorus do editing add some vocals and send it back to him moore considered writing of blood to be harder compared to previous osi albums previously matheos would send moore guitar parts to work with allowing moore to work with editing them pitching them and fucking about them different ways and then programming drums and keyboards when working on blood matheos also provided programming keyboard and drum parts if he sent me stuff that already had drums and keyboard parts and it wasn t a complete idea i had to figure out a way to elaborate on it without having that same equipment that he has there moore said overall he considered writing process to be smoother because we got on a roll and we re more fluid together mike portnoy of dream theater played drums on office of strategic influence and free but found experience frustrating moore regarded portnoy s contributions to first two albums as great but he and matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for blood we were continuing to try to get new voices involved with album he explained matheos a fan of porcupine tree was in control of personnel on blood and asked porcupine tree drummer gavin harrison to perform drums on album harrison had a schedule gap in fourth quarter of 2008 so agreed to work on album he never met matheos and moore recording his drums parts in his recording studio in england and exchanging files with them over internet most songs were sent to harrison with programmed drums for most part we usually told him to try to stay away from programmed drums and come up with his own parts and he did so much of that is his taking it in a different direction moore said there was probably at least one song maybe two where we said we d like you to keep closer to programmed drums but he had a lot of say in what went on matheos and moore were very happy with harrison s work on blood and hoped to work with him on fourth osi album blood marked first time matheos played bass on an osi album instead of recruiting an outside bassist matheos asked opeth vocalist and guitarist mikael akerfeldt to write lyrics and perform vocals on one track which would become stockholm matheos and moore sent him track they wanted him to work on and he sent back a rough mix of his vocals we were really happy with it moore said we didn t do any revisions or ask for any changes like we were expecting to it was a different approach than i would have taken and that s what was refreshing about it that s why we wanted to get somebody else to do some vocals on album tim bowness of no man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on no celebrations a bonus track music moore regarded blood as distilling osi vibe that we ve been going for all along with this album he noted that there was conflict due to his and matheos different musical tastes but it s not a personality conflict it s a musical conflict where we want different things to happen and have to work it musically moore considered this conflict to be pretty much only thing that makes osi relatively original if it was just one way or other like singer songwriter stuff electronic music or progressive metal there s a lot of people doing those things already moore stated that he found writing songs which combined progressive metal and electronic music easier than writing songs confined to one genre there s people who do that better working with two genres they re different enough from each other almost natural enemies that it keeps it interesting he said it doesn t feel like being in conquered territory it feels like there s still room to explore there s always conflicts between two writing elements that keeps it interesting when writing lyrics for previous releases moore would start mumbling and i try to figure out what i m saying and then try to make it make sense with blood he really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent i didn t want it to be like oh you get your own impression of lyrics everybody has their own idea i wanted to have an idea that i wanted to communicate and something communicable moore noted that he did occasionally use his mumbling method as it puts you in right direction as far as sounds vowel sounds and stresses on certain syllables and if you can write some words and lyrics that match that sometimes it flows really well he described all songs as based on personal experiences i ll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something he said but then by time i m finished lyrics it ll be about a relationship or something like that matheos recorded his parts in pro tools using a saffire pro 40 preamp matheos primarily used prs guitars and mesa boogie amplifiers moore used ableton live to write music and record his vocals only keyboard he used was a minimoog voyager release and promotion blood was released by insideout music on april 27 2009 in europe and may 19 in north america matheos and moore unsuccessfully tried to organise a tour in support of free we sort of disappointed people by saying that we were trying to making a tour happen and we wanted to make it happen moore said so this time we re not going to say that stuff moore stated that osi would remain a studio only project until further notice special edition of blood came with a bonus disc featuring three extra tracks tim bowness of no man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on first song no celebrations second track is a cover of christian brothers by elliott smith third track is terminal endless an extended version of regular cd track terminal it still has something interesting drum stuff where gavin just plays steady beats with variations on it moore said we had some mercy on album version but on bonus cd we don t have any mercy and we just let it go reception critical reception of blood was generally positive writing for blogcritics marty dodge praised album as jaw droppingly impressive considering it to have potential to be up there in top albums of year andrew reilly of madeloud lauded blood as osi s best album although considered other individual songs from band s catalog to be stronger than those on album alex henderson of allmusic regarded blood as an album that falls short of earth shattering but is still solid and worthwhile reilly described blood as fully mastering techno informed brand of progressive metal so many others have pursued to no avail with blood two have finally found stylistic fusion their first two discs hinted at henderson described sound of album as pink floyd and king crimson by way of radiohead nirvana grunge alt metal and alt rock reilly lauded moore s lyrics describing them as closer to his work in dream theater and chroma key than on first two osi albums moore turns conventional phrases into thinly veiled warnings to some unknown subject reilly commented osi has long been moore s avenue for exploring political as personal but here those two subjects fully cannibalize each other which given this group s past efforts and considerable talents would not at all be an impossible intention or unforeseen consequence he praised gavin harrison s drum performance describing it as phenomenal he considered stockholm and blood to be highlights of album dodge praised as stunning track listing special edition bonus disc
