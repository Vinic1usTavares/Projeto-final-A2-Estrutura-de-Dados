gould s introduction to paleontology class at harvard university only phrase gould had objected to in script was a line that introduced him as world s most brilliant paleontologist his original final line was i didn t do test i had more important work to do but it was cut because writers felt it would be funnier to give him a short final line in an earlier version of episode marge would have ended
