and unhealthy environment in mid 18th century portuguese returned to bay selling ivory to british ships carrying indian textiles in 1773 william bolts of trieste company reached bay and claimed it for holy roman empire bolts and austrians were forced out in 1781 by portuguese ships sent from goa that year hoping to prevent other european powers from claiming area in future portuguese constructed a fortress on bay naming it lourenco marques during late 18th and early 19th century fort was mainly used by french british and american whaling ships to stop for provisions a town grew around fort starting around 1850 and in 1877 it was elevated to city status in 1898 colony of portuguese mozambique relocated its capital there in late 19th and early 20th centuries lourenco marques grew both in population and economic development as a port city upon mozambican independence in 1975 city became national capital and was renamed maputo during mozambican civil war city s economy was devastated when war ended frelimo government launched a program to revive city s economy and to clean up city by forcibly removing criminals squatters and undocumented residents since then maputo s economy

was a small scale but profitable enterprise however ultimately multitudes of mosquitos that swarmed area forced portuguese to abandon fort dutch fort 1720s thumb plan of fort lydsaamheid built by dutch east india company in 1720 on 29 march 1720 three dutch ships kaap and zeelandia reached bay dutch navigators led by johannes steffler were warmly welcomed by local tribe and its chief mafumbo in march 1721 dutch east india company purchased land around bay from mafumbo and set about reconstructing old portuguese fort which had fallen into ruin repaired fort was named fort lydsaamheid dutch fort endurance within three weeks of their arrival 100 of original sailors craftsmen and soldiers had died of fever in august 1720 80 new arrivals came to replace them beginning in april 1721 it was governed by an as a dependency of dutch cape colony from april to 28 august 1722 when dutch recaptured it fort was occupied by pirates led by john taylor fort lydsaamheid s trade mainly centered around trade of ivory and to a lesser extent slaves tin aloes gold dust ambergris honey copper and rice during fort s nine years of operation it exported 22 500 kg 49 574 lb of ivory and 288 slaves slave trade while at its global peak was minimal because dutch slave traders preferred to go to northern ports where slaves could be more easily obtained instead of lydsaamheid which was not equipped to handle large quantities settlers at fort tried to farm but all attempts ended in failure in addition to trading fort was used as starting point for several expeditions into mozambican interior in search of reputed gold mines in which dutch believed was gold producing region mentioned as ophir in bible first such expedition led by steffler was forced to turn back after they were attacked by natives in lebombo mountains another expedition this time led by johannes in late 1720s set forth with native guides but after failed trading attempts and a skirmish with a tribe armed with spears also turned back they returned to find fort lydsaamheid in a state of disorder following discovery of a mutiny plot 62 would be mutineers who were disgruntled with fort s terrible conditions were arrested tortured and killed after their plans were discovered of 62 22 had been beaten with iron bars and their heads severed others suffocated and beheaded and remainder simply hanged in addition in 1728 28 dutch soldiers abandoned lydsaamheid and trekked to inhambane where eighteen who survived journey told portuguese there of mistreatment and diseases they had experienced at fort throughout its existence fort lydsaamheid suffered from meager trade an unhealthy environment and general discord and had failed to find fabled gold producing region in 1729 cape colony officials received orders from xvii dutch east india company s board of directors to abandon fort instead of immediately implementing these orders colony offered a one year grace period to fort s personnel however during this period fort s men under leadership of jan van de capelle attacked chief mafumbo whose tribe had settled too close for comfort in a battle that followed several local chiefs attacked killing all dutch soldiers except for one slave in response capelle wrote to cape colony officials requesting reinforcements to deal with hostile natives this series of events angered cape town leaders as men of fort lydsaamheid were involving themselves in conflicts when they were supposed to be preparing to leave in addition colony officials lambasted men for their lazy lifestyle often spending days fishing instead of surveying region in april 1730 cape colony leaders resolved to evacuate remaining men from fort and bring them to cape town on 27 december 1730 last 133 dutchmen boarded arriving in cape town in january 1731 before leaving they stripped fort of every remaining item and demolished palisade so that no other european power could seize it within three years of abandonment fort was an overgrown ruin with only a few walls remaining standing revival of trade 1730s 1770s 1730s and 40s saw decreased commercial activities in and around delagoa bay a dutch ship brack which stopped in bay in 1742 while on a voyage to madagascar reported that area was mostly deserted with a small number of natives who were still able to communicate in dutch they also encountered a few remaining merchants selling a small number of slaves but no ivory revival of trade in delagoa bay came with expanding british trade with india since abandonment of dutch fort portuguese had intermittently maintained trading posts in espiritu santo estuary within bay initially beads arms and a coconut product were shipped from madras to mozambique island where dutch merchant vessels would pick them up and bring them to delagoa bay still trade grew slowly and remained risky in part because of hostility of portuguese officials towards british merchant ships despite captain of inhambane having urged reestablishment of portuguese authority in bay since 1745 crown only did so in 1755 with sending barque francisco xavier purpose in addition to hopes of using region to provide slaves for brazil was to prevent any possible british attempts to colonize delagoa bay in addition as trade was just picking up portuguese saw an opportunity to draw high prices for its deccan cotton fabrics in exchange for ivory unexpectedly a bombay trading vessel british salamander bombketch showed up as well ruining portugal s market opportunity xavier unable to sell its expensive textiles left bay and ran aground on way to quelimane during 1750s and 60s british dominated trade in delagoa bay austrian colonization 1770s neither british nor portuguese were willing to go forward with risky venture of constructing a fort in delagoa bay nevertheless portuguese sent a new ship to delagoa in 1762 goal was to establish a small trading post and to either sign treaties with or purchase surrounding land from kingdom of tembi in order to keep british out portuguese constructed a mud structure on bay with a captain and 50 soldiers but like dutch before them disease forced them to abandoned post after four years only portuguese owned trading slaves remained with a reputation for robbing visitors with lapse of portuguese presence in bay dutch english merchant william bolts saw an opportunity bolts

had grown significantly ships from bombay surat and madras frequently arrived with gujarati textiles and left bay with ivory usually stopping in madagascar to purchase slaves before returning to india in april 1781 portugal alarmed at encroachment on their claimed territory sent five ships including a 40 gun frigate and 500 men from goa to force austrians out portuguese took any remaining trieste company people as prisoners seized their two anchored ships and demolished their buildings reassertion of portuguese control 1780s 1810s in order to prevent future intrusions portuguese immediately established a garrison and recommenced trade at delagoa bay new fort was called fortaleza da nossa senhora da conceicao portuguese fort of our lady of conception portuguese settlement was commonly called lourenco marques after explorer initially port s commercial success was scanty in 1790 they sold 4 000 pieces of indian textiles a meager increase from 3 000 that were sold 70 years earlier in 1720 while indian cloth was not selling very well there was increased demand for european textiles 20 000 sold in 1790 and to a lesser extent beads and coral in addition shipments sent down maputo river brought ivory rhinoceros horns hippopotamus teeth amber gold copper agricultural products and a small number of slaves although by turn of 19th century they were turning some profit through sale of ivory portuguese main purpose for maintaining fort was to prevent austrians or british from reasserting themselves in bay if it were not for portuguese crown s insistence on maintaining fort colonial government on mozambique island would likely have abandoned struggling settlement portuguese briefly abandoned lourenco marques after a french attack in 1796 returning in 1799 in 1801 small portuguese garrison was unable to prevent an english ship from trading in delagoa bay though there is limited documentation of this period it is thought that very little trade was carried out in bay during first two decades of 19th century next british ship to enter bay was 14 years later in 1815 by which point portuguese were able to successfully turn them away much of economic activity that remained in this period consisted of visits by whaling ships stopping for provisions french and british whaling ships had been stopping at port since 1789 and while french ships were no longer welcome after having attacked fort british and american whaling vessels continued to resupply at bay through early 19th century by 1817 portuguese planned to use port to enter whaling industry that year their first attempt to establish a whaling company in delagoa bay failed when their representative alienated a local chief by neglected to ask permission to use tribe s land chief ended up killing portuguese men involved with second attempt in 1818 whaling company was established with black and specialized equipment brought in from north america by this period slave trade in mozambique was found up north and in delagoa bay it was nearly nonexistent perhaps being a factor in portuguese search for other ventures like whaling by 1820s slave trade had grown in delagoa bay but was still small compared to north portuguese colonization and territorial disputes 1820 1900 british claims and african upheaval 1820s beginning in 1821 captain william fitzwilliam owen was sent by british to survey east african coast upon visiting delagoa bay owen wrote to his superiors that portuguese fort there was still so isolated as to sometimes experience food shortages eager for incriminating evidence that could provide britain an excuse to take region from portugal he wrote that lourenco marques had potential to become a major participant in slave trade fact that he cited port s potential to trade slaves rather than any actual trading is indicative that slave trade in delagoa bay was still very modest at that time owen upon finding that kingdom of tembi located on bay south of lourenco marques was still unclaimed by a european colonial power set to claim it for united kingdom in march 1823 he reached an agreement with king kapell who ceded his kingdom to british saying i king kapell do declare that i am induced to make this cession by advice of my chiefs because i find my state too weak to defend themselves against aggression of either africans or europeans owen claimed for britain land south of english river today known as espiritu santo estuary however when he visited bay again in 1824 he found that portuguese disregarding british treaty had reached their own treaties with african natives and they endeavored unsuccessfully to take military possession of country owen was able to take back control of territory but it remained disputed although union jack flew over area united kingdom had taken no steps to exercise authority over territory while ravages of zulus confined portuguese to limits of their fort vatwas a speaking zulu tribe had recently migrated to area raiding local villages for food and laying waste to bay region with exception of southern part after two years without rain drought was already causing famine and compounded by devastating attacks of vatwas local african population at time was suffering from social upheaval decade long turbulence was exacerbated by social effects of increased slave trading during late 1820s some stability was restored by 1830s when effects of drought had passed and slave trading declined by 1829 lourenco marques still consisted of a small fortified trading post known to locals as site of whites prior to 1826 french british and american ships entering bay traded either with portuguese port or directly with african traders and tribal chiefs trade became more regulated in 1826 when a trading company was granted a monopoly over ivory trade in bay allowing only them to purchase directly from african traders and negatively effecting commerce in lourenco marques population of fort at time was just a few hundred and consisted of three main groups government personnel including soldiers civil servants and their servants and slaves portuguese east india company officials and slaves and 300 400 africans living within fort s borders zulu conflict 1830s thumb zulu king dingane attacked lourenco marques in 1833 in 1833 for reasons that are not entirely clear zulu king dingane attacked lourenco marques on 26 july 1833 dingane and his army accompanied by auxiliaries from two other tribes arrived in front of fort and burned nearby native villages anticipating an attack governor of lourenco marques dionisio antonio ribeiro along with much of fort s personnel left to take refuge on xefina island ten miles east of fort some soldiers remained at fort along with head of trading company who disagreed with decision to leave on 17 september 1833 dingane s army sacked fort but not trading facilities nobre trading company head had convinced portuguese soldiers not to resist zulus nobre made an arrangement with zulus and emerged safe from conflict on 16 september dingane ordered his men to pursue and kill governor ribeiro when zulu warriors arrived on mainland across from xefina island on 6 october ribeiro took a boat planning to stop at magaia and then go meet leader soshangane an ally whom he had invited to attack zulus however before reaching his destination ship had to stop on coast due to stormy weather there ribeiro was captured by zulu who killed three of his men and took him back to lourenco marques where he was executed on 12 october 1833 before his execution a zulu reportedly gave a public speech and said governor will die because of his treachery and tyranny for having usurped land of king dingan e and of made war on him without motive sent his people to island of mocambique having had flags hoisted in lands of those kings without their consent and under force of arms and sent powder and ball to king dingan e while explicitly stated motivations for zulu invasion of lourenco marques and execution of ribeiro were governor s land expansion into zulu territory there may have been other reasons unstated in speech commercial downturn accompanying decline of slave trade by 1830 effected zulu who may have instead perceived economic hardship as resulting from portuguese greed in addition ribeiro s lack of caution in his interactions with volatile dingane who often switched from fighting with or against portuguese in periodic conflicts with other tribes and governor s amicable relations with soshangane an enemy of zulu were likely contributing factors following ribeiro s death nobre trader took over as acting governor on 21 august 1834 ribeiro s successor dario rodrigues de arrived at lourenco marques two days later a zulu representative of dingane arrived to ask for tribute by mid 1830s zulu kingdom controlled much of area to west and south of delagoa bay while soshangane s gaza empire controlled much of area to north of lourenco marques in 1835 a group of boers led by a man named traveled from transvaal and attempted to form a settlement on bay however their population was decimated by fever and they soon abandoned settlement british and boer disputes 1860s 1870s in 1860s both british and boers made short lived claims to territory around bay on 5 november 1861 royal navy captain bickford of frigate hms narcissus occupied island and elephant island and declared them british territory portugal protested this act and in 1872 dispute was submitted to arbitration of adolphe thiers president of france thiers successor patrice de macmahon on 24 july 1875 ruled in favor of portugal restoring their right to all lands south of delagoa bay previously united kingdom and portugal had agreed that a right of pre emption would be granted to unsuccessful claimant in case of sale or cession of bay portuguese authority over mozambican interior was not established until some time after macmahon

high and protected by bastions at intervals on 9 december 1876 lourenco marques was elevated to village status growing strength of transvaal led to greater interest being taken back in portugal in development of a port a commission was sent by portuguese government in 1876 to drain marshy land near settlement to plant blue gum trees and to build a hospital and a church in 1885 vasco de gama gardens were laid out on 10 november 1887 lourenco marques was declared a city by a royal decree by king luis who cited settlement s material improvements and economic potential witwatersrand gold rush which began in 1886 further increased economic development of city in late 19th and early 20th centuries as lourenco marques served as closest seaport for export of gold and diamonds from south
