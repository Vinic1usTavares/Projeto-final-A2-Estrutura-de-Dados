thumb a time domain an instrument used to locate position of faults on lines from time taken for a reflected wave to return from discontinuity a signal travelling along an electrical transmission line will be partly or wholly reflected back in opposite direction when travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in characteristic impedance of line or if far end of line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance this can happen for instance if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together this article is about signal reflections on electrically conducting lines such lines are loosely referred to as copper lines and indeed in telecommunications are generally made from copper but other metals are used notably aluminium in power lines although this article is limited to describing reflections on conducting lines this is essentially same phenomenon as optical reflections in fibre optic lines and microwave reflections in waveguides reflections cause several undesirable effects including modifying frequency responses causing overload power in transmitters and overvoltages on power lines however reflection phenomenon can also be made use of in such devices as stubs and impedance transformers special cases of open circuit and short circuit lines are of particular relevance to stubs reflections cause standing waves to be set up on line conversely standing waves are an indication that reflections are present there is a relationship between measures of reflection coefficient and standing wave ratio specific cases there are several approaches to understanding reflections but relationship of reflections to conservation laws is particularly enlightening a simple example is a step voltage where is height of step and is unit step function with time applied to one end of a lossless line and consider what happens when line is terminated in various ways step will be propagated down line according to telegrapher s equation at some velocity and incident voltage at some point on line is given pages 70 71 incident current can be found by dividing by characteristic impedance open circuit line thumb 430px fig 1 step voltage disturbance v u t is injected into input of line vi travels down line and is reflected back at far end as vr incident wave travelling down line is not affected in any way by open circuit at end of line it cannot have any effect until step actually reaches that point signal cannot have any foreknowledge of what is at end of line and is only affected by local characteristics of line however if line is of length step will arrive at open circuit at time at which point current in line is zero by definition of an open circuit since charge continues to arrive at end of line through incident current but no current is leaving line then conservation of electric charge requires that there must be an equal and opposite current into end of line essentially this is kirchhoff s current law in operation this equal and opposite current is reflected current and since there must also be a reflected voltage to drive reflected current down line this reflected voltage must exist by reason of conservation of energy source is supplying energy to line at a rate of none of this energy is dissipated in line or its termination and it must go somewhere only available direction is back up line since reflected current is equal in magnitude to incident current it must also be so that these two voltages will add to each other so that after step has been reflected twice incident voltage appears across output terminals of line as reflection proceeds back up line reflected voltage continues to add to incident voltage and reflected current continues to subtract from incident current after a further interval of reflected step arrives at generator end and condition of double voltage and zero current will pertain there also as well as all along length of line if generator is matched to line with an impedance of step transient will be absorbed in generator internal impedance and there will be no further reflections pai zhang pages 89 96 thumb 300px left fig 2 equivalent circuit of generator feeding a line this counter intuitive doubling of voltage may become clearer if circuit voltages are considered when line is so short that it can be ignored for purposes of analysis equivalent circuit of a generator matched to a load to which it is delivering a voltage can be represented as in figure 2 that is generator can be represented as an ideal voltage generator of twice voltage it is to deliver and an internal impedance of thumb 250px right fig 3 open circuit generator however if generator is left open circuit a voltage of appears at generator output terminals as in figure 3 same situation pertains if a very short transmission line is inserted between generator and open circuit if however a longer line with a characteristic impedance of and noticeable end to end delay is inserted generator being initially matched to impedance of line will have at output but after an interval a reflected transient will return from end of line with information on what line is actually terminated with and voltage will become as before short circuit line reflection from a short circuited line can be described in similar terms to that from an open circuited line just as in open circuit case where current must be zero at end of line in short circuit case voltage must be zero since there can be no volts across a short circuit again all of energy must be reflected back up line and reflected voltage must be equal and opposite to incident voltage by kirchhoff s voltage law and as reflection travels back up line two voltages subtract and cancel while currents will add reflection is double negative a negative current traveling in reverse direction dual situation to open circuit case arbitrary impedance thumb 300px fig 4 equivalent circuit of an incident wave on a transmission line arriving at an arbitrary load impedance for general case of a line terminated in some arbitrary impedance it is usual to describe signal as a wave traveling down line and analyse it in frequency domain impedance is consequently represented as a frequency dependant complex function for a line terminated in its own characteristic impedance there is no reflection by definition terminating in characteristic impedance has same effect as an infinitely long line any other impedance will result in a reflection magnitude of reflection will be smaller than magnitude of incident wave if terminating impedance is wholly or partly resistive since some of energy of incident wave will be absorbed in resistance voltage across terminating impedance may be calculated by replacing output of line with an equivalent generator figure 4 and is given et al pages 34 reflection must be exact amount required to make reflection coefficient is defined as and substituting in expression for in general is a complex function but above expression shows that magnitude is limited to when physical interpretation of this is that reflection cannot be greater than incident wave when only passive elements are involved but see negative resistance amplifier for an example where this condition does not hold matthaei et al pages 8 10 for special cases described above termination circuit when both and are purely resistive then must be purely real in general case when is complex this is to be interpreted as a shift in phase of reflected wave relative to incident wave connor pages 30 31 reactive termination another special case occurs when is purely real and is purely imaginary that is it is a reactance in this case since then showing that all incident wave is reflected and none of it is absorbed in termination as is to be expected from a pure reactance there is however a change of phase in reflection given by discontinuity along line thumb 500px fig 5 mismatch of transmission line characteristic impedances causes a discontinuity marked with a star in line parameters and results in a reflected wave a discontinuity or mismatch somewhere along length of line results in part of incident wave being reflected and part being transmitted onward in second section of line as shown in figure 5 reflection coefficient in this case is given by in a similar manner a transmission coefficient can be defined to describe portion of wave that it is transmitted in forward direction thumb 500px fig 6 lumped components or networks connected to line also cause a discontinuity marked with a star another kind of discontinuity is caused when both sections of line have an identical characteristic impedance but there is a lumped element at discontinuity for example shown figure 6 of a shunt lumped element similar expressions can be developed for a series element or any electrical network for that matter matthaei et al pages 34 35 networks reflections in more complex scenarios such as found on a network of cables can result in very complicated and long lasting waveforms on cable even a simple pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends these ring waves as they are originally defined in ieee standard 587 applicability to adjustable frequency control surge voltages persist for far longer than original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to original disturbance containing high frequency components in tens of mhz range standler pages 74 76 standing waves for a transmission line carrying sinusoidal waves phase of reflected wave is continually changing with distance with respect to incident wave as it proceeds back down line because of this continuous change there are certain points on line that reflection will be in phase with incident wave and amplitude of two waves will add there will be other points where two waves are in anti phase and will consequently subtract at these latter points amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes if incident wave has been totally reflected and line is lossless there will be complete cancellation at nodes with zero signal present there despite ongoing transmission of waves in both directions points where waves are in phase are anti nodes and represent a peak in amplitude nodes and anti nodes alternate along line and combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them combined incident plus reflected wave appears to be standing still on line and is called a standing wave connor pages 28 31 incident wave can be characterised in terms of line s propagation constant source voltage and distance from source by however it is often more convenient to work in terms of distance from load and incident voltage that has arrived there negative sign is absent because is measured in reverse direction back up line and voltage is increasing closer to source likewise reflected voltage is given by total voltage on line is given by it is often convenient to express this in terms of hyperbolic functions similarly total current on line is voltage nodes current nodes are not at same locations and anti nodes occur when because of absolute value bars general case analytical solution is tiresomely complicated but in case of lossless lines or lines that are short enough that losses can be neglected can be replaced by where is phase change constant voltage equation then reduces to trigonometric functions and partial differential of magnitude of this yields condition expressing in terms of wavelength allows to be solved in terms of is purely real when termination is short circuit or open circuit or when both and are purely resistive in those cases nodes and anti nodes are given by which solves for at for first point is a node for first point is an anti node and thereafter they will alternate for terminations that are not purely resistive spacing and alternation remain same but whole pattern is shifted along line by a constant amount related to phase of connor page 29 voltage standing wave ratio ratio of at anti nodes and nodes is called voltage standing wave ratio vswr and is related to reflection coefficient by for a lossless line expression for current standing wave ratio is identical in this case for a lossy line expression is only valid adjacent to termination vswr asymptotically approaches unity with distance from termination or discontinuity vswr and positions of nodes are parameters that can be directly measured with an instrument called a slotted line this instrument makes use of reflection phenomenon to make many different measurements at microwave frequencies one use is that vswr and node position can be used to calculate impedance of a test component terminating slotted line this is a useful method because measuring impedances by directly measuring voltages and currents is difficult at these frequencies connor pages 31 pages 73 76 vswr is conventional means of expressing match of a radio transmitter to its antenna it is an important parameter because power reflected back into a high power transmitter can damage its output circuitry bowick et al page 182 input impedance input impedance looking into a transmission line which is not terminated with its characteristic impedance at far end will be something other than and will be a function of length of line value of this impedance can be found by dividing expression for total voltage by expression for total current given above connor pages 13 14 substituting length of line and dividing through by reduces this to as before when considering just short pieces of transmission line can be replaced by and expression reduces to trigonometric functions applications there are two structures that are of particular importance which use reflected waves to modify impedance one is stub which is a short length of line terminated in a short circuit or it can be an open circuit this produces a purely imaginary impedance at its input that is a reactance by suitable choice of length stub can be used in place of a capacitor an inductor or a resonant circuit connor pp 32 35 matthaei et al pages 595 605 other structure is quarter wave impedance transformer as its name suggests this is a line exactly in length since this will produce inverse of its terminating et al pages 434 435 both of these structures are widely used in distributed element filters and impedance matching networks see also attenuation distortion fresnel
