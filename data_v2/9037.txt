laps of melbourne grand prix circuit and was first round of 2016 fia formula one world championship race marked 81st race in combined history of australian grand prix which dates back to 100 miles road race of 1928 and 21st time event was held at melbourne grand prix circuit mercedes driver lewis hamilton was defending race winner hamilton took first pole position of season and fiftieth of his career in a qualifying session that saw introduction of a new one by one elimination format that was widely criticised his teammate nico rosberg took victory ahead of hamilton and ferrari s sebastian vettel race was stopped on lap 18 following an accident involving fernando alonso and esteban gutierrez mercedes used break for a change of tyres that allowed their drivers to take a 1 2 finish after vettel had initially led race from start romain grosjean finished sixth scoring points for haas f1 team on their debut first completely new team to do so since mercedes equalled record for most consecutive 1 2 finishes by achieving their fifth in a row report background regulation changes race saw introduction of a new qualifying system as before qualifying was divided into three parts however instead of eliminating slowest drivers at end of each respective session slowest driver at a given point was now eliminated from contention every ninety seconds with countdown starting some minutes into every session in a further change of regulations tyre supplier pirelli now made three instead of two tyre compounds available for each grand prix for australian grand prix these were super soft soft and medium compounds with pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for race of which one must be used and an additional one for third part of qualifying drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of three compounds available notably mercedes drivers lewis hamilton and nico rosberg made different choices with rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead of soft tyres two manor drivers chose most conservative way taking on four sets each of medium and soft compounds race saw competitive debut of haas f1 team and its car haas vf 16 and return of renault as a fully manufacturer supported team after a four year absence free practice per regulations for season three practice sessions were held two 1 5 hour sessions on friday and another one hour session before qualifying on saturday rain had fallen before start of first practice session rendering track wet and slippery and drivers initially opted to go on their first laps on intermediate tyres nico rosberg was first to set a lap time clocking in at 1 44 037 a time soon bettered by his mercedes teammate lewis hamilton at 1 40 812 as conditions improved further kimi raikkonen set a new fastest time after about half an hour of practice soon after track had dried enough for drivers to go out on slick tyres with daniel ricciardo setting first time on medium compound with 1 34 007 after around one hour of practice hamilton managed best time of session at 1 29 725 still several wet spots on track caused problems to a number of drivers including max verstappen who flat spotted his tyres while spinning in turn six as well as valtteri bottas and rio haryanto who both had to pass through gravel traps after slipping off track shortly before end of session rain returned and caught out many drivers including raikkonen and ricciardo whose red bull got stuck in a gravel pit at turn twelve due to several rain showers between first and second practice track was again wet during second session which limited drivers to using intermediate tyres only hamilton was again fastest setting a time of 1 38 841 teammate rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into session damaging a new specification front wing that team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage rosberg later apologised for incident which saw him trying to get back to pit lane before his team told him to stop on track calling an early end to his session nico hulkenberg raikkonen ricciardo and carlos sainz jr all finished within one second of hamilton s time while sergio perez was at one point on his way to a new fastest time overall setting best times in first two along track before having to slow in last part of lap due to heavy rain two manor drivers pascal wehrlein and haryanto covered highest number of laps with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively neither renault nor williams drivers set a time albeit going on track sauber cars and max verstappen s toro rosso did not leave garage at all during session although rain fell on saturday morning track had dried by start of final free practice session lewis hamilton again set fastest time with 1 25 624 less than two tenths of a second in front of teammate rosberg with sebastian vettel in third position close behind fastest times had been set on super soft tyre compound however mercedes s advantage over ferrari proved more significant up to seven tenths of a second on harder soft compound tyre most likely to be used in race toro rosso confirmed their good pace for weekend with fourth and sixth place for carlos sainz and max verstappen respectively being about half a second quicker than their sister team red bull racing a major incident occurred just seconds after beginning of practice session when rio haryanto and romain grosjean collided in pit lane both cars needed to equip new front wings and haas also changed floor on grosjean s car haryanto was later issued a three place grid penalty for incident as well as two penalty points added to his licence qualifying thumb daniel ricciardo qualified eighth and went on to finish fourth in race qualifying got under way on saturday afternoon with new rules in place just as in years before qualifying procedure was divided into three parts with first part q1 running for 16 minutes and second and third parts q2 and q3 being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively all twenty two cars contested first part with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of first two parts of qualifying leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in q3 however in a change of rules drivers were now eliminated during session with slowest runner at a given point being taken out from contention every ninety seconds beginning seven minutes into q1 six minutes into q2 and five minutes into q3 new format meant that all cars took to track quickly in q1 with everyone setting lap times on super soft compound fastest tyre available at event two manor drivers were first to be eliminated having set only one timed lap each as were both haas cars after them being unable to cross finishing line in time same fate caught out daniil kvyat who qualified 18th both sauber drivers were able to go out on a second timed lap but proved too slow to avoid being last to go out in q1 after renault rookie jolyon palmer was able to avoid elimination setting a faster time towards end of session q2 started with a busy track once more but many of top drivers elected not to go out on a second timed run after setting sufficient lap times first time around eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly with two renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively two mclarens were next to go out of contention before bottas was eliminated for 11th place on grid failing to improve on his lap time both force india drivers were last not to make it into q3 with sergio perez beating his teammate hulkenberg to ninth third part of qualifying determined pole position and only two mercedes drivers set two timed laps after he clocked in behind both ferrari drivers in his first run rosberg improved to second place on his second time out but was unable to challenge teammate hamilton who took fiftieth pole position of his career every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in end two ferrari cars of vettel and raikkonen locked out second row on grid ahead of max verstappen and felipe massa sainz and ricciardo rounded up top eight on grid therefore q3 saw little running with final positions determined very early on and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before end of qualifying post qualifying new qualifying format was criticised immediately after end of session by pundits drivers and team personnel alike sky sports commentator martin brundle called for a swift revision of rules saying procedure was not acceptable and calling for it to be abandoned before next race mercedes s executive director toto wolff and former driver johnny herbert were equally critical describing it as rubbish and embarrassing red bull team director christian horner was apologetic describing format as not good for formula one niki lauda non executive chairman at mercedes was in agreement calling it a big mistake particular criticism was aimed at fact that many drivers did not get enough time to improve on their lap times seeing many getting out of their cockpits while still technically in contention world champion damon hill observed that pole sitter hamilton could have waved his own chequered flag with four minutes still to go nico rosberg acknowledged that it had not worked while sebastian vettel was equally critical describing it as wrong way to go lewis hamilton joined criticism but acknowledged attempt to revitalise format bernie ecclestone commercial rights holder of formula one spoke out against format as well declaring it to be pretty crap on day of race teams of formula 1 voted a proposal to go back to qualifying format as it had been in previous seasons which was rejected by fia s f1 commission race at end of formation lap daniil kvyat was unable to reach grid due to an electrical issue therefore field went to another formation lap and race was shortened accordingly to 57 laps at start proper vettel got away well passing through both mercedes cars into lead followed by his teammate raikkonen in second as rosberg and hamilton went through first corner hamilton was forced wide and lost additional places falling down to sixth kevin magnussen suffered a puncture on first lap and made a pit stop for new tyres while esteban gutierrez had mechanical issues at back of field hamilton was able to pass fifth placed massa on lap four as vettel was leading from raikkonen rosberg and verstappen on lap eight sainz was first of top ten runners to pit for new tyres meanwhile hamilton was unable to pass verstappen for fourth discussing alternative tactics with his team on radio communication pascal wehrlein had a good start in his debut as well running in 14th place at that point of race thumb left lewis hamilton started in pole position and finished second in race on end of lap eleven rosberg was first front runner to go into pitlane and vettel followed suit just two laps later a quicker stop by rosberg saw vettel emerge just in front of him but ferrari stayed ahead and he passed hamilton for second on lap 16 on same lap both raikkonen and hamilton made pit stops as well re establishing order one lap later fernando alonso had a major accident as he ran into back of gutierrez being lifted into air at and hitting left hand barrier before subsequently rolling over several times before coming to rest upside down against barrier at turn three experiencing a peak force of 46g while alonso walked away with minor injuries a safety car was deployed for a short time before race direction decided to red flag race due to huge amounts of debris across track from both alonso s mclaren and damaged advertising boards causing all cars to come back into pitlane while cars waited for restart work on cars was allowed and hamilton s front wing was changed while rio haryanto ended his race as race resumed behind safety car both ferrari drivers were running on super soft tyre compound with both mercedes now equipped with mediums which were set to last for rest of race running order at restart was vettel rosberg raikkonen ricciardo verstappen sainz hamilton massa grosjean bottas grosjean in ninth was only driver who had not made a pit stop before red flag was shown which allowed him to save one pit stop and change his tyres during break vettel led away at restart but his ferrari teammate raikkonen was forced to pull into pit lane on lap 22 with fire coming from his and subsequently retired handing second place to rosberg over next couple of laps vettel was able to pull away from rosberg on softer tyre compound marcus ericsson was handed a drive through penalty for having his team work on his car less than 15 seconds before restart by lap 31 gap between vettel and rosberg started to come down again while hamilton moved ahead of sainz into fifth as latter made a pit stop two laps later verstappen was in as well but a slow pit stop lost him time on lap 35 rosberg took lead as vettel made a pit stop who also lost time due to a mistake during his stop he emerged back on track in fourth place hamilton now started to pull back time on leaders while debutant palmer held off two toro rosso drivers in a struggle for ninth place thumb romain grosjean finished sixth scoring points for haas f1 on team s debut on lap 40 ericsson started to slow on track and eventually retired one lap later hamilton moved into second ahead of ricciardo on main straight lap 42 saw first sainz and then verstappen overtake palmer s renault who fell back to eleventh another lap later ricciardo changed tyres and came out fifth behind massa taking fourth three laps later at front hamilton and vettel slowly closed on rosberg with gap between two also coming down vettel came onto back of hamilton with five laps remaining chasing him closely for several laps before making a mistake in second to last corner of lap 55 losing his chances at second place as race ended nico rosberg took victory thirty one years after his father keke rosberg had won 1985 australian grand prix hamilton and vettel rounded out podium ahead of ricciardo and massa with romain grosjean having finished in sixth haas f1 became first new and from scratch constructor since toyota in 2002 to score points in its inaugural grand prix race entry behind grosjean hulkenberg bottas sainz and verstappen were other point scorers by finishing fourth daniel ricciardo equalled highest ever finish by an australian driver at their home event after mark webber did same in 2012 it was mercedes s fifth consecutive 1 2 finish equalling a record set by ferrari in and and by themselves in post race at podium interviews conducted by former formula one driver mark webber both mercedes drivers expressed delight at their result hamilton in particular described his race as great and added that he loved fact that we had to come through from far behind sebastian vettel meanwhile was satisfied with his start but lamented red flag situation and said that ferrari had not expected mercedes to opt for harder tyre compound and go until end of race he later added that he was confident that ferrari had closed gap to mercedes and would be able to compete for championship throughout season nico rosberg later revealed that team had been close to retiring his car due to persisting brake issues caused by debris caught in brake caliper however he was able to manage brake temperatures to secure victory rosberg also apologised to his teammate for making contact and forcing him wide at start following an inquiry into incident between alonso and gutierrez stewards took no action against either driver deeming it a racing incident with no driver particularly to blame fernando alonso shared stewards opinion and was quick to express that he did not blame gutierrez accident was a talking point for days after race with former fia president max mosley pointing out that alonso s impact might have been fatal about twenty years earlier he praised measures taken in terms of driver security ever since fatal accident of ayrton senna at 1994 san marino grand prix saying that due to these efforts one was now able to expect driver to walk away from a violent crash particular praise after race went to both newcomers haas and debutant jolyon palmer who delivered what guardian described as an impressive drive palmer had been able to hold off attacks by both toro rosso drivers for several laps in closing stages of race toro rosso s max verstappen was very unhappy with his team s strategy in race handling situation repeatedly complaining and swearing over team radio he lost several seconds in a rushed pitstop after which he lamented that he had wanted to pit before his teammate sainz while driving behind sainz when both where trailing palmer he asked for team orders to allow him to pass his teammate which were denied leading him to describe his team s strategy as a joke verstappen received criticism for his outbursts with sky sports describing him as sounding like a teenager and a sulky one at that he later apologised to his team for his outbursts classification qualifying thumb sebastian vettel finished third for ferrari
