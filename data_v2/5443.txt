performed at both london and philadelphia live aid concerts on 13 july 1985 during tour collins recorded song separate lives with marilyn martin for movie white nights which was a number one hit in us and a top ten hit in uk remixes of six songs from album were later included on 12 ers compilation album released in 1987 production and recording shortly after completion of work on eric clapton s album behind sun in mid 1984 collins turned his attention to his third solo album according to his 2016 autobiography not dead yet sessions for what would become no jacket required was a conscious attempt to move to a more uptempo sound i have a notion of what i want to do break out of this love song box that i ve found myself in i ll make a dance album or at least an album with a couple of uptempo tracks some of songs from album emerged from collins improvisations with a drum machine including singles one more night and sussudio collins started singing one more night to an attempt of making a beat similar to jacksons and improvised sus sussudio in another collins tried to replace lyric with another phrase but decided to keep that way leading to lyrics about a schoolboy crush on a girl at his school another song created mostly through improvisation don t lose my number was described by collins as having been written mostly during recordings for his first solo album face value http www genesis music com members community index php topic 0 collins added that he does not fully understand meaning of lyrics described by reviewer stephen holden of new york times as vague sketching outlines of a melodrama but withholding full story other songs were written with a more personal message long long way to go is often considered one of collins more popular songs never to be released as a single and was at that point in his career his most political song former police lead vocalist sting provided backing vocals for song sting and collins first met through band aid and would later perform together in live aid collins was working on a song and thought that sting having participated in band aid would relate to it very easily collins asked sting to help him provide vocals for this song and sting accepted doesn t anybody stay together anymore is another song in which collins was making a personal message song was made in response to everyone around him getting a divorce including his manager friends and himself years before collins later said that he sang this at charles prince of wales 40th birthday party not knowing that prince s divorce from his wife diana princess of wales would happen a short time later phil collins big band played this live on tour in later years collins performed a re arranged version of song as a ballad as part of his seriously live world tour differing considerably from original up beat album version opening drum fill of song would be later used on eric clapton track hold on on which collins played drums and produced for clapton s august album a year later take me home is another song in which meaning was originally very vague at first listening it appears that song is about going home but this is not true collins has stated that song lyrics refer to a patient in a mental institution and that it is very much based on novel one flew over cuckoo s nest peter gabriel helen terry and sting all provide backing vocals music video shot during tour features collins in multiple cities around world including london new york city tokyo moscow sydney paris chicago st louis los angeles hollywood san francisco and memphis graceland at end of music video collins arrives home and hears a woman presumably his wife from inside house asking him where he has been he replies by saying he has been to some of cities mentioned above woman replies you ve been down at pub haven t you as collins grins at camera we said hello goodbye appeared as a b side to take me home and don t lose my number originally and as an extra track on cd release of album producer arif mardin composed beginning portion of song a remix of song with additional guitars and without an orchestra was released following year 1986 on soundtrack for movie playing for keeps this remixed version received some radio airplay around time of soundtrack s release which coincided with no jacket required period though it did not chart collins has mused that song is unfairly classed as a second class citizen stating that song would have been looked at differently if it were added to album according to new york times reviewer caryn james song is a straightforward comment on leaving home man with horn was originally recorded during sessions for collins second solo album hello i must be going in 1982 found on sleeve of album a photo of every song collins recorded for that session is on album sleeve however song was not released until it appeared as b side to sussudio in uk and as b side to one more night in united states collins has said that he has no emotional attachment to song music by jackson 5 inspired collins to write song i like way which also did not appear on album originally appearing as b side to one more night in uk and sussudio in us he called song dodgy and has cited it among his least favourite songs title album is named after an incident at pump room restaurant in chicago illinois collins entering restaurant with former led zeppelin lead vocalist robert plant was denied admittance because he did not meet restaurant s dress code of jacket required for dinner while plant was allowed in collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it maitre d hotel argued that jacket was not proper collins said in an interview with playboy that he was at that point never so mad in his life after incident drummer often appeared on shows such as late night with david letterman and tonight show starring johnny carson denouncing restaurant and telling his story management of restaurant later sent him a complimentary sport coat and an apology letter stating that he could come to restaurant wearing whatever he wanted in photography for album s inner sleeve and subsequent publicity materials collins deliberately lampooned incident by wearing a suit that was several sizes too big release and commercial performance no jacket required was released on 18 february 1985 lead singles were sussudio in uk and one more night in us both songs had music videos that were shot at a london pub owned by richard branson featuring collins playing both before and after building closes in first week of march shortly after

number four on billboard hot 100 charts during late september 1985 and b side of single was we said hello goodbye collins had difficulty conceptualising a plot for corresponding music video he decided to create a gag video based on this difficulty in video he talks to clients and directors all giving him crazy conceptual ideas collins parodies several other videos including those by michael jackson david lee roth elton john cars and police singer also filmed parodies of mad max western films and samurai movies take me home final single released from album is often considered to be one of collins s most well known songs and has been a part of all of his tours since no jacket required world tour it reached number seven on us billboard charts and number 19 on uk charts song was not slated for a

night who said i would don t lose my number and take me home it was originally available on video home system vhs small and laserdisc ld critical reception reception for album was mostly positive geoff orens of allmusic in a retrospective review said that while some of songs are dated album contains standout tracks he describes long long way to go as one of collins most effective ballads and take me home as pulsating orens went on to say it s not a completely satisfying recording but it is best example of one of most dominating and influential styles of 1980s lori e pike of los angeles times said that collins recipe of tense vocals spiced with saucy horns and splashy electro synthesisers often leaves little room for real feeling to squeeze through when he slows down and lets his smoldering moodiness take over effect is magical stephen holden of new york times said that album was refreshing and that collins was adept at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood holden described only you know and i know as an angry love song that had some sampling of motown style music mixed in in one more night mr collins s recent number one hit a ticking snare drum injects a whisper of lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter tenderer reprise of against all odds says holden holden concluded by saying on surface no jacket required is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes but beneath its shiny exterior mr collins s drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind obsession and repression rolling stone reviewer david fricke said phil collins sudden transformation from balding bantam drummer for a prosperous british art rock group into a mainstream pop heartthrob might seem one of eighties most improbable success stories but judging from sly craft and warm low key humour of his solo records and his successful productions for philip bailey and frida collins newfound fame was inevitable robert hilburn of los angeles times originally disliked song one more night but later praised song saying that collins soulful but polite vocal style is also capable of capturing pain of going through yet one more night without her dallas morning news writer lennox samuels said that no jacket required atlantic is what fans have come to expect from phil collins lots of horns and syncopation heavy rhythm even those who were not normally fans of collins work liked album michael r smith of daily vault wrote anomaly or not it is indeed album that phil deserves to be remembered for stephen williams of newsday said that album was loaded with musical hooks and textured arrangements it also lacks tense edge that was part of collins work with genesis keegan hamilton of riverfront times said that album was 80 s dance pop special a smooth synthesiser groove with an order of keyboards drum machines and horns on side adding that sussudio was best track on album saying that it s catchy gibberish hamilton says that one more night was worst song on album saying that album s introspective slow jam wallows in self pity on negative side marty racine of houston chronicle said that i don t wanna know and take me home were only songs to rise above crowd and that collins focused too much on his singing and less on his drumming which can be captivating racine also added that album makes listener feel a little cold but admired that singer was playing game as well as anyone writing an article in defence of collins in 2010 gary mills of quietus described album as determined dross which collins did not deserve to have his career judged by in 2013 music critic tom service of guardian was similarly scathing saying album had not stood test of time and was unlistenable to today singling out sussudio for particular criticism arguing production drum machine inane sincerity of lyrics there s no colder or more superficial sound in popular music precisely because it takes itself so seriously he also compared it unfavourably with enduring appeal of collins s 1980s contemporaries such as human league and in particular pet shop boys saying latter were geniuses by comparison at 28th annual grammy awards collins was nominated in five categories album won award for album of year and collins won best pop vocal performance male collins shared producer of year non classical award with co producer

bateman briefly discusses it amongst other work by collins synthesiser riff was heavily criticised for sounding too much like prince s 1982 song 1999 a similarity that collins does not deny citing

show titled album flash taped in london england at royal albert hall reception for tour was positive as well rick kogan of chicago tribune said that after hearing and observing collins eminently satisfying and frequently spectacular two hour performance one is left not with a series of niggling questions about his popularity but rather with renewed admiration for forcefulness of well crafted songs played in a straightforward manner in interviews during tour it was remarked by interviewers that singer appeared similar to actors bob hoskins and danny devito collins joked that all three of them could play three bears from story goldilocks and three bears devito heard idea and contacted collins and hoskins about making a film collins researched bears and a script was planned kim basinger reportedly wished to play role of goldilocks however problems arose mostly involving script and all three actors abandoned film while on no jacket required tour collins recorded a song for movie white

accident and that both he and power station were going to attend both live aid shows as well but they all out by default i was only one who did it he later claimed bob geldof organiser of live aid originally asked collins to be part of geldof s first charity effort band aid collins played drums and performed backing vocals for band aid s uk number one hit in 1984 do they know it s christmas

against all odds and in air tonight and finished night playing drums for led zeppelin s aforementioned act band has claimed that performance was unspectacular and critics place blame on collins however collins says that i would pledge to my dying day that it wasn t me and that thompson was racing through some of performance collins later remarked i remember in middle of thing i actually
