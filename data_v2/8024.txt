wandsworth bridge crosses river thames in west london it carries a217 road between area of battersea near wandsworth town station in london borough of wandsworth on south of river and areas of sands end and parsons green in london borough of hammersmith and fulham on north side first bridge on site was a toll bridge built by julian tolme in 1873 in expectation that western terminus of hammersmith and city railway would shortly be built on north bank leading to a sharp increase in number of people wanting to cross river at this point railway terminus was not built and problems with drainage on approach road made access to bridge difficult for vehicles wandsworth bridge was commercially unsuccessful and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made toll free tolme s bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses and in 1926 a royal commission recommended its replacement in 1937 tolme s bridge was demolished present bridge an unadorned steel cantilever bridge designed by sir thomas peirson frank was opened in 1940 at time of its opening it was painted in dull shades of blue as camouflage against air raids a colour scheme it retains although wandsworth bridge is one of busiest bridges in london carrying over 50 000 vehicles daily it has been described as probably least noteworthy bridge in london background although opposite each other across river thames fulham on north bank and wandsworth on south bank were historically isolated from each other nearest crossing points were at putney bridge to west and battersea bridge to east both over a mile from wandsworth fast flowing but narrow river wandle at wandsworth was well situated for driving watermills leading to rapid spread of industry in area during 19th century nearby battersea railway bridge opened in 1863 but as local population grew and london s built up area began to encroach during 19th century pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased in 1864 it was expected that newly formed hammersmith and city railway would build its western terminus on north bank of river between chelsea and fulham in 1864 in anticipation of new railway line generating high demand for a river crossing an act of parliament was passed granting permission to wandsworth bridge company to build a bridge to be financed by tolls with proviso that bridge would be at least wide and cross river with no more than three spans rowland mason ordish designed an ordish lefeuvre principle bridge to comply with act s specifications of a similar design to his nearby albert bridge wandsworth bridge and albert bridge were authorised on same day last private authorised in london 1873 bridge thumb first wandsworth bridge alt narrow lattice truss bridge crossing a wide river company was unable to finance building of ordish s design and in 1870 a new act of parliament was passed giving company permission to build a bridge wide crossing river with five spans ordish was asked to design a cheaper bridge to new specifications but refused to change design so julian tolme was appointed designer in his place tolme designed a starkly functional lattice truss bridge of wrought iron it cost ps40 000 about ps in to build and consisted of five identical spans supported by four pairs of concrete filled iron piers each of cylindrical piers was sunk into riverbed bridge was due to open in early 1873 but workmen building it went on strike and a third act of parliament was necessary to give company time to resolve dispute and complete project wandsworth bridge was formally opened in a small ceremony on 26 september 1873 and a celebratory buffet was provided at nearby spread eagle pub a utilitarian structure made of mismatched materials purchased for cheapness new bridge elicited unenthusiastic responses illustrated london news remarked at time of its opening that no attempt has been made to produce architectural effect structure being substantial rather than ornamental illustrated london news 26 september 1873 quoted a d toll was charged on pedestrians and carts were charged 6d in 1867 formerly independent hammersmith and city railway was absorbed by metropolitan railway and great western railway and was operated from then on by metropolitan railway trains plan for a terminus in fulham was abandoned and line instead turned west at hammersmith to run over london and south western railway tracks to richmond although wandsworth town railway station near southern end of bridge had provided direct connections to central london since 1846 lack of rail connections opening on north bank meant area on fulham side remained undeveloped and bridge usage was low tolme s design was not sturdy enough to carry heavy vehicles and drainage problems on approach road to north discouraged vehicles from using wandsworth bridge public ownership thumb abolition of bridge tolls 1880 clockwise from top images show address being read at opening of

toll bridges act was passed and in 1880 wandsworth bridge along with other london bridges was taken into public ownership of metropolitan board of works despite having run at a loss throughout its lifetime board of works paid ps53 313 about ps in for bridge a substantial premium on its ps40 000 construction cost on 26 june 1880 edward prince of wales and alexandra princess of wales presided over a ceremony abolishing tolls over three bridges by time it was taken into public ownership bridge was in very poor condition in 1891 a weight limit of 5 tons was introduced and in 1897 a speed limit was imposed with its narrowness and weight restrictions by this point it was effectively a footbridge as narrowness and weight restrictions meant that it was unable to carry buses in 1926 a royal commission recommended its replacement and london county council agreed to finance a new bridge on site in 1928 it was decided instead to give priority to widening much busier putney bridge and replacement of wandsworth bridge was delayed 1940 bridge in 1935 ministry of transport agreed to finance 60 percent of projected 000 about ps in cost of a replacement bridge and london county council approved a new design by sir thomas peirson frank for a three span steel cantilever bridge in width allowing two lanes of traffic in each direction and designed to allow widening to if necessary design featured distinctive low curves intended to reflect low riverbanks in area design was presented to royal fine art commission for approval with a covering note stating that in design of bridge a severe simplicity of treatment has been carried out expressed in a technique essentially related to material proposed for its construction although commission expressed concern that bridge might be too narrow design was approved work was put out for tender with a stipulation that all materials used in construction of new bridge should be of british origin or manufacture contract for new bridge was awarded to messrs holloway brothers london and work began in 1937 a temporary footbridge that had been used during redevelopment of chelsea bridge between 1935 and 1937 was re erected alongside wandsworth bridge and existing bridge demolished new bridge was expected to be complete in 1939 however a shortage of steel in buildup to second world war delayed its opening until 25 september 1940 steel panels cladding bridge were painted in varying shades of blue to camouflage it from german and italian air raids a colour scheme it retains today although it is one of london s busiest bridges carrying over 50 000 vehicles per day its drab colour scheme and minimalist design have led to it being described as probably least noteworthy bridge in london later developments thumb current wandsworth bridge alt a long low bridge across a wide river bridge is painted in varying shades of blue which render it hard to see against water and sky historically southern approach roads had been in poor condition and confusing to use in 1969 greater london council built a214 road a three lane dual carriageway linking southern end of wandsworth bridge to tooting at immediate southern end of bridge is a large roundabout adjacent to wandsworth town railway station where bridgend road a217 york road way a217 and trinity road a214 meet roundabout is a noted example of 1960s modernist design and served as setting for parts of a clockwork orange in 1971 in 2007 approval was granted for a series of glass cone shaped flames designed by architect steven which would change colour with tides to be added to bridge deck cost estimated at ps800 000 would be raised by private sponsorship flames were to be raised above sightlines of drivers to avoid causing a distraction wandsworth bridge now marks boundary above which a lower speed limit on thames is enforced a speed limit is now in force downstream from wandsworth to but because of number of rowers using upper reaches of river all of
