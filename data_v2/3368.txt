first persian invasion of greece during persian wars began in 492 bc and ended with decisive athenian victory at battle of marathon in 490 bc invasion consisting of two distinct campaigns was ordered by persian king darius great primarily in order to punish city states of athens and eretria these cities had supported cities of ionia during their revolt against persian rule thus incurring wrath of darius darius also saw opportunity to extend his empire into europe and to secure its western frontier first campaign in 492 bc led by mardonius re subjugated thrace and forced macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom part of persia after being a vassal to persia as early as late 6th century bc probably in 512 bc however further progress was prevented when mardonius s fleet was wrecked in a storm off coast of mount athos following year having demonstrated his intentions darius sent ambassadors to all parts of greece demanding their submission he received it from almost all of them except athens and sparta both of whom executed ambassadors with athens still defiant and sparta now effectively at war with him darius ordered a further military campaign for following year second persian campaign in 490 bc was under command of datis and artaphernes expedition headed first to island naxos which it captured and burned it then island hopped between rest of cycladic islands annexing each into persian empire reaching greece expedition landed at eretria which it besieged and after a brief time captured eretria was razed and its citizens enslaved finally task force headed to attica landing at marathon en route for athens there it was met by a smaller athenian army which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at battle of marathon this defeat prevented successful conclusion of campaign and task force returned to asia nevertheless expedition had fulfilled most of its aims punishing naxos and eretria and bringing much of aegean under persian rule as well as full inclusion of macedon unfinished business from this campaign led darius to prepare for a much larger invasion of greece to firmly subjugate it and to punish athens and sparta however internal strife within empire delayed this expedition and darius then died of old age it was thus left to his son xerxes i to lead second persian invasion of greece beginning in 480 bc sources thumb upright 1 5 seal of king darius great hunting in a chariot reading i am darius great king in old persian elamite and babylonian british museum main source for greco persian wars is greek historian herodotus herodotus who has been called father of history cicero on laws i 5 was born in 484 bc in halicarnassus asia minor then under persian overlordship he wrote his enquiries greek historia english histories around 440 430 bc trying to trace origins of greco persian wars which would still have been relatively recent history wars finally ending in 450 bc holland pp xvi xvii herodotus s approach was entirely novel and at least in western society he does seem to have invented history as we know it as british author tom holland has it for first time a chronicler set himself to trace origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous nor to whims and wishes of some god nor to a people s claim to manifest destiny but rather explanations he could verify personally some subsequent ancient historians despite following in his footsteps criticised herodotus starting with thucydides thucydides history of peloponnesian war e g i p 15 nevertheless thucydides chose to begin his history where herodotus left off at siege of and therefore evidently felt that herodotus s history was accurate enough not to need re writing or correcting plutarch criticised herodotus in his essay on malignity of herodotus describing herodotus as barbarian lover for not being pro greek enough which suggests that herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even handed holland p xxiv a negative view of herodotus was passed on to renaissance europe though he remained well read however since 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events holland p 377 prevailing modern view is that herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his historia but that some of his specific details particularly troop numbers and dates should be viewed with skepticism nevertheless there are still some historians who believe herodotus made up much of his story fehling pp 1 277 sicilian historian diodorus siculus writing in 1st century bc in his bibliotheca historica also provides an account of greco persian wars partially derived from earlier greek historian ephorus this account is fairly consistent with herodotus s diodorus siculus bibliotheca historica greco persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including plutarch ctesias of cnidus and are alluded by other authors such as playwright aeschylus archaeological evidence such as serpent column also supports some of herodotus s specific claims note to herodotus ix 81 background thumb achaemenid king killing a greek hoplite circa 500 bc 475 bc metropolitan museum of art first persian invasion of greece had its immediate roots in ionian revolt earliest phase of greco persian wars however it was also result of longer term interaction between greeks and persians in 500 bc persian empire was still relatively young and highly expansionist but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples holland p47 p58 p203 moreover persian king darius was a usurper and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule even before ionian revolt darius had begun to expand empire into europe subjugating thrace expanding past danube river conquering paeonia and forcing macedon to become a client kingdom to persia though latter retaining an amount of autonomy up to 492 bc attempts at further expansion into politically fractious world of ancient greece may have been inevitable fine however ionian revolt had directly threatened integrity of persian empire and states of mainland greece remained a potential menace to its future stability holland 171 178 darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify greece and aegean and to punish those involved in ionian revolt herodotus v 105 ionian revolt had begun with an unsuccessful expedition against naxos a joint venture between persian satrap artaphernes and miletus tyrant aristagoras holland p154 157 in aftermath artaphernes decided to remove aristagoras from power but before he could do so aristagoras abdicated and declared miletus a democracy other ionian cities ripe for rebellion followed suit ejecting their persian appointed tyrants and declaring themselves democracies herodotus v 97 aristagoras then appealed to states of mainland greece for support but only athens and eretria offered to send troops holland 161 thumb left drawing of darius great and its inscription dareios top right on darius vase involvement of athens in ionian revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances beginning with establishment of athenian democracy in late 6th century bc in 510 bc with aid of cleomenes i king of sparta athenian people had expelled hippias tyrant ruler of athens herodotus v 65 with hippias s father peisistratus family had ruled for 36 out of previous 50 years and fully intended to continue hippias s rule hippias fled to sardis to court of persian satrap artaphernes and promised control of athens to persians if they were to help restore him herodotus v 96 in meantime cleomenes helped install a pro spartan tyranny under isagoras in athens in opposition to cleisthenes leader of traditionally powerful family who considered themselves natural heirs to rule of athens holland 132 in a daring response cleisthenes proposed to athenian people that he would establish a democracy in athens much to horror of rest of aristocracy cleisthenes s reasons for suggesting such a radical course of action which would remove much of his own family s power are unclear perhaps he perceived that days of aristocratic rule were coming to an end anyway certainly he wished to prevent athens becoming a puppet of sparta by whatever means necessary however as a result of this proposal cleisthenes and his family were exiled from athens in addition to other dissenting elements by isagoras having been promised democracy however athenian people seized moment and revolted expelling cleomenes and isagoras holland 136 cleisthenes was thus restored to athens 507 bc and at breakneck speed began to establish democratic government establishment of democracy revolutionised athens which henceforth became one of leading cities in greece new found freedom and self governance of athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to return of tyranny of hippias or any form of outside subjugation by sparta persia or anyone else cleomenes unsurprisingly was not pleased with events and marched on athens with spartan army holland 138 cleomenes s attempts to restore isagoras to athens ended in a debacle but fearing worst athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to artaphernes in sardis to request aid from persian empire holland p142 artaphernes requested that athenians give him an earth and water a traditional token of submission which athenian ambassadors acquiesced to however they were severely censured for this when they returned to athens at some point later cleomenes instigated a plot to restore hippias to rule of athens this failed and hippias again fled to sardis and tried to persuade persians to subjugate athens herodotus v 96 athenians dispatched ambassadors to artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action but artaphernes merely instructed athenians to take hippias back as tyrant needless to say athenians balked at this and resolved instead to be openly at war with persia having thus become enemy of persia athens was already in a position to support ionian cities when they began their revolt fact that ionian democracies were inspired by example of athens no doubt further persuaded athenians to support ionian revolt especially since cities of ionia were supposedly originally athenian colonies thumb athenians led a campaign against achaemenid capital of sardis in asia minor in 498 bc during ionian revolt city of eretria also sent assistance to ionians for reasons that are not completely clear possibly commercial reasons were a factor eretria was a mercantile city whose trade was threatened by persian dominance of aegean herodotus suggests that eretrians supported revolt in order to repay support milesians had given eretria in a past war against chalcis herodotus v 98 athenians and eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to asia minor herodotus v 99 whilst there greek army surprised and outmaneuvered artaphernes marching to sardis and there burning lower city holland p160 however this was as much as greeks achieved and they were then pursued back to coast by persian horsemen losing many men in process despite fact their actions were ultimately fruitless eretrians and in particular athenians had earned darius s lasting enmity and he vowed to punish both cities holland p168 persian naval victory at battle of lade 494 bc all but ended ionian revolt and by 493 bc last hold outs were vanquished by persian fleet holland revolt was used as an opportunity by darius to extend empire s border to islands of east vi 31 and propontis which had not been part of persian dominions before herodotus vi 33 completion of pacification of ionia allowed persians to begin planning their next moves to extinguish threat to empire from greece and to punish athens and eretria holland p177 178 492 bc mardonius campaign thumb persian warriors possibly immortals a frieze in darius s palace at susa siliceous glazed bricks c 510 bc louvre in spring of 492 bc an expeditionary force to be commanded by darius s son in law mardonius was assembled consisting of a fleet and a land army herodotus vi 43 whilst ultimate aim was to punish athens and eretria expedition also aimed to subdue as many of greek cities as possible herodotus vi 44 departing from cilicia mardonius sent army to march to hellespont whilst he travelled with fleet he sailed round coast of asia minor to ionia where he spent a short time abolishing tyrannies that ruled cities of ionia ironically since establishment of democracies had been a key factor in ionian revolt he replaced tyrannies with democracies thence fleet continued on to hellespont and when all was ready shipped land forces across to europe army then marched through thrace re subjugating it since these lands had already been added to persian empire in 512 bc during darius s campaign against scythians holland p153 upon reaching macedon persians forced it to become a fully subordinate part of persian empire they had been vassals of persians since late 6th century bc but retained their general autonomy meanwhile fleet crossed to resulting in submitting to persians fleet then rounded coastline as far as acanthus in chalcidice before attempting to round headland of mount athos however they were caught in a violent storm which drove them against coastline of athos wrecking according to herodotus 300 ships with loss of 20 000 men then whilst army was camped in macedon brygians a local thracian tribe launched a night raid against persian camp killing many of persians and wounding mardonius herodotus vi 45 despite his injury mardonius made sure that brygians were defeated and subjugated before leading his army back to hellespont remnants of navy also retreated to asia although this campaign ended land approaches to greece had been secured and greeks had no doubt been made aware of darius s intentions for them 491 bc diplomacy perhaps reasoning that expedition of previous year may have made his plans for greece obvious and weakened resolve of greek cities darius turned to diplomacy in 491 bc he sent ambassadors to all greek city states asking for earth and water a traditional token of submission herodotus vi 48 vast majority of cities did as asked fearing wrath of darius in athens however ambassadors were put on trial and then executed in sparta they were simply thrown down a well holland 179 this firmly and finally drew battle lines for coming conflict sparta and athens despite their recent enmity would together fight persians however sparta was then thrown into disarray by internal machinations citizens of aegina had submitted to persian ambassadors and athenians troubled by possibility of persia using aegina as a naval base asked sparta to intervene holland 181 cleomenes travelled to aegina to confront aeginetans personally but they appealed to cleomenes s fellow king demaratus who supported their stance herodotus vi 49 cleomenes responded by having demaratus declared illegitimate with help of priests at delphi whom he bribed demaratus was replaced by his cousin now faced with two spartan kings aeginetans capitulated and handed over hostages to athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour herodotus vi 73 however in sparta news emerged of bribes cleomenes had given at delphi and he was expelled from city herodotus vi 74 he then sought to rally northern to his cause at which spartans relented and invited him back to city by 491 bc though cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead following day cleomenes was succeeded by his half brother leonidas i 490 bc datis and artaphernes campaign taking advantage of chaos in sparta which effectively left athens isolated darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish athens and eretria holland pp181 183

depictions were made on tombs of other achaemenid emperors best preserved frieze being that of xerxes i according to herodotus fleet sent by darius consisted of 600 triremes herodotus vi 95 there is no indication in historical sources of how many transport ships accompanied them if any herodotus claimed that 3 000 transport ships accompanied 1 207 triremes during xerxes s invasion in 480 bc herodotus vii 97 among modern historians some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable it has been suggested either that number 600 represents combined number of triremes and transport ships green p90 or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes lazenby p46 herodotus does not estimate size of persian army only saying that they formed a large infantry that was well packed herodotus vi 94 among other ancient sources poet simonides a near contemporary says campaign force numbered 200 000 while a later writer roman cornelius nepos estimates 200 000 infantry and 10 000 cavalry cornelius nepos miltiades 4 plutarch and pausanias both independently give 300 000 as does suda dictionary plutarch moralia iv dictionary entry hippias plato and lysias assert 500 000 and justin 600 000 plato menexenus funeral oration ii 9 modern historians generally dismiss these numbers as exaggerations one approach to estimate number of troops is to calculate number of marines carried by 600 triremes herodotus tells us that each trireme in second invasion of greece carried 30 extra marines in addition to a probable 14 standard marines herodotus vii 184 thus 600 triremes could easily have carried 18 000 26 000 infantry kampouris 2000 numbers proposed for persian infantry are in range 18 000 100 000 davis pp9 p164 however consensus is around 25 000 persian infantry used in invasion was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across empire however according to herodotus there was at least a general conformity in type of armour and style of fighting lazenby pp23 29 troops were generally speaking armed with a bow short spear and sword carried a wicker shield and wore at most a leather jerkin one exception to this may have been ethnic persian troops who may have worn a corslet of scale armour some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently for instance saka were renowned axemen holland 18 elite contingents of persian infantry seem to have been ethnic persians medians cissians and saka herodotus specifically mentions presence of persians and saka at marathon herodotus vi 113 style of fighting used by persians was probably to stand off from an enemy using their bows or equivalent to wear down enemy before closing in to deliver coup de grace with spear and sword estimates for cavalry are usually in 1 000 3 000 range istoria tou ellenikou ethnous history of greek nation volume b athens 1971 persian cavalry was usually provided by ethnic persians bactrians medes cissians and saka most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry lazenby fleet must have had at least some proportion of transport ships since cavalry was carried by ship whilst herodotus claims cavalry was carried in triremes this is improbable lazenby estimates 30 40 transport ships would be required to carry 1 000 cavalry lindos once assembled persian force sailed from cilicia firstly to island of rhodes a lindian temple chronicle records that datis besieged city of lindos but was unsuccessful lind chron d 1 59 in higbie 2003 naxos fleet then moved north along ionian coast towards samos before abruptly turning west into aegean sea holland 186 fleet sailed next to naxos in order to punish naxians for their resistance to failed expedition that persians had mounted there a decade earlier many of inhabitants fled to mountains according to herodotus those that persians caught were enslaved persians then burnt city and temples of naxians herodotus vi 96 cyclades thumb 250px right satellite image of cyclades delos is small island directly to bottom left of mykonos moving on persian fleet approached delos whereupon delians also fled from their homes herodotus vi 97 having demonstrated persian power at naxos datis now intended to show clemency to other islands if they submitted to him he sent a herald to delians proclaiming holy men why have you fled away and so misjudged my intent it is my own desire and king s command to me to do no harm to land where two gods were born neither to land itself nor to its inhabitants so return now to your homes and dwell on your island datis then burned 300 talents of frankincense on altar of apollo on delos to show his respect for one of gods of island fleet then proceeded to island hop across rest of aegean on its way to eretria taking hostages and troops from each island karystos persians finally arrived off southern tip of euboea at karystos citizens of karystos refused to give hostages to persians so they were besieged and their land ravaged until they submitted to persians herodotus vi 99 siege of eretria task force then sailed around euboea to first major target eretria herodotus vi 100 according to herodotus eretrians were divided amongst themselves as to best course of action whether to flee to highlands or undergo a siege or to submit to persians in event majority decision was to remain in city herodotus vi 101 eretrians made no attempt to stop persians landing or advancing and thus allowed themselves to be besieged for six days persians attacked walls with losses on both sides however on seventh day two reputable eretrians opened gates and betrayed city to persians city was razed and temples and shrines were looted and burned furthermore according to darius s commands persians enslaved all remaining townspeople battle

peisistratus herodotus vi 102 athenians joined by a small force from plataea marched to marathon and succeeded in blocking two exits from plain of marathon holland pp187 190 at same time athens greatest runner pheidippides or was sent to sparta to request that spartan army march to athens aid pheidippides arrived during festival of a sacrosanct period of peace and was informed that spartan army could not march to war until full moon rose athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days herodotus vi 105 they decided to hold out at marathon for time being and they were reinforced by a contingent of hoplites from plataea thumb left greek wings envelop persians stalemate ensued for five days before athenians for reasons that are not completely clear decided to attack persians lazenby pp59 62 despite numerical advantage of persians hoplites proved devastatingly effective routing persians wings before turning in on centre of persian line remnants of persian army left battle and fled to their ships holland 197 herodotus records that 6 400 persian bodies were counted on battlefield herodotus vi 117 athenians lost just 192 men and plataeans 11 in immediate aftermath of battle herodotus says that persian fleet sailed around cape sunium to attack athens directly herodotus vi 115 although some modern historians place this attempt just before battle holland pp191 194 either way athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat and marched as quickly as possible back to athens herodotus vi 116 athenians arrived in time to prevent persians from securing a landing and seeing that opportunity was lost persians turned about and returned to asia on next day spartan army arrived having covered in only three days spartans toured battlefield at marathon and agreed that athenians had won a great victory herodotus vi 120 aftermath thumb right 200px greek hoplite and persian warrior depicted fighting 5th century bc defeat at marathon ended for time being persian invasion of greece however thrace and cycladic islands had been into persian empire and macedon reduced to a subordinate kingdom part of empire since late 6th century bc they had been vassals of persians but remained having a broad scope of autonomy darius was still fully intent on conquering greece to secure western part of his empire holland p177 moreover athens remained unpunished for its role in ionian revolt and both athens and sparta were unpunished for their treatment of persian ambassadors darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate greece however in 486 bc his egyptian subjects revolted indefinitely postponing any greek expedition holland p202 203 darius then died whilst preparing to march on egypt and throne of persia passed to his son xerxes i holland pp206 208 xerxes crushed egyptian revolt and very quickly restarted preparations for invasion of greece holland 211 this expedition was finally ready by 480 bc and second persian invasion of greece thereby began under command of xerxes himself holland 244 significance for persians two expeditions to greece had been largely successful new territories had been added to their empire and eretria had been punished it was only a minor setback that invasion had met defeat at marathon that defeat barely dented enormous resources of persian empire holland p200 yet for greeks it was an enormously significant victory it was first time that greeks had beaten persians and showed them that persians were not invincible and that resistance rather than subjugation was possible holland p201 victory at marathon was a defining moment for young athenian democracy showing what might be achieved through unity and self belief indeed battle effectively marks start of a golden age for athens holland p138 this was also applicable to greece as a whole their victory endowed greeks with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries during which western culture was born fuller 32 john stuart mill s famous opinion was that battle of marathon even as an event in british history is more important than battle of hastings powell et al 2001 militarily a major lesson for greeks was potential of hoplite phalanx this style had developed during internecine warfare amongst greeks since each city state fought in same way advantages and disadvantages of hoplite phalanx had not been obvious marathon was first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops and revealed how devastating hoplites could be in battle holland p194 197 phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry cause of much caution by greek forces at battle of plataea but used in right circumstances it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon holland 352 persians seem to have more or less disregarded military lessons of marathon composition of infantry for second invasion seems to have been same as during first despite availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in persian ruled lands lazenby p28 having won battles against hoplites previously persians may simply have regarded marathon as an aberration see also
