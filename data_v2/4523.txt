considered it one of most challenging effects his company made for season up to point episode aired anna torv considered it her favorite episode explaining in bound when olivia gets kidnapped they re giving her a spinal tap and she wakes up and breaks out it was just bang bang bang bang bang i found it really easy to follow and kind of energetic and i really loved filming that in reference to trini alvarado other actress in their fight scene torv also mentioned when shooting it we had so much fun that s probably my favorite sequence in show thus far actor joshua jackson believed episode was important developmentally for series explaining it was creatively when show really hit its stride in first season jackson continued i think right around midway point of first season show decided what it wanted to be from about midway point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes i can t remember exact number but two part episode where dunham gets kidnapped after that it was pretty clear we introduced bad guys for season and there was a much clearer narrative drive through rest of season in december 2008 entertainment weekly reported that actress ari graynor would be joining cast as a guest star for a minimum of three episodes beginning in january her character olivia s younger sister rachel would be visiting olivia for a few weeks because she s dealing with some man trouble back

jack bauer writing for a v club critic zach handlen also praised of opening sequence as well as olivia herself he graded episode with an a calling it a gripping bizarre occasionally wince inducing hour of television after a spotty first half of season fringe is finally hitting its stride jane boursaw of tv squad enjoyed episode like isler she also compared olivia to jack bauer and expressed suspicion that new characters rachel and ella were part of a bigger conspiracy bryant l griffin of airlock alpha compared olivia to character sydney bristow from television series alias and opined that fringe continues to exhibit a satisfying stride griffin however was disappointed that events from previous episode were ignored believing it to be a mistake to continue emphasising formulaic storytelling rather than a serialized format andrew hanson from los angeles times felt that despite extra ten minutes bound was more like a two hour episode being crammed into half time he thought episode s four writers were all busy as there were three stories going on at once and compared olivia to similarly characterized lost character jack shephard hanson concluded but how bad can it be when my biggest complaint about a show is that i want more and now that cold winter of reruns has passed we should be getting just that television without pity graded episode with a b various
