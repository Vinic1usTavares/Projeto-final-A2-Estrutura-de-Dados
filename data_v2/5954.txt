noronha et al 2009 p 450 sazima et al 2005 p 2 silva et al 2005 p 62 sazima et al 2005 p 1 trachylepis atlantica is a species of skink from island of fernando de noronha off northeastern brazil it is covered with dark and light spots on upperparts and is usually about in length tail is long and muscular but breaks off easily very common throughout fernando de noronha it is an opportunistic feeder eating both insects and plant material including nectar from erythrina velutina tree as well as other material ranging from cookie crumbs to eggs of its own species introduced predators such as feral cats prey on it and several parasitic worms infect it perhaps seen by amerigo vespucci in 1503 it was first formally described in 1839 its subsequent taxonomic history has been complex riddled with confusion with trachylepis maculata and other species and other problems species is classified in otherwise mostly african genus trachylepis and is thought to have reached its island from africa by rafting enigmatic trachylepis tschudii supposedly from peru may well be same species discovery and taxonomy in an early account of what may be fernando de noronha purportedly based on a voyage by amerigo vespucci in 1503 island was said to be inhabited by lizards with two tails which is thought be a reference to noronha skink carleton and olson 1999 p 48 tail is long and fragile and it breaks easily like that of many skinks and other lizards following which it may regenerate however when it does not completely break off a new tail may nevertheless grow out of broken part so that tail appears forked 19th century species was first formally described by john edward gray in 1839 based on two specimens collected by hms before 1838 schmidt 1945 p 45 mausfeld and vrcibradic 2002 p 292 he introduced names tiliqua punctata for noronha skink and tiliqua maculata for a species from guyana among many others gray 1839 p 289 six years later he transferred both to genus euprepis in 1887 george boulenger placed both in genus mabuya misspelled mabuia and considered them identical using name mabuia punctata for species which was said to occur both on fernando de noronha and in guyana he also included mabouya punctatissima o shaughnessy 1874 purportedly from south africa as a synonym boulenger 1887 pp 160 161 20th century in 1900 l g andersson claimed that gray s name punctata was preoccupied by lacerta punctata linnaeus 1758 which he identified as mabuya homalocephala he therefore replaced name punctata with its junior synonym maculata using name mabuya maculata for skink of fernando de noronha mausfeld and vrcibradic 2002 p 292 linnaeus s lacerta punctata in fact refers to asian species not to mabuya homalocephala but gray s name punctata remains invalid regardless bauer 2003 p 4 in 1931 c e and m d burt resurrected name mabuya punctata now spelled correctly for noronha skink noting that it was apparently a very distinct species but did not mention maculata and in 1935 e r dunn disputed boulenger s conclusion as to synonymy of punctata and maculata and in apparent ignorance of andersson s work restored name mabuya punctata for noronha skink dunn 1935 pp 535 536 he wrote that noronha skink was very distinct from other american mabuya and more similar in some respects to african species dunn 1935 p 536 k p schmidt in 1945 agreed with dunn s conclusion that maculata and punctata of gray were not same but he noted andersson s point that punctata was preoccupied and therefore introduced new name mabuya atlantica to replace punctata schmidt 1945 p 45 next year h travassos disagreeing with dunn and unaware of andersson s and schmidt s contributions travassos 1948 p 201 considered both of gray s names to be synonymous and restored name mabuya punctata for noronha skink travassos 1946 pp 6 7 he also considered mabouya punctatissima and trachylepis xystrolepis punctata tschudi 1845 described from peru as synonyms of this species travassos 1946 pp 7 8 in 1948 he acknowledged preoccupation of punctata noted by andersson and accordingly retired mabuya punctata in favor of mabuya maculata as andersson had done travassos 1948 p 206 name mabuya maculata remained in general usage for noronha skink in subsequent decades though some have used mabuya punctata not aware of last nomenclatural changes 21st century thumb left alt head of a lizard seen from above and from left a single scale with three clear ridges is figured to left text zoologie 3e partie pl 22 c is above images trachylepis maculata has long been confused with noronha skink in 2002 p mausfeld and d vrcibradic published a note on nomenclature of noronha skink informed by a re examination of gray s original type specimens despite extensive attempts to correctly name species they were apparently first to do so since boulenger in 1887 mausfeld and vrcibradic 2002 p 293 based on differences in number of scales subdigital lamellae lamellae on lower sides of digits and keels longitudinal ridges on dorsal scales located on upperparts as well as separation of parietal scales on head behind eyes in maculata they concluded that two were not after all identical and that schmidt s name mabuya atlantica should therefore be used mausfeld and vrcibradic 2002 p 294 mausfeld and vrcibradic considered mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on basis of morphological differences but were unable to resolve status of trachylepis xystrolepis punctata in same year mausfeld and others conducted a molecular phylogenetic study on noronha skink using mitochondrial 12s and 16s rrna genes and showed that species is more closely related to african than to south american mabuya species mausfeld et al 2002 p 281 as previously suggested on basis of morphological similarities whiting et al 2006 pp 720 721 they split old genus mabuya into four genera for geographically discrete clades including euprepis for african noronha clade thus renaming noronha species to euprepis atlanticus mausfeld et al 2002 p 290 in 2003 a m bauer found that name euprepis had been incorrectly applied to this clade and that trachylepis was correct instead so that noronha skink is currently referred to as trachylepis atlantica bauer 2003 p 2003 p 5 corrected generic name from euprepis to trachylepis but did not explicitly use name combination trachylepis atlantica which was first used by ananjeva et al 2006 p 76 additional molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2003 and 2006 confirmed relationship between noronha skink and african trachylepis carranza and arnold 2003 whiting et al 2006 in 2009 miralles and others reviewed taxon maculata and concluded that animal now known as trachylepis maculata also belongs in african clade but they were unable to determine whether or not it is indigenous to guyana miralles et al 2009 p 62 they also reviewed trachylepis xystrolepis punctata and replaced it with trachylepis tschudii because older name was preoccupied by linnaeus s and gray s punctata miralles et al 2009 p 57 although they were unable to resolve identity of t tschudii which is still known from a single specimen they believed that it is most likely same species as noronha skink it may be either a representative of an undiscovered amazonian population of latter or simply a mislabeled animal from fernando de noronha miralles et al

al 2009 p 453 a geologist who visited island in 1888 p 861 noted that skink is curious and bold while seated upon bare rocks i have often observed these little animals watching me apparently with as much curiosity as i watched them turning their heads from side to side as if in an effort to be wise if i kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me if i moved they ran down faces of rocks and turning stuck their heads above edges to watch me branner 1888 pp 866 867 diet thumb alt a darkly colored lizard on a rock with a winged insect in its mouth insects form an

insects but island populations may often be more herbivorous animal prey averages 6 9 mm3 in volume less than in most other trachylepis when tree erythrina velutina blooms during dry season noronha skinks climb up to to reach inflorescences of tree and to eat nectar by inserting their heads into flowers they probably use nectar both for its sugar and water content in this way skinks aid in pollinating tree as they acquire pollen on their scales and leave pollen on stigmas when visiting a flower sazima et al 2009 p 26 pollination is rare behavior among lizards but occurs most frequently in island species humans have introduced additional food sources to island including acacia seeds feces of rock rupestris carrion flies juvenile hemidactylus mabouya and even cookie crumbs given by tourists gasparini et al 2007 p 30 availability of these additional food sources may increase abundance of skink gasparini et al 2007 p 32 in 1887 h n ridley observed noronha skinks eating banana
