amanita nothofagi is a species of fungus in family amanitaceae endemic to new zealand species was first described by mycologist greta stevenson in 1962 fruit bodies have dark brown caps that are up to in diameter and covered with patches of soft greyish brown scales or warts gills underneath cap are crowded together free from attachment to stem and white becoming tinged with yellow in age stem of mushroom is long by thick and has a ring spore print is white and individual spores are spherical to ellipsoid measuring 7 5 9 by 7 5 9 micrometres mushroom may be confused with another new zealand species a australis but can be distinguished by certain characteristics amanita nothofagi is a mycorrhizal species and grows in association with native new zealand trees such as southern beech taxonomy and classification species was first described as new to science by new zealand mycologist greta stevenson who collected specimens in mid 1950s in nelson and cape farewell she published a description of mushroom in royal botanic garden s journal kew bulletin in 1962 second part of a five part series of articles describing mushroom flora of country specific epithet nothofagi refers to nothofagus genus of southern beeches with which species is often associated amanita authority rodham tulloss uses common name southern beech amanita while geoff ridley suggests charcoal stevenson classified amanita nothofagi in section phalloideae of genus amanita but ridley considered it better placed in section because of its subglobose basidiospores a clavate or occasionally abruptly bulbous stipe base with sparse bands or a rim of volva material description cap of a nothofagi is initially convex later becoming flattened with a central depression with radial grooves on margin reaching diameters of colour is variable ranging from buff to dark grey to greyish sepia with radial streaks of dusky brownish grey cap surface is sticky when young or wet but dries out with age remnants of volva form small to large irregularly shaped felted patches that are dull greyish sepia to sepia and sometimes scab like gills are crowded closely together and free from attachment to stem they are white to cream coloured wide lamellulae short gills that do not extend fully from cap edge to stem have somewhat truncated ends stem is high thick and tapers slightly at top it is hollow and has a bulbous base measuring in diameter stem surface above level of ring is white sparsely covered with woolly or fuzzy tufts occasionally breaking into transverse bands below ring stem surface is smooth or occasionally breaks into bands or fibrillose scales it is whitish buff or greyish sepia streaked with grey stem base may or may not have a band or rim of buff to greyish sepia volval remnants ring is membranous grooved whitish buff and greyish sepia or lavender grey it first hangs freely before later sticking to stem often tearing and adhering to edge of cap flesh of cap is white or stained mouse grey under central part occasionally with a grey line above gills stem flesh is white to pale buff spore print is white spores are typically 7 5 9 by 7 5 9 um spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid and thin walled under a microscope spores appear hyaline translucent and are amyloid meaning they will turn bluish black to black when stained with melzer s reagent basidia are 30 5 57 by 8 16 um four spored and not clamped at base margin cells of gills are plentiful spherical club shaped or swollen spherically at tip hyaline and measure 13 58 by 8 33 um cap cuticle consists of a 130 220 um wide strongly gelatinised suprapellis upper layer and a dense non gelatinised subpellis lower layer volval remnants on cap are made of abundant spherical elliptic and club shaped cells that are 21 119 by 14 5 115 um intermixed with hyphae 4 9 um wide and pale umber in colour and either arranged irregularly or with a vertical orientation similar species amanita nothofagi mushrooms can be confused with a australis if warts have been washed off and colour has been bleached a reliable method to distinguish two is to check for presence of clamp connections at bases of basidia which are present in a australis and absent from a nothofagi ridley notes that type collection was made with a dark grey specimen and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying species paler specimens resemble a excelsa which led some to incorrectly believe that species occurs in new zealand amanita is also similar in appearance spore size amyloid reaction and lack of clamp connections in basidia it is distinguished from a nothofagi largely on basis of colour it is a greyish brown to yellowish grey brown that fades to pinkish buff as it gets older tulloss suggests that resemblance of a number of species from australasia and chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and may indicate that they share gondwanan ancestors habitat and distribution fruit bodies of amanita nothofagi grow solitarily or in scattered groups like all amanita mushrooms it is mycorrhizal and grows in close association with southern beech genus nothofagus including new zealand red beech silver beech new zealand black beech and hard beech manuka and kanuka found on both north and south islands of new zealand it is most common of country s endemic amanita species see also list of amanita species references external links nothofagi category fungi of new zealand category fungi described in 1962
