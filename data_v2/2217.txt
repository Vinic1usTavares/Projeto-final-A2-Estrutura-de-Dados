severe tropical cyclone pat was a small but strong tropical cyclone that passed directly over aitutaki cook islands in southern pacific ocean on february 10 2010 part of a series of storms to impact group of islands early that year pat was first identified as a tropical depression on february 6 well to northeast of samoan islands storm steadily organized as it moved generally southeast becoming a tropical cyclone on february 8 turning to south intensification began in earnest and system acquired hurricane force winds within 48 hours of being named wide system displayed annular characteristics and a wide eye pat reached its peak strength early on february 10 as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 140 km h 85 mph and a barometric pressure of 960 mbar hpa 28 35 inhg hours later it struck aitutaki producing gusts in excess of 185 km h 115 mph on island hostile wind shear then prompted rapid weakening of cyclone system degraded below gale intensity on february 11 just 24 hours after it peaked and was last noted early on february 12 battering aitutaki with wind gusts in excess of 185 km h 115 mph cyclone pat devastated island approximately 78 percent of homes were damaged with 72 structures destroyed electrical grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost agriculture also experienced tremendous impact with most crops completely lost damage on aitutaki amounted to us 13 7 million however casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported recovery efforts began immediately after storm with red cross and government of new zealand aiding local government a reconstruction plan was enacted by cook islands within a month and subsequently funded by new zealand owing to its destructive effects name pat was later retired and replaced with pili meteorological history between january and march 2010 australian monsoon trough extended unusually far east over southern pacific ocean with above average sea surface temperatures stemming from a moderate strength el nino multiple low pressure systems were able to develop across region an unusual spree of tropical cyclogenesis in rapid succession ensued including four hurricane strength storms oli pat rene and tomas on february 6 fiji meteorological service fms began monitoring a tropical depression dubbed well to northeast of samoan islands embedded within a well developed trough system displayed curved convective banding features environmental conditions in area including low wind shear high ocean heat content and upper level outflow favored cyclogenesis additionally an active madden julian oscillation phase moving into region was expected to bolster development steady improvement of system s convective structure ensued and early on february 7 joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert low trekked generally east southeast in response to a near equatorial ridge anchored to north storm s appearance continued to improve and dvorak classifications rose to t2 5 indicating gale force winds were likely present accordingly jtwc began issuing advisories on system at 18 00 utc and dubbed it tropical cyclone forecasters noted however that small size of cyclone could lead to erroneously low dvorak estimates fms followed suit six hours later and assigned name pat to cyclone assessing it as a category 1 on australian cyclone scale convection became increasingly symmetric on february 8 and a small eye feature appeared on microwave satellite imagery spanning no more than developing storm began a gradual turn to south as steering currents shifted from equatorial ridge to a subtropical ridge based on increasing dvorak numbers jtwc assessed pat to have reached hurricane intensity by 06 00 utc on february 9 eye feature became more pronounced throughout day with convection consolidating inward and becoming more symmetric accordingly fms accordingly upgraded pat to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone by 18 00 utc system became annular in nature on february 10 characterized by a lack of prominent banding features and uniform convection which surrounded its wide eye pat reached its peak intensity at 06 00 utc that day as it began turning to southwest maximum winds were estimated at 140 km h 85 mph alongside a barometric pressure of 960 mbar hpa 28 35 inhg at same time jtwc assessed pat to have been a category 2 equivalent on saffir simpson hurricane scale with one minute sustained winds of 165 km h 105 mph weakening began shortly thereafter as wind shear over system increased pat passed directly over island of aitutaki between 12 00 and 18 00 utc low level center of pat began decoupling from convection late on february 10 once it cleared aitutaki storm rapidly weakened amid strong shear with center being left completely exposed early on february 11 a solitary band remained along south side of storm by that time and fms no longer considered it a tropical cyclone after 06 00 utc lone band of convection dissipated later that day and with no residual thunderstorm activity skeletal low turned westward in response to westerly flow jtwc maintained pat as a tropical storm until 18 00 utc and as a tropical depression until its dissipation early on february 12 preparations thumb right visible satellite image of cyclone pat around its peak intensity early on february 10 250px starting on february 7 tropical cyclone alerts and later gale warnings were issued for northern cook islands under anticipation of gale force winds impacting populated islands first of these islands were and suwarrow as storm moved southward advisories shifted accordingly strong wind warnings were raised for pukapuka nassau and on february 8 however they were dropped later that day as cyclone pat moved away alerts on potential gales in southern cook islands also began on february 8 including islands of atiu aitutaki and gale warnings for aitutaki palmerston and rarotonga began on february 9 and extended to next day early on february 10 a hurricane warning was issued for aitutaki with core of pat s destructive winds forecast to pass close to or over island sustained winds of 140 km h 85 mph and gusts of 185 km h 115 mph were anticipated aforementioned warnings were allowed to expire once pat cleared cook islands on february 11 and was no longer a threat emergency centers were prepped across northern cook islands on february 8 cook islands chapter of red cross took early action with cyclone pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on february 9 volunteers from organization assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on aitutaki anticipating high winds residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters similar preparations took place on rarotonga though main concern there was storm surge government offices and schools there were closed on february 11 most residents and all tourists along coast in aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters authorities later announced that they were under prepared for cyclone pat lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue impact passing directly over aitutaki on february 10 pat produced wind gusts in excess of 185 km h 115 mph making it one of most powerful storms ever experienced by residents on island it is also considered among most damaging on island aitutaki mayor tai herman claimed winds to be much stronger with gusts up to 240 km h 150 mph during worst of storm these winds were above building codes at time which required structures to be able to withstand winds of numerous trees and power lines fell amid powerful winds cutting power to entirety of island and severing communications according to government of cook islands 78 percent of homes on island sustained damage of 277 affected homes 59 sustained minor damage 51 moderate 95 major and 72 were destroyed severity of damage correlated with age of each home with buildings over 25 years old suffering greatest impact collateral damage took place when debris from damaged or destroyed structures became airborne and struck other buildings hardest hit were villages of and costs to homes amounted to nz 15 million us 10 6 million one building at seventh day adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage although damage occurred at school it was utilized as an evacuation shelter primary school and college in also suffered damage island s electrically run water supply was substantially effected a total of 568 homes lost access to clean water with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed aitutaki s only hospital fared well through storm with some roof damage and flooded rooms infrastructural losses totaled to nz 2 3 million us 1 6 million mainly stemming from power grid agricultural sector sustained extensive damage amounting to us 1 5 million with some crops experiencing a total loss severity of damage raised concerns about food security in months after storm particularly hard hit was mango crop which was to be harvested two weeks after pat struck approximately 60 75 percent of coconut trees and 75 percent of java plum mango and kapok trees sustained damage most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases multiple branches additionally blue lorikeet vini a bird native to french polynesia and cook islands population suffered dramatic losses due to storm with population on aitutaki dropping by more than 50 percent all told losses from pat amounted to us 13 7 million however dr russell howorth from secretariat of pacific community spc stated that damage reached us 8 2 million in comparison collective damage from cyclones in cook islands since 1955 was us 47 million according to spc in contrast to severity of damage no fatalities and only eight minor injuries took place fearing similar damage to aitutaki a pre emptive state of emergency was issued for rarotonga this was soon lifted as pat ultimately spared rarotonga and little damage took place there gale force winds and heavy rains impacted rarotonga and palmerston islands large swells affected uninhabited penrhyn atoll interfering with a study of marine turtles aftermath thumb right infrared satellite image of cyclone pat as it passed over aitutaki on february 10 immediately following pat s passage government of cook islands declared aitutaki a disaster zone in accordance with franz agreement government of new zealand made an initial donation of nz 350 000 for recovery efforts prior to formal request for assistance on february 13 following said request new zealand prepped a c 130 hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and new zealand defence force nzdf personnel which arrived in aitutaki on february 15 aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to island nzdf priority was repair of schools and hospitals though they assisted red cross with clearing debris restoring power and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents lack of access to clean water prompted significant concern and a water and sanitation expert from australian red cross flew in on february 12 to assist with restoration efforts immediate provisions of 600 water bottles were sent to island on february 16 red cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water using a truck to distribute it to island s villages through september 24 they provided over 100 000 litres of clean water distribution of 2 050 collapsible containers and 200 hygiene kits lessened dependency on red cross s water pump an extensive repair and recovery plan was enacted by government of cook islands within a month of cyclone pat which covered agricultural infrastructural and societal sectors financial restraints hindered expected progress of this operation with more than two thirds of it not being funded by final plan report on march 4 of nz 15 million us 10 6 million in home damage nz 7 2 million us 5 1 million was covered new zealand later provided a nz 5 5 million us 3 9 million grant to assist in this effort priority was placed on repairing damaged homes with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones labor costs would ultimately reach nz 6 million us 4 2 million for this project finalization of funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early june with some residents still living in tents farmers were provided with nz 195 000 us 138 000 worth of seeds seedlings and various supplies to jump start agricultural recovery since majority of island s electrical grid was destroyed an earlier plan to convert network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor by february 17 80 percent of grid was restored however only 10 percent homes were actually connected presence of dead vegetation left behind by storm created fire hazards across island prompting government to issue a ban on burning seventh day adventist church primary school resumed classes on february 15 despite losing a building all other schools suspended activities until february 22 however approach of tropical depression 11f delayed this until following day on february 23 european union provided us 110 000 in emergency funds to cook islands habitat for humanity later sought to assist in rebuilding process in april with a funding goal of nz 300 000 us 210 000 depression set in among members throughout storm battered community once rebuilding process began fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose mayor tai herman feared that survivors would consider selling their homes and leave cook islands altogether even prime minister jim was reported to be left in shock by scale of damage government enacted a three month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with disaster and maintain social integrity among victims through september 265 people took advantage of this program see also 2009 10 south pacific cyclone season cyclone oli cyclone tomas cyclone notes
