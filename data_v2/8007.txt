maxwell lyte 1909 vol i p 226 while there she married fownes who was then a resident of nethway devon maxwell lyte 1909 pp 225 226 to improve his wife s estate fownes luttrell obtained a sanction from

parliamentary seats for borough of minehead for ps30 000 but there were no serious bidders largely due to high prices and fact that fownes luttrell had in fact not inherited much control over seats he was putting up for sale namier 1964b however frugal spending helped to recover estate and fownes luttrell invested in 1760 in manor of near dunster which he purchased from john poyntz he went on to

member of parliament being lord of manor of minehead theoretically gave fownes luttrell a natural interest in elections to parliament for borough i e power to influence votes of its householders however luttrells had let it slip out of their control and fownes luttrell was being warned by his estate s agent john st albyn in 1747 that you do not appear sure of more than one quarter of vote and it may happen too that of even one quarter of them some will fail you maxwell lyte 1909 vol i p 232 at british general election of 1754 fownes luttrell was serving as high sheriff of somerset which barred him from standing as a candidate to be a member of parliament however henry shiffner a merchant from london approached him and offered himself as a candidate for borough in his place maxwell lyte 1909 vol i p 238 as st albyn had warned shiffner was not returned as a member instead lord egremont a local landowner offered considerable financial support to his own candidate daniel boone while one of incumbent mps charles whitworth offered to sell parts of his estate to loyal supporters an intervention from duke of newcastle at egremont s request led to boone and whitworth forming an alliance against fownes luttrell shiffner petitioned parliament and was supported by an angered fownes luttrell maxwell lyte 1909 vol i p 239 but egremont and fownes luttrell eventually agreed a truce and by 1757 had agreed to return a member each and oppose any third candidates reluctant to stand himself fownes luttrell supported shiffner again pair would spend seven years dealing with estate and consolidating his interest there this coupled with his arrangement with egremont meant that shiffner was duly returned in 1761 alongside first earl of thomond brother of egremont beating an outsider earl of during this parliament fownes luttrell entertained voters at dunster castle and in village where he laid on expensive feasts maxwell lyte 1909 pp 242 and 244 after his wife s death in 1766 fownes luttrell decided to stand at general election in 1768 despite his efforts to build up support there were still factions and opposition to him to gain some form of patronage in minehead he travelled to london and obtained from government control over offices in minehead which prevented his opponents from doing same fownes luttrell won that election accumulating more than ps1 800 worth of expenses in process maxwell lyte 1909 p 250 while a member of parliament he is not recorded as speaking and does not appear in small number of division lists still surviving according to maxwell lyte it does not appear that he had any real zest for parliamentary life and was probably far happier with his hounds and his fighting cocks in devon or somerset maxwell lyte 1909 vol i p 256 however it appears that prime minister lord north believed that in return for government s support in 1768 fownes luttrell had promised to return government s candidate thomas pownall at next election when that time came in 1774 north supported fownes luttrell and warned off his rival charles whitworth however fownes luttrell was elected alongside his eldest son john which caused a dispute between former and north dispute was resolved when elder fownes luttrell offered to resign that december in favour of pownall on condition that pownall seek his approval before nominating any of his friends or himself in future a draft document outlining his other conditions included a payment of ps3 000 in return for his resignation despite resigning fownes luttrell had asserted his influence and control over both seats and in 1780 his son francis was elected alongside john fownes luttrell who remained one of mps until 1806 and went on to sit again from 1807 to 1816 his other son thomas and john s son also called john were also elected subsequently death henry fownes luttrell died on 30 october 1780 ancestry references notes citations bibliography burke j and burke j b 1847 a
