r v thomas was an australian court case decided in victorian court of appeal on 18 august 2006 it concerned conviction in february 2006 of joseph thomas nicknamed jihad jack in media on terrorism related charges specifically receiving funds from al qaeda appeal revolved around admissibility of a confession thomas made during an interrogation in pakistan in 2003 court found that evidence which was crucial to thomas convictions was inadmissible because it had not been given voluntarily court accordingly quashed his convictions but after further hearings ordered on 20 december 2006 that he be retried rather than acquitted background to case joseph thomas is an australian citizen on 23 march 2001 he left australia and travelled by air to pakistan crossing into afghanistan by land for next three months he was alleged to have trained at al farouq training camp near city of kandahar before travelling to kabul in july 2001 reasons for ruling 3 given during initial trial over next eighteen months or so thomas stayed in various al qaeda safe houses and is alleged to have made contact with several al qaeda officials on 4 january 2003 thomas was apprehended by pakistani immigration officials at an airport in city of karachi and taken into custody thomas had with him items including an australian issue passport an airline ticket for travel to indonesia and about 3 800 in cash passport issued on 19 may 1993 had been tampered with for intention of concealing details of thomas movements after his departure from australia in 2001 he was blindfolded and driven to an unknown location where he was questioned for about two hours by two pakistani men and two americans he was questioned several times over next few days before being taken to another location which thomas described as some sort of mansion house where he was kept in a small cell for next two weeks and questioned on a number of occasions initially he maintained a fabricated story that he was a student who had been travelling in pakistan but he later revealed truth that he had been in contact with al qaeda in afghanistan he said that he was motivated to change his story by several incidents including one in which one of pakistani interrogators pulled on collar of his hood so as to strangle him and incidents in which interrogators said that he would be electrocuted and executed according to thomas he was then told that his cooperation was welcome and that he would be returned home after two weeks thomas was blindfolded and shackled and flown to islamabad where he remained in custody there he was visited by an australian consular representative who later gave evidence that thomas did not appear to have been maltreated or denied food or water however representative did testify that while thomas was on phone to his parents in australia he told them i m not going to cuba referring to guantanamo bay detainment camp to which a pakistani official replied no that s not correct between 25 january and 29 january thomas was interviewed four times by members of australian federal police afp and by members of australian security intelligence organisation accompanied by pakistani officials during one of these interviews a pakistani official said to thomas we told you that you have to prove it that you are not a terrorist you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here thomas was then transferred again this time to city of lahore where he was kept for another three weeks and interrogated by pakistani officials and an american official referred to as joe this man suggested that thomas return to afghanistan with a recording device to obtain information on al qaeda figures a suggestion thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed joe also threatened thomas that he would be sent to afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted and implied that agents would be sent to australia to rape thomas wife thomas was then returned to islamabad on 8 march thomas was interviewed again by two members of afp who had made special arrangements with pakistani directorate for inter services intelligence isi to have interview conducted pursuant to australian law particularly requirements of federal evidence act 1995 and crimes act 1914 so that admissible evidence could be gathered isi allowed interview but with a very limited timeframe and did not allow thomas to have access to legal advice during this interview thomas made several self statements which were key to his later convictions and admissibility of which was central issue in appeal in statements thomas admitted that he had tampered with his passport to conceal amount of time he had been in pakistan and also admitted that money and airline ticket had been given to him by tawfiq bin attash a high ranking al qaeda lieutenant involved with 1998 united states embassy bombings and uss cole bombing on 10 march afp wrote again to isi reiterating requirements of australian legislation and saying that admissibility of record of interview in australian courts has been seriously compromised on 6 june 2003 thomas was released from pakistani custody at which point he was deported to australia he spent nearly a year and a half subsequently living with his family in melbourne suburb of werribee victoria before he was arrested by afp on 18 november 2004 and charged with several federal offences including one count of possessing a false passport an offence under passports act 1938 and one count of receiving funds from a terrorist organisation and two counts of providing resources to a terrorist organisation offences under criminal code act 1995 trial thomas was tried in supreme court of victoria on 26 february was found guilty of passport charge and receiving funds charge although he was acquitted of providing funds charges he was later sentenced on 31 march to a total of five years imprisonment with a two year non parole period sentencing remarks with respect to admissibility of record of 8 march interview trial judge justice cummins had instructed jury that normally failure to avail an interviewee of right to legal access would be fatal to admission of a subsequent interview however requirement is not absolute nor can it be it is not hollow to say that suspect had right to choose whether to proceed without that legal access he had right to choose not to answer and wait for legal bus which might never arrive or to answer in legitimate aim of ultimate return to australia to say such a choice is no choice at all is revisionism in his assessment judge said that afp interviewers had conducted interview fairly and properly and had not attempted to use thomas lack of legal representation to their favour trial judge also concluded that thomas had been properly informed of his right to silence and had not been induced by afp officers to participate in interview by offer of repatriation or any other reward ultimately he decided that thomas had participated voluntarily in interview and that in circumstances thomas lack of legal advice should not make record of interview inadmissible arguments lex lasry qc on behalf of thomas argued that trial judge had made several errors of law trial judge should have found that 8 march interview was not voluntary and hence inadmissible and even if it had been voluntary trial judge should have excluded it anyway on grounds of fairness or public policy several other matters were also raised relating to particular parts of evidence specifically relating to witness testimony of yahya goba one of buffalo six but these matters had little bearing on final outcome of case and were dealt with only briefly by court central argument raised was that with regard to all circumstances thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to speak or not other main argument was an alternative argument that if court decided that admissions were in fact voluntary they should not have been admitted anyway on basis that to do so would be unfair because of factors including thomas lack of access to legal advice even where he had a right to obtain it his vulnerability in circumstances and contamination of record of interview by previous joint team interrogations and their potential or actual use as levers to remind applicant of his earlier answers two other parties sought to be involved in case as amici curiae amnesty international represented by former federal court justice ron merkel and victorian human rights advocacy group human rights law resource centre however both their applications were rejected because they could not assist court in a way in which they could not otherwise be assisted and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by lasry in any event judgment in a unanimous decision three judges decided that appeal should be allowed more specifically that leave to appeal should be granted and appeal heard and allowed at once on basis that 8 march 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible and by admitting it trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice of interview court quoted from a 1948 judgment of future chief justice of australia owen dixon followed unanimously by high court of australia in later decisions in which he said that at common law a confessional statement made out of court by an accused person may not be admitted in evidence against him upon his trial for crime to which it relates unless it is shown to have been voluntarily made this means substantially that it has been made in exercise of his free choice if he speaks because he is overborne his confessional statement cannot be received in evidence and it does not matter by what means he has been overborne if his statement is result of duress intimidation persistent importunity or sustained or undue insistence or pressure it cannot be voluntary but it is also a definite rule of common law that a confessional statement cannot be voluntary if it is preceded by an inducement held out by a person in authority and inducement has not been removed before statement is made court also noted a recent decision of its own in which it had emphasised that principles of evidence strike a balance between rights of individual and rights of state and that on one hand there is an obvious need to bring to account those who have committed serious offences if objectives of criminal justice system are to be achieved and societal values vindicated but on other it cannot be forgotten that those values incorporate rights of individual and in part define nature of relationship between citizen and community in which he or she resides court considered that thomas had been regularly informed by all those who had interrogated him that degree to which he cooperated would determine what happened to him and that given their position as authority figures thomas would have readily perceived that they had ability to change his situation indeed none of interviewers had done anything to dispel idea that they would be able to help thomas court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper as trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in thomas position other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family particularly after thomas expressed happiness at seeing photographs one of interviewers took them away saying we might give you another look at that later comments which were calculated if not intended to remind applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours court rejected opinion of trial judge that thomas viewed 8 march interview differently to other interviews which were concerned only with intelligence gathering rather they emphasised how similar interviews all were same place same afp personnel same topics they considered that inducements offered in previous interviews and indeed threats and intimidation in previous interviews by american joe and others all remained operative their power undiminished in 8 march interview lastly court rejected argument that admissions were voluntary because thomas knew he had a right to silence because he did not have any practical opportunity to exercise right court concluded that trial judge had made an error by separating interview from circumstances and that in circumstances thomas had no real choice whether to answer questions even threat confess or be tortured can be said to involve a choice and a chance that torture may not be applied but it could never be regarded as a free choice in relevant sense ultimately court found that admissions were not given voluntarily and so were not admissible discretion to exclude evidence although it was unnecessary to decide alternative argument court addressed it briefly anyway after considering previous cases on issue court considered whether australian investigators acted fairly they concluded that only one course was properly open to investigating officials in light of position taken by pakistani authorities it was to acknowledge that no formal record of interview could be conducted so long as applicant was in pakistan since as investigating officials appreciated any such interview would be unlawful that is would be contrary to australian law court also referred to a judgment of justice mchugh of high court in which he said that although there is some discretion as to whether evidence obtained where an interviewee does not have access to legal advice should be admitted or not judges are not free to make decision by reference to general notions of fairness court concluded that trial judge had erred in not exercising his discretion to bar evidence from being admitted although it was not necessary to decide point consequences thomas original convictions were quashed however before final orders were made commonwealth director of public prosecutions sought to make a submission as to whether there should be a directed acquittal or whether there should be a retrial court heard brief arguments then set aside issue for a further hearing to be held after parties had made written submissions prosecution sought to introduce as evidence statements thomas made in an interview with australian broadcasting corporation for four corners television program in february 2006 parties made submissions and there was an oral hearing on 1 december 2006 all parties accepted that relevant test to be applied was test set out in high court case of dpp nauru v fowler which sets out two preconditions for a retrial first requiring that admissible evidence presented at trial be sufficiently cogent to support a conviction second requiring consideration of circumstances that would make it unjust to put accused through a retrial however this case had an unusual feature namely that evidence that prosecution would seek to use at a retrial had not been available at original trial through no fault of prosecution since although interviews had been taken at that time they had not been published ultimately all parties agreed that all evidence not just evidence submitted in original trial should be considered when applying first part of fowler test court decided that it would be reasonably possible for a jury to convict thomas based on available evidence so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust thomas lawyer lex lasry argued that delay in thomas prosecution he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to australia and extensive media coverage of case meant it was unlikely thomas would get a fair trial and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody mostly in solitary confinement without conviction which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post traumatic stress disorder court was of opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances and although other factors were considered court ultimately decided that circumstances did not preclude a retrial as such court ordered on 20 december 2006 that thomas be retried thomas was then released on bail with requirements to report three times a week and not to leave australia thomas and his family were in court to hear verdict his mother crying and thomas looking more like a startled rabbit than a terrorist in retrial in 2008 thomas was found not guilty of terrorism charges but was found guilty of a passport offence which carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment thomas had already served nine months justice curtain ordered that thomas be imprisoned for nine months but found he was free to go after taking into account time already served commentary decision was praised by civil libertarians former president of council of civil liberties robert richter qc said that decision was important because pressure is to say well do anything if case is said to be a terrorist case that is unacceptable court of appeal has said it s unacceptable university of melbourne evidence law professor andrew palmer said that i think that it was a little bit naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive i don t really know what they were thinking decision has also attracted criticism conservative columnist piers akerman said that decision has handed al qaeda islamiyah and all other terrorist organisations a major victory and confirmed adage law is an ass akerman emphasised that information about thomas including four corners here was already available in public domain for populace to make its own judgment despite judicial commands to juries to ignore material which may have some minor relevance in their petty fiefdoms conservative melbourne lawyer peter faris qc called for an appeal to high court or changes to laws of evidence legislation saying that this case is bad law alternatively suggesting that thomas be handed over to pakistan since he stated that evidence from interview would in his opinion be admissible in a pakistani court faris also argued that there was an issue of apparent bias arising with respect to presiding judge in appeal maxwell p which could afford grounds for invalidating appeal it should be noted however that pakistani law of evidence does not permit a confession made to a police officer to be admitted into evidence article 38 qanun e order law of evidence faris argued that apparent bias arose because of maxwell s activities before his appointment to supreme court of victoria including his membership of organisations including amnesty international his past presidency of liberty victoria his past involvement with human rights law and advocacy against counter terrorism laws faris drew a comparison with house of lords case which considered extradition of augusto pinochet which was overturned on appeal because of lord hoffman s failure to disclose his links to amnesty international because of ongoing proceedings relating to whether thomas should be acquitted or retried neither government of australia nor opposition commented immediately after case although treasurer peter costello later said that anti terrorism legislation did not need to be strengthened in wake of case and opposition foreign affairs spokesperson kevin rudd said that what is plain from events of yesterday is that government has bungled and bungled badly prosecution of this case gerard henderson said that case highlights an emerging division within democracies between civil liberties advocates on one hand and a democracy defence lobby which maintains that radical islamism poses a real and present danger to western nations on other references category civil rights case law category terrorism in australia
