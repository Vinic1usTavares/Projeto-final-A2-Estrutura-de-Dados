something anything is third album by american musician todd rundgren released in february 1972 it was his first double album and was recorded in late 1971 in los angeles new york city and bearsville studios woodstock three quarters of album was recorded in studio with rundgren playing all instruments and singing all vocals as well as being producer final quarter contained a number of tracks recorded live in studio without any overdubs save for a short snippet of archive recordings from 1960s rundgren had become confident enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards that he had tackled in earlier releases and this coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians led him to temporarily relocate to los angeles in an attempt to record an entire album single handedly after he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard lp an earthquake struck la he decided to head back to new york for some live sessions with help of moogy klingman to lighten mood final sessions were in bearsville where remainder of recording and mixing took place and this created enough material for a double album album peaked at number 29 on billboard 200 and was certified gold three years after its release a single taken from album hello it s me was a top five hit in us in late 1972 and it contained a further hit i saw light something anything later attracted critical acclaim as one of most significant records of 1970s in 2003 album was ranked number 173 on rolling stone magazine s list of 500 greatest albums of all time maintaining rating in a 2012 revised list it was voted number 797 in third edition of colin larkin s all time top 1000 albums 2000 after something anything rundgren moved away from straightforward pop ballads present on this album to more experimental territory and progressive rock in later releases beginning with following a wizard a true star 1973 background thumb right by doing some of recording at home rundgren was able to do more lengthy studio experiments such as using a putney vcs3 synthesizer by time rundgren started recording album he had already achieved commercial success as a solo artist and producer and this increased his self confidence he had also become dissatisfied with other musicians playing on his recordings recalling i d never played drums or bass before though i would hector those that did this led him to decide to record entire album by himself using multi tracking he wrote material for album at a prolific rate he attributed his productivity to ritalin and cannabis stating that drugs caused me to crank out songs at an incredible pace he found some of other songs quick to write too noting they were all basically starting out with c major 7th and i d start moving my hand around in predictable patterns until a song came out recording los angeles sessions majority of backing tracks on first three sides of album were recorded at i d sound studios los angeles engineered by james lowe with assistance from john lee studio was one of first independent units in la and lowe believes rundgren chose it due to ability to work hands on without record company interference and having all latest technology and equipment rundgren played every instrument in turn starting with drums noting it was logical place to start with others individually laid down on top while recording drums rundgren would try and hum song in his head to remember where he was but if i would screw up then i would change song afterwards to fit mistake that i had made because it was easier than going back and fixing it in retrospect rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track being a novice drummer at time but concluded that end result sound s like a band he didn t think his lack of technical proficiency on instrument was a particular handicap saying that people comprehend what you re playing and it has a greater impact engineering album lowe recalled he was mostly working in dark and that rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded i was never sure exactly where song was going until we d put down about four or five tracks in addition to recording at i d sound rundgren took an 8 track recorder and some studio equipment installing it at his rented home on astral drive nichols canyon intro and breathless were recorded here along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs a version of torch song was also recorded but was scrapped due to excessive background noise rundgren recalled that recording at home meant he could spend time working on pieces of technology or production such as programming a vcs3 synthesizer at his leisure without wasting anyone else s time artwork on original gatefold sleeve was also shot in this apartment despite working long hours each day in both i d and at home with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating rundgren said he enjoyed recording experience and wouldn t have had it any other way new york sessions thumb right moogy klingman pictured in 2011 has said for record plant sessions rundgren wanted horns singers everything so i made a ton of phone calls rundgren contemplated recording more tracks to make up a double album in a similar manner but following an earthquake he decided to relocate to new york city and hold a live recording session at record plant with session players basic idea was to create songs with sing along choruses rundgren did not pre plan who would play on sessions but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near studio to turn up and learn material rundgren contacted moogy klingman who would appear on several tracks and later co found utopia with rundgren rundgren instructed klingman to find best session players possible for recording klingman recalled getting a phone call from rundgren late on a friday evening asking him to find a full band by sunday morning he wanted horns singers everything so i made a ton of phone calls klingman said that not everyone could make entire session so a variety of musicians particularly guitarists and bassists needed to be used performers including rundgren himself only rehearsed songs a few times before committing performance to tape in order to sound spontaneous and some of banter between takes appears on finished album three songs were recorded at record plant including one of klingman s own dust in wind guitarist rick derringer appeared on one track and would collaborate with rundgren in future trumpeter randy brecker had been a founding member of blood sweat tears and along with his brother michael who also played on record plant sessions went on to find commercial success with brecker brothers trombonist barry rogers who completed brass section on record plant recordings had also collaborated with brecker brothers in band dreams a further live session was held at bearsville studios in woodstock which used some of members of paul butterfield blues band resulting in two other tracks final track on side four slut was recorded earlier at a live session in i d sound studios and featured previous collaborators tony and hunt sales and guitarist rick vito majority of vocals for existing studio tracks were also recorded at record plant with additional recording at bearsville where album was mixed as in la lowe helped out with engineering we d just put up a neumann and he d sing right there in control room using monitors for playback songs liner notes describe first side of album as a bouquet of ear catching melodies second as cerebral side third as kid gets heavy and fourth is titled baby needs a new pair of snakeskin boots a pop operetta rundgren wrote sleeve notes and included a small operetta that described a narrative between live tracks i saw light was placed at start of album as it was felt to be most likely hit song was influenced by carole king and written in approximately 20 minutes couldn t i just tell you has had a major influence on artists in power pop music genre with music critic stephen thomas erlewine of all music guide calling it one of great songs that provided power pop with its foundation scott miller s 2010 book music what happened calls song likely greatest power pop recording ever made with lyrics somehow both desperate and lighthearted at same time and a guitar solo having truly amazing dexterity and inflection hello it s me had been recorded by rundgren s old band nazz as with rest of live tracks on side four little preparation was done for track rundgren later claimed entire song was rehearsed and recorded in under two hours and horn lines and backing vocals at end of track were completely improvised fourth side was completed by two small extracts of archive recordings featuring rundgren in 1960s first was a performance of barrett strong s money that s what i want by a group of same name money recorded around 1966 while second was a clip of messin with kid performed by woody s truck stop in philadelphia late 1966 release and reception something anything was released in february 1972 white labeled promotional dj issues of lp were pressed on colored vinyl first record on red vinyl second on blue billboard reviewed that rundgren s songs have an aura of being irreverent irrelevant little ditties while in reality they are strident observations and that he seemed to have had fun making album hello it s me was released as a single late in 1972 and reached 5 on billboard hot 100 following year according to encyclopedia of popular music writer colin larkin album has since been rightly regarded as one of landmark releases of early 70s allmusic especially praised album s endearing tone and often adventurous variety of styles commenting that listening to something anything is a mind altering trip in itself no matter how many instantly memorable shamelessly accessible pop songs are scattered throughout album village voice critic robert christgau also applauded album s variety many good songs span styles and subjects in a virtuoso display and many ordinary ones are saved by todd s confidence and verve rolling stone found songs perfectly composed while deeming record rundgren s best selling most enduring work born of desperation one that demonstrates his command of studio unfurling his falsetto over a kaleidoscope of rock genres axl rose declared in a 1989 rolling stone interview that today my favorite record is todd rundgren s something anything rundgren himself has been more ambivalent about album s success and critical acclaim he has stated several times that since he had already become successful as a producer he was not as interested in straight commercial pop success as other artists in particular he rejected a tag of being a male carole king with all due respect he later stated i took no comfort in merely being labeled a singer songwriter subsequent albums beginning with follow up a wizard a true star and spin off group utopia would see a radical shift away from straightforward three minute pop track listing personnel todd rundgren performs all
