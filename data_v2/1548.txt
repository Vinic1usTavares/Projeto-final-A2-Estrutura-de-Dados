polish underground state also known as polish secret state is a collective term for underground resistance organizations in poland during world war ii both military and civilian that were loyal to government of republic of poland in exile in london first elements of underground state were established in final days of german and soviet invasion of poland in late september 1939 underground state was perceived by supporters as a legal continuation of pre war republic of poland and its institutions that waged an armed struggle against country s occupying powers nazi germany and soviet union underground state encompassed not only military resistance one of largest in world but also civilian structures such as education culture and social services although underground state enjoyed broad support throughout much of war it was not supported or recognized by far left communists nationalists from national radical camp and national radical camp abc opposed german occupation of poland and two movements were quickly replaced by narodu a part of polish underground state which also included most members of pre war far right influence of communists eventually declined amid military reversals most notably failure of warsaw uprising and growing hostility of ussr soviet union had created an alternative puppet government in 1944 polish committee of national liberation and ensured it formed basis of post war government in poland during soviet backed communist takeover of poland at end of war many underground state members were prosecuted as alleged traitors and died in captivity abandoned by western allies finding it impossible to negotiate with soviets and wishing to avoid a civil war key institutions of underground state dissolved themselves in first half of 1945 ultimately hundreds of thousands of people were directly involved with various agencies of underground state estimates for membership in armia krajowa alone are often given at approaching half a million people and they were quietly supported by millions of polish citizens rationale behind creation of secret civilian authority drew on fact that german and soviet occupation of poland was illegal hence all institutions created by occupying powers were considered illegal and parallel polish underground institutions were set up in accordance with polish law scale of underground state was also inadvertently aided by actions of occupiers whose attempts to destroy polish state nation and its culture including most importantly genocidal policies that targeted polish citizens fuelled popular support for polish resistance movement and its development during cold war era research on underground state was curtailed by polish communist officials who instead emphasized role that communist partisans played in anti nazi resistance hence until recently bulk of research done on this topic was carried out by polish scholars living in exile history 1939 1940 formation in many respects history of polish underground state mirrors that of polish non communist resistance in general underground state traces its origins to service for poland s victory sluzba polski szp organization which was founded on 27 september 1939 one day before surrender of polish capital of warsaw at a time when polish defeat in german invasion of poland accompanied by soviet one appeared inevitable szp founder general michal karaszewicz tokarzewski received orders from polish commander in chief marshal edward rydz smigly to organize and carry out struggle in occupied poland karaszewicz tokarzewski decided that organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format and in line with traditions of underground 19th century polish national government and world war i era polish military organization it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life hence szp in contact with and subordinate to polish government in exile envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization but also as a vehicle through which polish state continued to administer its occupied territories following polish constitution president ignacy moscicki interned in romania after polish government evacuated itself from poland on 17 september resigned and appointed general boleslaw wieniawa dlugoszowski as his successor unpopular with french government wieniawa dlugoszowski was replaced by wladyslaw raczkiewicz on 29 september general wladyslaw sikorski a long term opponent of sanacja regime who resided in france and had support of french government would become polish commander in chief on 28 september and poland s prime minister on 30 september this government was quickly recognized by france and united kingdom raczkiewicz described as weak and indecisive held relatively little influence compared to charismatic sikorski due to political differences among factions in polish exile government and in particular szp ties to sanacja regime which dominated polish government since mid 1920s szp was reorganized into union of armed struggle zwiazek walki zbrojnej zwz on 13 november 1939 karaszewicz tokarzewski supported that move aiming to include parties marginalized by sanacja regime and supported formation of main political council rada polityczna grp sikorski named general kazimierz sosnkowski head of zwz and colonel stefan rowecki was appointed commander of zwz german occupation zone karaszewicz tokarzewski became commander of zwz soviet zone but was arrested in march 1940 by soviets when attempting to cross new german soviet border in june sikorski appointed rowecki as commander of both zones thumb wladyslaw sikorski polish commander in chief and prime minister during world war ii given that zwz focused on military aspects of struggle its civilian dimension was less clearly defined and developed more slowly a situation exacerbated by complex political discussions that were then unfolding between politicians in occupied poland and government in exile first located in paris and after fall of france in london sikorski s government opted for a much more democratic procedure then less democratic prewar sanacja regime national council rada narodowa was formed by government in exile in december 1939 including representatives from different polish political factions meanwhile in occupied poland a major step toward development of organization s civilian structure was taken in late february 1940 when zwz established its local version of national council political consultative committee komitet pkp structures in occupied poland maintained close communication with government in exile through radio communications and hundreds if not thousands of couriers such as jan karski one of most significant developments of 1940 was creation of office of government delegation for poland na with ratajski nominated on 3 december as first delegate this event marked official beginning of underground state ratajski would be followed by jan jan stanislaw jankowski and stefan korbonski post of delegate could be seen as equivalent to that of a deputy prime minister particularly since legislation of 1944 unlike grp and pkp which operated alongside military structures but had no influence over them delegation had budgetary control over military delegation was to oversee military and recreate civilian administration as early as 1940 underground state s civilian arm was actively supporting underground education it then set out to develop social security information propaganda and justice networks 1941 1943 growth by 1942 most of differences between politicians in occupied poland and those in exile had been positively settled by 1943 pkp had evolved into home political representation krajowa polityczna krp which served as basis of council of national unity rada jednosci narodowej created on 9 january 1944 council headed by kazimierz was seen as underground state s parliament meanwhile military arm of underground state expanded dramatically and zwz was transformed into armia krajowa ak or home army in 1942 zwz ak commanders included stefan rowecki tadeusz komorowski and leopold okulicki in august 1943 and march 1944 polish underground state announced its long term plan which was partly designed to undercut attractiveness of some of communists proposals communists in their increasingly radical what we fight for declarations from march and november 1943 were proposing creation of a heavily socialist or even communist state denouncing capitalism which they equated to slavery they demanded nationalization of most if not all of economy introduction of central planning underground state s declaration what polish nation is fighting for declared reconstruction of poland as a democratic parliamentary state as its goal guaranteeing full equality to minorities as well as full freedom of speech freedom of religion and freedom of political activity plan also called for creation of a central european federal union without domination by any single state in economic sector planned economy would be endorsed by embracing socialist and christian democrat principles such as income redistribution aiming at a reduction of economic inequality plan promised land reform nationalization of industrial base demands for territorial compensation from germany and re establishment of country s pre 1939 eastern border according to plan country s eastern borders as delineated by 1921 treaty of riga would be kept while in north and west compensation would be sought from german territories thus main differences between underground state and communists in terms of politics were not rooted in radical economic and social reforms which both sides advocated but rather in their divergent positions on such issues as national sovereignty borders and polish soviet relations program was criticized by nationalist factions for being too socialist and not christian enough underground state achieved its zenith of influence in early 1944 in april polish government in exile recognized administrative structure of delegate s office as temporary governmental administration this was when delegate officially became recognized as deputy prime minister and council of ministers at home krajowa rada krm was created underground state however declined sharply in aftermath of nationwide uprising operation tempest initiated in spring of 1944 in addition to costly and eventually unsuccessful warsaw uprising part of operation tempest hostile attitude of soviet union and its puppet polish government polish committee of national liberation polski komitet pkwn towards non communist resistance loyal to polish government in exile proved to be disastrous underground state assumed that polish resistance would aid advancing soviet forces and ak commanders and representatives of administrative authority would assume role of legitimate hosts instead soviets commonly surrounded disarmed and arrested underground s military authority members and its civilian representatives instituting their own administrative structures instead in early july 1944 even as ak resistance continued its struggle against germans underground state was forced to order ak and its administrative structure to remain in hiding from soviets due to continued arrests and reprisals experienced by those who revealed themselves 1944 1945 decline and dissolution events taking place in 1943 significantly weakened polish government in exile a rift developed between poland and soviet union an increasingly important ally for west particularly after revelation of katyn massacre in 1943 on 13 april followed by breaking off of diplomatic relations with poland by soviets on 21 april subsequent death on 4 july of charismatic general sikorski succeeded by less influential stanislaw mikolajczyk as prime minister and general sosnkowski as commander in chief contributed to decline no representative of polish government was invited to tehran conference 28 november 28 1 december 1943 or yalta conference 4 11 february 1945 two crucial events in which western allies and soviet union discussed shape of post war world and decided on fate of poland assigning it to soviet sphere of influence in teheran neither churchill nor roosevelt objected to stalin s suggestion that polish government in exile in london was not representing polish interests as historian anita prazmowska noted this spelled end of that government s tenuous influence and raison d etre after teheran conference stalin decided to create his own puppet government for poland and pkwn was proclaimed in 1944 pkwn was recognized by soviet government as only legitimate authority in poland while mikolajczyk s government in london was termed by soviets an illegal and self styled authority mikolajczyk would serve in prime minister s role until 24 november 1944 when realizing increasing powerlessness of government in exile he resigned and was succeeded by tomasz arciszewski whose obscurity in words of historian mieczyslaw b signaled arrival of government in exile at total inconsequentiality thumb right stefan korbonski last delegate communists refused to deal with underground state just like they refused to deal with government in exile its leaders and soldiers in liberated polish territories were persecuted a number of prominent leaders of underground state including government delegate jan stanislaw jankowski and last ak commander in chief general leopold okulicki who decided to reveal themselves and upon soviet invitation begun open negotiations with communist authorities were arrested and sentenced by soviets in moscow in infamous trial of sixteen arrests were carried out in march 1945 and trial itself took place in june that year on 27 june 1945 council of national unity held its last session issuing a 12 point declaration demanding that soviet army leave poland and repression of non communist political parties cease government delegate s office at home restructured after arrests of its leadership and headed by last delegate stefan korbonski disbanded on 1 july after creation in moscow of provisional government of national unity jednosci narodowej trjn on 28 june 1945 disbanding of those structures marked end of underground state trjn was composed primarily of communist representatives from pkwn with a token representation of opposition as a gesture towards western allies with establishment of trjn government in exile stopped being recognized by western allies france withdrew its recognition on 29 june followed by united kingdom and united states on 5 july who decided to support soviet backed and increasingly communist trjn body seeing this as a western betrayal government in exile protested that decision and continued to operate till fall of communism in 1989 when it recognized post communist polish government rigged polish legislative election of 1947 marked onset of undisguised communist rule in poland few independent politicians like mikolajczyk who attempted to form an opposition were threatened with arrests retired or emigrated underground state s military arm armia krajowa officially disbanded on 19 january 1945 to avoid armed conflict with soviets and a civil war over next few years communists solidified their hold on poland falsifying elections persecuting opposition and eliminating it as a political power remnants of armed resistance nie armed forces delegation for poland freedom and independence that refused to lay down their weapons and surrender to communist regime continued to hold out for several years as cursed soldiers fighting soviet backed communist forces until eradicated political representation underground state represented most though not all political factions of second polish republic political consultative committee pkp represented four major polish parties socialist party pps wrn people s party sl sn and labor party sp sp joined pkp in june 1940 four months after pkp was created and pps wrn withdrew from pkp between october 1941 and march 1943 those parties known as big four were also represented in home political representation krp compared to pkp and krp council of national unity was much more representative and included representatives of several smaller political groupings several other groups lacked significant representation in pkp and krp but nonetheless had supported underground state non polish ethnic minorities primarily ukrainians and belarusians were not represented in underground state however jews were most important groups that lacked representation in underground state included communist polish workers party ppr and its military arm ludowa and far right group and its military arm military organization lizard union both extreme left communists and extreme right nationalists saw themselves in opposition to underground state only ppr however opposed to polish independence and supporting full inclusion of poland in soviet union was seen as completely outside framework of state other groups were seen as a legitimate opposition in 1944 ppr would become part of pkwn soviet puppet government structure civilian thumb polish underground state s underground information bulletin 15 july 1943 reporting death of gen sikorski and ordering a national day of mourning government in exile located first in france and later in united kingdom with president prime minister and commander in chief of polish army was top military and civilian authority recognized by authorities of underground state as their commanders government in exile was represented in occupied poland by government delegation for poland headed by government delegate for poland main role of civilian branch of underground state was to preserve continuity of polish state as a whole including its institutions these institutions included police courts and schools this branch of state was intended to prepare cadres and institutions to resume power after german defeat in world war ii by final years of war civilian structure of underground state included an underground parliament administration judiciary courts and police secondary and higher level education and supported various cultural activities such as publishing of newspapers and books underground theatres lectures exhibitions concerts and safeguarded various works of art it also dealt with providing social services including to destitute jewish population through council to aid jews or zegota through directorate of civil resistance 1941 1943 civil arm was also involved in lesser acts of resistance such as minor sabotage although in 1943 this department was merged with directorate of covert resistance forming directorate of underground resistance subordinate to ak departments can be seen as loosely corresponding to ministries three departments were dedicated to war related issues department for elimination of consequences of war department for public works and reconstruction and department for information and press other departments mirrored pre war polish ministries e g department of post offices and telegraphs or department of treasury delegate s office was divided into departments 14 of which existed toward end of war full list included presidential department department of internal affairs justice department employment and social welfare department agriculture department treasury department trade and industry department postal and telegraph services department department for elimination of consequences of war transport department information and press department of public works and reconstruction department of education and culture and department of national defence on geographical division level delegation had local offices dividing polish territories into 16 voivodeships each under an underground voivode further divided into headed by and with separate municipal bodies in early 1944 delegation employed some 15 000 people in its administration those were primarily older people as younger ones were recruited for military side of operations military thumb right 100 alt see caption regional organization of armia krajowa in 1944 military arm of polish underground state consisted primarily of various branches of armia krajowa ak and until 1942 union of armed struggle this arm of state was designed to prepare polish society for a future fight for country s liberation apart from armed resistance sabotage intelligence training and propaganda state s military arm was responsible for maintaining communication with london based government in exile and for protecting civilian arm of state armia krajowa s primary resistance operations were sabotage of german activities including transports headed for eastern front in soviet union sabotage of german rail and road transports to eastern front was so extensive it is estimated that one eighth of all german transports to eastern front were destroyed or significantly delayed due to ak s activities ak also fought several full scale battles against germans particularly in 1943 and 1944 during operation tempest they tied down significant german forces worth at least several divisions upper estimates suggest about 930 000 troops diverting much needed supplies while trying to support soviet military polish intelligence operatives supplied valuable intelligence information to allies 43 percent of all reports received by british secret services from continental europe in 1939 45 came from polish sources at its height ak numbered over 400 000 and was recognized as one of three largest or even largest resistance movement of war axis fatalities due to actions of polish underground of which ak formed bulk are estimated at up to 150 000 definition historiography and remembrance thumb polish underground state monument in poznan for decades research on polish underground state was restricted largely because communist people s republic of poland did not wish to fully acknowledge role of non communist resistance during first postwar stalinist years efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous bordering on illegal research into events occurring in soviet annexed territories in 1939 1941 period was particularly difficult limited research devoted to underground state that did take place was done mainly by polish emigre historians living in west communist state downplayed importance of non communist resistance movements while communist movement armia ludowa was emphasized as being of primary importance in fact opposite was true absence of research by polish scholars along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist poland contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by western scholars of one of europe s largest resistance movements non communist polish resistance movement bulk of western research centred on much smaller french resistance la resistance with fall of communism poland regained full independence and polish scholars could begin unrestricted research into all aspects of polish history scholars who chose to investigate underground state were also confronted with issue of its uniqueness no country or nation has ever created a similar institution and hence problem of defining it polish historian stanislaw salmonowicz discussing historiography of polish underground state defined it as a collection of state legal organizational and citizenship structures which were to ensure constitutional continuation of polish statehood on its own territory salmonowicz concluded that this constitutional continuity real performance of state s functions on its past territory and loyalty of a great majority of polish society were most significant elements of its existence underground state also became officially recognized by polish government local authorities and community with most major cities in poland erecting various memorials to underground state affiliated resistance in poznan there is a dedicated polish underground state monument erected in 2007 on 11 september 1998 sejm parliament of poland declared day of 27 september anniversary of founding of service for poland s victory organization to be day of polish underground state see also home army minor sabotage polish contribution to world war ii polish resistance movement in world war ii polish resettlement corps notes a more widely used term polish underground state was first used on 13 january 1944 by official underground publication of polish underground authorities polish secret state polish panstwo was a term used by jan karski in his book story of a secret state written and first published in second half of 1944 in united states b several sources note that armia krajowa was largest resistance movement in nazi occupied europe for example norman davies wrote armia krajowa home army ak which could fairly claim to be largest of european resistance gregor dallas wrote home army armia krajowa or ak in late 1943 numbered around 400 000 making it largest resistance organization in europe mark wyman wrote armia krajowa was considered largest underground resistance unit in wartime europe certainly polish resistance was largest resistance movement until german invasion of yugoslavia and soviet union in 1941 in last years of war those two resistances would rival ak in its strength see resistance during world war ii for a more detailed analysis compared to them size of french resistance was smaller numbering around 10 000 people in 1942 and swelling to 200 000 by 1944 references
