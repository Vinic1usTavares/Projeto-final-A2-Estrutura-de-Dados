1996 oman cyclone also known as cyclone 02a was a tenacious and deadly system that caused historic flooding in southern arabian peninsula it originated from a disturbance in gulf of aden first such tropical cyclogenesis on record after moving eastward system interacted with monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on june 11 later that day it turned toward oman and struck country s southeast coast it weakened over land dissipating on june 12 although it continued to produce rainfall heavy at times over next few days offshore oman storm s rough waves disabled an oil tanker and damaged a fishing boat killing one person in latter incident striking oman storm produced significant rainfall totals well above monthly average peaking at in dhofar region strong winds where storm moved ashore damaged buildings and local water plant rains washed out roads and isolated villages killing two people due to drowning in al ghubra however effects were more severe in yemen where floods were considered worst on record storm produced heaviest rainfall in 70 years reaching in ma rib flood waters washed away or damaged of roads and 21 bridges some of them dating back 2 000 years to roman era storm washed away topsoil or otherwise wrecked of crop fields accounting for us 100 million in agriculture damage at least 1 820 houses were destroyed many of them built on wadis or dry river beds overall damage was estimated at us 1 2 billion and there were 338 deaths in yemen world bank assisted in a project to rebuild damaged infrastructure in yemen and to mitigate against future floods meteorological history on may 31 a weak circulation persisted over warm waters of gulf of aden between yemen and somalia its origins were unknown possibly convergence of sea breeze along coast of somalia with monsoon flow system produced convection or thunderstorms along both coasts of body of water as it moved east northeastward along coast of yemen and oman disturbance brought dry air from north which decreased convection it moved farther offshore on june 7 into open arabian sea where it interacted with south west monsoon and developed more convection area of thunderstorms persisted about 1 480 km 920 mi northeast of somalia by june 9 it became circular as circulation became more defined fueled by instability from monsoon trough wind shear was expected to prevent significant development although system organized enough that joint typhoon warning center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on june 10 on next day agency initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 02a about 160 km 100 mi from oman coastline this marked first occasion that a tropical cyclone originated from a system in gulf of aden after becoming a tropical storm system s structure became more aligned as it developed an anticyclone aloft fueled by water temperatures of cyclone intensified further at 03 00 utc on june 11 omani city of recorded sustained winds of 75 km h 45 mph and a station on masirah island recorded a pressure of on this basis jtwc estimated that storm attained peak winds of 75 km h 45 mph however a nearby ship reported sustained winds of 85 km h 50 mph and well defined structure on satellite imagery suggested winds as strong as 120 km h 75 mph moving northwestward cyclone made landfall around 09 00 utc on june 11 about 130 km 80 mi southwest of masirah island in southeastern oman at a location named ras madrakah it quickly weakened over desert terrain and dry air and circulation dissipated by june 12 over central portion of country however remnants turned to southwest steered by a northerly flow it entered rub al khali or empty quarter of saudi arabia late on june 12 and continued slowly westward storm s interaction with monsoon brought intertropical convergence zone northward into oman and yemen bringing unusually heavy rainfall until system gradually wound down imd official warning agency for basin did not track cyclone in general tropical cyclone forecast models failed to predict that storm would form impact right thumb map of territories surrounding gulf of aden that were affected by cyclone precursor to storm dropped heavy rainfall in oman reaching in on may 31 storm later produced intense precipitation across coast and desert regions of country masirah recorded of rainfall over 36 hours compared to average monthly average of while salalah reported or 600 of average june rainfall however heaviest rainfall occurred on june 11 and into following day when system drew moisture into mountainous parts of dhofar region a station called jebel recorded over 48 hours including on june 11 farther north heavy rainfall occurred in al hajar mountains where was recorded mostly over eight hours there of precipitation was recorded over two hours offshore arabian peninsula cyclone produced rough waves that disabled an oil tanker crew was rescued by omani coast guard after being stranded for a few days a fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near ras madrakah killing one person in crew of nine near where storm moved ashore storm s strong winds heavily damaged village of ras madrakah considered worst storm in memory cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings including damaging roof of desalination plant leaving residents without water for several days strong winds of over 93 km h 58 mph knocked down 20 trees in rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings across storm s track through oman rains replenished water levels in aquifers while also washing out roads and isolating villages this lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work al desert was flooded for over a month due to storm killing two people due to drowning in al ghubra floods provided grazing for endangered oryx population although many livestock were killed three airports in country were closed due to floods up to four days damage was heaviest in yemen where storm s remnants dropped heaviest rainfall in 70 years ma rib recorded of rainfall and capital sana a reported of precipitation widespread flooding affected much of yemen worst on record for country damage was heaviest in three governorates hadhramaut shabwah and ma rib with lesser effects in three other governorates waters washed away or damaged of roads and 21 bridges including primary road crossing hadhramaut some of damaged roads were built 2 000 years prior under roman empire primary highways were damaged in 16 locations thousands of cars and other vehicles were inundated necessitating boat travel to transport injured residents about of power lines was cut floods washed away 113 power poles and four main generators were affected causing widespread outages storm debris contaminated also many drinking wells and damaged 1 357 water pumps damaged about 80 of shabwah governorate lost water access forcing some residents to drink from contaminated wadis or formerly dry river beds about one third of gabions structures to help with flood control were damaged or destroyed as were 634 dykes many yemeni villages were isolated and entirety of and provinces were inaccessible within governorate floods destroyed 1 820 houses many of them washed away and many others were damaged leaving 22 842 families homeless storm washed away topsoil or otherwise wrecked of crop fields storm also knocked over 37 000 fruit trees and killed 13 000 livestock accounting for about us 100 million in agriculture damage about 70 of arable land in shabwah governorate was washed away floods littered about of irrigation canals with sand many of houses and fields were built on wadis which were swept away when water levels rose floods also damaged or destroyed 43 health facilities and 53 schools overall 338 people were killed by floods in yemen and damage was estimated at us 1 2 billion according to centre for research on epidemiology of disasters however yemen s general secretariat for natural disasters and relief estimated damage at us 200 million which accounted for 12 of country s gdp aftermath after worst of floods ended yemeni government created a flood relief high committee to coordinate incoming aid and relief distribution ministry of health coordinated transportation and storage of goods workers quickly repaired roads and airports in shabwah care and oxfam repaired damaged pumps and wells to restore access to clean water and german government sent a team to restore water access in ma rib governorate widespread destruction of crop fields caused many tribes to abandon their ancestral land many of residents left homeless either stayed with families or relatives or resided in temporary shelters where there were reports of malaria typhoid and diarrhea government provided building materials to rebuild houses in immediate aftermath local red cross chapter distributed about 1 300 blankets 200 tents and 200 sets of cooking tools stagnant waters in yemen caused a locust outbreak in august 1996 that affected saudi arabia for next three months officials used over of pesticide in response to outbreak heavy rural damage depressed regional economy in 1996 and 1997 on june 17 government of yemen issued an appeal for international aid while also declaring four governorates as disaster areas after severe flooding occurred 20 countries and various international organizations provided money or relief goods to yemen amounting to us 14 million yemen s needs were determined by a survey between officials in ministry of electricity and workers in united nations office for coordination of humanitarian affairs several departments within united nations provided assistance as well toward a crop assessment drugs and wheat flour world health organization provided medical supplies to country international federation of red cross and red crescent societies provided 3 million water tablets along with cash and general supplies european commission precursor to european union donated about us 186 000 to yemeni red cross and other european countries france germany italy netherlands norway spain sweden switzerland and united kingdom also provided assistance other countries in middle east also sent supplies to yemen neighboring oman sent 28 metric tons of food and qatar sent us 1 2 million worth of food blankets and tents syria sent us 5 million worth of food aid as part of a plan toward preventing future floods world bank provided us 14 5 million to rebuild roads power and water plants and regrowing lost crops in months after floods government of yemen sought help from international development association to prevent future floods from being as damaging government created an emergency flood rehabilitation project that was geared toward more long term solutions thousands of farmers benefited from improved irrigation and from employment opportunities roads and bridges were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors first such occurrence in country using competitive bidding project was completed in december 2001 at a cost of us 31 59 million international development association paid us 27 44 million and yemen s government provided rest of funding see also list of arabian peninsula tropical cyclones 2002 oman cyclone short lived storm that caused similar effects in oman 2008 yemen cyclone deadly storm that
