harsh opponent of napoleon bonaparte s occupation of his native germany formed in 1809 when war broke out between first french empire and austrian empire corps initially comprised a mixed force around 2 300 strong of infantry cavalry and later supporting artillery most units of corps wore black uniforms leading to black nicknames of unit though some light units such as sharpshooters and uhlans wore green uniforms brunswickers wore silvered skull badges on their hats their title originated from duke frederick william who claimed duchy of brunswick luneburg which french had abolished in order to incorporate its lands into french satellite kingdom of westphalia black brunswickers earned themselves a fearsome reputation over following decade taking part in several significant battles including pre waterloo engagement at quatre bras on 16 june 1815 where duke lost his life however recruiting replacement of casualties and finance had always been problematic and corps was disbanded in early 1820s exploits of brunswickers caught british victorian public s imagination an example of this can be found in john everett millais s painting black brunswicker completed in 1860 painting depicts a

luneburg charles william ferdinand was fatally wounded during prussian defeat at battle of jena auerstedt following prussia s defeat and collapse of fourth coalition against napoleon his duchy remained under french control rather than permit duke s heir frederick william to succeed to his father s title napoleon seized duchy and in 1807 incorporated it into his newly created model kingdom of westphalia ruled by his brother jerome two years later in 1809 fifth coalition against napoleon was formed between austrian empire and united kingdom dispossessed frederick william who had been a strenuous critic of french domination in germany seized this opportunity to seek austrian help to raise an armed force to finance this venture he mortgaged his principality in oels in its initial incarnation dated to 25 july 1809 2300 strong free corps consisted of two battalions of infantry one jager battalion a company of sharpshooters and a mixed cavalry contingent including hussars and uhlans despite a successful campaign with their austrian allies defeat of latter at battle of wagram on 6 july 1809 led to armistice of on 12 july william refused to accept this and led his schwarze schar black host into germany succeeding in briefly taking control of city of brunswick faced with superior westphalian forces brunswickers conducted a remarkable fighting retreat across germany twice holding off pursuing armies at battle of halberstadt and battle of finally being evacuated by royal navy from mouth of river weser landing in england duke was welcomed by his cousin and brother in law prince regent later king george iv and black brunswickers entered british service haythornthwaite philip j 1990 napoleonic source book guild publishing p 147 during next few years brunswickers earned themselves a sound reputation through service with british in peninsular campaign however steady attrition in battles and skirmishes through portugal and spain combined with a lack of political support and financial difficulties led to a situation where unit s imminent disbandment looked likely peninsular war when organized for british service corps was renamed brunswick oels jager and brunswick oels hussar regiments prussians represented a large part of original officer corps while enlisted men were motivated by german patriotism however once oels entered english service they were cut off from their natural recruiting grounds compelled to enlist men from prisoner of war camps to fill up ranks quality of soldiers in oels decreased also king s german legion obtained best of german recruits leaving oels with less desirable ones in addition to germans oels recruited poles swiss danes dutch and croats charles oman peninsular war historian calls oels a motley crew much given to desertion and records one occasion where ten men were caught deserting in a body of these four were shot and rest flogged nevertheless brunswick oels jagers gave a good account of themselves during war regiment really a single battalion arrived in portugal in early 1811 duke of wellington distributed one company to 4th division and two companies to 5th division as skirmishers while remaining nine companies served in newly formed 7th division oels remained in this organization until end of war in april 1814 during this period oels served in most of major battles including fuentes de onoro

to abandon attacks french capture of fortified farm of la haye sainte had left a gap in centre of wellington s line and brunswick infantry were brought along to fill it it was here that napoleon sent

koller and black trousers they were additionally equipped with a standard hussar sword should they have need to defend their guns there are a number of speculative theories on origin of brunswickers dark and seemingly grim choice of garb it has been suggested that black was chosen to mourn duke frederick william s late father as a sign of respect for duke or in mourning for duke s occupied homeland colonel augustus frazer who had served alongside brunswickers reported that black was adopted in mourning for duke s wife princess marie of baden who had died in 1808 and that black uniforms
