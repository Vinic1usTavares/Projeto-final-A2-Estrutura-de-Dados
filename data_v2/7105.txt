begotten is a 1989 american experimental dark fantasy horror film written produced edited and directed by edmund elias merhige it stars brian donna stephen charles barry and members of merhige s theatre company theatre of material film contains no dialogue and mimics style of aged black and white films its enigmatic plot drawn from elements of various creation myths opens with suicide of a godlike figure and births of mother earth and son of earth who set out on a journey of death and rebirth through a barren landscape according to author scott macdonald film s allegorical qualities and purposeful ambiguity invite multiple interpretations begotten was first conceived as an experimental theater piece with dance and live musical accompaniment but merhige switched to film after deciding that his vision would be too expensive to achieve as a production for live audiences antonin artaud and philosopher friedrich nietzsche were major influences on begotten as merhige believed their ideas and theories had not been explored in film to their full extent inspiration for film s visual style stemmed from sources including georges franju s documentary short blood of beasts akira kurosawa s seven samurai stan brakhage s act of seeing with one s own eyes and german expressionist film cabinet of dr caligari it was filmed on location in new york and new jersey over an extended period generally said to have lasted for three and a half years although in one interview merhige said filming had taken only five and a half months begotten was not picked up for distribution until approximately two years after editing was completed following its debut at montreal world film festival it was screened at san francisco international film festival where it was seen by film critics tom luddy and peter scarlet they brought it to attention of fellow critic susan sontag whose enthusiastic praise and private screenings of film in her own home were instrumental to its eventual release though largely ignored by mainstream critics it attained cult film status and influenced several avant garde filmmakers experimental artists and musicians film s scarcity on home video prompted its fans to spread their own bootleg copies a phenomenon described as a copy cult by authors ernest mathijs and xavier mendik begotten is currently banned in singapore due to its violent content as first part of a planned trilogy begotten was followed in 2006 by din of celestial birds a short sequel with theory of evolution as its dominant theme plot inside a small shack a robed

and barren landscape mother earth later gives birth to son of earth a malformed convulsing man he is soon abandoned by his mother who leaves him to his own devices after an untold period of time wandering across barren landscape son of earth encounters a group of faceless nomads who seize him by his umbilical cord upon being captured son of earth begins to vomit organic pieces which nomads excitedly accept as gifts they then throw man into a fire pit where he burns to death son of earth is resurrected by mother earth who comforts her newly reborn offspring before they continue together

son of earth whom she conceived via artificial insemination stephen charles barry as son of earth flesh on bone deformed convulsing son of mother earth and god killing himself barry would later reprise his role in film s sequel din of celestial birds which was also written and directed by merhige members of merhige s theater company theatre of material which included adolpho vargas arthur streeter daniel harkins erik slavin james gandia michael phillips and terry andersen provided additional credits for other characters in film such as nomads and robed figures themes critics have identified several major themes in begotten in interviews merhige himself has acknowledged that he intentionally incorporated these themes into film while also inviting viewers to form their own interpretations of film death and rebirth several critics have noted that begotten contains an underlying theme of death and rebirth recurring throughout most of director s works in an interview with marty mapes of movie habit com merhige stated i ve always believed in continuity of consciousness i don t think body dying means it s over it just means that there s a transformation taking place so what we call physical death is not something that i think is some sorrowful loss i just think that entire universe is in a constant state of change and in its movement we re kind of moving with it in its review com noted that film s recurring theme of death and rebirth might have been inspired by a near death experience merhige had suffered during his youth at age nineteen author and independent filmmaker john kenneth muir pointed out film s ideas of suffering death and rebirth watching this pageant of suffering our minds jump to idea of man assiduously painfully re shaping hard soil of earth to gain a foothold and grow crops to bring life from unforgiving terra firma is this how earth feels to be under our yoke to be shaped to our purposes muir also pointed out that initial scenes of brutality and suffering were followed by cathartic scenes of cleansing and renewal of earth exemplified by passing of seasons author william e b verrone also noted this depiction of violence birth and death if indeed we are to mourn death and destruction of god mother son then we can because of immense mistreatment and suffering and when flowers wilt and then bloom we are offered salvation religion mythology and occult thumb right film incorporates several mythological religious themes including character of mother earth which is loosely based on deity of same name and mary mother of jesus many critics have pointed out film s incorporation of various religious and mythological themes and events from christianity celtic mythology and slavic mythology including creation mother earth and various other religious themes on which events that take place in film are loosely based merhige himself has acknowledged that film was deliberately arranged to appear as part of a mythology author william e b verrone observes begotten offers a non story about primitive myths divine birth and punishment a cryptic passion play about earth s birth and torture told quite literally but meant to evoke a more metaphoric symbolic realm of experience and understanding author scott macdonald pointed out that film s highly allegorical plot suggest s a historical overview of attitudes popular in north america and europe during past few centuries macdonald also interpreted film s plot as death of god and birth and rape of nature or god as nature in their book cult cinema an introduction authors ernest mathijs and jamie sexton noted that film makes perhaps most serious attempt to visualize elements of dionysian orgiastic cultism in combination with gnostic and pagan myths film s opening sequence shares many similarities with various creation myths specifically ones where life is generated from corpse or dismemberment of an originator deity author herbert s lindenberger felt that merhige was redoing old fertility myths that sir james frazer pulled together to shock late victorians about savagery of their ancestors lindenberger also noted film s inclusion of themes taken from christianity such as buried god his resurrection and inclusion of god s mother in his article 10 horror movies too intense even for halloween screenrant s jason stated that film s unconventional storyline was an abstract interpretation of death and rebirth of god earth and man janet maslin of new york times categorized film as being a re envision ing of primitive myths in visceral monstrously immediate terms film critic richard corliss from time pointed out that it contained multiple references to druidism corliss also noted film s mixture of druidism with several biblical stories such as creation genesis nativity and christ s torture death influences several critics have pointed out possible influences for film s visual style merhige himself has cited theories and ideas of antonin artaud and friedrich nietzsche which in his opinion had not been developed on film to fullest extent as well as works of bosch goya munk eisenstein and bunuel in a 1993 interview with author scott macdonald merhige also listed georges franju s documentary short blood of beasts as an inspiration for visual style of film as well as akira kurosawa s seven samurai stan brakhage s act of seeing with one s own eyes and german expressionist film cabinet of dr caligari film critic eric d snider has pointed out that david lynch s eraserhead might also have influenced film s visual style production development and pre production begotten was written produced and directed by merhige with development for film beginning in mid to late 1980s although some sources list date as 1984 merhige had studied at new york state university and soon developed an interest in theater after attending several performances while in manhattan he was particularly fascinated by a japanese dance troupe called which director later learned consisted of a core group that did everything together and knew each other thoroughly on both a professional and personal level wanting to achieve something similar merhige founded theatre of material a small theater production company based in new york city after working on several different experimental theater productions he began developing his next project also initially for theater as later recalled i originally thought of it as a dance theater with live music piece that we would do at lincoln center it was only after discovering that it would cost a quarter of a million dollars to produce that decision was made to adapt script for a motion picture instead of a theater production also as members of company started moving on to other projects merhige had wanted to keep a permanent record of company s work interviewed in 2013 by fangoria he elaborated on how film had grown into a deeply personal project at time it was more of a cataclysmic storm that went through me it became a documentary of this thing that was moving through me i had to get it out there so it wouldn t eat me alive from inside still only nineteen at time he wrote film s script in six months before working on begotten he had previously made several short films such as implosion 1983 spring rain 1984 and a taste of youth 1985 these were well received and gave director experience and insight he needed while working on begotten for development of film s script merhige and members of theatre of material wanted film to be silent instead focusing on what director called emotions on fringes and emotions which they felt that most directors and artists would avoid in preparation for writing script merhige and members from theatre of material would perform breathing exercises as a group then examine experience afterwards as merhige explained we would breathe to point of hysteria and create these moments of panic afterwards we would analyze what experience was all about it was an intimate science group would then write down ideas and scenes based on their experiences with merhige incorporating segments that scared him as well as others that he was not able to understand but had stuck with him initial draft for screenplay was then brought to members of group who also worked as both cast and crew for film where they would rehearse excerpts from script followed by a discussion about what they had just read prior to breaking it down into its physical elements a period of four and a half months was dedicated to rehearsing film as merhige wanted cast in tune with one another before shooting filming principal photography took place in mid to late 1980s over a period of three and a half months in several different locations merhige filled multiple roles in film s production including work on cinematography and special effects latter using a 16mm arriflex camera on black and white reversal film he had previously worked on several short film subjects before developing begotten opening sequence depicting robed figure listed in credits as god killing himself disemboweling himself and mother earth emerging from his remains was shot first sequence was then edited together and shown to cast and crew whose reactions to footage was very enthusiastic with merhige stating i think it proved to everyone that this was an important film that there really was nothing else like it and we were actually going to make it happen most of cast and crew were paid little to nothing with their forms of payment being free room and board and merhige himself paying for all of their expenses in his book film out of bounds essays and interviews on non mainstream cinema worldwide author matthew edwards cited begotten as an example of low budget films outside of hollywood that were both unique and distinct despite minuscule budgets and display ed more flair invention style and substance than your average hollywood popcorn flick a majority of film was shot at a construction site on border between new york city and new jersey where merhige had been given permission to shoot for a period of twenty days when construction crews were not working members of construction site would occasionally lend film crew a hand by constructing landscapes when certain shots of mountains were needed during a scene scenes involving time lapses of sunrises and sunsets were shot by director who spent a couple of days alone in mountains near santa fe or albuquerque funding for film came from merhige s grandfather who had set merhige up with a trust fund for medical school additional costs were paid by merhige from income he received while working multiple jobs as a special effects artist merhige described working on film as being powerful and one that was both transformative and ritualistic that changed lives of all those involved with project post production thumb right film s distinct visual style was accomplished through use of an optical printer which took a total of eight to ten hours for each minute of film begotten had been envisioned by merhige as a silent film depicting a time that predated spoken language and communication being made on a sensory level merhige had previously worked as a special effects designer for various different companies including a brief job where he performed rotoscoping for a disney television show and knew how to create visual effects needed for film in order to create desired look and feel merhige would experiment with reel during filming to give it an old withered look this included running negative through sandpaper in order to scratch it up before shooting still unsatisfied with overall effect merhige decided to use an optical printer but was unable to find one within budget optical printer was constructed over a period of eight months by merhige himself who would use old spare parts acquired from camera stores and special effects houses where he had occasionally worked merhige would later use this technique which he called rephotography in his following film shadow of vampire editing process proved to be most time consuming as each minute of footage generated by optical printer took on average between eight and ten hours to complete this process which removed almost all grey from film s color spectrum also involved analyzing and testing each resulting shot before sending tests off to lab if a particular shot appeared to be off it was changed and often involved reshooting footage most of film was developed in a small developing studio located on 48th street called kin o lux labs run by german immigrant fred schreck no relation to famed german actor max schreck who had moved from germany after end of world war ii merhige had met elderly schreck while he was developing test footage for film merhige had been turned down by various studios where he tried to have footage developed before going to kin o lux schreck immediately took a liking to director and allowed merhige to use lab to develop footage while also teaching him how to hand develop footage schreck is credited under special thanks in film s credits at one point during editing process merhige enlisted his father s input on certain scenes as later recalled during an interview with moviemaker magazine i would bring my father who loves john ford westerns into editing room to see this silent black and white extremely bizarre film and i would ask him whether scene made sense and if it worked and he said none of it makes sense to me but if i had a choice of what made better sense within edit i would use this edit over that edit he was very open minded sound mix used in film was composed and arranged by evan albam merhige hired albam after tim mccann a close friend of merhige and assistant director for film recommended him for constructing film s music and sound effects albam had a job painting houses at time composing music in his spare time before being hired to compose soundtrack for film merhige would work closely with albam on developing film s music and sound effects in order to find right balance of visual and audio cues for film a process that took a year to complete release distribution thumb begotten was first screened at san francisco international film festival before its official premiere at new york city film forum begotten did not gain distribution until approximately two years after editing for film had been completed during this time merhige would show it to possible distributors but most refused to release film as it did not fit into a specific genre making it difficult to bring film to market merhige later recalled when i first went looking for distribution everyone laughed at me saying we don t know what this is merhige then took it to a number of museums in hopes of eventually finding a distributor in end only two showed any interest but both were turned down by merhige who felt that they would not have been right choice as a result merhige became very protective of film only showing it to people he felt he could trust it was briefly screened at san francisco international film festival where it was seen by film critics tom luddy and peter scarlet both were fascinated by film s distinct visual style and brought it to attention of fellow critic susan sontag sontag who set up a private screening at her home for some of her closest friends her praise of film became one of begotten s most publicized reviews and instrumental for its eventual release sontag later brought film to berlin film festival where it was viewed by director werner herzog merhige later recalled that herzog was very supportive of film theatrical was shown for first time at montreal world film festival on october 26 1989 film would later have screenings at san francisco international film festival and berlin film festival in early to mid 1990s its first official premiere took place at new york city s film forum in fall of 1990 it was exhibited several years later at theater in vienna in 1992 as a part of a retrospective of american independent cinema titled unknown territories on october 20 2014 it was screened at brooklyn s spectacle theater as a part of its fourth annual film event film was later screened at third annual horror film festival spectrefest on october 28 2015 along with its spiritual sequel din of celestial birds followed by an onstage discussion with merhige film was shown at music box theatre in midtown manhattan on september 25 2016 during its 25th anniversary celebration where it was screened from merhige s personal 16mm print it was viewed as a double feature alongside director s other film shadow of vampire and was followed by a q a with merhige film was later screened at short film festival in london on january 8 2017 where it was shown again in its original 16mm format accompanied by a live music score from film it was screened on october 17 2019 at rice media center as part of a celebration of low fi analog film series home had received very limited home media distribution after its theatrical release with current copies of film being out of print and difficult to acquire initially merhige did not intend for film to be released on home video stating in an interview with scott macdonald that he had previously been repulsed by home video as a medium merhige eventually changed his mind and felt that original soundtrack mix with which he had not been completely satisfied could be enhanced through medium film was briefly released on vhs by world artists home video on march 10 1995 it was later given a very limited dvd release by world artists on february 20 2001 and included a souvenir booklet original theatrical trailer rare and never before seen movie stills and production photos this edition of film has long been out of print which has led to circulation and distribution of illegal bootlegged and pirated digital copies on july 29 2016 merhige announced via instagram that film would be released for first time on blu ray in fall of that year however distribution deal fell through and a second announcement during its 25th anniversary screening alongside shadow of vampire at music box theatre in midtown manhattan did not provide a release date either reception critical reception thumb susan sontag was one of main advocates for begotten and helped ensure film s release begotten has received little to no attention from film critics with many mainstream reviewers ignoring film entirely merhige was initially afraid that audiences would misunderstand parts or entire film altogether when i finished film i felt sure it would be misunderstood and consigned to underground again i see it as a very serious very beautiful work of art but when it was first finished i was always thinking what if everybody just laughs what if they don t see anything in it there is always that possibility reactions to film upon its release were extremely polarized but merhige has stated that he remains grateful for starting his career with film limited reviews on film have been mixed to positive with some critics calling it a masterpiece praising film s unique visual style and resonating themes others have criticized these same merits along with its brutal violence and running time susan sontag one of leading advocates for film praised it referring to it as a metaphysical splatter film and one of 10 most important films of modern times marc savlov from austin chronicle called film experimental haunting dreamlike and intentionally confounding also writing merhige s stylized nightmare dreamscape is a calculatedly misbegotten travelogue through hell accompanied by a jittery muffled soundtrack of crickets doomed souls and worse adrian halen from horror news net gave film a positive review stating begotten is hard to consume on many levels though in that consumption is also a smattering of brilliance jonathan rosenbaum from chicago reader called it a remarkable if not extremely upsetting and gory black and white experimental feature further stating if you re squeamish you should avoid this like plague others may find it hard to shake off artistry and originality of this visionary effort and if you re looking to be freaked out you shouldn t pass it up david sterritt from christian science monitor offered film similar praise stating that film strongly recalls work of samuel beckett s stark novel how it is sterritt also noted film s claustrophobic feelings and dark narrative writing shot in grainy black and white on 16mm film and then put through a multiple process to bring out astonishing new relationships between shades of black white and grey begotten is entrancing obsessive disturbing and probably indelible angelo from com gave film a positive review he stated in his review in a way it inspires so much emotion on such a deep and raw level it s a moving and poignant film however message it makes is not pretty but if you re like me and wondering if you ve been desensitized after years of horror flicks it ll show you whether you can still feel or not dennis schwartz from world movie reviews awarded film a grade b praising film s visual aesthetic and comparing film s graphic imagery to paintings by francis bacon mexican film critic marco gonzalez called film magnificent and a must see for anyone interested in cinematic avant garde although he also noted that many viewers would likely find film unbearable film was not without its detractors author and independent filmmaker john kenneth muir awarded film a mixed rating of two and a half out of a possible four stars calling it an experimental one of a kind cinematic experience in his review muir praised film s originality and powerful imagery while criticizing running time as being too long janet maslin from new york times criticized film for being too grotesque writing mr merhige s concentration while impressive in its way seems almost entirely self contained with little effort to engage an audience on even level of myth rob gonsalves from efilmcritic com panned film awarding it one out of five stars in review gonsalves who referred to merhige as a bullshit artist as opposed to a true artist criticized film s running time as being overlong and its visual style as being empty and repetitive while also negatively comparing it to david lynch s eraserhead concluding his review gonsalves wrote if you enjoy projecting meaning onto stylish nothingness begotten is your movie rest of us may consider it sort of art movie that gives art movies a bad name has gradually developed a cult following over years and is considered by some to be director s masterpiece in their analytical book on cult cinema authors ernest mathijs and xavier mendik cited reasons for film s cult status were due to its severely limited availability with much of its exposure being through distribution of bootleg copies which they called a copy cult film is currently banned in singapore due to its graphic and disturbing content begotten has been included in multiple lists at various media outlets in

were it not for susan sontag taste of cinema com listed it at 13 in its 20 most disturbing movies of all time summarizing begotten possesses a haunting atmospherically visceral quality that has yet to be surpassed combine merhige s avant garde film style with sequences of torture and unsettling imagery and you get one of most shocking experimental pictures of all time it was placed at 4 on nylon s 8 most disturbing horror films ever made entertainment weekly included film in its 13 of most disturbing and critically acclaimed movies to ever hit theaters describing it as kind of like if alejandro jodorowsky told story of creation filtered through lens of eraserhead in his book disorders of magnitude a survey of dark fantasy author jason v brock listed film at 7 and as one of his favorite radio film and or television productions film s critical success also proved to be a starting point for merhige s filmmaking career who would go on to make much praised shadow of vampire and suspect zero although latter was released to negative reviews actor nicolas cage producer of shadow of vampire had pushed for director s hiring after viewing a copy of begotten merhige was later hired by singer marilyn manson to direct music videos for his songs antichrist superstar and cryptorchid latter utilizing imagery that was heavily incorporated from begotten manson was a huge admirer of begotten which he called one of strangest and scariest films i ve seen and had personally contacted merhige to ask him if he would be willing to direct music video for his song cryptorchid manson has stated that during recording of his album latter video premiered at san francisco international film festival in 1997 where it won a golden gate certificate of merit award it was subsequently barred from release by interscope records whom manson claimed were appalled by it due to its fascist iconography namely nuremberg rallies along with u s military footage and images of a ku klux klan lynching cryptorchid was also beset with troubles and remained unreleased until it was leaked on youtube in 2010 merhige has since become a prominent member of theatre directing numerous stage plays which include a dream play an adaption of william shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream and waiting for godot din of celestial birds thumb begotten is considered by writer director merhige to be first of an unofficial trilogy second film in series din of celestial birds was released in 2006 begotten is considered by merhige as start of an unofficial series second film in series a 14 minute short titled din of celestial birds was shot in a similar visual fashion as begotten as with film s predecessor merhige fulfilled multiple roles during its production functioning as writer director and producer funding for din of celestial birds came through cooperation of q6 production group a collective of philosophers and artists according to merhige inspiration for din of celestial birds came from silent films such as jean cocteau s blood of a poet 1930 fritz lang s metropolis 1927 and works of lumiere brothers as he stated in an interview with turner classic movies i stripped my idea down to its simplest form and peeled my crew back to people i trust my friends a computational visual neuroscientist a visual philosopher painter a multi media performance artist a gifted musician composer and a sculptor painter i then took off to search for creation in its simplest and purest form focusing on theory of evolution instead of religion and mythology film opens with text that reads hello and welcome do not be afraid be comforted remember our origin followed by images depicting big bang then after a hyper accelerated trip through evolution of life and earth it culminates in birth of an embryonic pseudo humanoid called son of light stephen charles barry that reaches to some unknown source din of celestial birds premiered on turner classic movies on september 15 2006 it was later screened alongside its predecessor at spectrefest film festival in 2015 influence since its release begotten has become a minor influence on several avant garde and experimental films and has been cited by several artists as inspiration for some of their works michael pope s acclaimed 2001 experimental film has been compared to begotten featuring a similar visual style and impressionistic mythology flashback sequences in panos cosmatos s 2010 film beyond black rainbow were said to be openly inspired by begotten kyle turner from com compared 2015 experimental film ville marie as being very similar to merhige s film in terms of cinematic style and use of reverse exposure certain scenes in can s 2015 surrealist horror film baskin were compared to begotten in an interview with press visual artist and musician rob stanley cited film s dark imagery as one of influences for his artwork james quinn s 2017 experimental horror film flesh of void was noted by several critics as being similar to merhige s film in style and narrative however quinn himself stated in an interview with nightmare on film street that he felt his film did not fall into same category certain scenes from blake williams 2018 avant garde science fiction film prototype were compared to begotten by glenn kenny of new york times jimmy joe roche s 2018 experimental short film skin of man was also said to have been influenced by begotten film s reach has also extended into music world american music artist zola jesus listed film as a major inspiration for her 2017 music album writing for months on end i had e elias merhige s 1990 film begotten on loop i d sit in my dark room being lit by nothing but screen s caustic frames it was my closest friend during my darkest moments and a scream i couldn t
