indian princess or la belle sauvage is a musical play with a libretto by james nelson barker and music by john bray based on pocahontas story as originally recorded in john smith s generall historie of virginia 1624 piece is structured in style of a ballad opera with songs and choruses and also has music underlying dialogue like a melodrama pocahontas persuades her father king powhatan to free smith and becomes attracted to john rolfe breaking off her arranged marriage with a neighboring tribal prince an action that leads to war her tribe wins war but her father loses trust in white settlers pocahontas warns settlers who reconcile with powhatan several comic romances end happily and smith predicts a great future for new country play deals with relations between native americans and first european settlers in america scholars have debated whether piece is progressive in its depiction of natives and have commented that work reflects an emerging american dramatic and musical sensibility it served to popularize and romanticize pocahontas story as an important american myth comedy was first performed in 1808 at chestnut street theatre in philadelphia it has been cited as first play about american indians by an american playwright known to be produced on a professional stage and possibly first play produced in america to be then performed in england although validity of both statements has been questioned its portrayal of native americans has been criticized as racially insensitive but piece is credited with inspiring a whole new genre of plays about pocahontas specifically and native americans in general that was prevalent throughout 19th and early 20th century play was subsequently produced throughout country background barker was motivated to create a truly american style of drama to counteract what he saw as mental colonialism and american tendency to feel culturally inferior to europe for this reason he looked to native subject matter for play as opposed to other american dramatists like john howard payne who neglected american subject matter and locations although in his preface barker cites his primary source of inspiration as john smith s generall historie of virginia 1624 he was likely more influenced by a series of popular books by john davis including travels of four years and a half in united states of america 1803 captain smith and princess pocahontas 1805 and first settlers of virginia 1806 which featured a more sexualized and romanticized characterization of pocahontas much of known background about piece comes from a letter barker wrote to william dunlop dated june 10 1832 in it he indicates that he had been working on indian princess for a number of years before it was first produced in 1808 in fact in 1805 he wrote a masque entitled america which has not survived that he intended to serve as a conclusion to play in which characters called america science and liberty sing and engage in political debate barker originally intended piece as a play without music but john bray an actor translator composer employed by new theatre in philadelphia convinced him to add a musical score character list published dramatis personae divides character list into europeans settlers and virginians natives listing men first by rank followed by women and supernumeraries europeans an english lord captain

speech predicting a great future for new country that will form in this land score surviving published version of musical score appears in format of a simplified keyboard transcription using a two staff system treble and bass it includes only occasional notations about instruments used in original full orchestral score which has not survived therefore musical elements from original production such as inner harmonic parts and accompaniment are no longer known based on records of payments made to musicians at chestnut street theatre at time of premiere it was likely that production employed approximately 25 pieces which may have consisted of pairs of woodwinds flutes oboes clarinets and bassoons and brasses horns and trumpets as well as some timpani and strings typically however entire orchestra was used only for overture and selected large chorus numbers while solo numbers were accompanied by strings and one or two pairs of woodwinds brasses and timpani may have been used to invoke a sense of military in numbers like walter s captain smith thumb upright advertisement for 1808 alexandria production performances play first premiered at chestnut street theatre in philadelphia on april 6 1808 in barker s letter to dunlop he writes performance was done as a benefit for mr bray who also played role of walter however other sources suggest it was a benefit for a mrs woodham in any case it is clear that performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut performance short mr webster a tenor who played role of larry was an object of public scorn at time because of his effeminate manner and dress and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation causing barker himself to order curtain to be dropped play was subsequently performed again in philadelphia on february 1 1809 although it was advertised for january 25 there is some discrepancy about date of new york premiere which took place at park theatre either on june 14 1808 or on january 14 1809 as a benefit for english actress mrs lipman it was performed again in new york as a benefit for dunlop on june 23 1809 there was a performance benefiting bray and an actor named mr cone advertised for august 25 1808 at alexandria theatre in virginia there was also a gala premiere on an unspecified date in baltimore barker wrote in his letter to dunlop that play was subsequently and frequently performed in all theatres across country it was standard practice in all these productions for native american roles to be played by white actors wearing dark makeup indian princess has been cited as first well documented case of a play that was originally performed in america being subsequently staged in england although records indicate there was a play called pocahontas or indian princess credited as being adapted by t a cooper that played theatre royal at drury lane in london on december 15 1820 and subsequently on december 16 and december 19 piece differed drastically from barker s original and featured a completely different cast of characters barker himself wrote that production was done without his permission or even his knowledge and based on a critical response he read of london performance he deduced that there was very little in play that was his own other evidence suggests that script used in england was not only a completely different play but that it was likely not even originated by an american this assertion is based primarily on three factors kinder and meeker portrayal of natives which reduces grandeur of play s american heroes more vague listing of setting as north america rather than specifically virginia and lack of implications about america s great destiny that was evident in barker s version distinction between london and american versions is also supported by a review of london production in which reviewer cites a lack of comic characters barker s version included several and presence of a character named who is nowhere to be found in barker s play style and structure structurally play resembles a typical english ballad opera plot of play can be seen as a blending of a comedy of racial and cultural stereotypes with a love story and an historical drama barker borrows heavily from shakespearean comedy as can be seen most blatantly in gender disguises employed by characters of kate and geraldine use of verse writing for higher class characters and prose for those of lesser status also borrows from shakespearean tradition it is of note that pocahontas switches from prose to verse after falling in love with rolfe indian princess is also one of first american plays to call itself a melo drame or melodrama which literally is french for play with music like french and german melodramas typical of period score contained open ended snippets of background mood music that can be repeated as much as necessary to heighten sentimentality of drama although some have argued that it bears no other resemblance to typical french melodrama of period still others have said that categorization of piece as a melodrama is accurate considering play s portrayal of genre s typical persecuted heroine pocahontas villainous antagonists miami and grimosco virtuous hero smith and comic relief robin and others play can also be seen as a predecessor to exaggerated emotionalism of later american drama and as an early example of how background music would be used in more modern american drama and films analysis and criticism indian princess is one example of an attempt by an artist of early 19th century to define an american national identity pocahontas representing spirit of america literally shields smith from injury and serves as foster mother protecting colonists from famine and attack achieving mythic status as a heroic mother and preserving nurturing and legitimizing america as a country play allows for an acknowledgement of troubling aspects of nation s history of conquest violence and greed by couching negative implications in a romantic plot in other words romantic conquest helps to soften harshness and brutality of colonial conquest success of play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through pocahontas myth barker also had commercial interests and was motivated by a drive for artistic and financial success in this vein play was an attempt to please anglophile public but create something truly american in setting and theme portrayals of indians in play from a perspective of racial sensitivity have been met with mixed reviews by modern critics some write positively about portrayals saying that other than grimosco and miami natives are noble though primitive and have a more american value system than savages traditionally portrayed in british media of period others however see characters portrayed stereotypically as lusty childlike weak and corruptible beings with exceptions of pocahontas and nantaquas who are portrayed positively only because they accept english values still others take a middle ground noting range of representations in any case play can be seen as a justification of white assimilation of natives especially when examining pocahontas s choice to be with rolfe as a microcosm of their societies critics have pointed out several inherent flaws in script including early placement of play s climax smith at chopping block at beginning of act ii loose construction song lyrics that trivialize characters and a main character in pocahontas that is somewhat stilted and overly poetic in contrast however others have argued that pocahontas s love scene in act iii is where truest poetry of piece emerges there has been less critique of bray s musical work but victor fell yellin tried to recreate what he felt was score s melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it in liner notes he points out that music does not critically compare with great musical masters of its time but its success is derived from its charm while it lacks modulation it contains well turned melodic and rhythmic phrases and syncopations that add to its american style indian princess certainly began a long american tradition of romanticizing and sexualizing pocahontas who was only a child in smith s original accounts therefore it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre but it can be criticized for diminishing potential richness of subject matter historical significance barker s indian princess has been cited as first american play featuring native american characters to ever be staged although barker s play is predated by at least two offerings by europeans featuring native americans including tammany in 1794 by british playwright ann kemble hatton and german writer johann wilhelm rose s pocahontas schauspiel mit gesang in a play with songs in five acts in 1784 at least one american play was also written before barker s published by robert rogers in 1766 though piece was apparently never produced however more recently uncovered evidence shows a record of an anonymous melodrama entitled captain smith and princess pocahontas produced at chestnut street theatre in 1806 calling into question whether barker s play was really first of its kind though no further information is known about earlier piece barker s play has also been cited as earliest surviving dramatized account of smith and pocahontas although this idea is debunked by availability of aforementioned johann wilhelm rose work in any case indian princess is credited as being primarily responsible for elevating pocahontas story to one of nation s most celebrated myths and is thought to mark beginning of popular american genre of indian drama piece is also of note as one of very few of its time to have entire musical score published and available today as opposed to only individual popular songs thumb right edward henry corbould s engraving smith rescued by pocahontas c 1850 was perhaps directly inspired by indian princess barker s play directly or indirectly inspired many other stage adaptations of pocahontas story including pocahontas or settlers of virginia by george washington parke custis 1830 pocahontas by robert dale owen 1837 forest princess by charlotte b conner 1848 po ca hon tas or gentle savage by john brougham 1855 pocahontas by welland hendrick 1886

green 1957 additionally there were approximately 40 plays with indian themes recorded from 1825 to 1860 that likely were directly influenced by indian princess edward henry corbould s engraving c 1850 smith rescued by pocahontas was possibly also directly inspired by indian princess disney s animated pocahontas 1995 is one of more recent of several films also in same tradition as barker s play see
