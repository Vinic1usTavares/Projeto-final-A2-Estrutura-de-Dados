well as films such as wiz in 1978 ghostbusters in 1984 and day after tomorrow in 2004 history thumb left a remnant of croton distribution reservoir seen at foundation of south court in 2014 consolidation of astor and lenox libraries into new york public library in 1895 along with a large bequest from samuel j tilden and a donation of 5 2 million from andrew carnegie allowed for creation of an enormous library system libraries had a combined 350 000 items after merger which was relatively small compared to other library systems at time as a point of civic pride new york public library s founders wanted an imposing main branch several sites were considered including those of astor and lenox libraries but trustees of libraries ultimately chose a new site along fifth avenue between 40th and 42nd streets because it was centrally located between astor and lenox libraries at time it was occupied by obsolete croton reservoir traces of old reservoir still exist on library floor dr john shaw billings who was named first director of new york public library had created an early sketch for a massive reading room on top of seven floors of book stacks combined with fastest system for getting books into hands of those who requested to read them his design for new library formed basis of main branch once main branch was opened astor and lenox libraries were planned to close and their functions were planned to be merged into that of main branch construction in may 1897 new york state legislature passed a bill allowing site of croton reservoir to be used for a public library building a competition among city s most famous architects was subsequently held and 88 designs were submitted of these 12 were selected for a semi finalist round and three went on to a finalist round ultimately in late 1897 relatively unknown firm of carrere and hastings was selected to design and construct new library firm created a model for future library building which was exhibited at new york city hall in 1900 whether john carrere or thomas s hastings contributed more to design is in dispute but both architects are honored with busts located at bottoms of each of astor hall s two staircases in a later interview with new york times carrere stated that library would contain twenty five or thirty different rooms each with their own specialty eighty three miles of books in its stacks and a general reading room that could fit a thousand guests in any case construction itself was delayed by objections of mayor robert anderson van wyck over concerns that city s finances were unstable a bond measure of 500 000 was allocated by new york city board of estimate in may 1899 next month work started on croton reservoir s excavation and workers began digging through reservoir s wall work on foundation commenced in may 1900 and by 1901 much of croton reservoir had been excavated in november 1900 work was hindered by a water main break that partly flooded old reservoir a contract to construct building was awarded to norcross brothers company this was initially controversial because firm was not lowest bidder after a private ceremony to mark start of construction was held in august 1902 a ceremonial cornerstone was laid on november 10 1902 cornerstone contained a box of artifacts from library and city construction of main branch along with that of nearby grand central terminal helped to revitalize bryant park work progressed gradually on library basement was completed by 1903 and first floor by 1904 however exterior work was delayed and when norcross brothers contract expired in august 1904 exterior was only halfway completed during summer of 1905 giant columns were put into place and work on roof was begun roof was finished by december 1906 final remaining contracts totaling 1 2 million concerned installation of furnishings in interior contract for interior work was awarded to john peirce company in april 1907 and building s exterior was mostly done by end of that year pace of construction was generally sluggish in 1906 an official for new york public library stated that some of exterior and most of interior was not finished contractors started painting main reading room and catalog room in 1908 and began installing furniture following year starting in 1910 around worth of shelves were installed to hold collections that were designated for being housed there with substantial room left for future acquisitions it took one year to transfer and install books from astor and lenox libraries late in construction process a proposal to install a municipal light plant in basement of main branch was rejected by late 1910 library was nearly completed and officials forecast an opening date of may 1911 carrere died before building was opened and in march 1911 two thousand people viewed his coffin in library s rotunda opening on may 23 1911 main branch of new york public library was ceremonially opened in front of 15 000 guests ceremony was presided over by president william howard taft and was attended by governor john alden dix and mayor william jay gaynor following day may 24 public was invited and tens of thousands went to library s jewel in crown first item called for was philosophy of plays of shakespeare unfolded by delia bacon although book was not actually in main branch s collection at time this

his book seven minutes later beaux arts main branch was largest marble structure up to that time in united states with 3 5 million volumes spread across projected final cost was 10 million excluding cost of books and land representing a fourfold increase over initial cost estimate of 2 5 million structure ultimately cost 9 million to build over three times as much as originally projected because there were so many visitors during first week of main branch s opening new york public library s directors initially did not count number of visitors but guessed that 250 000 patrons were accommodated
