acetic acid systematically named ethanoic acid is a colourless liquid organic compound with chemical formula ch3cooh also written as ch3co2h or when undiluted it is sometimes called glacial acetic acid vinegar is no less than 4 acetic acid by volume making acetic acid main component of vinegar apart from water acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell in addition to household vinegar it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate it is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack skin acetic acid is second simplest carboxylic acid after formic acid it consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group it is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical used primarily in production of cellulose acetate for photographic film polyvinyl acetate for wood glue and synthetic fibres and fabrics in households diluted acetic acid is often used in agents in food industry acetic acid is controlled by food additive code as an acidity regulator and as a condiment in biochemistry acetyl group derived from acetic acid is fundamental to all forms of life when bound to coenzyme a it is central to metabolism of carbohydrates and fats global demand for acetic acid is about 6 5 million metric tons per year mt a of which approximately 1 5 mt a is met by recycling remainder is manufactured from methanol vinegar is mostly dilute acetic acid often produced by fermentation and subsequent oxidation of ethanol nomenclature trivial name acetic acid is most commonly used and preferred iupac name systematic name ethanoic acid a valid iupac name is constructed according to nomenclature iupac provisional recommendations 2004 chapter p 12 1 page 4 name acetic acid derives from latin word for vinegar and is related to word acid itself glacial acetic acid is a name for water free anhydrous acetic acid similar to german name ice vinegar name comes from ice like crystals that form slightly below room temperature at presence of 0 1 water lowers its melting point by 0 2 degc a common symbol for acetic acid is where ac is symbol representing acetyl group c o conjugate base acetate is thus represented as aco ac is not to be confused with symbol for element actinium context prevents confusion among organic chemists to better reflect its structure acetic acid is often written as c o oh c o oh cooh and in context of acid base reactions abbreviation hac is sometimes used where ac in this case is a symbol for acetate rather than acetyl acetate is ion resulting from loss of from acetic acid name acetate can also refer to a salt containing this anion or an ester of acetic acid properties thumb upright acetic acid crystals acidity hydrogen centre in carboxyl group cooh in carboxylic acids such as acetic acid can separate from molecule by ionization ch3coo sub h h because of this release of proton h acetic acid has acidic character acetic acid is a weak acid in aqueous solution it has a pka value of 4 76 its conjugate base is acetate ch3coo a 1 0 m solution about concentration of domestic vinegar has a ph of 2 4 indicating that merely 0 4 of acetic acid molecules are dissociated h3o 10 2 4 0 4 however in very dilute 10 6 m solution acetic acid is 90 dissociated 375px deprotonation equilibrium of acetic acid in water thumb cyclic dimer of acetic acid dashed green lines represent hydrogen bonds structure in solid acetic acid molecules form chains individual molecules being interconnected by hydrogen bonds in vapour at dimers can be detected dimers also occur in liquid phase in dilute solutions in non hydrogen bonding solvents and a certain extent in pure acetic acid but are disrupted by hydrogen bonding solvents dissociation enthalpy of dimer is estimated at 65 0 66 0 kj mol and dissociation entropy at 154 157 j mol 1 k 1 other carboxylic acids engage in similar intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions solvent properties liquid acetic acid is a hydrophilic polar protic solvent similar to ethanol and water with a moderate relative static permittivity dielectric constant of 6 2 it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars but also non polar compounds such as oils as well as polar solutes it is miscible with polar and non polar solvents such as water chloroform and hexane with higher alkanes starting with octane acetic acid is not completely miscible and its miscibility declines with longer n alkanes solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical for example as a solvent in production of dimethyl terephthalate biochemistry at physiological phs acetic acid is usually fully ionised to acetate acetyl group formally derived from acetic acid is fundamental to all forms of life when bound to coenzyme a it is central to metabolism of carbohydrates and fats unlike longer chain carboxylic acids fatty acids acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides however artificial glycerine triacetate is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines acetic acid is produced and excreted by acetic acid bacteria notably genus acetobacter and clostridium these bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs water and soil and acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and other foods spoil acetic acid is also a component of vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent production thumb purification and concentration plant for acetic acid in 1884 acetic acid is produced industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation about 75 of acetic acid made for use in chemical industry is made by carbonylation of methanol explained below biological route accounts for only about 10 of world production but it remains important for production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin other processes are methyl formate isomerization conversion of to acetic acid and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions i e during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or lactic acid production as of 2003 2005 total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid that is manufactured by intent rather than recovered from processing such as production of cellulose acetates polyvinyl alcohol operations and numerous acetic anhydride was estimated at 5 mt a million tonnes per year approximately half of which was produced in united states european production was approximately 1 mt a and declining while japanese production was 0 7 mt a another 1 5 mt were recycled each year bringing total world market to 6 5 mt a since then global production has increased to 10 7 mt a in 2010 and further however a slowing in this increase in production is predicted acetic acid sri consulting two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are celanese and bp chemicals other major producers include millennium chemicals sterling chemicals samsung eastman and methanol carbonylation most acetic acid is produced by methanol carbonylation in this process methanol and carbon monoxide react to produce acetic acid according to equation 250px process involves as an intermediate and occurs in three steps a catalyst metal carbonyl is needed for carbonylation step 2 hi ch3i h2o ch3i co ch3coi ch3coi h2o ch3cooh hi two related processes for carbonylation of methanol rhodium catalyzed monsanto process and iridium catalyzed cativa process latter process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted former process often in same production plants catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes but cativa process requires less so water gas shift reaction is suppressed and fewer by products are formed by altering process conditions acetic anhydride may also be produced on same plant using rhodium catalysts acetaldehyde oxidation prior to commercialization of monsanto process most acetic acid was produced by oxidation of acetaldehyde this remains second most important manufacturing method although it is usually not competitive with carbonylation of methanol acetaldehyde can be produced by hydration of acetylene this was dominant technology in early 1900s light naphtha components are readily oxidized by oxygen or even air to give peroxides which decompose to produce acetic acid according to chemical equation illustrated with butane 2 5 o2 4 ch3co2h 2 h2o such oxidations require metal catalyst such as salts of manganese cobalt and chromium typical reaction is conducted at temperatures and pressures designed to be as hot as possible while still keeping butane a liquid typical reaction conditions are and 55 atm side products may also form including ethyl acetate formic acid and propionic acid these side products are also commercially valuable and reaction conditions may be altered to produce more of them where needed however separation of acetic acid from these by products adds to cost of process under similar conditions and using similar catalysts as are used for butane oxidation oxygen in air to produce acetic acid can oxidize acetaldehyde 2 o2 2 ch3co2h using modern catalysts this reaction can have an acetic acid yield greater than 95 major side products are ethyl acetate formic acid and formaldehyde all of which have lower boiling points than acetic acid and are readily separated by distillation ethylene oxidation acetaldehyde may be prepared from ethylene via wacker process and then oxidised as above in more recent times chemical company showa which opened an ethylene oxidation plant in oita japan in 1997 commercialised a cheaper single stage conversion of ethylene to acetic acid process is catalyzed by a palladium metal catalyst supported on a acid such as silicotungstic acid similar process use same metal catalyst on silicotungstic acid and silica c2h4 o2 ch3co2h it is thought to be competitive with methanol carbonylation for smaller plants 100 250 kt a depending on local price of ethylene approach will be based on utilizing a novel selective oxidation technology for selective oxidation of ethylene and ethane to acetic acid unlike traditional oxidation catalysts selective oxidation process will use uv light to produce acetic acid at ambient temperatures and pressure oxidative fermentation for most of human history acetic acid bacteria of genus acetobacter have made acetic acid in form of vinegar given sufficient oxygen these bacteria can produce vinegar from a variety of alcoholic foodstuffs commonly used feeds include apple cider wine and fermented grain malt rice or potato mashes overall chemical reaction facilitated by these bacteria is o2 ch3cooh h2o a dilute alcohol solution inoculated with acetobacter and kept in a warm airy place will become vinegar over course of a few months industrial vinegar making methods accelerate this process by improving supply of oxygen to bacteria first batches of vinegar produced by fermentation probably followed errors in winemaking process if must is fermented at too high a temperature acetobacter will overwhelm yeast naturally occurring on grapes as demand for vinegar for culinary medical and sanitary purposes increased vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in hot summer months before grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine this method was slow however and not always successful as vintners did not understand process one of first modern commercial processes was fast method or german method first practised in germany in 1823 in this process fermentation takes place in a tower packed with wood shavings or charcoal alcohol containing feed is trickled into top of tower and fresh air supplied from bottom by either natural or forced convection improved air supply in this process cut time to prepare vinegar from months to weeks nowadays most vinegar is made in submerged tank culture first described in 1949 by otto and heinrich ebner in this method alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through solution using modern applications of this method vinegar of 15 acetic acid can be prepared in only 24 hours in batch process even 20 in 60 hour fed batch process anaerobic fermentation species of anaerobic bacteria including members of genus clostridium or can convert sugars to acetic acid directly without creating ethanol as an intermediate overall chemical reaction conducted by these bacteria may be represented as 3 ch3cooh these acetogenic bacteria produce acetic acid from one carbon compounds including methanol carbon monoxide or a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen 2 co2 4 h2 ch3cooh 2 h2o this ability of clostridium to metabolize sugars directly or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs suggests that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol oxidizers like acetobacter however clostridium bacteria are less acid tolerant than acetobacter even most acid tolerant clostridium strains can produce vinegar in concentrations of only a few per cent compared to acetobacter strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20 at present it remains more cost effective to produce vinegar using acetobacter rather than using clostridium and concentrating it as a result although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940 their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications uses acetic acid is a chemical reagent for production of chemical compounds largest single use of acetic acid is in production of vinyl acetate monomer closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small vinyl acetate monomer primary use of acetic acid is production of vinyl acetate monomer vam in 2008 this application was estimated to consume a third of world s production of acetic acid reaction consists of ethylene and acetic acid with oxygen over a palladium catalyst conducted in gas phase 2 h3c cooh 2 c2h4 o2 2 h3c co o ch ch2 2 h2o vinyl acetate can be to polyvinyl acetate or other polymers which are components in paints and adhesives ester production major esters of acetic acid are commonly used as solvents for inks paints and coatings esters include ethyl acetate n butyl acetate isobutyl acetate and propyl acetate they are typically produced by catalyzed reaction from acetic acid and corresponding alcohol h3c cooh ho r h3c co o r h2o r a general alkyl group most acetate esters however are produced from acetaldehyde using tishchenko reaction in addition ether acetates are used as solvents for nitrocellulose acrylic varnish and wood stains first glycol are produced from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol which are then esterified with acetic acid three major products are ethylene glycol ether acetate eea ethylene glycol ether acetate eba and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate pma more commonly known as in semiconductor manufacturing processes where it is used as a resist solvent this application consumes about 15 to 20 of worldwide acetic acid ether acetates for example eea have been shown to be harmful to human reproduction acetic anhydride product of condensation of two molecules of acetic acid is acetic anhydride worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application and uses approximately 25 to 30 of global production of acetic acid main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give ketene at 700 750 degc ketene is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain anhydride ch3co2h ch2 c o h2o ch3co2h ch2 c o 2o acetic anhydride is an agent as such its major application is for cellulose acetate a synthetic textile also used for photographic film acetic anhydride is also a reagent for production of heroin and other compounds use as solvent glacial acetic acid is an excellent polar protic solvent as noted above it is frequently used as a solvent for recrystallization to purify organic compounds acetic acid is used as a solvent in production of acid tpa raw material for polyethylene terephthalate pet in 2006 about 20 of acetic acid was used for tpa production acetic acid is often used as a solvent for reactions involving carbocations such as friedel crafts alkylation for example one stage in commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a wagner meerwein rearrangement of to acetate here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a nucleophile to trap rearranged carbocation glacial acetic acid is used in analytical chemistry for estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water so amide behaves as a strong base in this medium it then can be using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid such as perchloric acid medical use acetic acid injection into a tumor has been used to treat cancer since 1800s acetic acid is used as part of cervical cancer screening in many areas in developing world acid is applied to cervix and if an area of white appears after about a minute test is positive acetic acid is an effective antiseptic when used as a 1 solution with broad spectrum of activity against streptococci staphylococci pseudomonas and others it may be used to treat skin infections caused by pseudomonas strains resistant to typical antibiotics while diluted acetic acid is used in no high quality evidence supports this treatment for rotator cuff disease as a treatment for otitis externa it is on world health organization s list of essential medicines safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system foods acetic acid has 349 kcal per 100 g vinegar is typically no less than 4 acetic acid by mass legal limits on acetic acid content vary by jurisdiction vinegar is used directly as a condiment and in pickling of vegetables and other foods table vinegar tends to be more diluted 4 to 8 acetic acid while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses but is by far oldest and best known application reactions organic chemistry acetic acid undergoes typical chemical reactions of a carboxylic acid upon treatment with a standard base it converts to metal acetate and water with strong bases e g organolithium reagents it can be doubly deprotonated to give reduction of acetic acid gives ethanol oh group is main site of reaction as illustrated by conversion of acetic acid to acetyl chloride other substitution derivatives include acetic anhydride this anhydride is produced by loss of water from two molecules of acetic acid esters of acetic acid can likewise be formed via fischer esterification and amides can be formed when heated above acetic acid decomposes to produce carbon dioxide and methane or to produce ketene and water ch3cooh ch4 co2 ch3cooh h2o reactions with inorganic compounds acetic acid is mildly corrosive to metals including iron magnesium and zinc forming hydrogen gas and salts called acetates mg 2 ch3cooh ch3coo h2 because aluminium forms a acid resistant film of aluminium oxide aluminium tanks are used to transport acetic acid metal acetates can also be prepared from acetic acid and an appropriate base as in popular baking soda vinegar reaction ch3cooh co2 h2o a colour reaction for salts of acetic acid is iron iii chloride solution which results in a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification a more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form oxide which can be detected by its malodorous vapours other derivatives organic or inorganic salts are produced from acetic acid some commercially significant derivatives sodium acetate used in textile industry and as a food preservative copper ii acetate used as a pigment and a fungicide aluminium acetate and iron ii acetate used as mordants for dyes palladium ii acetate used as a catalyst for organic coupling reactions such as heck reaction acetic acids are produced from acetic acid some commercially significant derivatives acid acid mca acid considered a by product and trichloroacetic acid mca is used in manufacture of indigo dye acid which is esterified to produce reagent ethyl trifluoroacetic acid which is a common reagent in organic synthesis amounts of acetic acid used in these other applications together account for another 5 10 of acetic acid use worldwide history vinegar was known early in civilization as natural result of exposure of beer and wine to air because acetic acid producing bacteria are present globally use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into 3rd century bc when greek philosopher theophrastus described how vinegar acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art including white lead lead carbonate and verdigris a green mixture of copper salts including copper ii acetate ancient romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa sapa that was produced in lead pots was rich in lead acetate a sweet substance also called sugar of lead or sugar of saturn which contributed to lead poisoning among roman aristocracy in 16th century german alchemist andreas described production of acetone from dry distillation of lead acetate decarboxylation presence of water in vinegar has such a profound effect on acetic acid s properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and acid found in vinegar were two different substances french chemist pierre adet proved them identical upright thumb alt glass beaker of crystallised acetic acid crystallised acetic acid in 1845 german chemist hermann kolbe synthesised acetic acid from inorganic compounds for first time this reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride followed by pyrolysis to and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid by 1910 most glacial acetic acid was obtained from liquor a product of distillation of wood acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime and resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid at that time germany was producing 10 000 tons of glacial acetic acid around 30 of which was used for manufacture of indigo dye because both methanol and carbon monoxide are commodity raw materials methanol carbonylation long appeared to be attractive precursors to acetic acid henri dreyfus at british celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925 however a lack of practical materials that could contain corrosive reaction mixture at high pressures needed 200 atm or more discouraged commercialization of these routes first commercial methanol carbonylation process which used a cobalt catalyst was developed by german chemical company basf in 1963 in 1968 a rhodium based catalyst cis rh co 2i2 was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by products us chemical company monsanto company built first plant using this catalyst in 1970 and rhodium catalyzed methanol carbonylation became dominant method of acetic acid production see monsanto process in late 1990s chemicals company bp chemicals commercialised cativa catalyst ir co 2i2 which is promoted by organic chemicals harold a bryan g reuben jeffery s plotkin for greater efficiency this iridium catalyzed cativa process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted monsanto process often in same production plants interstellar medium interstellar acetic acid was discovered in 1996 by a team led by david using former berkeley illinois maryland association array at hat creek radio observatory and former millimeter array located at owens valley radio observatory it was first detected in sagittarius b2 north molecular cloud also known as sgr b2 large molecule heimat source acetic acid has distinction of being first molecule discovered in interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers in all previous ism molecular discoveries made in millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for detections health effects and safety concentrated acetic acid is corrosive to skin these burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure prolonged inhalation exposure eight hours to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes nose and throat at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs eyes and skin may result vapour concentrations of 1 000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated these predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm estimated produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation upper respiratory tract irritation and dermatitis exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of eyes nose and throat with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm has been reported in a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of skin of hands conjunctivitis but no corneal damage bronchitis and pharyngitis and erosion of exposed teeth incisors and canines hazards of solutions of acetic acid depend on concentration following
