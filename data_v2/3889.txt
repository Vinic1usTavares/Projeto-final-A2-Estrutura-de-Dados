purchased a roll for 2000 yen after cutting and preparing vinyl cels they discovered that painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off cels to keep costs low they made their own tap to punch holes in b5 animation paper used in production work was carried out in an empty room of okada s house where their business was also operated while other people were present work was shared and anno akai and yamaga worked full time on production direction was not professional but takeada attributed okada as producer with yamaga directing akai doing character animation and anno as mecha animator takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed but still credits yamaga akai and anno with production itself filming was done
