extraterritorial court as an infringement of china s sovereignty on 15 august lin issued an edict that prevented sale of food to british chinese repository vol 8 p 216 chinese labourers working for british in macao were withdrawn next day war junks arrived in coves along pearl river and notices above fresh water springs warned that they were poisoned on 24 august portuguese governor of macao da

6 gun schooner pearl and a 1 gun pinnace from volage of captain smith upon arrival they encountered three anchored chinese men of war junks whose presence prevented regular supplies of food elliot sent interpreter karl gutzlaff in a small boat with two men to junk which elliot thought was commanding vessel due to its size and superior equipment correspondence relating to china 1840 p 2016 p 116 gutzlaff took two documents that he translated from elliot they included demands for food shipments to be restored and a plea not to repeat poisoning of colony s water springs after a chinese spokesman read messages he told gutzlaff that they lacked authority to renew food sales but was willing to report matter to his superiors gutzlaff responded suppose you were without food for any length of time and debarred from buying it would you wait until case was transmitted to higher authorities or procure for yourself same by every means in your power to which they exclaimed certainly nobody will like to starve and necessity has no law correspondence relating to china 1840 p 449 they then directed him to another junk where a naval officer was said to reside local chinese commander was lieutenant colonel lai enjue waley 1958 p 70 there gutzlaff restated his request to allow people to come out and sell provisions he repeatedly went back and forth between two parties repeating details of conversations with elliot he also took ps200 and told chinese that they would not leave without supplies soon afterwards chinese soldiers went off in a boat to consult with officer in adjacent fort and promised to relay his opinion it appeared nothing could be done unless matter was reported to deputy of commissioner who resided in neighbourhood and leave obtained from plenipotentiary himself after a chinese request to know items wanted gutzlaff wrote a list he was told they could not be procured but items would be given to satisfy immediate necessities according to gutzlaff this was a mere manoeuvre to gain time in manning fort he reported after most pathetic appeal to their feelings and having described disasters which certainly would ensue from their obstinacy i left them and returned on board cutter after five or six hours of what elliot called delay and irritating evasion he sent a boatload of people on shore to a distant part of bay with money to purchase provisions which they accomplished but were then obliged by mandarin authorities to return them in his report elliot wrote that he felt greatly provoked upon hearing this and opened fire on junks in what became first armed conflict of first opium war hanes sanello 2002 p 66 according to adam elmslie a young superintendency clerk who was present elliot sent a message at 2 pm warning chinese that if they did not receive provisions in half an hour they would sink junks when ultimatum expired with no results smith ordered his pinnace to fire after which elmslie observed thumb cutter louisa centre in 1834 at 3 45 pm shore batteries opened fire in support of junks by 4 30 pm louisa had fired 104 rounds elleman 2001 p 17 running low on ammunition british sailed away elleman 2001 p 18 with pinnace having gone for help fay 1975 p 175 junks pursued retreating vessels pearl was half size of junks and louisa a quarter of size after replenishing their cartridges both boats re engaged junks which clerk described meanwhile british reinforcements were arriving including barge from east indiaman cambridge commanded by captain joseph abraham douglas and manned by 18 seamen during re engagement junks retreated to their former positions correspondence relating to china 1840 p 447 battle ended in a stalemate volage later arrived and weighed with armed boats of fleet but night came and put an end to engagement next morning junks were evacuated and with mandarins offering no molestation elliot did not carry conflict further le pichon 2006 p 379 in total three british were wounded a flesh wound in arm of douglas and two of his crew more severely lin reported two chinese killed and six wounded chang 1964 p 203 aftermath during evening elliot and smith discussed destroying three junks and deploying men to attack battery next day but smith acceded to elliot s recommendation not to do so elliot stated that an attack would destroy village and cause great injury and irritation to inhabitants in a letter to trader james matheson on 5 september elliot felt that it would be unbecoming of a british warship to shoot to death chinese junks which his poor cutter could do under their batteries he wrote perhaps i ought not to have fired at all but every man s patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried i am afraid i have disappointed men s ardent spirits here but i believe i have done well to refrain le pichon 2006 p 377 he circulated a paper on shore same day which stated american sea captain robert bennet forbes described event in a letter to his wife a day after clash british were able to obtain provisions after skirmish but they were slightly more expensive english sinologist arthur waley theorised that given corruption of canton navy chinese patrol boats tried to obtain bribes from peasants by offering to turn a blind eye on their trading activities during embargo since bribes were larger than they were willing to pay embargo was enforced and british were cut from supplies but after battle chinese were disinclined to risk another naval confrontation and accepted a smaller bribe from peasants resulting in food supplies being available again but at a slightly higher price chinese commander lai sent a disingenuous report of victory claiming to have sunk a two masted english ship and inflicted at least 40 or 50 casualties this is first of what chinese accounts later called six smashing blows against british navy however these accounts were fabricated and official of events were repeated throughout war elleman 2001 p 15 to understand why chinese made such reports waley explained that any military action whether successful or not was followed by a scramble to get mentioned in official report to throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration promotion or other reward number of alleged casualties inflicted on enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to reward they had in mind although lin forwarded lai s concocted reports to daoguang emperor waley noted that it is unclear to what extent if any that lin was aware of fabrications especially since he was regarded as a man of unusually high integrity by british and chinese waley 1958 pp 71 72 this was first in a series of reports in which emperor became aware in 1841 that canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during war waley 1958 p 72 emperor ordered governor of guangxi liang chang chu to send him clear accounts of events at canton noting that since guangxi was a neighbouring province liang must be receiving independent accounts he warned liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places waley 1958 p 73 notes references cameron nigel 1991 an illustrated history of
