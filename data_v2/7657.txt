local lawyer robert dover with approval of king james dover s motivation in organising games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for defence of realm but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together games were attended by all classes of society including royalty on one occasion events included horse racing coursing with hounds running jumping dancing sledgehammer throwing fighting with swords and cudgels quarterstaff and wrestling booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes and abundant food was supplied for everyone who attended a temporary wooden structure called dover castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what is now known as dover s hill complete with small cannons that were fired to begin events games took place on thursday and friday of week of whitsun normally between mid may and mid june many 17th century puritans disapproved of such festivities believing them to be of pagan origin and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a sunday or a church holiday such as whitsun by time of king james s death in 1625 many puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities increasing tensions between supporters of king and puritans resulted in outbreak of english civil war in 1642 bringing games to an end revived after restoration games gradually degenerated into a drunk and disorderly country festival according to their critics games ended again in 1852 when common land on which they had been staged was partitioned between local landowners and farmers and subsequently enclosed since 1966 games have been held each year on friday after spring bank holiday events have included tug of war gymkhana shin kicking dwile flonking motorcycle scrambling judo piano smashing and morris dancing british olympic association has recognised cotswold olimpick games as first stirrings of britain s olympic beginnings origins first olimpick games were probably held in 1612 organised by lawyer robert dover although different sources give dates from 1601 until 1612 little is known about dover he was probably born between 1575 and 1582 in norfolk one of four children born to john dover and may have been admitted to queens college at cambridge in 1583 leaving early to avoid swearing oath of supremacy dover was admitted to gray s inn on 27 february 1636 and was probably called to bar in 1611 same year he likely moved to near chipping campden with his wife and children it is unclear whether dover began games from scratch or took over from an existing event perhaps a church ale games had approval of king james who in his book of advice to his son doron 1599 had written that to promote good feeling among common people towards their king certain days in year would be appointed for delighting people with public spectacles of all honest games and exercise of arms although there was at that time in england a growing admiration for ancient greeks dover may have been motivated by military rather than cultural considerations his biographer christopher whitfield claimed that dover combined ancient countryside practices with classical mythology and renaissance culture whilst linking them with throne and king s protestant church dover believed that physical exercise was necessary for defence of kingdom he may also have believed that games would bring rich and poor together increasing social harmony an ideal that might explain why event captured public imagination poetry of period games as an occasion of social harmony and communal joy endymion porter a member of court of king james had an estate in village of aston sub edge close to dover s home dover acted as porter s legal agent between 1622 and 1640 and through him james sent some of his own clothes to dover purposely to grace him and consequently solemnity of games james may also have granted dover a coat of arms with motto do ever good as claimed by dover s grandson a claim that was rejected by heraldic authorities in 1682 annalia dubrensia annals of dover a collection of poems praising dover and his achievements in promoting and managing games was published in 1636 contributors included well known poets such as michael drayton ben jonson thomas randolph and thomas heywood they saw games as revitalising traditional english social life and they countered opposition from critics of such events who complained of drunken behaviour and sexual licence by stressing peaceful and well behaved nature of occasion and even praising games as a gesture of loyalty to king games had acquired their title of by time annalia dubrensia was published a name approved of by dover it proceedings while adding an air a gentrification to sports by linking them with olympics of ancient greece having been brought up in a catholic family dover might well have been keen not to draw attention to religion particularly if games had taken over from an earlier church ale proceedings games took place in a natural amphitheatre on what is known today as dover s hill then called plain above town of chipping campden in gloucestershire they were held on thursday and friday of whit week or week of whitsun which normally fell between mid may and mid june dover presided over games on horseback dressed ceremonially in a coat hat feather and ruff donated by king james horses and men were decorated with dover s favours yellow ribbons pinned to a hat or worn around arm leg or neck tents were erected for gentry who came from surrounding counties of gloucestershire oxfordshire and worcestershire and food was supplied in abundance poet nicholas wallington wrote that thumb cotswold 2007 opening dover s hill a temporary wooden building was constructed each year called dover castle from which gunfire salutes were sounded during competitions competitors were summoned to hillside by sound of a hunting horn to take part in various sports mounted cannons were fired to begin events which included horse racing coursing with hounds running jumping dancing sledgehammer throwing fighting with swords and cudgels quarterstaff and wrestling prizes included silver trophies for mounted sports and perhaps also money for other events contests were refereed by officials called sticklers from which phrase a stickler for rules is derived sticklers were so named because they carried sticks with which to safely separate two fighting swordsmen no scores or times are recorded for any of events portable watches of time were rare costly and relatively unreliable devices but perhaps just as importantly nobody in dover s time was much interested in sports record keeping or record breaking visitors from all strata of society attended from agricultural labourers to nobility some of whom travelled up to to attend games prince rupert attended in 1636 other diversions a harper dressed as greek poet homer entertained crowds enhancing classical olympic theme there was also a maze known as a troy town constructed from piled up turf with walls about high through which villagers would dance various games were played for small stakes in booths and tents including chess game similar to card games such as cent a game like piquet king james approved of card games when you have no other thing ado and are weary of reading and when it is foul and stormy weather but he considered chess to be too obsessive a game games ended with a grand firework display centred on castle controversy in 17th century many puritans believed that slightest action might lead to sin and even to hell if it was not repented they frowned on festivities such as games as being of pagan origin promoting immorality and drunkenness and disapproved of any celebration on a church holiday such as whitsun a puritan revolt over a 1627 bringing in may festival at mount wollaston in present day massachusetts resulted in expulsion of its organiser from colony king james on other hand viewed puritanism as a challenge to authority of monarch fine clothes donated by king which dover wore when he presided over games were not just a fashion statement but also a political one feather in dover s hat was a flag of defiance to virtue in puritan eyes and even starch probably used in washing of his ruff was evil according to puritan writer philip he described starch as a certain kind of liquid matter wherein devil hath learned them non puritans to wash and die their ruffs james was succeeded by king charles i in 1625 new king reluctantly consented to an act of parliament for punishing divers abuses on lord s day called sunday act restricted activities that were allowed to take place on a sunday and prohibited any meetings of people outside their own parishes on sunday many puritan landowners went even further forbidding their workers to attend any church ales culminating in two somerset circuit judges ruling in 1632 that all public ales be henceforth utterly suppressed following year charles reversed judges ruling of 1632 he produced a new version of james s book of sports which he ordered to be read in every church in it he wrote outbreak of english civil war in 1642 brought games to an end first revival 1660 1850 games were revived at some uncertain date after restoration of 1660 dover had died in 1652 and bereft of his influence games became just another drunken country festival according to an account written by poet william somervile in 1740 by then games known as dover s meeting were well established and once again quite popular and included events such as fighting it is unclear whether contestants fought with metal or wooden swords but there is no doubt that very real danger was involved during a fight at beginning of 19th century one of contestants was so badly injured that he died soon afterwards wrestling competitions had become shin kicking contests with competitors wearing heavily nailed boots sometimes with pointed tips poet and writer richard graves described games in his picaresque novel spiritual quixote 1773 as a heathenish assembly somervile s account of 1740 games describes a general riot in which chairs and forms and battered bowls are hurled with fell intent like bombs bottles fly graves dramatised enthusiasm for women s race for a holland shift displayed on a pole six young women began to exhibit themselves before whole assembly in a dress hardly reconcilable to rules of decency by 1845 games were being organised by a local publican william drury who paid ps5 for right to do so he hired out space for stalls and booths and presumably sold alcohol at event rector of weston sub edge parish in which dover s hill is located reverend geoffrey drinkwater bourne claimed that up to 30 000 people were attending games by then and that hillside was full of drunk and disorderly individuals bourne also claimed that such accounts may have been exaggerated however as there are few reports of police being called to games and no court records of prosecutions for drunkenness or fighting staging of games depended on existence of a suitably large area of common land but by mid 19th century much of england s common land was being partitioned up and fenced off consent for enclosure of parish of weston sub edge was given in 1850 signalling end of games in 1852 parish s were divided among local farmers and landowners reverend bourne who a few years earlier had complained so vociferously about games received shakespearean connection some historians have suggested that games were alluded to in playwright william shakespeare s merry wives of windsor and used that as evidence to suggest that shakespeare may have seen games but allusion is not present in quarto edition of 1602 making its first appearance in posthumous first folio of 1623 edited by henry condell and john it is therefore uncertain whether or not it was written by shakespeare first shakespearean scholars to make a connection between dover and shakespeare were samuel johnson george steevens thomas warton and edmond malone historian jean wilson has commented that it required quite imaginative leaps such as a hill referred to by bolingbroke king henry iv of england being hill on which games were held more recently historian and secretary of robert dover s games society francis burns has suggested that wrestling scene in as you like it reflects wrestling at games although shakespeare may have been acquainted with robert dover there is no evidence that he ever attended games second

return to being a regular event until robert dover s games society was founded in 1965 except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of foot and mouth disease has forced their cancellation
