guatemala and onwards into el salvador and southern lowlands of pacific littoral plain overarching term maya is a modern collective term that refers to peoples of region however term was not used by

city state by late classic aristocracy had greatly increased resulting in corresponding reduction in exclusive power of divine king maya civilization developed highly sophisticated artforms and maya created art using both perishable and non perishable materials including wood jade obsidian ceramics sculpted stone monuments stucco and finely painted murals maya cities tended to expand haphazardly and city centre would be occupied by ceremonial and administrative complexes surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts different parts of a city would often be linked by causeways

times kings were specifically identified with young maize god whose gift of maize was basis of mesoamerican civilization maya royal succession was patrilineal and royal power only passed to queens when doing otherwise would result in extinction of dynasty typically power was passed to eldest son a young prince was called a ch ok youth although this word later came to refer to nobility in general royal heir was called b aah ch ok head youth various points in young prince s childhood were marked by ritual most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six years although being of royal bloodline was of utmost importance heir also had to be a successful war leader as demonstrated by taking of captives enthronement of a new king was a highly elaborate ceremony involving a series of separate acts that included enthronement upon a jaguar skin cushion human sacrifice and receiving symbols of royal power such as a headband bearing a jade representation of so called jester

jackson 2013 pp 142 144 there was no universal structure for maya royal court instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context jackson 2013 p 144 a number of royal and noble titles have been identified by epigraphers translating classic maya inscriptions ajaw is usually translated as lord or king in early classic an ajaw was ruler of a city later with increasing social complexity ajaw was a member of ruling class and a major city could have more than one each ruling over different districts d arcy harrison 2003 p 114 paramount rulers distinguished

that holder of this title may have been spokesman for ruler jackson 2013 p 15 courtly titles are overwhelmingly male oriented and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty jackson 2013 p 77 titled elites were often associated with particular structures in hieroglyphic inscriptions of classic period cities indicating that such office holders either owned that structure or that structure was an important focus for their activities jackson 2013 p 68 a lakam was possibly only non elite post holder in royal court lakam was only found in larger sites and they appear to have been responsible for taxation of local districts different factions may have existed in royal court k uhul ahaw and his household would have formed central power base but other important groups were priesthood warrior aristocracy and other aristocratic courtiers where ruling councils existed as at chichen itza and copan these may have formed an additional faction rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out in such a setting public performance was vital such performances included ritual dances presentation of war captives offerings of tribute human sacrifice and religious ritual foias 2014 p 226 commoners commoners are estimated to have comprised over 90 of population but relatively little is known about them their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials and their remains have left little trace in archaeological record some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms and these can be identified but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not such low status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain sharer and traxler 2006 p 97 range of commoners was broad it consisted of everyone not of noble birth and therefore included everyone from poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions marcus 2004a p 277 commoners engaged in essential production activities including that of products destined for use by elite such as cotton and cacao as well as subsistence crops for their own use and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools masson and peraza lope 2004 p 213 commoners took part in warfare and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors commoners paid taxes to elite in form of staple goods such as maize flour and game foias 2014 p 161 it is likely that hard working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of maya society marcus 2004a p 255 warfare warfare was prevalent in maya world military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons including control of trade routes and tribute raids to take captives scaling up to complete destruction of an enemy state little is known about maya military organization logistics or training warfare is depicted in maya art from classic period and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions unfortunately inscriptions do not provide information upon causes of war or form it took in 8th 9th centuries intensive warfare resulted in collapse of kingdoms of petexbatun region of western peten aoyama 2005 p 291 rapid abandonment of aguateca by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine remains of maya weaponry in situ aoyama 2005 p 292 aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 ad who overcame its formidable defences and burned royal palace elite inhabitants of city either fled or were captured and never returned to collect their abandoned property inhabitants of periphery abandoned site soon after this is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a maya state rather than subjugate it research at aguateca indicated that classic period warriors were primarily members of elite aoyama 2005 p 293 from as early as preclassic period ruler of a maya polity was expected to be a distinguished war leader and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt in classic period such trophy heads no longer appeared on king s belt but classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives foster 2002 p 143 right up to end of postclassic period maya kings led as war captains maya inscriptions from classic show that a defeated king could be captured tortured and sacrificed foster 2002 p 144 spanish recorded that maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books webster 2000 p 66 outcome of a successful military campaign could vary in its impact on defeated polity in some cases entire cities were sacked and never resettled as at aguateca foias 2014 pp 167 68 in other instances victors would seize defeated rulers their families and patron gods captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned or sacrificed at least severe end of scale defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to victor foias 2014 p 168 warriors during contact period it is known that certain military positions were held by members of aristocracy and were passed on by patrilineal succession it is likely that specialised knowledge inherent in particular military role was taught to successor including strategy ritual and war dances maya armies of contact period were highly disciplined and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills every able bodied adult male was available for military service maya states did not maintain standing armies warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed there were also units of full time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders wise and mcbride 2008 p 32 most warriors were not full time however and were primarily farmers needs of their crops usually came before warfare wise and mcbride 2008 p 34 maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of enemy as seizure of captives and plunder phillips 2007 p 95 there is some evidence from classic period that women provided supporting roles in war but they did not act as military officers with exception of those rare ruling queens foster 2002 p 145 by postclassic native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle weapons thumb lintel 16 from yaxchilan depicting king yaxun b alam in warrior and grube 2000 128 132 atlatl spear thrower was introduced to maya region by teotihuacan in early classic foster 2002 p 146 this was a stick with a notched end to hold a dart or javelin foster 2002 pp 146 47 stick was used to launch missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with arm alone evidence in form of stone blade points recovered from aguateca indicate that darts and spears were primary weapons of classic maya warrior aoyama 2005 p 294 commoners used in war which also served as their hunting weapon bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by ancient maya for both war and hunting although present in maya region during classic period its use as a weapon of war was not favoured aoyama 2005 pp 294 301 it did not become a common weapon until postclassic contact period maya also used two handed swords crafted from strong wood with blade fashioned from inset obsidian rice rice pugh and sanchez polo 2009 p 129 similar to aztec macuahuitl maya warriors wore body armour in form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it resulting armour compared favourably to steel armour worn by spanish when they conquered region phillips 2007 p 94 warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins trade trade was a key component of maya society and in development of maya civilization cities that grew to become most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods or portage routes cities such as kaminaljuyu and q umarkaj in guatemalan highlands and chalchuapa in el salvador variously controlled access to sources of obsidian at different points in maya history most important cities in northern yucatan peninsula controlled access to sources of salt in postclassic maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider mesoamerica foias 2014 p 18 maya engaged in long distance trade across maya region and across greater mesoamerica and beyond as an illustration an early classic maya merchant quarter has been identified at distant metropolis of teotihuacan in central mexico foster 2002 p 322 within mesoamerica beyond maya area trade routes particularly focused on central mexico and gulf coast in early classic chichen itza was at hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from colombia and panama and turquoise from los new mexico long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by royal family prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by city s ruler and as luxury gifts to consolidate loyalty of vassals and allies trade routes not only supplied physical goods they facilitated movement of people and ideas throughout mesoamerica sharer and traxler 2006 p 660 shifts in trade routes occurred with rise and fall of important cities in maya region and have been identified in every major reorganization of maya civilization such as rise of preclassic maya civilization transition to classic and terminal classic collapse even spanish conquest did not immediately terminate all maya trading activity foster 2002 p 319 for example contact period manche ch ol traded prestige crops of cacao and vanilla into colonial verapaz caso barrera and aliphat fernandez 2006 pp 31 36 caso barrera and aliphat fernandez 2007 p 49 merchants little is known of maya merchants although they are depicted on maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress from this it is known that at least some traders were members of elite during contact period it is known that maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions foster 2002 p 320 majority of traders were middle class but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than prestigious long distance trading that was preserve of elite foster 2002 pp 319 20 travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through underworld patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks when merchants travelled they painted themselves black like their patron gods and went heavily armed maya had no pack animals so all trade goods were carried on backs of porters when going overland if trade route followed a river or coast then goods were transported in canoes foster 2002 p 323 a substantial maya trading canoe was encountered off honduras on christopher columbus s fourth voyage it was made from a large hollowed out tree trunk and had a palm covered canopy canoe was broad and was powered by 25 rowers trade goods carried included cacao obsidian ceramics textiles food and drink for crew and copper bells and axes foster 2002 p 324 cacao was used as currency although not exclusively and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing flesh from pod and stuffing it with dirt or avocado rind foster 2002 p 325 marketplaces marketplaces are difficult to identify archaeologically dahlin et al 2007 p 363 however spanish reported a thriving market economy when they arrived in region dahlin et al 2007 p 365 at some classic period cities archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as permanent foundations of market stalls dahlin et al 2007 p 367 a 2007 study analysed soils from a modern guatemalan market and compared results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at chunchucmil unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity calculated density of market stalls at chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in early classic dahlin et al 2007 pp 363 369 380 archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis foias 2014 p 14 sharer and traxler 2006 659 when spanish arrived postclassic cities in highlands had markets in permanent plazas with officials on hand to settle disputes enforce rules and collect taxes sharer and traxler 2006 658 art maya art is essentially art of royal court it is almost exclusively concerned with maya elite and their world maya art was crafted from both perishable and non perishable materials and served to link maya to their ancestors although surviving maya art represents only a small proportion of art that maya created it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in americas miller 1999 p 10 maya art has many regional styles and is unique in ancient americas in bearing narrative text miller 1999 p 11 finest surviving maya art dates to late classic period miller 1999 p 105 maya exhibited a preference for colour green or blue green and used same word for colours blue and green correspondingly they placed high value on apple green jade and other greenstones associating them with sun god k inich ajau they sculpted artefacts that included fine tesserae and beads to carved heads weighing miller 1999 pp 73 75 maya nobility practised dental modification and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade such as that of k inich king of palenque miller 1999 p 75 maya stone sculpture emerged into archaeological record as a fully developed tradition suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood because of of wood corpus of maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared few wooden artefacts that have survived include three dimensional sculptures and hieroglyphic panels miller 1999 pp 78 80 stone maya stelae are widespread in city sites often paired with low circular stones referred to as altars in literature miller 1999 pp 9 80 stone sculpture also took other forms such as limestone relief panels at palenque and piedras negras miller 1999 pp 80 81 at yaxchilan dos pilas copan and other sites stone stairways were decorated with sculpture miller 1999 pp 80 81 sharer and traxler 2006 p 340 hieroglyphic stairway at copan comprises longest surviving maya hieroglyphic text and consists of 2 200 individual glyphs sharer and traxler 2006 p 340 largest maya sculptures consisted of architectural facades crafted from stucco rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on wall and three dimensional form was built up using small stones finally this was coated with stucco and moulded into finished form human body forms were first modelled in stucco with their costumes added afterwards final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted miller 1999 p 84 giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple facades by late preclassic and such decoration continued into classic period estrada belli pp 44 103 04 maya had a long tradition of mural painting rich polychrome murals have been excavated at san bartolo dating to between 300 and 200 bc saturno stuart and beltran 2006 1281 82 walls were coated with plaster and polychrome designs were painted onto smooth finish majority of such murals have not survived but early classic tombs painted in cream red and black have been excavated at caracol rio azul and tikal among best preserved murals are a full size series of late classic paintings at bonampak miller 1999 pp 84 85 flint chert and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in maya culture but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools miller 1999 p 83 eccentric flints are among finest lithic artefacts produced by ancient maya sharer and traxler 2006 p 45 they were technically very challenging to produce requiring considerable skill on part of artisan large obsidian eccentrics can measure over in length williams 2010 their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human animal and geometric forms associated with maya religion museum of archaeology and ethnology eccentric flints show a great variety of forms such as crescents crosses snakes and scorpions thompson 1990 p 147 largest and most elaborate examples display multiple human heads with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger one miller 1999 p 228 maya textiles are very poorly represented in archaeological record although by comparison with other pre columbian cultures such as aztecs and andean region it is likely that they were high value items miller 1999 pp 86 87 a few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists but best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media such as painted murals or ceramics such secondary representations show elite of maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths generally these would have been cotton but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown miller 1999 p 87 ceramics are most commonly surviving type of maya art maya had no knowledge of potter s wheel and maya vessels were built up by coiling rolled strips of clay into desired form maya pottery was not glazed although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing maya ceramics were painted with clay slips blended with minerals and coloured clays ancient maya firing techniques have yet to be replicated miller 1999 p 86 a quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from late classic tombs on jaina island in northern yucatan they stand from high and were hand modelled with exquisite detail sharer and traxler 2006 p 378 ik style polychrome ceramic corpus including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels originated in late classic motul de san jose it includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks one of most distinctive features is realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life subject matter of vessels includes courtly life from peten region in 8th century ad such as diplomatic meetings feasting bloodletting scenes of warriors and sacrifice of prisoners of war reents budet et al 2007 pp 1417 18 bone both human and animal was also sculpted human bones may have been trophies or relics of ancestors miller 1999 p 78 maya valued shells and worked them to remove white exterior and spines to reveal fine orange interior miller 1999 p 77 around 10th century ad metallurgy arrived in mesoamerica from south america and maya began to make small objects in gold silver and copper maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads bells and discs in last centuries before spanish conquest maya began to use lost wax method to cast small metal pieces miller 1999 p 76 one poorly studied area of maya folk art is graffiti hutson 2011 p 403 additional graffiti not part of planned decoration was incised into stucco of interior walls floors and benches in a wide variety of buildings including temples residences and storerooms graffiti has been recorded at 51 maya sites particularly clustered in peten basin and southern campeche and chenes region of northwestern yucatan at tikal where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded subject matter includes drawings of temples people deities animals banners litters and thrones graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly with drawings overlapping each other and display a mix of crude untrained art and examples by artists who were familiar with classic period artistic conventions hutson 2011 pp 405 06 architecture thumb right reconstruction of urban core of tikal in 8th century ad maya produced a vast array of structures and have left an extensive architectural legacy maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts masonry architecture built by maya evidences craft specialization in maya society centralised organization and political means to mobilize a large workforce it is estimated that a large elite residence at copan required an estimated 10 686 man days to build which compares to 67 man days for a commoner s hut foster 2002 p 215 abrams 1994 pp 60 130 it is further estimated that 65 of labour required to build noble residence was used in quarrying transporting and finishing of stone used in construction and 24 of labour was required for manufacture and application of limestone based plaster altogether it is estimated that two to three months were required for construction of residence for this single noble at copan using between 80 and 130 full time labourers a classic period city like tikal was spread over with an urban core covering labour required to build such a city was immense running into many millions of man days most massive structures ever erected by maya were built during preclassic period foster 2002 pp 216 17 craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by late preclassic and would have required planners and architects foster 2002 p 216 urban design maya cities were not formally planned and were subject to irregular expansion with haphazard addition of palaces temples and other buildings olmedo vera 1997 p 34 most maya cities tended to grow outwards from core and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture miller 1999 p 25 maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes centres of all maya cities featured sacred precincts sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls schele and mathews 1999 p 23 these precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes sculpted monuments were raised to record deeds of ruling dynasty city centres also featured plazas sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools schele and mathews 1999 p 24 frequently causeways linked centre to outlying areas of city some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in outlying areas of city which served as sacred centres for non royal lineages areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art ceremonial centre of maya city was where ruling elite lived and where administrative functions of city were performed together with religious ceremonies it was also where inhabitants of city gathered for public activities elite residential complexes occupied best land around city centre while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from ceremonial centre residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above level of rain season floodwaters olmedo vera 1997 p 35 building materials and methods thumb right fired bricks with animal designs from comalcalco maya built their cities with neolithic technology foster 2002 p 238 they built their structures from both perishable materials and from stone exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources and this also affected building style across a broad swathe of maya area limestone was immediately available local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut but hardens with exposure there was great variety in quality of limestone with good quality stone available in usumacinta region in northern yucatan limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality volcanic tuff was used at copan and nearby quirigua employed sandstone hohmann 2011 p 195 in comalcalco where suitable stone was not available locally foster 2002 p 239 fired bricks were employed limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement plaster and stucco lime based cement was used to seal stonework in place and stone blocks were fashioned using rope and water abrasion and with obsidian tools maya did not employ a functional wheel so all loads were transported on litters barges or rolled on logs heavy loads were lifted with rope but probably without employing pulleys wood was used for beams and for lintels even in masonry structures foster 2002 pp 238 39 throughout maya history common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch adobe was also applied this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over woven stick walls of huts like wood and thatch adobe was used throughout maya history even after development of masonry structures in southern maya area adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available principal construction types great cities of maya civilization were composed of pyramid temples palaces ballcourts causeways patios and plazas some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls exteriors of most buildings were painted either in one or multiple colours or with imagery many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs fuente staines cicero and arellano hernandez 1999 p 142 palaces and acropoleis thumb right terminal classic palace complex at sayil in northern and traxler 2006 p 546 these complexes were usually located in site core beside a principal plaza maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a range structure term acropolis in a maya context refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds they generally extended horizontally as opposed to towering maya pyramids and often had restricted access some structures in maya acropoleis supported roof combs rooms often had stone benches used for sleeping and holes indicate where curtains once hung large palaces such as at palenque could be fitted with a water supply and sweat baths were often found within complex or nearby during early classic rulers were sometimes buried underneath acropolis complex foster 2002 p 232 some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms in royal palace of palenque there were a number of throne rooms that were used for important events including inauguration of new kings christie 2003 pp 315 16 palaces are usually arranged around one or more courtyards with their facades facing inwards some examples are adorned with sculpture christie 2003 p 316 some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as royal residences of named rulers there is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences and that a range of courtly activities took place in them including audiences formal receptions and important rituals christie 2003 p 315 pyramids and temples thumb right temple i at tikal was a funerary temple in honour of king jasaw chan k awiil i sharer and traxler 2006 pp 395 397 temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as k uh nah meaning god s house temples were raised on platforms most often upon a pyramid earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms by late preclassic period their walls were of stone and development of corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch by classic period temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended height of temple and served as a foundation for monumental art temple shrines contained between one and three rooms and were dedicated to important deities such a deity might be one of patron gods of city or a deified ancestor foster 2002 p 231 in general freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors miller 1999 p 32 e groups and observatories maya were keen observers of sun stars and planets e groups were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in maya region they take their names from group e at uaxactun doyle 2012 p 358 they consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure and were used to mark solstices and equinoxes earliest examples date to preclassic period demarest 2004 p 201 lost world complex at tikal started out as an e group built towards end of middle preclassic drew 1999 p 186 laporte and fialko 1994 p 336 due to its nature basic layout of an e group was constant a structure was built on west side of a plaza it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing cardinal directions it faced east across plaza to three small temples on far side from west pyramid sun was seen to rise over these temples on solstices and equinoxes foster 2002 p 235 e groups were raised across central and southern maya area for over a millennium not all were properly aligned as observatories and their function may have been symbolic foster 2002 pp 235 36 as well as e groups maya built other structures dedicated to observing movements of celestial bodies many maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies including planet venus and various constellations caracol structure at chichen itza was a circular multi level edifice with a conical superstructure it has slit windows that marked movements of venus at copan a pair of stelae were raised to mark position of setting sun at equinoxes triadic pyramids thumb right model of a triadic pyramid at caracol belize triadic pyramids first appeared in preclassic they consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward facing buildings all mounted upon a single basal platform largest known triadic pyramid was built at el mirador in peten basin it covers an area six times as large as that covered by temple iv largest pyramid at tikal sharer and traxler 2006 p 253 three superstructures all have stairways leading up from central plaza on top of basal platform coe 1999 p 77 no securely established forerunners of triadic groups are known but they may have developed from eastern range building of e group complexes hansen 1998 p 78 triadic form was predominant architectural form in peten region during late preclassic forsyth 1993 p 113 szymanski 2013 pp 23 37 examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites valdes

found at uaxactun caracol seibal nakum tikal and palenque hansen 1998 p 80 q umarkaj example is only one that has been dated to postclassic period szymanski 2013 p 35 triple temple form of triadic pyramid appears to be related to maya mythology hansen 1991 p 166 ballcourts ballcourt is a distinctive pan mesoamerican form of architecture although majority of maya ballcourts date to classic period colas and voss 2011 p 186 earliest examples appeared around 1000 bc in northwestern yucatan during middle preclassic sharer and traxler 2006 p 207 by time of spanish contact ballcourts were only in use in guatemalan highlands at cities such as q umarkaj and iximche throughout maya history ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an i shape with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones foster 2002 p 233 central playing area usually measures between long and is flanked by two lateral structures that stood up to high colas and voss 2011 p 189

by wide with walls standing high coe 1999 p 175 regional architectural styles although maya cities shared many common features there was considerable variation in architectural style foster 2002 p 223 such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials climate topography and local preferences in late classic these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles foster 2002 p 224 central peten central peten style of architecture is modelled after great city of tikal style is characterised by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb and accessed by a single doorway additional features are use of stela altar pairings and decoration of architectural facades lintels and roof combs with relief sculptures of

northwestern yucatan during terminal classic it spread beyond this core region across northern yucatan peninsula puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement resulting in stronger walls and also strengthened their corbel arches foster 2002 pp 224 25 this allowed puuc style cities to build freestanding entrance archways upper facades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic fashion erected as facing over core forming elaborate compositions of long nosed deities such as rain god and principal bird deity motifs also included geometric patterns lattices and spools possibly influenced by styles from highland oaxaca outside maya area in contrast lower facades were left undecorated roof combs were relatively uncommon at puuc sites foster 2002 p 225 chenes chenes style is very similar to puuc style but predates use of mosaic facades of puuc region it featured fully adorned facades on both upper and lower sections of structures some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities identifying doorways as entrances to supernatural realm some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels fuente staines

false towers are only found in rio bec region rio bec sites include chicanna and xpuhil usumacinta usumacinta style developed in hilly terrain of usumacinta drainage cities took advantage of hillsides to support their major architecture as at palenque and yaxchilan sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples as in peten roof combs adorned principal structures palaces had multiple entrances that used post and lintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting many sites erected stelae but palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings language thumb map of mayan language migration routes before 2000 bc maya spoke a single language dubbed proto mayan by linguists foster 2002 p 274 linguistic analysis of reconstructed proto mayan vocabulary suggests that original proto mayan homeland was in western or northern guatemalan highlands although evidence is not conclusive proto mayan diverged during preclassic period to form major mayan language groups that make up family including greater k iche an greater q tz ch olan and yucatecan sharer and traxler 2006 p 26 these groups diverged further during pre columbian era

stuart and beltran 2006 p 1282 however this is preceded by several other mesoamerican writing systems such as epi olmec and zapotec scripts early maya script had appeared on pacific coast of guatemala by late 1st century ad or early 2nd century love 2007 p 293 schieber and corzo 2010 p 2 similarities between isthmian script and early maya script of pacific coast suggest that two systems developed in tandem sharer and traxler 2006 p 225 by about ad 250 maya script had become a more formalised and consistent writing system kettunen and helmke 2008 p 10 catholic church and colonial officials notably bishop diego de landa destroyed maya texts wherever they found them and with them knowledge of maya writing but by chance three uncontested pre columbian books dated to postclassic period have been preserved these are known as madrid codex dresden codex and paris codex sharer and traxler 2006 p 126 foster 2002 p 297 a few pages survive from a fourth grolier codex whose authenticity is disputed archaeology conducted at maya sites often reveals other fragments rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices these tantalizing remains are however too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived most of organic material having decayed sharer and traxler 2006 p 129 in reference to few extant maya writings michael d coe stated most surviving pre columbian maya writing dates to classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from maya sites such as stelae or on ceramics vessels other media include aforementioned codices stucco facades frescoes wooden lintels cave walls and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials including bone shell obsidian and jade writing system maya writing system often called hieroglyphs from a superficial resemblance to ancient egyptian writing ellsworth hamann 2008 pp 6 7 is a logosyllabic writing system combining a syllabary of phonetic signs representing syllables with logogram representing entire words tanaka 2008 pp 30 53 among writing systems of pre columbian new world maya script most closely represents spoken language macri and looper 2003 p 5 at any one time no more than around 500 glyphs were in use some 200 of which including variations were phonetic maya script was in use up to arrival of europeans its use peaking during classic period sharer and traxler 2006 pp 120 123 in excess of 10 000 individual texts have been recovered mostly inscribed on stone monuments lintels stelae and ceramics kettunen and helmke 2008 p 6 maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree bark generally now known by its nahuatl language name used to produce codices miller and taube 1993 p 131 tobin 2001 skill and knowledge of maya writing persisted among segments of population right up to spanish conquest knowledge was subsequently lost as a result of impact of conquest on maya society sharer and traxler 2006 p 120 decipherment and recovery of knowledge of maya writing has been a long and laborious process coe 1994 pp 245 46 some elements were first deciphered in late 19th and early 20th century mostly parts having to do with numbers maya calendar and astronomy sharer and traxler 2006 pp 135 36 major breakthroughs were made from 1950s to 1970s and accelerated rapidly thereafter foster 2002 pp 271 72 by end of 20th century scholars were able to read majority of maya texts and ongoing work continues to further illuminate content macri and looper 2003 p 11 kettunen helmke 2014 p 9 logosyllabic script thumb right reading order of maya hieroglyphic text basic unit of maya logosyllabic text is glyph block which transcribes a word or phrase block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form glyph block with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern for ease of reference epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically and top to bottom numerically thus any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified c4 would be third block counting from left and fourth block counting downwards if a monument or artefact has more than one inscription column labels are not repeated rather they continue in alphabetic series if there are more than 26 columns labelling continues as a b etc numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text kettunen helmke 2014 p 16 although mayan text may be laid out in varying manners generally it is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks reading order of text starts at top left block a1 continues to second block in double column b1 then drops down a row and starts again from left half of double column a2 and thus continues in zig zag fashion once bottom is reached inscription continues from top left of next double column where an inscription ends in a single unpaired column this final column is usually read straight downwards individual glyph blocks may be composed of a number of elements these consist of main sign and any affixes main signs represent major element of block and may be a noun verb adverb adjective or phonetic sign some main signs are abstract some are pictures of object they represent and others are head variants personifications of word they represent affixes are smaller rectangular elements usually attached to a main sign although a block may be composed entirely of affixes affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements including nouns verbs verbal suffixes prepositions pronouns and more small sections of a main sign could be used to represent whole main sign and maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements kettunen helmke 2014 pp 24 25 writing tools although archaeological record does not provide examples of brushes or pens analysis of ink strokes on postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair a classic period sculpture from copan honduras depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell webster et al 1989 p 55 excavations at aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from residences of elite status scribes including palettes and mortars and scribes and literacy commoners were illiterate scribes were drawn from elite it is not known if all members of aristocracy could read and write although at least some women could since there are representations of female scribes in maya art foster 2002 p 331 maya scribes were called aj tz ib meaning one who writes or paints sharer and traxler 2006 p 123 there were probably scribal schools where members of aristocracy were taught to write drew 1999 p 322 scribal activity is identifiable in archaeological record jasaw chan k awiil i king of tikal was interred with his paint pot some junior members of copan royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements a palace at copan has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding ink pots drew 1999 p 323 although not much is known about maya scribes some did sign their work both on ceramics and on stone sculpture usually only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture eight sculptors signed one stela at piedras negras however most works remained unsigned by their artists foster 2002 p 278 mathematics in common with other mesoamerican civilizations maya used a base 20 vigesimal system foster 2002 p 249 bar and dot counting system that is base of maya numerals was in use in mesoamerica by 1000 bc blume 2011 p 53 maya adopted it by late preclassic and added symbol for zero blume 2011 p 53 sharer and traxler 2006 p 101 this may have been earliest known occurrence of idea of an explicit zero worldwide sharer and traxler 2006 p 101 justeson 2010 p 46 although it may have been predated by babylonian system justeson 2010 p 46 earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 ad justeson 2010 p 49 in its earliest uses zero served as a place holder indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count this later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation justeson 2010 p 50 and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years until writing system was extinguished by spanish justeson 2010 p 52 basic number system consists of a dot to represent one and a bar to represent five foster 2002 p 248 by postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero during classic period other glyphs were used foster 2002 p 248 sharer and traxler 2006 p 101 maya numerals from 0 to 19 used repetitions of these symbols value of a numeral was determined by its position as a numeral shifted upwards its basic value multiplied by twenty in this way lowest symbol would represent units next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty and symbol above that would represent multiples of 400 and so on for example number 884 would be written with four dots on lowest level four dots on next level up and two dots on next level after that to give 884 using this system maya were able to record huge numbers simple addition could be performed by summing dots and bars in two columns to give result in a third column sharer and traxler 2006 p 101 calendar maya calendrical system in common with other mesoamerican calendars had its origins in preclassic period however it was maya that developed calendar to its maximum sophistication recording lunar and solar cycles eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy in some cases maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in old world for example maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than julian year maya calendar was intrinsically tied to maya ritual and it was central to maya religious practices foster 2002 p 250 calendar combined a non repeating long count with three interlocking cycles each measuring a progressively larger period these were 260 day tzolk in foster 2002 p 251 365 day haab foster 2002 p 252 and 52 year calendar round resulting from combination of tzolk in with haab foster 2002 p 253 there were also additional calendric cycles such as an 819 day cycle associated with four quadrants of maya cosmology governed by four different aspects of god k awiil sharer and traxler 2006 p 104 basic unit in maya calendar was one day or k in and 20 k in grouped to form a winal next unit instead of being multiplied by 20 as called for by vigesimal system was multiplied by 18 in order to provide a rough approximation of solar year hence producing 360 days this 360 day year was called a tun each succeeding level of multiplication followed vigesimal system sharer and traxler 2006 p 102 long count periods period calculation span years approx k in1 x 2020 x days1 x 18 x 207 200 x 18 x 20 x 20144

tzolk in provided basic cycle of maya ceremony and foundations of maya prophecy no astronomical basis for this count has been proved and it may be that 260 day count is based on human gestation period this is reinforced by use of tzolk in to record dates of birth and provide corresponding prophecy 260 day cycle repeated a series of 20 day names with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in cycle a particular day occurred 365 day haab was produced by a cycle of eighteen named 20 day winals completed by addition of a 5 day period called wayeb wayeb was considered to be a dangerous time when barriers between mortal and supernatural realms were broken allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns in a similar way to tz olkin named winal would be prefixed by a number from 0 to 19 in case of shorter wayeb period prefix numbers ran 0 to 4 since each day in tz olkin had a name and number e g 8 ajaw this would interlock with haab producing an additional number and name to give any day a more complete designation for example 8 ajaw 13 keh such a day name could only recur once every 52 years and this period is referred to by mayanists as calendar round in most mesoamerican cultures calendar round was largest unit for measuring time sharer and traxler 2006 p 107 as with any non repeating calendar maya measured time from a fixed start point maya set beginning of their calendar as end of a previous cycle of bak tuns equivalent to a day in 3114 bc this was believed by maya to be day of creation of world in its current form maya used long count calendar to fix any given day of calendar round within their current great piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak tuns there was some variation in calendar specifically texts in palenque demonstrate that piktun cycle that ended in 3114 bc had only 13 bak tuns but others used a cycle of 13 20 bak tun in current piktun carter 2014 a single passage on a late classic hieroglyphic panel at palenque makes two further points clear first that count of bak tuns will accumulate to 19 as before present era before number in piktuns place will change and second that that number will change to 1 not to 14 just as bak tuns did in 2720 bc in other words all piktuns except present one contained 20 bak tuns but current one contains 33 all previous next place up contained 20 piktuns but current contains 33 of those presumably same pattern obtains for rest of higher places this staggered resetting of higher order cycles so jarringly unexpected from a contemporary western perspective suggests an attitude towards time more numerological than mathematical 13 and 20 after all are key numbers of tzolk in so it is fitting that they should be incorporated into long count at enormous temporal scales additionally there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed van stone 2011 a full long count date consisted of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off number of bak tuns kat uns tuns winals and k ins since start of current creation this would be followed by tz olkin portion of calendar round date and after a number of intervening glyphs long count date would end with haab portion of calendar round date sharer and traxler 2006 p 110 correlation of long count calendar although calendar round is still in use today 1992 p 1 miles 1952 p 273 maya started using an abbreviated short count during late classic period short count is a count of 13 k book of chilam balam of book of chilam balam of ralph l washington d c carnegie institution 1933 pp 79 83 contains only colonial reference to classic long count dates most generally accepted correlation is goodman martinez thompson or gmt correlation this equates long count date 11 16 0 0 0 13 ajaw 8 xul with gregorian date of 12 november 1539 sharer and traxler 2006 p 114 epigraphers simon martin and nikolai grube argue for a two day shift from standard gmt correlation martin and grube 2000 p 13 correlation would shift long count dates back by 260 years it also accords with documentary evidence and is better suited to archaeology of yucatan peninsula but presents problems with rest of maya region george vaillant correlation would shift all maya dates 260 years later and would greatly shorten postclassic period radiocarbon dating of dated wooden lintels at tikal supports gmt correlation astronomy thumb representation of an astronomer from madrid 1999 pp 252 53 maya made meticulous observations of celestial bodies patiently recording astronomical data on movements of sun moon venus and stars this information was used for divination so maya astronomy was essentially for astrological purposes maya astronomy did not serve to study universe for scientific reasons nor was it used to measure seasons in order to calculate crop planting it was rather used by priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time and project them into future to produce prophecy priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of sun and moon and movements of venus and stars these were measured against dated events in past on assumption that similar events would occur in future when same astronomical conditions prevailed demarest 2004 p 192 illustrations in codices show that priests made astronomical observations using naked eye assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device foster 2002 p 261 analysis of few remaining postclassic codices has revealed that at time of european contact maya had recorded eclipse tables calendars and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in europe demarest 2004 p 193 maya measured 584 day venus cycle with an error of just two hours five cycles of venus equated to eight 365 day haab calendrical cycles and this period was recorded in codices maya also followed movements of jupiter mars and mercury when venus rose as morning star this was associated with rebirth of maya hero twins foster 2002 p 260 for maya heliacal rising of venus was associated with destruction and upheaval venus was closely associated with warfare and hieroglyph meaning war incorporated glyph element symbolizing planet foster 2002 p 262 sight lines through windows of caracol building at chichen itza align with northernmost and southernmost extremes of venus path maya rulers launched military campaigns to coincide with heliacal or cosmical rising of venus and would also sacrifice important captives to coincide with such conjunctions solar and lunar eclipses were considered to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon world in dresden codex a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring k in day hieroglyph eclipses were interpreted as sun or moon being bitten and lunar tables were recorded in order that maya might be able to predict them and perform appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster religion and mythology in common with rest of mesoamerica maya believed in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities who needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices at core of maya religious practice was worship of deceased ancestors who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with supernatural realm demarest 2004 p 176 earliest intermediaries between humans and supernatural were shamans sharer and traxler 2006 p 93 maya ritual included use of hallucinogens for chilan oracular priests visions for chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies which are hallucinogenic in high doses 1979 pp 50 52 as maya civilization developed ruling elite codified maya world view into religious cults that justified their right to rule sharer and traxler 2006 p 91 in late preclassic sharer and traxler 2006 p 721 this process culminated in institution of divine king k uhul ajaw endowed with ultimate political and religious power maya viewed cosmos as highly structured there were thirteen levels in heavens and nine in underworld with mortal world in between each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour north was white east was red south was yellow and west was black major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours maya households interred their dead underneath floors with offerings appropriate to social status of family there dead could act as protective ancestors maya lineages were patrilineal so worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasised often with a household shrine as maya society developed and elite became more powerful maya royalty developed their household shrines into great pyramids that held tombs of their ancestors belief in supernatural forces pervaded maya life and influenced every aspect of it from simplest day to day activities such as food preparation to trade politics and elite activities maya deities governed all aspects of world both visible and invisible sharer and traxler 2006 p 92 maya priesthood was a closed group drawing its members from established elite by early classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books including astronomical observations calendrical cycles history and mythology priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting bloodletting incense burning music ritual dance and on certain occasions human sacrifice during classic period maya ruler was high priest and direct conduit between mortals and gods it is highly likely that among commoners shamanism continued in parallel to state religion by postclassic religious emphasis had changed there was an increase in worship of images of deities and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice sharer and traxler 2006 p 722 archaeologists painstakingly reconstruct these ritual practices and beliefs using several techniques one important though incomplete resource is physical evidence such as dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits shrines and burials with their associated funerary offerings sharer and traxler 2006 pp 91 92 maya art architecture and writing are another resource and these can be combined with ethnographic sources including records of maya religious practices made by spanish during conquest human sacrifice thumb right upright relief sculpture of a decapitated ballplayer adorning great ballcourt at chichen itza blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for maya deities and sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering by extension sacrifice of a human life was ultimate offering of blood to gods and most important maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed with lower status captives being used for labour sharer and traxler 2006 p 751 important rituals such as dedication of major building projects or enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering sacrifice of an enemy king was most prized and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of decapitation of maya maize god by death gods in ad 738 vassal king k ak tiliw chan yopaat of quirigua captured his overlord uaxaclajuun ub aah k awiil of copan and a few days later ritually decapitated him sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in classic period maya art and sometimes took place after victim was tortured being variously beaten scalped burnt or disembowelled miller and taube 1993 p 96 another myth associated with decapitation was that of hero twins recounted in popol vuh playing a ballgame against gods of underworld heroes achieved victory but one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their opponents gillespie 1991 pp 322 23 during postclassic period most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction influenced by rites of aztecs in valley of mexico this usually took place in courtyard of a temple or upon summit of pyramid sharer and traxler 2006 p 752 in one ritual corpse would be skinned by assistant priests except for hands and feet and officiating priest would then dress himself in skin of sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing rebirth of life archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as classic period and 2006 p 493 deities maya world was populated by a great variety of deities supernatural entities and sacred forces maya had such a broad interpretation of sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate demarest 2004 p 177 maya interpretation of deities was closely tied to calendar astronomy and their cosmology demarest 2004 pp 177 179 importance of a deity its characteristics and its associations varied according to movement of celestial bodies priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial since priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation when correct ceremonies should be performed and what would be an appropriate offering each deity had four manifestations associated with cardinal directions each identified with a different colour they also had a dual day night life death aspect demarest 2004 p 179 itzamna was creator god but he also embodied cosmos and was simultaneously a sun god k inich ahau day sun was one of his aspects maya kings frequently identified themselves with k inich ahau itzamna also had a night sun aspect night jaguar representing sun in its journey through underworld demarest 2004 p 181 four supported corners of mortal realm in heavens bacabs performed same function as well as their four main aspects had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood demarest 2004 p 182 four were storm gods controlling thunder lightning and rains demarest 2004 pp 182 83 nine lords of night each governed one of underworld realms other important deities included moon goddess maize god and hero twins demarest 2004 pp 181 83 popol vuh was written in latin script in early colonial times and was probably transcribed from a hieroglyphic book by an unknown k iche maya nobleman miller and taube 1993 p 134 it is one of most outstanding works of indigenous literature in americas popul vuh recounts mythical creation of world legend of hero twins and history of postclassic k iche kingdom deities recorded in popul vuh include hun k iche maize god sharer and traxler 2006

common with other mesoamerican cultures maya worshipped feathered serpent deities such worship was rare during classic period miller and taube 1993 p 150 but by postclassic feathered serpent had spread to both yucatan peninsula and guatemalan highlands in yucatan feathered serpent deity was kukulkan miller and taube 1993 p 142 among k iche it was q uq umatz christenson 2007 pp 52 kukulkan had his origins in classic period war serpent kan and has also been identified as postclassic version of vision serpent of classic maya art freidel schele and parker 1993 pp 289 325 although cult of kukulkan had its origins in these earlier maya traditions worship of kukulkan was heavily influenced by quetzalcoatl cult of central mexico sharer and traxler 2006 pp 582 83 likewise q uq umatz had a composite origin combining attributes of mexican quetzalcoatl with aspects of classic period itzamna fox 2008 pp 60 121 220 agriculture thumb right maize was a staple of maya diet ancient maya had diverse and sophisticated methods of food production it was believed that shifting cultivation agriculture provided most of their food fisher 2014 p 196 but it is now thought that permanent raised fields terracing intensive gardening forest gardens and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting large populations of classic period in some areas sharer and traxler 2006 pp 81 82 demarest 2004 pp 130 38 ross 2011 p 75 indeed evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs adams brown and culbert 1981 p 1460 contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient maya in areas that were densely populated in pre columbian times ross 2011 p 75 and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize manioc sunflower seeds cotton and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in mesoamerica since at least 2500 bc colunga garcia marin and villarreal 2004 pp s103 basic staples of maya diet were maize beans and squashes these were supplemented with a wide variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in forest at joya de a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in maya homes among them were and tomatoes cotton seeds were in process of being ground perhaps to produce cooking oil in addition to basic foodstuffs maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton cacao and vanilla cacao was especially prized by elite who consumed chocolate beverages foster 2002 p 310 cotton was spun dyed and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded foster 2002 pp 310 11 maya had few domestic animals dogs were domesticated by 3000 bc and muscovy duck by late postclassic foster 2002 pp 311 312 ocellated turkeys were unsuitable for domestication but were rounded up in wild and penned for fattening all of these were used as food animals dogs were additionally used for
