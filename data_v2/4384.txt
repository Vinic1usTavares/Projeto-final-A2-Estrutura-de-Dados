papal election of 1159 held 4 7 september followed death of pope adrian iv it resulted in a double papal election a majority of cardinals elected cardinal rolando of siena as pope alexander iii but a minority refused to recognize him and elected their own candidate ottaviano de monticelli who took name victor iv creating a schism that lasted until 1178 schism was a result of growing tensions inside sacred college of cardinals concerning foreign policy of holy see papal states in 12th century were a buffer between holy roman empire and norman kingdom of sicily after concordat of worms in 1122 papacy allied with empire rather than with normans but during pontificate of adrian iv 1154 59 this alliance broke up because emperor frederick i barbarossa did not fulfil terms of treaty of constance 1153 that obliged him to help papacy to restore its authority in rome and in other territories controlled by king of sicily robinson pp 464 465 in these circumstances adrian iv decided to break alliance with emperor and to make peace with william i of sicily by signing treaty of benevento 1156 in following years there were growing tensions between papacy and emperor frederick i barbarossa e g a dispute at diet of besancon in 1157 frederick tried with significant success to strengthen his influence on church in germany robinson pp 388 391 and 464 471 change of direction of papal foreign policy resulted in division of sacred college into supporters and opponents of new policy who were unable to achieve a compromise after death of adrian iv election of 1159 had also significant legal consequences up to that time election of new pope required unanimity among electors which led to schism when existence of factions in sacred college made unanimity impossible robinson p 57 to avoid schism in future third lateran council in 1179 promulgated decree licet de evitanda discordia which established rule that pope is elected with a majority of two thirds of cardinals participating in election robinson p 84 death of adrian iv pope adrian iv died on 1 september 1159 fearing a possible schism shortly before his death he recommended to cardinals election of cardinal bernard of porto as his successor robinson pp 79 80 list of participants there were thirty one cardinals in september 1159 robinson p 43 and 83 brixius p 24 zenker p 198 one of them seems not to have participated in election leaving number of thirty electors brixius p 24 and bolton duggan p 106 latter source gives number of twenty eight but it has certainly omitted two cardinal adding cardinal rolando of s marco his 22 supporters and 5 supporters of ottaviano of s cecilia but not ottaviano himself besides it indicates that alexander iii was supported by 22 cardinals but true number is 23 see rahewin cap lxiii salvador miranda on his website cardinals of holy roman church papal elections of 12th century 1100 1198 has published a slightly different lists of cardinals in this election taken from very old of alphonso chacon vitae et res gestae pontificum romanorum et s r e rome 1677 chacon included two more cardinal deacons among electors of victor iv gregorio of ss vito e

1159 bolton duggan pp 105 106 rahewin cap lxii and nothing is known about them except alleged participation in this election so it seems doubtful that they were ever promoted to cardinalate and even that they existed cardinal guglielmo seems to be a duplicate of cardinal guglielmo marengo who had been archdeacon of pavia before his promotion to cardinalate and whose attitude at beginning of schism was ambiguous see robinson p 475 brixius does not mention them in his work elector factioncardinalatial title of promotions according to zenker pp 222 226 and brixius passim elevator o s b of

alexander iii however it seems unlikely because cardinal rainaldo was not a resident of roman curia but of abbey of montecassino where he acted as abbot for 29 years 1137 1166 fact that he did not subscribe to any papal bulls during his long cardinalate 1140 1166 clearly indicates his permanent absence from papal court jaffe pp 559 609 616 653 658 659 besides although he certainly joined

left upright king william i of sicily college of cardinals was divided into two factions so called sicilian party and imperial faction sicilian party led by chancellor rolando of siena and camerlengo boso supported pro sicilian policy of adrian iv imperial faction was led by ottaviano of s cecilia it is known that sicilian party counted thirteen cardinals they were chancellor roland of s marco camerlengo boso of ss cosma e damiano cardinal bishops bernard of porto ubaldo of ostia walter of albano and gregorio of sabina as well as cardinals odone of s giorgio ubaldo of s croce ottone of s nicola ardicio of s teodoro giovanni of s anastasia ildebrando of ss apostoli and pietro of s robinson p 53 imperial party may have counted as many as nine cardinals this number is given in manifest of electors of victor iv dated october 1159 however this manifest is signed only by five cardinals and is not believed to be reliable none of other sources support number of nine cardinals in favour of ottaviano victor iv bolton duggan p 106 victorine party claimed that among these nine cardinals was gregorio of sabina later bribed by alexandrines langen p 454 but cardinal gregorio is known to have been a sicilian robinson p 53 but only six can be identified as its members ottaviano of s cecilia giovanni of ss silvestro e martino guido of s maria in trastevere imar of tusculum raymond of s maria in via lata and simeone of s maria in duggan p 105 guglielmo of s pietro in vincoli was probably seventh one langen p 454 perhaps cardinal cinzio of s adriano also belonged to this faction remaining ten cardinals were neutral robinson p 83 it is believed that both factions made some preparations to election in last months of pontificate of adrian iv although these attempts are known only from hostile accounts produced for polemical purposes during subsequent schism and it is impossible to verify their accuracy both sides accused each other of illegal conspiracies adherents of victor iv accused sicilians of receiving bribes from king william i of sicily and anti imperial cities of brescia milan and piacenza they ostensibly made an oath not to vote for any candidate outside their circle on other hand sicilians accused imperialists of hatching a plot with imperial envoy otto von wittelsbach who was present at rome at time of election and gave significant support to victor iv in taking control over patrimony of st peter it is known that secular adherents of cardinal ottaviano de monticelli who was related to powerful family of counts of tusculum were prepared for armed confrontation in rome evidently neither party was prepared for compromise robinson p 81 proceedings election of alexander iii thumb right upright pope alexander iii cardinals assembled in vatican basilica on 4 september three days after death of adrian iv they had decided that according to custom election should be unanimous to be valid robinson p 82 it seems that candidature of bernard of porto recommended by adrian as acceptable for both factions had never been even advanced both parties put forward candidates mutually unacceptable imperial party proposed ottaviano de monticelli while sicilians proposed chancellor rolando robinson p 79 cardinals discussed for three days without achieving a compromise however sicilian party was able to join all neutral cardinals and probably detached also some members of imperial faction on fourth day 7 september cardinal rolando of siena was proclaimed pope by them and took name alexander iii although unanimity had not been achieved and some cardinals still opposed his candidature according to manifest of alexandrine party of october 1159 and an account of cardinal boso on that day rolando received votes of all cardinals assembled except three those of ottaviano of s cecilia giovanni of ss silvestro e martino and guido of s maria in trastevere then supporters of rolando recognized that it seemed inappropriate that apostolic see should remain any longer without a ruler because of contentiousness of aforesaid three men on other hand opposite party claimed that ottaviano had still nine votes and that sicilian party having majority simply broke rule that required unanimity for valid election robinson pp 82 83 however version of imperial cardinals is believed to be less reliable than version of alexandrine party even if latter may be also not fully accurate based on subscriptions of manifests of both parties issued shortly after election it is possible to assume that at least twenty three electors voted for rolando and no more than six opposed him bolton duggan p 106 these numbers do not include elect himself election of victor iv electors of cardinal rolando immediately after proclaiming him pope attempted to place upon him purple mantle which symbolized assumption of papal office but then election entered tumultuous stage cardinal ottaviano monticelli snatched mantle from alexander s back and his armed bands burst into basilica alexander iii and his supporters fled to citadel of st peter which was in hands of cardinal boso in their absence few cardinals who remained in basilica elected ottaviano of s cecilia to papacy and enthroned him as victor iv exact number of his electors is not known but there are good reasons to believe that it was six including ottaviano himself since only five cardinals signed manifest in his favour in following month however it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in election of victor iv but very quickly joined obedience of alexander iii robinson p 83 bolton duggan p 106 perhaps three or four supporters of alexander iii who did not escape to citadel joined election of victor iv under pressure of armed bands this would explain why could have claimed that their faction counted nine cardinals including sicilian gregorio of sabina and why their numbers dwindled so quickly to five however there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis consecration of alexander iii pope alexander iii remained in citadel for a week until he was rescued and escorted from rome by odo and on september 18 he was eventually bestowed with purple mantle on 20 september at small village of ninfa south east of velletri he was consecrated bishop of rome by cardinal ubaldo allucingoli bishop of ostia e velletri and crowned by cardinal odone bonecase protodeacon of s giorgio in on 27 september he excommunicated victor iv and his adherents robinson p 478 consecration of victor iv victor iv was consecrated on 4 october in abbey of by cardinal bishop imar of tusculum dean of sacred college of cardinals assisted by bishops ubaldo of ferentino and riccardo of jaffe p 828 with armed assistance of otto von wittelsbach and his own armed groups in relatively short time he took control over city of rome and patrimony of st peter while alexander iii took refuge in territory of kingdom of sicily and later in france robinson p 484 manifests of both factions in october 1159 both rivals together with their adherents defended legality of their elections in october 1159 cardinals of both produced manifests to emperor frederick in favour of their elects alexandrine manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals while that of victorine faction only by five rahewin gesta frederici manifest of party is a cap lxii while that of alexandrine party is cap lxiii supporters of victor iv admitting that they were in minority justified their action by fact that opposite faction broke rule of unanimity and in consequence election of rolando was invalid opposite party claimed that principle of unanimity had been breached by obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of imperial faction who stubbornly refused to recognize candidate desired

at least three new cardinal deacons bernard of ss sergio e bacco giovanni of s maria in aquiro and lando of s angelo brixius pp 67 68 while alexander iii appointed on february 18 1160 cardinal deacon milo of s maria in aquiro brixius p 24 and p 65 no 20 schism both popes sent their legates to catholic kingdoms in order to secure their recognition at council of pavia in february 1160 emperor frederick i declared himself in favour of victor iv and episcopate of empire followed him with significant exception of archbishop of salzburg eberhard i von and his suffragans robinson pp 474 475

i barbarossa and pope alexander iii signed a treaty of venice 1 august 1177 shortly thereafter pro imperial pope callistus iii successor of victor iv abandoned his claims to papacy and submitted to alexander iii 29 august 1178 victor iv and his successors paschal iii 1164 68 and callistus iii 1168 78 are now regarded as by catholic church while alexander iii is recognized as legitimate successor of st peter apostle aftermath election of 1159 and subsequent schism showed necessity of amending rules concerning papal elections decree licet de evitanda discordia issued by third lateran council in 1179 abolished rule of unanimity in favour of rule of majority of two thirds decree confirmed also that all three orders of college of cardinals bishops priests and deacons are equal in papal elections although practice allowing participation of cardinal priests and cardinal deacons on equal rights with cardinal bishops had been introduced no later than in papal election 1118 decree in
