albany highway links western australia s capital city perth with its oldest settlement albany on state s south coast highway travels through southern wheatbelt and great southern regions and is designated state route 30 for most of its length outside of perth highway is predominately a sealed single carriageway with regular overtaking lanes in some undulating areas albany highway commences at causeway a river crossing that connects to perth s central business district highway heads south east through perth s metropolitan region bypassed in part by shepparton road and kenwick link and continues south eastwards through to albany it intersects several major roads in perth including leach tonkin brookton and south western highways rural section of albany highway connects to important regional roads at few towns and roadhouses along route including coalfields highway at arthur river great southern highway at cranbrook and highway at mount barker prior to european settlement indigenous noongar people had a considerable network of tracks including a trade route between areas now known as perth and albany construction of a road between perth and albany began soon after naming of albany in 1832 but progress was slow with only completed by 1833 a monthly mail route which operated in 1840s had such trouble with journey that a new contractor was required each year and from 1847 mail route detoured via bunbury introduction of convicts in 1850 and thus convict labour allowed a road along direct route to be fully constructed by 1863 rise of motor vehicle era in early 20th century saw road gain prominence once more and by 1939 whole road had been sealed congestion at perth end of road in 1930s led to parallel roads berwick street and shepparton road being upgraded to provide bypasses entire perth albany road was renamed albany highway on 2 october 1940 in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route from late 1970s 49 million over ten years was spent on repairing albany highway and experience saw main roads develop a program of interventions to prevent costly road reconstruction since 1990s main roads has been upgrading various portions along length of albany highway including widening sections to dual carriageways in perth and construction of kenwick link bypass route description albany highway commences at causeway a river crossing that connects to perth s central business district highway heads south east through perth s metropolitan region and continues through southern wheatbelt and great southern regions to albany on south coast of western australia albany highway is generally a two lane single carriageway road but with additional lanes and dual carriageway sections in perth and albany highway is allocated state route 30 except for bypassed sections in perth and southernmost portion in albany part bypassed by kenwick link is allocated alternate state route 30 and a short length in arthur river is concurrently allocated state route 107 albany highway also carries sections of heritage country tourist drive tourist drive 205 and great southern tourist way tourist drive 356 main roads western australia monitors traffic volume across state s road network including various locations along albany highway in 2013 14 financial year recorded traffic volumes ranged between 3880 and 70 690 vehicles per weekday in perth 1980 to 3880 in wheatbelt and 1720 to 5120 in great southern highest percentage of heavy traffic was 29 2 south of jarrahdale road in wheatbelt reports commissioned by royal automobile club of western australia rac in 2006 and 2008 gave majority of highway a three star safety rating out of five with an approximately section south east of armadale rated at a two star level overall highway network was generally rated as three star or four star but around 10 in 2006 and 5 in 2008 received a two star rating perth to armadale in perth albany highway s north western terminus is at a parclo interchange with causeway shepparton road and great eastern and canning highways in victoria park first of road is one way into interchange but only connecting to causeway and canning highway there is no direct access to other roads for next highway is a two lane two way high street serving victoria park s town centre and continuing south east through east victoria park nearby four lane shepperton road serves as a bypass carrying through traffic as well as state route 30 thumb albany highway as a dual carriageway in cannington two roads converge at an intersection with welshpool road and for albany highway serves as an arterial route in perth s south eastern suburbs varying between a single carriageway and dual carriageway and between a four and six lane capacity this part of highway is dominated by commercial shopping precincts in bentley cannington gosnells and kelmscott with numerous sets of traffic lights section of albany highway through beckenham and kenwick is allocated alternate state route 30 while state route 30 follows a bypass kenwick link albany highway has a folded diamond interchange with tonkin highway in gosnells and continues south for past commercial and residential properties in kelmscott and mount nasura highway has a t junction that is western terminus of brookton highway at boundary between kelmscott and mount nasura further south in armadale highway intersects eastern end of armadale road and northern end of south western highway regional highway thumb two lane highway section near mount barker thumb albany highway and south coast highway intersection outside albany albany highway proceeds east and then south from armadale around suburb of mount richon road continues south east with signs of human activity becoming more sparse as highway crosses darling scarp and scenery transitions to native forest further south after it transitions again to pastures with farming activities such as livestock rearing and orchards over next highway encounters few towns williams kojonup and mount barker are on highway but are apart roadhouses exist at north bannister crossman and arthur river while many of service towns in region are approximately to east on great southern highway including narrogin and katanning closer to albany there are large tracts of blue gum eucalypt plantations from road s south eastern terminus it passes albany airport highway passes by suburban areas before intersecting south coast highway at a y intersection and only beyond it a large five way roundabout this roundabout is southern terminus of state route 30 and connects highway with chester pass road which continues east to south coast highway north road and hanrahan road final stretch takes highway south east into centre of albany history background prior to european settlement indigenous noongar people had a considerable network of tracks around their territory in south west of western australia one such track used as a trade route linked swan river in modern day perth with area now known as albany track followed a similar alignment to modern day albany highway cited in on 25 december 1826 new south wales colonial government brig amity under command of major edmund lockyer arrived at king george sound to establish a military garrison on 21 january 1827 as instructed by colonial secretary union jack was raised and a feu de joie fired by troops formally annexing territory in assertion of first official claim by imperial government to british possession over whole continent of australia on 7 march 1831 king george sound and colony was made part of swan river colony and a free settlement albany was officially named by governor stirling at beginning of 1832 at time that political authority passed to swan river colony construction of a road from albany to perth began soon thereafter but only had been completed by 1833 due to this slow progress settlers of albany petitioned england to supply convicts to work on road at time government in perth derided proposal and western australia would not become a penal colony until 1849 surveying and initial routes in october and november 1835 governor stirling and surveyor general john septimus roe travelled overland from perth to albany with focus of journey being route south of hotham river a more comprehensive survey was undertaken in july september 1836 by assistant surveyors alfred hillman and d smith hillman started from albany end while smith concurrently commenced from perth a few months later in february 1837 hillman accompanied a group that made trip to perth in 12 days travelling time journeying via mount barker lake matilda kojonup williams and arthur river this group was led by mr j harris and included lieutenant armstrong with eight soldiers of 21st fusiliers albany settlers patrick taylor and dr thomas harrison as well as native handsome in april 1838 four bridges were built near albany by john young and in 1839 governor john hutt ventured out to albany on an official visit travelling through williams and kojonup assistant surveyor hillman led a large group of albany settlers to perth in 1840 via joseph s wells and whilst in same year edward john eyre shepherded 550 sheep and 70 cattle from albany to york and then over to perth a monthly mail route was set up in june 1841 travelling from albany to perth via kojonup and williams following year a service through guildford commenced tough conditions of mail route saw a different contractor providing service each year 1845 contractor james martin had particular trouble with debts which led to his mail horse being seized while he managed to acquire a replacement animal he also had trouble servicing resultant debt of ps2 in 1847 perth albany route was adjusted so that mail would travel from albany to kojonup then head to bunbury on coast and subsequently up to perth via rockingham and fremantle new route still had difficulties such as flooding in winter of 1847 that resulted in a terrible trip which took a month to complete people of albany who could travel as passengers on mail cart found trip to perth long and deplorable with arrival of convict ship on 1 june 1850 and advent of convict labour early completion of perth albany road seemed assured investigations of a direct route via kelmscott hotham williams and kojonup began in late 1851 assistant surveyor a c gregory reported in 1852 that direct route would be shorter than route via bunbury and shorter than york route construction was recommended in late 1852 after mail contractor george maxwell completed a journey along proposed route in september and soon commenced had been completed by october 1853 and whole road was finished in 1863 road served as main link between perth and albany until 1880s when great southern railway opened early 20th century rise of motor vehicle era in early 20th century saw road gain prominence once more newly formed main roads board took over control and maintenance of perth albany road and twenty one other important roads between 1926 and 1928 which were declared main roads at this stage perth albany road was not much more developed than a bush track to increase usability of overall main road network board s work schedule prioritised upgrading worst individual segments rather than any one road in 1928 29 twenty two separate sections of perth albany road were improved but many were short and drivers would experience quite varied conditions from new sealed road to gravel road and then a boggy dirt in just a few miles by 1932 improved conditions allowed an average speed of to be reached for a total trip of eight to nine hours instead of two days in 1938 a total of had been sealed and following year whole route had been completed in 1935 a town planning report for city of perth noted traffic congestion on albany road in victoria park as widening existing road would have left council liable for compensation from affected businesses and properties provision of bypass routes was recommended instead to provide bypasses parallel roads would be upgraded and extended berwick street to south west and shepparton road to north east in 1937 work had progressed on extending berwick street eastwards and it had been extended to alday street by november 1938 a new causeway to extend berwick street north over swan river and make it a truck route was considered by state government in 1940 existing causeway from which albany road commenced had experienced almost a doubling of traffic volume between 1930 and 1939 however new causeway was eventually constructed adjacent to old causeway which was then demolished cooperation of canning road district would be required to continue berwick street bypass south east beyond city s boundary at boundary road and ultimately through to albany road south perth road board was also in favour of such a bypass which would improve access for south perth residents a deputation from canning and south perth road boards to acting minister for works mr e h gray in june 1940 complained about congestion in albany road traffic delays were worsened by cars parked on both sides of road and slow moving trams deputation suggested extending berwick street to albany highway as solution as well as removing trams gray contended that parking should be prohibited and refused to scrap trams but said he would consider resumption of land east of berwick street to enable a extension to albany road however berwick street was diverted to south west to connect with chapman road providing a longer continuous route west of albany highway shepperton road ran parallel to albany road between harvey street from causeway and somerset street further along in 1937 a road from asquith street to albany road was constructed to eventually link in with shepperton road in same year intersection of albany road milford street and welshpool road was reconfigured to improve visibility and in anticipation of an eastern extension to shepperton road in april 1940 that extension was nearing completion which was expected to be by end of may while demolition of houses on land resumed for western extension was being arranged on 29 september 1941 perth city council decided to construct link between asquith street and harvey street early following year completing shepperton road bypass buses were rerouted onto shepperton road in 1946 by which time it had become preferred route for motorists in november 1939 state advisory committee on nomenclature recommended that perth albany road be named great southern highway in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route this suggestion followed on from naming of great eastern highway in april of previous year committee sent letters to all local governments in area to advise them of proposal feedback was mixed whilst name was thoroughly approved by tambellup road board and perth city council s general purposes committee recommended that no objection be raised kojonup road board believed that sufficient grounds did not exist for proposed change and albany municipal council objected strongly to not retaining perth albany in name state advisory committee made a new recommendation in april 1940 for albany highway instead of great southern highway this new proposal received support from albany municipal council and tambellup road board however perth city council still preferred great southern highway and recommended that within its boundaries from causeway to welshpool road be named albany road and that one of proposed bypasses in area would be better suited to highway name entire road was renamed albany highway on 2 october 1940 superseding previously used names albany road perth albany road and high street in kojonup post world war ii during world war ii main roads department focused its activities on war effort roads in rural areas deteriorated especially after pearl harbour attack brought war to pacific and only most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes following war main roads returned to its usual operations repairing and maintaining road network rural road network expanded in 1950s with main roads both repairing worst segments of its roads through numerous small jobs and assisting local governments to seal their roads such activity was spurred on by closure of railway lines in addition to establishment of new land settlements in perth a roundabout was constructed at north western end of albany highway to improve flow of traffic onto and off causeway it opened in 1952 with guides on usage of roundabout published in newspapers in 1973 construction began to upgrade intersection to a partial cloverleaf interchange at eastern end of causeway 1 3 million interchange opened on 8 march 1974 thumb albany highway facing south near tunney by late 1970s road sections sealed in 1950s and 1960s were in need of repair or maintenance to prolong pavement life old bitumen surfaces would deteriorate and crack resealing such cracks was a high priority as expensive reconstruction would be required if water was allowed to enter road base over a ten year period 49 million was spent on repairing albany highway techniques used in this process were then formalised into 4r program which aimed to alleviate a growing maintenance problem based on a thirty five year pavement lifespan amount of reconstruction required would be more than double actual rate of reconstruction 4r abbreviated options that could be used keep roads serviceable restoration maintaining condition of a road resurfacing resealing a bitumen surface which was no longer waterproof to prevent pavement failure rehabilitation improving a deteriorated road to its original condition reconstruction done when deterioration was beyond point of repairs interventions to prevent a road requiring reconstruction most costly option would save money from 1980s main roads began planning for future needs of albany highway within city of canning in perth in conjunction with city and metropolitan region planning authority a section between leach highway and nicholson road was subsequently upgraded between november 1992 and june 1994 four lane undivided road had been one of most congested in perth but was improved by adding a third lane in each direction as well as a median strip project was recognised with an excellence award from institution of engineers australia in 1994 in 1990s several other improvement projects were planned across length of highway including between bedfordale and north bannister through mount barker and between and albany closer to perth section along bedfordale hill south east of armadale was upgraded to a four lane dual carriageway with work completed in june 1999 this period also saw planning and construction of additional junctions with new major roads in perth at armadale armadale road would connect to what had been a three way junction with south western highway while a highway deviation was proposed to connect to extension of roe highway through beckenham proposed deviation became kenwick link constructed as part of roe highway extension towards fremantle it was initially built as a single carriageway and upgraded to a dual carriageway later it opened on 17 april 1998 ahead of roe highway extensions from welshpool road to kenwick link opened 30 november 2002 and from kenwick link to nicholson road opened 21 january 2003 further work was undertaken in perth in 2011 and 2012 between john street in bentley and leach highway road was widened and a median installed to increase both safety and efficiency works also upgraded intersection including installation of new traffic lights downer edi works
