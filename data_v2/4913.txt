psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic prodrug compound produced by more than 200 species of mushrooms collectively known as psilocybin mushrooms most potent are members of genus psilocybe such as p p semilanceata and p cyanescens but psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera as a prodrug psilocybin is quickly converted by body to psilocin which has mind altering effects similar in some aspects to those of lsd mescaline and dmt in general effects include euphoria visual and mental hallucinations changes in perception a distorted sense of time spiritual experiences and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks imagery found on prehistoric murals and rock paintings of modern day spain and algeria suggests that human usage of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history in mesoamerica mushrooms had long been consumed in spiritual and divinatory ceremonies before spanish chroniclers first documented their use in 16th century in 1959 swiss chemist albert hofmann isolated active principle psilocybin from mushroom psilocybe mexicana hofmann s employer sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in psychedelic psychotherapy although increasingly restrictive drug laws of late 1960s curbed scientific research into effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens its popularity as an entheogen spirituality enhancing agent grew in next decade owing largely to increased availability of information on how to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms intensity and duration of effects of psilocybin are variable depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms dosage individual physiology and set and setting as was shown in experiments led by timothy leary at harvard university in early 1960s once ingested psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin which then acts on serotonin receptors in brain mind altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours although to individuals under influence of psilocybin effects may seem to last much longer since drug can distort perception of time psilocybin has a low toxicity and a low harm potential possession of psilocybin containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws effects thumb right american psychologist and counterculture figure timothy leary conducted early experiments into effects of psychedelic drugs including psilocybin 1989 photo effects of psilocybin are highly variable and depend on mindset and environment in which user has experience factors commonly referred to as set and setting in early 1960s timothy leary and colleagues at harvard university investigated role of set and setting on effects of psilocybin they administered drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room ninety eight of subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and contribution of background and situational factors individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom drug was novel group size dosage preparation and expectancy were important determinants of drug response in general those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that groups were less supportive and their experiences were less pleasant conversely smaller groups fewer than six individuals were seen as more supportive participants also reported having more positive reactions to drug in those groups leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli these findings were affirmed in a later review by jos ten berge 1999 who concluded that dosage set and setting were fundamental factors in determining outcome of experiments that tested effects of psychedelic drugs on artists creativity after ingesting psilocybin a wide range of subjective effects may be experienced feelings of disorientation lethargy giddiness euphoria joy and depression in one study 31 of volunteers who had been given a high dose reported feelings of significant fear and 17 experienced transient paranoia in studies at johns hopkins among those given a moderate dose but still enough to give a high probability of a profound and beneficial experience negative experiences were rare whereas 1 3 of those given high dose experienced anxiety or paranoia low doses of drug can induce hallucinatory effects closed eye hallucinations may occur in which affected individual sees multicolored geometric shapes and vivid imaginative sequences some individuals report experiencing synesthesia such as tactile sensations when viewing colors ballesteros et al 2006 p 175 at higher doses psilocybin can lead to intensification of affective responses enhanced ability for introspection regression to primitive and childlike thinking and activation of vivid memory traces with pronounced emotional undertones open eye visual hallucinations are common and may be very detailed although rarely confused with reality a 2011 prospective study by roland r griffiths and colleagues suggests that a single high dosage of psilocybin can cause long term changes in personality of its users about half of study participants described as healthy spiritually active and many possessing postgraduate degrees showed an increase in personality dimension of openness assessed using revised neo personality inventory and this positive effect was apparent more than a year after psilocybin session according to study authors finding is significant because no study has demonstrated personality change in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event a further study by griffiths in 2017 found that doses of 20 to 30 mg 70 kg psilocybin inducing mystical type experiences brought more lasting positive changes to traits including altruism gratitude forgiveness and feeling close to others when they were combined with a regular meditation practice and an extensive spiritual practice support programme although other researchers have described instances of psychedelic drug usage leading to new psychological understandings and personal insights it is not known whether these experimental results can be generalized to larger populations physical effects common responses include pupil dilation 93 changes in heart rate 100 including increases 56 decreases 13 and variable responses 31 changes in blood pressure 84 including hypotension 34 hypertension 28 and general instability 22 changes in stretch reflex 86 including increases 80 and decreases 6 nausea 44 tremor 25 and 16 inability to properly direct or limit motions temporary increases in blood pressure caused by drug can be a risk factor for users with pre existing hypertension these qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies see for example a 2005 magazine survey of club goers in uk found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in last year although this effect is caused by mushroom rather than psilocybin itself in one study administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels blood sugar levels or liver toxicity tests perceptual distortions thumb right ability of psilocybin to cause perceptual distortions is linked to its influence on activity of prefrontal cortex psilocybin is known to strongly influence subjective experience of passage of time users often feel as if time is slowed down resulting in perception that minutes appear to be hours or time is standing still studies have demonstrated that psilocybin significantly impairs subjects ability to gauge time intervals longer than 2 5 seconds impairs their ability to synchronize to inter beat intervals longer than 2 seconds and reduces their preferred tapping rate these results are consistent with drug s role in affecting prefrontal cortex activity and role that prefrontal cortex is known to play in time perception however neurochemical basis of psilocybin s effects on perception of time are not known with certainty users having a pleasant experience can feel a sense of connection to others nature and universe other perceptions and emotions are also often intensified users having an unpleasant experience a bad trip describe a reaction accompanied by fear other unpleasant feelings and occasionally by dangerous behavior in general phrase bad trip is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions not just transitory experience of such feelings a variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip including tripping during an emotional or physical low or in a non supportive environment see set and setting ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs including alcohol can also increase likelihood of a bad trip other than duration of experience effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of lsd or mescaline however in psychedelics encyclopedia author peter stafford noted psilocybin experience seems to be warmer not as forceful and less isolating it tends to build connections between people who are generally much more in communication than when they use lsd stafford 1992 p 273 uses spiritual psilocybin mushrooms have been and continue to be used in indigenous new world cultures in religious divinatory or spiritual contexts reflecting meaning of word entheogen god within mushrooms are revered as powerful spiritual sacraments that provide access to sacred worlds typically used in small group community settings they enhance group cohesion and reaffirm traditional values terence mckenna documented worldwide practices of psilocybin mushroom usage as part of a cultural ethos relating to earth and mysteries of nature and suggested that mushrooms enhanced self awareness and a sense of contact with a transcendent other reflecting a deeper understanding of our connectedness with nature psychedelic drugs can induce states of consciousness that have lasting personal meaning and spiritual significance in individuals who are religious or spiritually inclined these states are called mystical experiences some scholars have proposed that many of qualities of a drug induced mystical experience are indistinguishable from mystical experiences achieved through non drug techniques such as meditation or in 1960s walter pahnke and colleagues systematically evaluated mystical experiences which they called mystical consciousness by categorizing their common features these categories according to pahnke describe core of a universal psychological experience free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations and allow researchers to assess mystical experiences on a qualitative numerical scale in 1962 marsh chapel experiment which was run by pahnke at harvard divinity school under supervision of timothy leary almost all of graduate degree divinity student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences one of participants was religious scholar huston smith author of several textbooks on comparative religion he later described his experience as most powerful cosmic homecoming i have ever experienced in a 25 year followup to experiment all of subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of high points of their spiritual life doblin 1991 p 13 psychedelic researcher rick doblin considered study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of double blind procedure and several imprecise questions in mystical experience questionnaire nevertheless he said that study cast a considerable doubt on assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long term effects doblin 1991 p 24 this sentiment was echoed by psychiatrist william a richards who in a 2007 review stated psychedelic mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar if not identical to those that occur through so called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry thumb right in their studies on psilocybin experience johns hopkins researchers use peaceful music and a comfortable room to help ensure a comfortable setting and experienced guides to monitor and reassure volunteers a group of researchers from johns hopkins school of medicine led by griffiths conducted a study to assess immediate and long term psychological effects of psilocybin experience using a modified version of mystical experience questionnaire and a rigorous double blind procedure when asked in an interview about similarity of his work with leary s griffiths explained difference we are conducting rigorous systematic research with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions a route which dr leary abandoned in early 1960s national institute of drug abuse funded study published in 2006 has been praised by experts for soundness of its experimental design in experiment 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate ritalin in separate sessions methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by ralph w hood 61 of subjects reported a complete mystical experience after their psilocybin session while only 13 reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate two months after taking psilocybin 79 of participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well being about 36 of participants also had a strong to extreme experience of fear or dysphoria i e a bad trip at some point during psilocybin session which was not reported by any subject during methylphenidate session about one third of these 13 of total reported that this dysphoria dominated entire session these negative effects were reported to be easily managed by researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on subject s sense of well being a follow up study conducted 14 months after original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to experience almost one third of subjects reported that experience was single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives and over two thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events about two thirds indicated that experience increased their sense of well being or life satisfaction even after 14 months those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on personality trait of openness intellect personality traits are normally stable across lifespan for adults likewise in a recent 2010 web based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use 60 of 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long term positive impact on their sense of well being while many recent studies have concluded that psilocybin can occasion mystical type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance not all medical community is on board paul r mchugh formerly director of department of psychiatry and behavioral science at johns hopkins responded as follows in a book review unmentioned fact in harvard psychedelic club is that lsd psilocybin mescaline and like produce not a higher consciousness but rather a particular kind of lower consciousness known well to psychiatrists and neurologists namely toxic delirium in response to dr mchugh s denial that mystical experience leads to insight michael pollan points to roland griffiths johns hopkins researcher and author of many studies finding that experiences of many of participants have actually involved substantial and sustained personal meaning bringing enduring positive changes in psychological functioning according to pollan griffiths admits that those taking psilocybin may be encountering a temporary psychosis but notes that patients mchugh describes are unlikely to report years later of their experience wow that was one of greatest and most meaningful experiences of my life such responses argue that it is not appropriate to automatically equate a psilocybin induced experience of profound insight with superficially similar experiences of psychiatric patients characterized as mere toxic delirium when it is only insight reached in psilocybin experience that is reported to often result in profound beneficial and enduring life changes for person in 2011 griffiths and colleagues published results of further studies designed to learn more about optimum psilocybin doses needed for positive life changing experiences while minimizing chance of negative reactions in a 14 month followup researchers found that 94 of volunteers rated their experiences with drug as one of top five most spiritually significant of their lives 44 said it was single most significant none of 90 sessions that took place throughout study were rated as decreasing well being or life satisfaction moreover 89 reported positive changes in their behaviors as a result of experiences conditions of experimental design included a single drug experience a month on a couch in a living room like setting with eye shades and carefully chosen music classical and world music as an additional precaution to guide experience as with 2006 study 2011 study included a monitor or guide whom volunteers supposedly trusted monitors provided gentle reassurance when volunteers experienced anxiety volunteers and monitors all remained blind to exact dosages for purpose of experiment available forms although psilocybin may be prepared synthetically outside of research setting it is not typically used in this form psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies by preparing a herbal tea or by combining with other foods to mask bitter taste in rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously adverse effects most of comparatively few fatal incidents reported in literature that are associated with psychedelic mushroom usage involve simultaneous use of other drugs especially alcohol probably most common cause of hospital admissions resulting from psychedelic mushroom usage involve bad trips or panic reactions in which affected individuals become extremely anxious confused agitated or disoriented accidents self injury or suicide attempts can result from serious cases of acute psychotic episodes although no studies have linked psilocybin with birth defects it is recommended that pregnant women avoid its usage toxicity thumb 500px center chart of dependence potential and effective dose lethal dose ratio of several psychoactive drugs source toxicity of psilocybin is low in rats median lethal dose ld50 when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram mg kg approximately one and a half times that of caffeine when administered intravenously in rabbits psilocybin s ld50 is approximately 12 5 mg kg psilocybin comprises approximately 1 of weight of psilocybe cubensis mushrooms and so nearly of dried mushrooms or of fresh mushrooms would be required for a person to reach 280 mg kg ld50 value of rats based on results of animal studies lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams 1000 times greater than effective dose of 6 milligrams registry of toxic effects of chemical substances assigns psilocybin a relatively high therapeutic index of 641 higher values correspond to a better safety profile for comparison therapeutic indices of aspirin and nicotine are 199 and 21 respectively lethal dose from psilocybin toxicity alone is unknown at recreational or medicinal levels and has rarely been documented only two cases attributed to overdosing on hallucinogenic mushrooms without concurrent use of other drugs have been reported in scientific literature and may involve other factors aside from psilocybin psychiatric panic reactions can occur after consumption of psilocybin containing mushrooms especially if ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected reactions characterized by violent behavior suicidal thoughts schizophrenia like psychosis and convulsions have been reported in literature a 2005 survey conducted in united kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in past year had experienced a panic attack other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia confusion prolonged derealization disconnection from reality and mania psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization in 2016 a study was done at johns hopkins by roland griffiths and others in which 1993 individuals completed an online survey about their single most psychologically difficult or challenging experience worst bad trip after consuming psilocybin mushrooms 11 put self or others at risk of physical harm 2 6 behaved in a physically aggressive or violent manner and 2 7 received medical help of those whose experience occurred 1 year before 7 6 sought treatment for enduring psychological symptoms three cases appeared associated with onset of enduring psychotic symptoms and three cases with attempted suicide difficulty of experience was positively associated with dose despite difficulties 84 endorsed benefiting from experience it was concluded that incidence of risky behavior or enduring psychological distress is extremely low when psilocybin is given in laboratory studies to screened prepared and supported participants safeguards against these risks in clinical trials at johns hopkins include exclusion of volunteers with personal or family history of psychotic disorders or other severe psychiatric disorders recent evidence however has suggested against contention that use of psilocybin puts one at risk for developing long lasting mental disorders an analysis of information from national survey on drug use and health showed that use of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin is associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress past year suicidal thinking past year suicidal planning and past year suicide attempt similarity of psilocybin induced symptoms to those of schizophrenia has made drug a useful research tool in behavioral and neuroimaging studies of this psychotic disorder in both cases psychotic symptoms are thought to arise from a deficient of sensory and cognitive information in brain that ultimately lead to cognitive fragmentation and psychosis flashbacks spontaneous recurrences of a previous psilocybin experience can occur long after having used psilocybin mushrooms hallucinogen persisting perception disorder hppd is characterized by a continual presence of visual disturbances similar to those generated by psychedelic substances neither flashbacks nor hppd are commonly associated with psilocybin usage and correlations between hppd and psychedelics are further obscured by use and other variables tolerance and dependence tolerance to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly ingesting psilocybin more than about once a week can lead to diminished effects tolerance dissipates after a few days so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid effect a cross tolerance can develop between psilocybin and pharmacologically similar lsd and between psilocybin and such as mescaline and dom repeated use of psilocybin does not lead to physical dependence a 2008 study concluded that based on us data from period 2000 2002 adolescent onset defined here as ages 11 17 usage of hallucinogenic drugs including psilocybin did not increase risk of drug dependence in adulthood this was in contrast to adolescent usage of cannabis cocaine medicines and stimulants all of which were associated with an excess risk of developing clinical features associated with drug dependence likewise a 2010 dutch study ranked relative harm of psilocybin mushrooms compared to a selection of 19 recreational drugs including alcohol cannabis cocaine ecstasy heroin and tobacco psilocybin mushrooms were ranked as illicit drug with lowest harm corroborating conclusions reached earlier by expert groups in united kingdom pharmacology pharmacodynamics thumb right 200px neurotransmitter serotonin is structurally similar to psilocybin psilocybin is rapidly in body to psilocin which is a partial agonist for several serotonin receptors which are also known as 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 ht receptors psilocin has a high affinity for 5 and 5 ht2c receptors in human brain and with a slightly lower affinity for 5 ht2a receptor psilocin binds with low affinity to 5 receptors including 5 and 5 psychotomimetic psychosis mimicking effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose dependent fashion by 5 ht2a antagonist drug various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non 5 receptors also contribute to subjective and behavioral effects of drug for example psilocin indirectly increases concentration of neurotransmitter dopamine in basal ganglia and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol a non selective dopamine receptor antagonist taken together these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin s psychotomimetic effects psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for dopamine receptor d2 unlike another common 5 ht receptor agonist lsd serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of brain including cerebral cortex and are involved in a wide range of functions including regulation of mood and motivation pharmacokinetics effects of drug begin 10 40 minutes after ingestion and last 2 6 hours depending on dose species and individual metabolism stamets 1996 pp 36 41 half life of psilocybin is 163 64 minutes when taken orally or 74 1 19 6 minutes when injected intravenously a dosage of 4 10 mg corresponding roughly to 50 300 micrograms per kilogram ug kg of body weight is required to induce psychedelic effects a typical recreational dosage is 10 50 mg psilocybin which is roughly equivalent to 10 50 grams of fresh mushrooms or 1 5 grams of dried mushrooms a johns hopkins study found ideal dose for long term positive effects to be 20 mg per 70 kg of body weight ref name a small number of people are unusually sensitive to psilocybin such that a normally threshold level dose of about 2 mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses in contrast there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person s response to psilocybin thumb 500px center psilocybin is converted in liver to pharmacologically active psilocin which is then either glucuronated to be excreted in urine or further converted to various psilocin metabolites psilocybin is metabolized mostly in liver as it becomes converted to psilocin it undergoes a first pass effect whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches systemic circulation psilocin is broken down by enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in blood plasma including 4 hydroxyindole 3 acetaldehyde 4 and 4 hydroxyindole 3 acetic acid some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid which can then be excreted in urine psilocin is glucuronated by enzymes in liver and by in small intestine based on studies using animals about 50 of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through stomach and intestine within 24 hours about 65 of absorbed psilocybin is excreted into urine and a further 15 20 is excreted in bile and feces although most of remaining drug is eliminated in this way within 8 hours it is still detectable in urine after 7 days clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in plasma of adults average about 8 ug liter within 2 hours after ingestion of a single 15 mg oral psilocybin dose psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4 6 ug liter psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than lsd on a weight per weight basis and physiological effects last about half as long ballesteros et al 2006 p 171 monoamine oxidase inhibitors have been known to prolong and enhance effects of dmt and one study assumed that effect on psilocybin would be similar since it is a structural analogue of dmt alcohol consumption may enhance effects of psilocybin because acetaldehyde one of primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol reacts with biogenic amines present in body to produce related to and b carboline tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin because tobacco smoke exposure decreases activity of mao in brain and peripheral organs chemistry and biosynthesis psilocybin o phosphoryl 4 hydroxy n n dimethyltryptamine 4 po psilocin or 4 po ho dmt is a prodrug that is converted into pharmacologically active compound psilocin in body by a reaction this chemical reaction takes place under strongly acidic conditions or under physiological conditions in body through action of enzymes called alkaline psilocybin is a tryptamine compound with a chemical structure containing an indole ring linked to an substituent it is chemically related to amino acid tryptophan and is structurally similar to neurotransmitter serotonin psilocybin is a member of general class of tryptophan based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms including humans other related indole containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals and found in skin of psychoactive toads psilocybin is an alkaloid that is soluble in water methanol and aqueous ethanol but insoluble in organic solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether its pka values are estimated to be 1 3 and 6 5 for two successive phosphate oh groups and 10 4 for nitrogen so in general it exists as a zwitterionic structure exposure to light is detrimental to stability of aqueous solutions of psilocybin and will cause it to rapidly oxidize an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard osamu and colleagues reported a method for large scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003 starting with 4 hydroxyindole they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85 yield a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses purified psilocybin is a white needle like crystalline powder with a melting point between and a slightly ammonia like taste biosynthetically biochemical transformation from tryptophan to psilocybin involves several enzyme reactions decarboxylation methylation at n9 position 4 hydroxylation and o phosphorylation isotopic labeling experiments from 1960s suggested that tryptophan decarboxylation is initial biosynthetic step and that o phosphorylation is final step but recent analyses of isolated enzymes demonstrate that o phosphorylation is third step in p cubensis sequence of intermediate enzymatic steps has been shown to involve 4 different enzymes and in p cubensis and p cyanescens although biosynthetic pathway may differ between species these enzymes are encoded in gene clusters in psilocybe panaeolus and gymnopilus thumb 500px center biosynthetic route previously thought to lead to psilocybin it has recently been shown that 4 hydroxylation and o phosphorylation immediately follow decarboxylation and neither dmt nor psilocin are intermediates although spontaneously generated psilocin can be converted back to psilocybin analytical methods several relatively simple chemical tests commercially available as reagent testing kits can be used to assess presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms drug reacts in marquis test to produce a yellow color and a green color in mandelin test neither of these tests however is specific for psilocybin for example marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings including amphetamine and methamphetamine ehrlich s reagent and reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect drug after thin layer chromatography many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples although earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography high temperature required to vaporize psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin making it difficult to chemically discriminate between two drugs in forensic toxicology techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms are most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures these techniques include ion mobility spectrometry capillary zone electrophoresis ultraviolet spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy high performance liquid chromatography hplc is used with ultraviolet fluorescence electrochemical and mass detection methods various chromatographic methods have been developed to detect psilocin in body fluids rapid emergency drug identification system hs a drug screening method based on hplc hplc with electrochemical detection gc ms and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry although determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean up i e removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction followed by of extracts in case of gc ms a specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples a 2009 publication reported using hplc to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time these analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are however not routinely available and not typically used in clinical settings natural occurrence species 78 p 1 34 p semilanceata 0 98 p baeocystis

australia and associated islands 19 diversity of mushrooms is reported to have been increased by horizontal transfer of psilocybin gene cluster between unrelated mushroom species in general psilocybin containing species are dark spored gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of subtropics and tropics usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris wurst et al 2002 p 5 psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents but majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests psilocybe species commonly found in tropics include p cubensis and p subcubensis p semilanceata considered by guzman to be world s most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom is found in europe north america asia south america australia and new zealand but is entirely absent from mexico although presence or absence of psilocybin is not of much use as a chemotaxonomical marker at familial level or higher it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups thumb center 450px global distribution of over 100 psychoactive species of genus psilocybe mushrooms both caps and stems contain psychoactive compounds although caps consistently contain more spores of these mushrooms do not contain psilocybin or psilocin total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from same strain because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early in formation of fruit bodies or sclerotia younger smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of drug than larger mature mushrooms in general psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable ranging from almost nothing to 1 5 of dry weight stafford 1992 p 248 and depends on species strain growth and drying conditions and mushroom size stamets 1996 pp 36 41 52 cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years stamets 1996 pp 51 2 while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of original psilocybin psilocybin contents of dried herbarium specimens of psilocybe semilanceata in one study were shown to decrease with increasing age of sample collections dated 11 33 or 118 years old contained 0 84 0 67 and 0 014 all dry weight respectively mature mycelia contain some psilocybin while young mycelia recently germinated from spores lack appreciable amounts many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of analog compounds and stamets 1996 p 38 chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors ballesteros et al 2006 p 170 although most species of psilocybin containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to oxidization of phenolic compounds this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom s potency stamets 1996 pp 56 8 history early thumb 240px right mayan mushroom stones of guatemala there is evidence to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years murals dated 9000 to 7000 bce found in sahara desert in southeast algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs and holding mushroom like objects parallel lines extend from mushroom shapes to center of dancers heads 6 000 year old discovered near spanish town of villar del humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as psilocybe hispanica a hallucinogenic species native to area archaeological artifacts from mexico as well as so called mayan mushroom stones of guatemala have also been interpreted by some scholars as evidence for ritual and ceremonial usage of psychoactive mushrooms in mayan and aztec cultures of mesoamerica stamets 1996 p 11 in nahuatl language of aztecs mushrooms were called teonanacatl or god s flesh following arrival of spanish explorers to new world in 16th century chroniclers reported use of mushrooms by natives for ceremonial and religious purposes according to dominican friar diego duran in history of indies of new spain published c 1581 mushrooms were eaten in festivities conducted on occasion of accession to throne of aztec emperor moctezuma ii in 1502 franciscan friar bernardino de sahagun wrote of witnessing mushroom usage in his florentine codex published 1545 1590 marley 2010 p 164 and described how some merchants would celebrate upon returning from a successful business trip by consuming mushrooms to evoke revelatory visions after defeat of aztecs spanish forbade traditional religious practices and rituals that they considered pagan idolatry including ceremonial mushroom use for next four centuries indians of mesoamerica hid their use of entheogens from spanish authorities marley 2010 p 165 although dozens of species of psychedelic mushrooms are found in europe there is little documented usage of these species in old world history besides use of amanita muscaria among siberian peoples few existing historical accounts about psilocybin mushrooms typically lack sufficient information to allow species identification and usually refer to nature of their effects for example flemish botanist carolus clusius 1526 1609 described crazy mushroom used in rural hungary to prepare love potions english botanist john parkinson included details about a foolish mushroom in his 1640 herbal gartz 1997 pp 10 2 first reliably documented report of intoxication with psilocybe semilanceata europe s most common and widespread psychedelic mushroom involved a british family in 1799 who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in london s green park gartz 1997 p 16 modern american banker and amateur ethnomycologist r gordon wasson and his wife valentina p wasson a physician studied ritual use of psychoactive mushrooms by native population in mazatec village de jimenez mexico in 1957 wasson described psychedelic visions that he experienced during these rituals in seeking magic mushroom an article published in popular american weekly life magazine later same year they were accompanied on a follow up expedition by french mycologist roger heim who identified several of mushrooms as psilocybe species heim cultivated mushrooms in france and sent samples for analysis to albert hofmann a chemist employed by swiss multinational pharmaceutical company sandoz now novartis hofmann who had in 1938 created lsd led a research group that isolated and identified psychoactive compounds from psilocybe mexicana hofmann was aided in discovery process by his willingness to ingest mushroom extracts to help verify presence of active compounds he and his colleagues later synthesized a number of compounds chemically related to naturally occurring psilocybin to see how structural changes would affect new molecules differed from psilocybin in position of phosphoryl or hydroxyl group at top of indole ring and in numbers of methyl groups ch3 and other additional carbon chains stafford 1992 p 237 thumb left albert hofmann shown here in 1993 purified psilocybin and psilocin from psilocybe mexicana in late 1950s two diethyl analogs containing two ethyl groups in place of two methyl groups of psilocybin and psilocin were synthesized by hofmann 4 n n diethyltryptamine called cey 19 and 4 hydroxy n n diethyltryptamine called cz 74 because their physiological effects last only about three and a half hours about half as long as psilocybin they proved more manageable in european clinics using therapy a form of psychotherapy involving controlled use of psychedelic drugs sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin under name to physicians and clinicians worldwide marley 2010 p 166 there were no reports of serious complications when psilocybin was used in this way in early 1960s harvard university became a testing ground for psilocybin through efforts of timothy leary and his associates ralph metzner and richard alpert who later changed his name to ram dass leary obtained synthesized psilocybin from hofmann through sandoz pharmaceutical some studies such as concord prison experiment suggested promising results using psilocybin in clinical psychiatry according to a 2008 review of safety guidelines in human hallucinogenic research however leary and alpert s well publicized termination from harvard and later advocacy of hallucinogen use further undermined an objective scientific approach to studying these compounds in response to concerns about increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by general public psilocybin and other hallucinogenic drugs suffered negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws in united states laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited production trade or ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs sandoz stopped producing lsd and psilocybin same year further backlash against lsd usage swept psilocybin along with it into schedule i category of illicit drugs in 1970 subsequent restrictions on use of these drugs in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being professionally marginalized thumb right increasing availability of information on growing techniques made it possible for amateurs to grow psilocybin mushrooms psilocybe cubensis pictured without access to laboratory equipment despite legal restrictions on psilocybin use 1970s witnessed emergence of psilocybin as entheogen of choice ott 1993 p 276 this was due in large part to a wide dissemination of information on topic which included works such as those by author carlos castaneda and several books that taught technique of growing psilocybin mushrooms one of most popular of this latter group was published in 1976 under pseudonyms o t oss and o n by jeremy dennis j mckenna k harrison mckenna and terence mckenna entitled psilocybin magic mushroom grower s guide over 100 000 copies were sold by 1981 as ethnobiologist jonathan ott explains these authors adapted san antonio s technique for producing edible mushrooms by casing mycelial cultures on a rye grain substrate san antonio 1971 to production of psilocybe stropharia cubensis new technique involved use of ordinary kitchen implements and for first time layperson was able to produce a potent entheogen in his own home without access to sophisticated technology equipment or chemical supplies ott 1993 p 290 san antonio s technique describes a method to grow common edible mushroom agaricus bisporus see because of a lack of clarity about laws about psilocybin mushrooms retailers in late 1990s and early 2000s commercialized and marketed them in in netherlands and uk and online several websites emerged that have contributed to accessibility of information on description use effects and exchange of experiences among users since 2001 six eu countries have tightened their legislation on psilocybin mushrooms in response to concerns about their prevalence and increasing usage in 1990s hallucinogens and their effects on human consciousness were again subject of scientific study particularly in europe advances in and neuropsychology and availability of brain imaging techniques have provided impetus for using drugs like psilocybin to probe neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations recent studies in united states have attracted attention from popular press and thrust psilocybin back into limelight society and culture legal status in united states psilocybin and psilocin were first subjected to federal regulation by drug abuse control amendments of 1965 a product of a bill sponsored by senator thomas j dodd law passed in july 1965 and effected on february 1 1966 was an amendment to federal food drug and cosmetic act and was intended to regulate unlicensed possession manufacture or sale of depressant stimulant and hallucinogenic drugs boire 2002 p 25 statutes themselves however did not list hallucinogenic drugs that were being regulated instead term hallucinogenic drugs was meant to refer to those substances believed to have a hallucinogenic effect on central nervous system thumb left dried psilocybe mushrooms showing characteristic blue bruising on stems despite seemingly strict provisions of law many people were exempt from prosecution statutes permit ted people to possess such drugs so long as they were for personal use of possessor for a member of his household or for administration to an animal federal law that specifically banned psilocybin and psilocin was enacted on october 24 1968 substances were said to have a high potential for abuse no currently accepted medical use and a lack of accepted safety boire 2002 p 26 on october 27 1970 both psilocybin and psilocin became classified as schedule i drugs and were simultaneously labeled hallucinogens under a section of comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act known as controlled substances act schedule i drugs are illicit drugs that are claimed to have no known therapeutic benefit johns hopkins researchers suggest that if psilocybin clears current phase iii clinical trials it should be re categorized to a schedule iv drug such as prescription sleep aids but with tighter control united nations convention on psychotropic substances adopted in 1971 requires its members to prohibit psilocybin and parties to treaty are required to restrict use of drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions however mushrooms containing drug were not specifically included in convention due largely to pressure from mexican government most national drug laws have been amended to reflect terms of convention examples include uk misuse of drugs act 1971 us psychotropic substances act of 1978 australia poisons standard october 2015 http www wa gov au pco prod nsf documents file misuse 20 20 e0 00 5d pdf canadian controlled drugs and substances act of 1996 ballesteros et al 2006 pp 178 9 and japanese narcotics and control law of 2002 possession and use of psilocybin is prohibited under almost all circumstances and often carries severe legal penalties possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms including bluing species of psilocybe is therefore prohibited by extension however in many national state and provincial drug laws there has been a great deal of ambiguity about legal status of psilocybin mushrooms as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places boire 2002 pp 25 48 most us state courts have considered mushroom a container of illicit drugs and therefore illegal a loophole further complicates legal situation spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain drugs and are legal to possess in many areas jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include germany since 1998 and california georgia and idaho in united states as a consequence there is an active underground economy involved in sale of spores and cultivation materials and an internet based social network to support illicit activity marley 2010 pp 177 8 in may 2019 denver colorado became first us city to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms after an ordinance was admitted to ballot and voted on in june 2019 oakland became second u s city to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms in october 2019 chicago followed oakland becoming largest us city to decriminalize entheogenic plants usage a 2009 national survey of drug use by us department of health and human services concluded that number of first time psilocybin mushroom users in united states was roughly equivalent to number of first time users of cannabis in european countries lifetime prevalence estimates of psychedelic mushroom usage among young adults 15 34 years range from 0 3 to 14 1 in modern mexico traditional ceremonial use survives among several indigenous groups including mixes zapotecs and although hallucinogenic psilocybe species are abundant in low lying areas of mexico most ceremonial use takes places in mountainous areas of elevations greater than guzman suggests this is a vestige of spanish colonial influence from several hundred years earlier when mushroom use was persecuted by catholic church research psilocybin has been a subject of preliminary research since early 1960s when harvard psilocybin project evaluated potential therapeutic value of psilocybin for personality disorders beginning in 2000s decade research on anxiety disorders major depression and various addictions was conducted marley 2010 pp 179 81 psilocybin has been tested for its potential for developing prescription drugs to treat drug dependence anxiety or mood disorders in 2018 food and drug administration fda granted
