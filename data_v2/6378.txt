mammals from latin mamma breast are vertebrate animals constituting class mammalia and characterized by presence of mammary glands which in females and sometimes males produce milk for feeding nursing their young a neocortex a region of brain fur or hair and three middle ear bones these characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds from which they diverged in late triassic 201 227 million years ago there are around 5 450 species of mammals largest orders are rodents bats and soricomorpha shrews and others next three are primates apes monkeys and others cetartiodactyla cetaceans and even toed ungulates and carnivora cats dogs seals and others mammals along with birds and possibly some other dinosaurs are endothermic this trait evolved separately in both cases and is an example of convergent evolution in terms of cladistics which reflects evolutionary history mammals are only living members of clade synapsida which together with sauropsida reptiles and birds form larger amniota clade early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs a group that produced non mammalian dimetrodon at end of carboniferous period around 300 million years ago this group diverged from line that led to today s reptiles and birds line following stem group sphenacodontia split into several diverse groups of non mammalian synapsids sometimes incorrectly referred to as mammal like reptiles before giving rise to therapsida in early permian period modern mammalian orders arose in paleogene and neogene periods of cenozoic era after extinction of non avian dinosaurs and have been among dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years ago to present basic body type is quadruped and most mammals use their four extremities for terrestrial locomotion but in some extremities are adapted for life at sea in air in trees underground or on two legs mammals range in size from bumblebee bat to blue whale possibly largest animal to have ever lived maximum lifespan varies from two years for shrew to 211 years for bowhead whale all modern mammals give birth to live young except five species of monotremes which are egg laying mammals most species rich group of mammals cohort called placentals have a placenta which enables feeding of fetus during gestation most mammals are intelligent with some possessing large brains self awareness and tool use mammals can communicate and vocalize in several different ways including production of ultrasound scent marking alarm signals singing and echolocation mammals can organize themselves into fission fusion societies harems and hierarchies but can also be solitary and territorial most mammals are polygynous but some can be monogamous or polyandrous domestication of many types of mammals by humans played a major role in neolithic revolution and resulted in farming replacing hunting and gathering as primary source of food for humans this led to a major restructuring of human societies from nomadic to sedentary with more co operation among larger and larger groups and ultimately development of first civilizations domesticated mammals provided and continue to provide power for transport and agriculture as well as food meat and dairy products fur and leather mammals are also hunted and raced for sport and are used as model organisms in science mammals have been depicted in art since palaeolithic times and appear in literature film mythology and religion decline in numbers and extinction of many mammals is primarily driven by human poaching and habitat destruction primarily deforestation classification thumb upright 1 35 orders rodentia blue chiroptera red and soricomorpha yellow together make up over 70 of mammal species mammal classification has been through several iterations since carl linnaeus initially defined class no classification system is universally accepted mckenna bell 1997 and wilson reader 2005 provide useful recent george gaylord simpson s principles of classification and a classification of mammals amnh bulletin v 85 1945 provides systematics of mammal origins and relationships that were universally taught until end of 20th century since simpson s classification paleontological record has been recalibrated and intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself partly through new concept of cladistics though field work gradually made simpson s classification outdated it remains closest thing to an official classification of mammals most mammals including six most species rich orders belong to placental group three largest orders in numbers of species are rodentia mice rats porcupines beavers capybaras and other gnawing mammals chiroptera bats and soricomorpha shrews moles and solenodons next three biggest orders depending on biological classification scheme used are primates including apes monkeys and lemurs cetartiodactyla including whales and even toed ungulates and carnivora which includes cats dogs weasels bears seals and allies according to mammal species of world 5 416 species were identified in 2006 these were grouped into 1 229 genera 153 families and 29 orders in 2008 international union for conservation of nature iucn completed a five year global mammal assessment for its iucn red list which counted 5 488 species according to research published in journal of mammalogy in 2018 number of recognized mammal species is 6 495 including 96 recently extinct definitions word mammal is modern from scientific name mammalia coined by carl linnaeus in 1758 derived from latin mamma teat pap in an influential 1988 paper timothy rowe defined mammalia phylogenetically as crown group of mammals clade consisting of most recent common ancestor of living monotremes echidnas and platypuses and therian mammals marsupials and placentals and all descendants of that ancestor since this ancestor lived in jurassic period rowe s definition excludes all animals from earlier triassic despite fact that triassic fossils in have been referred to mammalia since mid 19th century if mammalia is considered as crown group its origin can be roughly dated as first known appearance of animals more closely related to some extant mammals than to others ambondro is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while and are more closely related to therians as fossils of all three genera are dated about in middle jurassic this is a reasonable estimate for appearance of crown group t s kemp has provided a more traditional definition synapsids that possess a dentary squamosal jaw articulation and occlusion between upper and lower molars with a transverse component to movement or equivalently in kemp s view clade originating with last common ancestor of and living mammals earliest known synapsid satisfying kemp s definitions is dated so appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given this late triassic date mckenna bell classification in 1997 mammals were comprehensively revised by malcolm c mckenna and susan k bell which has resulted in mckenna bell classification their 1997 book classification of mammals above species level is a comprehensive work on systematics relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa living and extinct down through rank of genus though molecular genetic data challenge several of higher level groupings authors worked together as paleontologists at american museum of natural history new york mckenna inherited project from simpson and with bell constructed a completely updated hierarchical system covering living and extinct taxa that reflects historical genealogy of mammalia extinct groups are represented by a dagger class mammalia subclass

contains mammals and their extinct relatives originated during pennsylvanian subperiod 323 million to 300 million years ago when they split from reptilian and avian lineages crown group mammals evolved from earlier mammaliaforms during early jurassic cladogram takes mammalia to be crown group evolution from amniotes thumb original synapsid skull structure contains one temporal opening behind orbitals in a fairly low position on skull lower right in this image this opening might have assisted in containing jaw muscles of these organisms which could have increased their biting strength first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors they had lungs and limbs amniotic eggs however have internal membranes that allow developing embryo to breathe but keep water in hence amniotes can lay eggs on dry land while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water first amniotes apparently arose in pennsylvanian subperiod of carboniferous they descended from earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as ferns mosses and other plants within a few million years two important amniote lineages became distinct synapsids which would later include common ancestor of mammals and sauropsids which now include turtles lizards snakes crocodilians dinosaurs and birds synapsids have a single hole temporal fenestra low on each side of skull one synapsid group pelycosaurs included largest and fiercest animals of early permian nonmammalian synapsids are sometimes inaccurately called mammal like reptiles therapsids a group of synapsids descended from pelycosaurs in middle permian about 265 million years ago and became dominant land vertebrates they differ from basal eupelycosaurs in several features of skull and jaws including larger skulls and incisors which are equal in size in therapsids but not for eupelycosaurs therapsid lineage leading to mammals went through a series of stages beginning with animals that were very similar to their pelycosaur ancestors and ending with cynodonts some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals those stages were characterized by gradual development of a bony secondary palate progression towards an erect limb posture which would increase animals stamina by avoiding carrier s constraint but this process was slow and erratic for example all herbivorous therapsids retained sprawling limbs some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs and some late permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs in fact modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs dentary gradually became main bone of lower jaw which by triassic progressed towards fully mammalian jaw lower consisting only of dentary and middle ear which is constructed by bones that were previously used to construct jaws of reptiles first mammals permian triassic extinction event about 252 million years ago which was a prolonged event due to accumulation of several extinction pulses ended dominance of carnivorous therapsids in early triassic most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which over an extended period 35 million years came to include crocodylomorphs pterosaurs and dinosaurs however large cynodonts like and still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively by jurassic dinosaurs had come to dominate large terrestrial herbivore niches as well first mammals in kemp s sense appeared in late triassic epoch about 225 million years ago 40 million years after first therapsids they expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from mid jurassic onwards jurassic castorocauda for example was a close relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming digging and catching fish most if not all are thought to have remained nocturnal nocturnal bottleneck accounting for much of typical mammalian traits majority of mammal species that existed in mesozoic era were multituberculates eutriconodonts and earliest known metatherian is sinodelphys found in 125 million year old early cretaceous shale in china s northeastern liaoning province fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues thumb restoration of juramaia sinensis oldest known eutherian 160 m y a oldest known fossil among eutheria true beasts is small juramaia sinensis or jurassic mother from china dated to 160 million years ago in late jurassic a later eutherian relative eomaia dated to 125 million years ago in early cretaceous possessed some features in common with marsupials but not with placentals evidence that these features were present in last common ancestor of two groups but were later lost in placental lineage in particular epipubic bones extend forwards from pelvis these are not found in any modern placental but they are found in marsupials monotremes other mammals and an early cretaceous animal in eutherian order this also applies to multituberculates they are apparently an ancestral feature which subsequently disappeared in placental lineage these epipubic bones seem to function by stiffening muscles during locomotion reducing amount of space being presented which placentals require to contain their fetus during gestation periods a narrow pelvic outlet indicates that young were very small at birth and therefore pregnancy was short as in modern marsupials this suggests that placenta was a later development one of earliest known monotremes was which lived about 120 million years ago in australia monotremes have some features which may be inherited from original amniotes such as same orifice to urinate defecate and reproduce cloaca as lizards and birds also do and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified earliest appearances of features whose fossils date from approximately 195 million years ago in early jurassic provides first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by squamosal and dentary bones there is no space in jaw for articular a bone involved in jaws of all early synapsids left thumb fossil of thrinaxodon at national museum of natural history earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of castorocauda and from 164 million years ago in mid jurassic in 1950s it was suggested that foramina passages in maxillae and premaxillae bones in front of upper jaw of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae whiskers and so were evidence of hair or fur it was soon pointed out however that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae as modern lizard tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in nonmammalian cynodont thrinaxodon popular sources nevertheless continue to attribute whiskers to thrinaxodon studies on permian coprolites suggest that non mammalian synapsids of epoch already had fur setting evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts when endothermy first appeared in evolution of mammals is uncertain though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non mammalian therapsids modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals but there is evidence that some of their ancestors perhaps including ancestors of therians may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians likewise some modern therians like and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs parasagittal limb posture appeared sometime in late jurassic or early cretaceous it is found in eutherian eomaia and metatherian sinodelphys both dated to 125 million years ago epipubic bones a feature that strongly influenced reproduction of most mammal clades are first found in suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and mammaliformes they are omnipresent in non placental mammaliformes though and appear to have lacked them it has been suggested that original function of lactation milk production was to keep eggs moist much of argument is based on monotremes egg laying mammals rise of mammals therian mammals took over medium to large sized ecological niches in cenozoic after cretaceous paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles as well as various other mammal groups and underwent an exponential increase in body size megafauna then mammals diversified very quickly both birds and mammals show an exponential rise in diversity for example earliest known bat dates from about 50 million years ago only 16 million years after extinction of dinosaurs molecular phylogenetic studies initially suggested that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in period from late eocene through miocene however no placental fossils have been found from before end of cretaceous earliest undisputed fossils of placentals comes from early paleocene after extinction of dinosaurs in particular scientists have identified an early paleocene animal named as one of first placental mammals however it has been reclassified as a non placental eutherian of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a late cretaceous origin for placentals and a paleocene origin for most modern clades earliest known ancestor of primates is achilles from around 55 million years ago this tiny primate weighed 20 30 grams 0 7 1 1 ounce and could fit within a human palm anatomy distinguishing features living mammal species can be identified by presence of sweat glands including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish their young in classifying fossils however other features must be used since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils many traits shared by all living mammals appeared among earliest members of group jaw joint dentary lower jaw bone which carries teeth and squamosal a small cranial bone meet to form joint in most including early therapsids joint consists of articular a small bone at back of lower jaw and quadrate a small bone at back of upper jaw middle ear in crown group mammals sound is carried from eardrum by a chain of three bones malleus incus and stapes ancestrally malleus and incus are derived from articular and quadrate bones that constituted jaw joint of early therapsids tooth replacement teeth are replaced once or as in toothed whales and rodents not at all rather than being replaced continually throughout life prismatic enamel enamel coating on surface of a tooth consists of prisms solid rod like structures extending from dentin to tooth s surface occipital condyles two knobs at base of skull fit into topmost neck vertebra most other tetrapods in contrast have only one such knob for most part these characteristics were not present in triassic ancestors of mammals nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone exception being modern placentals biological systems thumb left raccoon lungs being inflated manually majority of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae bones in neck including bats giraffes whales and humans exceptions are manatee and two toed sloth which have just six and three toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae all mammalian brains possess a neocortex a brain region unique to mammals placental mammals have a corpus callosum unlike monotremes and marsupials lungs of mammals are spongy and honeycombed breathing is mainly achieved with diaphragm which divides thorax from abdominal cavity forming a dome convex to thorax contraction of diaphragm flattens dome increasing volume of lung cavity air enters through oral and nasal cavities and travels through larynx trachea and bronchi and expands alveoli relaxing diaphragm has opposite effect decreasing volume of lung cavity causing air to be pushed out of lungs during exercise abdominal wall contracts increasing pressure on diaphragm which forces air out quicker and more forcefully rib cage is able to expand and contract chest cavity through action of other respiratory muscles consequently air is sucked into or expelled out of lungs always moving down its pressure gradient this type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows mammalian heart has four chambers two upper atria receiving chambers and two lower ventricles discharging chambers heart has four valves which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in correct direction through heart preventing after gas exchange in pulmonary capillaries blood vessels in lungs oxygen rich blood returns to left atrium via one of four pulmonary veins blood flows nearly continuously back into atrium which acts as receiving chamber and from here through an opening into left ventricle most blood flows passively into heart while both atria and ventricles are relaxed but toward end of ventricular relaxation period left atrium will contract pumping blood into ventricle heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles and is supplied via coronary arteries integumentary system is made up of three layers outermost epidermis dermis and hypodermis epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick its main function is to provide a waterproof layer its outermost cells are constantly lost its cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward middle layer dermis is 15 to 40 times thicker than epidermis dermis is made up of many components such as bony structures and blood vessels hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue which stores lipids and provides cushioning and insulation thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species marine mammals require a thick hypodermis blubber for insulation and right whales have thickest blubber at although other animals have features such as whiskers feathers setae or cilia that superficially resemble it no animals other than mammals have hair it is a definitive characteristic of class though some mammals have very little careful examination reveals characteristic often in obscure parts of their bodies herbivores have developed a diverse range of physical structures to facilitate consumption of plant material to break up intact plant tissues mammals have developed teeth structures that reflect their feeding preferences for instance frugivores animals that feed primarily on fruit and herbivores that feed on soft foliage have low crowned teeth specialized for grinding foliage and seeds grazing animals that tend to eat hard silica rich grasses have high crowned teeth which are capable of grinding tough plant tissues and do not wear down as quickly as low crowned teeth most carnivorous mammals have teeth of varying length depending on diet long canines and similar tooth replacement patterns stomach of artiodactyls is divided into four sections rumen reticulum omasum and abomasum only ruminants have a rumen after plant material is consumed it is mixed with saliva in rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material solids lump together to form a bolus or cud and is regurgitated when bolus enters mouth fluid is squeezed out with tongue and swallowed again ingested food passes to rumen and reticulum where microbes bacteria protozoa and fungi produce cellulase which is needed to break down cellulose in plants perissodactyls in contrast to ruminants store digested food that has left stomach in an enlarged cecum where it is fermented by bacteria carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat as compared to elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals which are necessary to break down tough complex plant fibers caecum is either absent or short and simple and large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than small intestine thumb bovine kidney mammalian excretory system involves many components like most other land animals mammals are and convert ammonia into urea which is done by liver as part of urea cycle bilirubin a waste product derived from blood cells is passed through bile and urine with help of enzymes excreted by liver passing of bilirubin via bile through intestinal tract gives mammalian feces a distinctive brown coloration distinctive features of mammalian kidney include presence of renal pelvis and renal pyramids and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla which is due to presence of elongated loops of henle only mammalian kidney has a bean shape although there are some exceptions such as multilobed kidneys of pinnipeds cetaceans and bears most adult placental mammals have no remaining trace of cloaca in embryo embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of anus and an anterior region that has different fates depending on sex of individual in females it develops into vestibule that receives urethra and vagina while in males it forms entirety of penile urethra however tenrecs golden moles and some shrews retain a cloaca as adults biological reviews cambridge journals in marsupials genital tract is separate from anus but a trace of original cloaca does remain externally monotremes which translates from greek into single hole have a true cloaca sound production thumb upright 1 35 a diagram of ultrasonic signals emitted by a bat and echo from a nearby object as in all other tetrapods mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds and a vocal tract which filters this sound lungs and surrounding musculature provide air stream and pressure required to phonate larynx controls pitch and volume of sound but strength lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume more primitive mammals such as echidna can only hiss as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx other mammals phonate using vocal folds as opposed to vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles movement or tenseness of vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming mammals can change position of larynx allowing them to breathe through nose while swallowing through mouth and to form both oral and nasal sounds nasal sounds such as a dog whine are generally soft sounds and oral sounds such as a dog bark are generally loud left thumb beluga whale echolocation sounds some mammals have a large larynx and thus a low pitched voice namely hammer headed bat where larynx can take up entirety of thoracic cavity while pushing lungs heart and trachea into abdomen large vocal pads can also lower pitch as in low pitched roars of big cats production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as african elephant loxodonta spp and baleen whales small mammals with small have ability to produce ultrasound which can be detected by modifications to middle ear and cochlea ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles which might have been important during mesozoic when birds and reptiles were dominant predators this private channel is used by some rodents in for example mother to pup communication and by bats when echolocating toothed whales also use echolocation but as opposed to vocal membrane that extends upward from vocal folds they have a melon to manipulate sounds some mammals namely primates have air sacs attached to larynx which may function to lower resonances or increase volume of sound vocal production system is controlled by cranial nerve nuclei in brain and supplied by recurrent laryngeal nerve and superior laryngeal nerve branches of vagus nerve vocal tract is supplied by hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves electrical stimulation of gray peg region of mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans seals cetaceans elephants and possibly bats in humans this is result of a direct connection between motor cortex which controls movement and motor neurons in spinal cord fur thumb porcupines use their spines for defense function primary function of fur of mammals is thermoregulation others include protection sensory purposes waterproofing and camouflage types definitive which may be shed after reaching a certain length vibrissae sensory hairs most commonly whiskers pelage guard hairs under fur and awn hair spines stiff guard hair used for defense example porcupines bristles long hairs usually used in visual signals example lion mane velli often called down fur which insulates newborn mammals wool long soft and often curly thermoregulation hair length is not a factor in thermoregulation for example some tropical mammals such as sloths have same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation and conversely other tropical mammals with short hair have same insulating value as arctic mammals of fur can increase an animal s insulation value and arctic mammals especially have dense fur for example musk ox has guard hairs measuring as well as a dense underfur which forms an airtight coat allowing them to survive in temperatures of some desert mammals such as camels use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin allowing animal to stay cool a camel s fur may reach in summer but skin stays at aquatic mammals conversely trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping skin dry thumb a leopard s disruptively colored coat provides camouflage for this ambush predator coloration mammalian coats are colored for a variety of reasons major selective pressures including camouflage sexual selection communication and thermoregulation coloration in both hair and skin of mammals is mainly determined by type and amount of melanin for brown and black colors and for a range of yellow to reddish brown colors giving mammals an earth tone some mammals like mandrill have more vibrant colors due to structural coloration many sloths appear green because their fur hosts green algae this may be a symbiotic relation that affords camouflage to sloths camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey in arctic and subarctic mammals such as arctic fox alopex lagopus collared lemming stoat mustela and snowshoe hare lepus americanus seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage some arboreal mammals notably primates and marsupials have shades of violet green or blue skin on parts of their bodies indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution aposematism warning off possible predators is most likely explanation of black and white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves such as in foul smelling skunk and powerful and aggressive honey badger coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic as in many primate species differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels important in mate selection coat color may influence ability to retain heat depending on how much light is reflected mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation and stay warmer and some smaller mammals such as voles have darker fur in winter white fur of arctic mammals such as polar bear may reflect more solar radiation directly onto skin dazzling black and white striping of zebras appear to provide some protection from biting flies reproductive system thumb right goat kids stay with their mother until they are weaned in male placentals penis is used both for urination and copulation depending on species an erection may be fueled by blood flow into vascular spongy tissue or by muscular action a penis may be contained in a prepuce when not erect and some placentals also have a penis bone baculum marsupials typically have forked penises while echidna penis generally has four heads with only two functioning testes of most mammals descend into scrotum which is typically posterior to penis but is often anterior in marsupials female mammals generally have a clitoris labia majora and labia minora on outside while internal system contains paired oviducts 1 2 uteri 1 2 cervices and a vagina marsupials have two lateral vaginas and a medial vagina vagina of monotremes is better understood as a urogenital sinus uterine systems of placental mammals can vary between a duplex were there are two uteri and cervices which open into vagina a bipartite were two uterine horns have a single cervix that connects to vagina a bicornuate which consists where two uterine horns that are connected distally but separate medially creating a y shape and a simplex which has a single uterus thumb left matschie s tree kangaroo with young in pouch ancestral condition for mammal reproduction is birthing of relatively undeveloped either through direct or a short period as soft shelled eggs this is likely due to fact that torso could not expand due to presence of epipubic bones oldest demonstration of this reproductive style is with which produced undeveloped but at much higher litter sizes than any modern mammal 38 specimens most modern mammals are viviparous giving birth to live young however five species of monotreme platypus and four species of echidna lay eggs monotremes have a sex determination system different from that of most other mammals in particular sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal viviparous mammals are in subclass theria those living today are in marsupial and placental infraclasses marsupials have a short gestation period typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development in many species this takes place within a pouch like sac marsupium located in front of mother s abdomen this is plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals presence of epipubic bones in all non placental mammals prevents expansion of torso needed for full pregnancy even non placental eutherians probably reproduced this way placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young usually after long gestation periods they get their name from placenta which connects developing fetus to uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake in placental mammals epipubic is either completely lost or converted into baculum allowing torso to be able to expand and thus birth developed offspring mammary glands of mammals are specialized to produce milk primary source of nutrition for newborns monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have nipples seen in most mammals but they do have mammary glands young lick milk from a mammary patch on mother s belly compared to placental mammals milk of marsupials changes greatly in both production rate and in nutrient composition due to underdeveloped young in addition mammary glands have more autonomy allowing them to supply separate to young at different development stages lactose is main sugar in placental mammal milk while monotreme and marsupial milk is dominated by oligosaccharides weaning is process in which a mammal becomes less dependent on their mother s milk and more on solid food endothermy nearly all mammals are endothermic warm blooded most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm like birds mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic cold blooded reptiles and insects endothermy requires plenty of food energy so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size a rare exception naked mole rat produces little metabolic heat so it is considered an operational birds are also endothermic so endothermy is not unique to mammals species lifespan among mammals species maximum lifespan varies significantly for example shrew has a lifespan of two years whereas oldest bowhead whale is recorded to be 211 years although underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain numerous studies indicate that ability to repair dna damage is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan in a 1974 study by hart and it was found that dna excision repair capability increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with capacity to recognize dna double strand breaks as well as level of dna repair protein in a study of cells from sixteen mammalian species genes employed in dna repair were found to be up regulated in longer lived species cellular level of dna repair enzyme poly adp ribose polymerase was found to correlate with species lifespan in a study of 13 mammalian species three additional studies of a variety of mammalian species also reported a correlation between species lifespan and dna repair capability locomotion terrestrial thumb running gait photographs by eadweard muybridge 1887 most vertebrates amphibians reptiles and some mammals such as humans and bears are plantigrade walking on whole of underside of foot many mammals such as cats and dogs are digitigrade walking on their toes greater stride length allowing more speed digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement some animals such as horses are walking on tips of their toes this even further increases their stride length and thus their speed a few mammals namely great apes are also known to walk on their knuckles at least for their front legs giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle walkers some mammals are bipeds using only two limbs for locomotion which can be seen in for example humans and great apes bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds conserve more energy and have ability to manipulate objects with their hands which aids in foraging instead of walking some bipeds hop such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats animals will use different gaits for different speeds terrain and situations for example horses show four natural gaits slowest horse gait is walk then there are three faster gaits which from slowest to fastest are trot canter and gallop animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally such as for moving sideways or backwards for example main human gaits are bipedal walking and running but they employ many other gaits occasionally including a four legged crawl in tight spaces mammals show a vast range of gaits order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence for quadrupeds there are three main categories walking gaits running gaits and leaping gaits walking is most common gait where some feet are on ground at any given time and found in almost all legged animals running is considered to occur when at some points in stride all feet are off ground in a moment of suspension arboreal thumb left upright gibbons are very good because their elongated limbs enable them to easily swing and grasp on to branches arboreal animals frequently have elongated limbs that help them cross gaps reach fruit or other resources test firmness of support ahead and in some cases to swing between trees many arboreal species such as tree porcupines silky anteaters spider monkeys and possums use prehensile tails to grasp branches in spider monkey tip of tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad which provides increased friction claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient direction of forces animal applies this is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from perspective of such a small animal however claws can interfere with an animal s ability to grasp very small branches as they may wrap too far around and prick animal s own paw frictional gripping is used by primates relying upon hairless fingertips squeezing branch between fingertips generates frictional force that holds animal s hand to branch however this type of grip depends upon angle of frictional force thus upon diameter of branch with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability to control descent especially down large diameter branches some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating foot into a reversed posture this allows claws to hook into rough surface of bark opposing force of gravity small size provides many advantages to arboreal species such as increasing relative size of branches to animal lower center of mass increased stability lower mass allowing movement on smaller branches and ability to move through more cluttered habitat size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as sugar glider some species of primate bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath branch both pitching and tipping become irrelevant as only method of failure would be losing their grip aerial thumb upright 1 35 slow motion and normal speed of egyptian fruit bats flying bats are only mammals that can truly fly they fly through air at a constant speed by moving their wings up and down usually with some fore aft movement as well because animal is in motion there is some airflow relative to its body which combined with velocity of wings generates a faster airflow moving over wing this generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards upwards components of these counteract gravity keeping body in air while forward component provides thrust to counteract both drag from wing and from body as a whole wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than those of birds allowing bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag by folding wings inwards towards their body on they use 35 less energy during flight than birds membranes are delicate ripping easily however tissue of bat s membrane is able to regrow such that small tears can heal quickly surface of their wings is equipped with touch sensitive receptors on small bumps called merkel cells also found on human fingertips these sensitive areas are different in bats as each bump has a tiny hair in center making it even more sensitive and allowing bat to detect and collect information about air flowing over its wings and to fly more efficiently by changing shape of its wings in response fossorial and subterranean a fossorial from latin meaning digger is an animal adapted to digging which lives primarily but not solely underground some examples are badgers and naked mole rats many rodent species are also considered fossorial because they live in burrows for most but not all of day species that live exclusively underground are described as subterranean some organisms are fossorial to aid in temperature regulation while others use underground habitat for protection from predators or for food storage an animal is said to be sub fossorial if it shows limited adaptations to a fossorial lifestyle damiani r 2003 earliest evidence of cynodont burrowing royal society publishing volume 270 issue 1525 fossorial mammals have a fusiform body thickest at shoulders and tapering off at tail and nose unable to see in dark burrows most have degenerated eyes but degeneration varies between species pocket gophers for example are only semi fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes in fully fossorial marsupial mole eyes are degenerated and useless moles have vestigial eyes and cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering eyes external ears flaps are also very small or absent truly fossorial mammals have short stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal but semi fossorial mammals have cursorial legs front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows and back paws have webbing as well as claws which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth many fossorial mammals such as shrews hedgehogs and moles were classified under now obsolete order insectivora aquatic thumb a pod of short beaked common dolphins swimming fully aquatic mammals cetaceans and sirenians have lost their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through water flipper movement is continuous whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down propelling themselves through vertical movement while their flippers are mainly used for steering their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside down in water flukes of sirenians are raised up and down in long strokes to move animal forward and can be twisted to turn forelimbs are paddle like flippers which aid in turning and slowing semi aquatic mammals like pinnipeds have two pairs of flippers on front and back fore flippers and hind flippers elbows and ankles are enclosed within body pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag in addition to their streamlined bodies they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water they also lack pili so their fur can be streamlined as they swim they rely on their fore flippers for locomotion in a wing like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles fore flipper movement is not continuous and animal glides between each stroke compared to terrestrial carnivorans fore limbs are reduced in length which gives locomotor muscles at shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage hind flippers serve as stabilizers other semi aquatic mammals include beavers hippopotamuses otters and platypuses hippos are very large semi aquatic mammals and their barrel shaped bodies have graviportal skeletal structures adapted to carrying their enormous weight and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along bottom of a river behavior communication and vocalization thumb upright vervet monkeys use at least four distinct alarm calls for different predators many mammals communicate by vocalizing vocal communication serves many purposes including in mating rituals as warning calls to indicate food sources and for social purposes males often call during mating rituals to ward off other males and to attract females as in roaring of lions and red deer songs of humpback whale may be signals to females they have different dialects in different regions of ocean social vocalizations include territorial calls of gibbons and use of frequency in greater spear nosed bats to distinguish between groups vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators and reactions of other monkeys vary according to call for example if an alarm call signals a python monkeys climb into trees whereas eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on ground prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal type size and speed of an approaching predator elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting screaming trumpeting roaring and rumbling some of rumbling calls are infrasonic below hearing range of humans and can be heard by other elephants up to away at still times near sunrise and sunset left thumb orca calling including occasional echolocation clicks mammals signal by a variety of means many give visual anti predator signals as when deer and gazelle stot honestly indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape or when white tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed informing predator that it has been detected many mammals make use of scent marking sometimes possibly to help defend territory but probably with a range of functions both within and between species microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation feeding thumb a short beaked echidna foraging for insects to maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet while earliest mammals were probably predators different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways some eat other animals this is a carnivorous diet and includes insectivorous diets other mammals called herbivores eat plants which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose an herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory seed eating folivory leaf eating frugivory fruit eating nectar eating gum eating and fungus eating digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances and make them available for digestion which are either housed in stomach or in a large cecum some mammals are consuming feces to absorb nutrients not digested when food was first ingested an omnivore eats both prey and plants carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because proteins lipids and minerals found in meat require little in way of specialized digestion exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi chambered stomach like terrestrial herbivores size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type allen s rule since small mammals have a high ratio of heat losing surface area to heat generating volume they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate mammals that weigh less than about are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate slow complex digestive process of an herbivore larger animals on other hand generate more heat and less of this heat is lost they can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates or a slower digestive process herbivores furthermore mammals that weigh more than usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects ants or termites some mammals are omnivores and display varying degrees of carnivory and herbivory generally leaning in favor of one more than other since plants and meat are digested differently there is a preference for one over other as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous they are grouped into three categories 50 70 meat 70 and greater of meat and 50 or less of meat dentition of consists of dull triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food hypercarnivores however have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing and in some cases strong jaws for bone crushing as in case of hyenas allowing them to consume bones some extinct groups notably had saber shaped canines some physiological carnivores consume plant matter and some physiological herbivores consume meat from a behavioral aspect this would make them omnivores but from physiological standpoint this may be due to physiologically animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous thus such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification for example it is well documented that some ungulates such as giraffes camels and cattle will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients also cats which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material such as hairballs aid with hemoglobin production and as a laxative many mammals in absence of sufficient food requirements in an environment suppress their metabolism and conserve energy in a process known as hibernation in period preceding hibernation larger mammals such as bears become to increase fat stores whereas smaller mammals prefer to collect and stash food slowing of metabolism is accompanied by a decreased heart and respiratory rate as well as a drop in internal temperatures which can be around ambient temperature in some cases for example internal temperatures of hibernating arctic ground squirrels can drop to however head and neck always stay above a few mammals in hot environments aestivate in times of drought or extreme heat namely fat tailed dwarf lemur intelligence in intelligent mammals such as primates cerebrum is larger relative to rest of brain intelligence itself is not easy to define but indications of intelligence include ability to learn matched with behavioral flexibility rats for example are considered to be highly intelligent as they can learn and perform new tasks an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat in some mammals food gathering appears to be related to intelligence a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat which must think to outwit its prey thumb a bonobo fishing for termites with a stick tool use by animals may indicate different levels of learning and cognition sea otter uses rocks as essential and regular parts of its foraging behaviour smashing abalone from rocks or breaking open shells with some populations spending 21 of their time making tools other tool use such as chimpanzees using twigs to fish for termites may be developed by watching others use tools and may even be a true example of animal teaching tools may even be used in solving puzzles in which animal appears to experience a eureka moment other mammals that do not use tools such as dogs can also experience a eureka moment brain size was previously considered a major indicator of intelligence of an animal since most of brain is used for maintaining bodily functions greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately or exponent of body mass comparison of a particular animal s brain size with expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence sperm whales have largest brain mass of any animal on earth averaging and in mature males self awareness appears to be a sign of abstract thinking self awareness although not well defined is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as reasoning traditional method for measuring this is mirror test which determines if an animal possesses ability of self recognition mammals that have passed mirror test include asian elephants some pass some do not chimpanzees orangutans humans from 18 months mirror stage bottlenose dolphins killer whales and false killer whales social structure thumb female elephants live in stable groups along with their offspring thumb dolphins are known for their intelligence and travel in groups eusociality is highest level of social organization these societies have an overlap of adult generations division of reproductive labor and cooperative caring of young usually insects such as bees ants and termites have eusocial behavior but it is demonstrated in two rodent species naked mole rat and mole rat is when animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of same species but fall short of qualifying as eusocial that is presocial animals can display communal living cooperative care of young or primitive division of reproductive labor but they do not display all of three essential traits of eusocial animals humans and some species of callitrichidae marmosets and tamarins are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young harry harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys presocial primates in 1958 results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually a fission fusion society is a society that changes frequently in its size and composition making up a permanent social group called parent group permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment in a fission fusion society main parent group can fracture fission into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances for example a number of males may break off from main group in order to hunt or forage for food during day but at night they may return to join fusion primary group to share food and partake in other activities many mammals exhibit this such as primates for example orangutans and spider monkeys elephants spotted hyenas lions and dolphins solitary animals defend a territory and avoid social interactions with members of its species except during breeding season this is to avoid resource competition as two individuals of same species would occupy same niche and to prevent depletion of food a solitary animal while foraging can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey thumb left red kangaroos boxing for dominance in a hierarchy individuals are either dominant or submissive a despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant while others are submissive as in wolves and lemurs and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals where there is a top individual and a bottom individual pecking orders may also be ranked by sex where lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than top individual of other sex as in hyenas dominant individuals or alphas have a high chance of reproductive success especially in harems where one or a few males resident males have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group non resident males can also be accepted in harems but some species such as common vampire bat rotundus may be more strict some mammals are perfectly monogamous meaning that they mate for life and take no other partners even after original mate s death as with wolves eurasian beavers and otters there are three types of polygamy either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights polygyny multiple males that females mate with polyandry or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females it is much more common for polygynous mating to happen which excluding leks are estimated to occur in up to 90 of mammals lek mating occurs when males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations as in harbor seals all higher mammals excluding monotremes share two major adaptations for care of young live birth and lactation these imply a group wide choice of a degree of parental care they may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in or feed and guard them often for a prolonged period of time many mammals are k selected and invest more time and energy into their young than do r selected animals when two animals mate they both share an interest in success of offspring though often to different extremes mammalian females exhibit some degree of maternal aggression another example of parental care which may be targeted against other females of species or young of other females however some mammals may aunt infants of other females and care for them mammalian males may play a role in child rearing as with tenrecs however this varies species to species even within same genus for example males of southern pig tailed macaque do not participate in child care whereas males of japanese macaque m do humans and other mammals in human culture thumb upper paleolithic cave painting of a variety of large mammals lascaux c 17 300 years old non human mammals play a wide variety of roles in human culture they are most popular of pets with tens of millions of dogs cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around world mammals such as mammoths horses and deer are among earliest subjects of art being found in upper paleolithic cave paintings such as at lascaux major artists such as albrecht durer george stubbs and edwin landseer are known for their portraits of mammals many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals chapters on hunting deer wild hog boar rabbit and squirrel mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport often combined with betting on outcome there is a tension between role of animals as companions to humans and their existence as individuals with rights of their own mammals further play a wide variety of roles in literature film mythology and religion uses and importance thumb left upright cattle have been kept for milk for thousands of years domestic mammals form a large part of livestock raised for meat across world they include 2009 around 1 4 billion cattle 1 billion sheep 1 billion domestic pigs and 1985 over 700 million rabbits working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from origins of agriculture their numbers declining with arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery in 2004 they still provided some 80 of power for mainly small farms in third world and some 20 of world s transport again mainly in rural areas in mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles pack animals continue to transport goods mammal skins provide leather for shoes clothing and upholstery wool from mammals including sheep goats and alpacas has been used for centuries for clothing mammals serve a major role in science as experimental animals both in fundamental biological research such as in genetics and in development of new medicines which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety millions of mammals especially mice and rats are used in experiments each year a knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse with an inactivated gene replaced or disrupted with an artificial piece of dna they enable study of sequenced genes whose functions are unknown a small percentage of mammals are non human primates used in research for their similarity to humans charles darwin jared diamond and others have noted importance of domesticated mammals in neolithic development of agriculture and of civilization causing farmers to replace hunter gatherers around world this transition from hunting and gathering to herding flocks and growing crops was a major step in human history new agricultural economies based on domesticated mammals caused radical restructuring of human societies worldwide alterations in biodiversity and significant changes in earth s landforms and its atmosphere momentous outcomes hybrids hybrids are offspring resulting from breeding of two genetically distinct individuals which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous deliberate or accidental of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes hybrids between different subspecies within a species such as between bengal tiger and siberian tiger are known as intra specific hybrids hybrids between different species within same genus such as between lions and tigers are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses hybrids between different genera such as between sheep and goats are known as intergeneric hybrids natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones where two populations of species within same genera or species living in same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other some hybrids have been recognized as species such as red wolf though this is controversial artificial selection deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals is being used to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor a breeding back intraspecific hybrid may be very similar to extinct wildtype in appearance ecological niche and to some extent genetics but initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction as a result bred back breeds are at best vague look alikes of extinct as heck cattle are of aurochs purebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction through process of genetic pollution uncontrolled hybridization introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out competition from hybrid species when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact extinction in some species especially rare varieties is possible interbreeding can swamp rarer gene pool and create hybrids depleting purebred gene pool for example endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from domestic water buffalo such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process nevertheless hybridization threatens existence of rare species threats thumb upright 1 4 biodiversity of large mammal species per continent before and after humans arrived there loss of species from ecological communities defaunation is primarily driven by human activity this has resulted in empty forests ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates in quaternary extinction event mass die off of megafaunal variety coincided with appearance of humans suggesting a human influence one hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals such as woolly mammoth into extinction 2019 global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services by states that total biomass of wild mammals has declined by 82 percent since beginning of human civilization various species are predicted to become extinct in near future among them rhinoceros primates pangolins and giraffes hunting alone threatens hundreds of mammalian species around world scientists claim that growing demand for meat is contributing to biodiversity loss as this is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction species rich habitats such as significant portions of amazon rainforest are being converted to agricultural land for meat production according to world wildlife fund s 2016 living planet index global wildlife populations have declined 58 since 1970 primarily due to habitat destruction over hunting and pollution they project that if current trends continue 67 of wildlife could disappear by 2020 another influence is over hunting and poaching which can reduce overall population of game animals especially those located near villages as in case of peccaries effects of poaching can especially be seen in ivory trade with african elephants marine mammals are at risk from entanglement from fishing gear notably cetaceans with discard mortalities ranging from 65 000 to 86 000 individuals annually attention is being given to endangered species globally notably through convention on biological diversity otherwise known as rio accord which includes 189 signatory countries that are focused on identifying endangered species and habitats another notable conservation organization is iucn which has a membership of over 1 200 governmental and non governmental organizations recent extinctions can be directly attributed to human influences iucn characterizes recent extinction as those that have occurred past cut off point of 1500 and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015 some species such as pere david s deer are extinct in wild and survive solely in captive populations other species such as florida panther are ecologically extinct surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have no impact on ecosystem other populations are only
