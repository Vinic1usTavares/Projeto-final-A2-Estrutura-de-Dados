author yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild germany s intellectual and cultural life reintroducing literature banned by nazis and fostering growth of younger writers despite these efforts doblin was disappointed by apparent continuity between nazi years and postwar climate his growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of

china wang lun also had an influence on younger german writers including lion feuchtwanger anna seghers and bertolt brecht for latter wang lun provided an impulse for development of theory of epic theatre in commercial sales it is doblin s most successful novel after berlin alexanderplatz wadzeks kampf mit der dampfturbine thumb cover of first edition of wadzeks kampf mit der dampfturbine doblin s 1918 comic novel has been seen in its experimental narrative technique its refusal to psychologize its characters and its depictions of berlin as modern metropolis as a precursor to doblin s better known berlin alexanderplatz wadzeks kampf mit der dampfturbine wadzek s battle with steam turbine tells story of wadzek a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor his futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in fortification and quixotic defense of his family s garden house in suburban reinickendorf following dissipation of this endeavor he

bertolt brecht wallenstein although doblin s 1920 epic about thirty years war was in general favorably received by critics he was disappointed with reception because he felt he had created in wallenstein a peerless work as a consequence he wrote a scathing critique of critics which he published in 1921 under title der sein stoff und die kritik epic poet his material and critique novel centers on tension between ferdinand ii holy roman emperor and his general albrecht von wallenstein wallenstein represents a new type of warfare characterized by ruthless realpolitik and capitalist expansion while ferdinand becomes increasingly overwhelmed by course of events and gradually retreats from politics altogether doblin s approach to narrating war differed from prevailing historiography in that rather than interpreting thirty years war primarily as a religious conflict he portrays it critically as absurd consequence of a combination of national political financial and individual psychological factors doblin saw a strong similarity between thirty years war and first world war during which he wrote wallenstein novel is counted among most innovative and significant historical novels in german literary tradition berge meere und giganten doblin s 1924 science fiction novel recounts course of human history from 20th to 27th century portraying it as a catastrophic global struggle between technological mania natural forces and competing political visions berge meere und giganten mountains seas and giants presciently invokes such topics as urbanization alienation from nature ecological devastation mechanization dehumanization of modern world as well as mass migration globalization totalitarianism fanaticism terrorism state surveillance genetic engineering
