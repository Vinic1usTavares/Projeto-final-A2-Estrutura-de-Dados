of available paper was insufficient for full benefits to be seen within months outbreak of korean war led to paper shortages that forced gold to find a new printer robert m guinn new paper was of even lower quality a disappointment to gold according to gold magazine was profitable within five issues an incredible achievement in his words in summer of 1951 disagreements within world editions led to attempts to disrupt galaxy distribution ashley transformations p 32 according to gold circulation director and head of american office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them and made sure that ones that did get distributed went to areas of united states such as south where there was little or no audience for magazine head of french office of world editions came to united states to find

agreed to sell galaxy to printer robert m guinn it was only after sale was complete that sabotaged distribution came to light world editions wanted to buy back magazine but guinn quoted a price four

buying galaxy circulation at about 90 000 was highest of science fiction magazines but guinn decided to cut costs and in 1959 raised cover price and changed magazine to a bimonthly schedule while increasing page count guinn also cut rates paid to authors from three and occasionally four cents a word to one and a half cents a word these changes saved galaxy over 12 000 a year result was a fall

nebula awards in 1972 and 1973 respectively and robert silverberg s a time of changes won nebula in 1971 sturgeon s short story slow sculpture won both hugo and nebula in 1970 a letter column was

1974 and won nebula baen s successors pierce stine and kemske were unable to maintain his standard pohl remained loyal to magazine but serialization of his novel jem exemplified galaxy growing problems due to magazine s increasingly erratic schedule serialization stretched from last issue of 1978 into 1980 well after it had appeared in book form in november 1977 paul walker took over book column from spider robinson and jerry pournelle left science column at end of 1978 artwork quality dropped to an amateurish level and despite appearance of a few successful stories and novels such as c j s faded sun overall quality was dramatically worse than it had been under baen tymn ashley science fiction fantasy and weird fiction magazines p 305 galaxy deterioration was largely due to financial troubles of publisher arnold abramson who reduced pay rate at a time of high inflation to a penny a word even that low rate did not guarantee timely disbursement and many writers stopped submitting because of galaxy reputation for paying slowly if at all costs were increasing for paper postage and production and paperback anthology market was booming adding to competition that galaxy faced floyd kemske s only issue never received newsstand distribution doomed by financial troubles of magazine s publisher vincent mccaffrey tymn ashley science fiction fantasy and weird fiction magazines p 306 cover layout and artwork thumb right nine issues of galaxy showing major variations in cover design over magazine s had a characteristic cover style in 1950s with an inverted white l shape greek gamma framing cover art this style was copied by several magazines including authentic science fiction and startling stories when astounding followed suit in late 1951 gold commented sarcastically in an editorial that galaxy would like to know when we may have it format back again quoted in rosheim galaxy magazine p 33 first variation came with september 1956 issue which widened left hand strip of white to allow room to print story titles and author names december 1961 issue was first to eliminate strip on left and until july 1969 magazine varied between this layout inverted l and a version with no white at all first used on august 1965 issue another change visible in that issue is reversal of title coloring to white lettering on a block of red this was used from august 1963 to december 1965 in august 1969 title was enlarged to fill width of magazine this issue had white inverted l but it was last one to do so till 1980 after august 1969 cover paintings spanned entire cover though with some minor variations in layout such as can be seen in october 1976 issue then in september 1978 undated on cover but numbered vol 39 no 7 original typeface for galaxy was abandoned for last few issues final issue edited by kemske returned to previous layout and typeface although with a magazine twice size of original digest when e j gold revived galaxy in 1994 he restored inverted l and employed a predominantly black and white look for eight issues he published notable artists who contributed regularly to galaxy included ed emshwiller who won several hugo awards for his work peter nicholls hugo in clute nicholls encyclopedia of science fiction 1993 pp 595 600 ashley transformations p 31 hugo nominee wallace wood hugo award for best professional artist and jack gaughan who won three hugos in late 1960s partly for his work in galaxy gaughan was commissioned by pohl to provide cover and interior art for jack vance s dragon masters in 1962 resulting illustrations made gaughan immediately famous in science fiction field di fate infinite worlds p 182 in 1950s and 1960s galaxy retained original artwork sent in by its artists though emshwiller much of whose best color work appeared there was able to negotiate an exception to this rule retaining art for his portfolios ortiz emshwiller p fate infinite worlds p 160 in 1972 much of this artwork including both interior and cover illustrations was sold off by robert guinn who had kept it when he sold galaxy to upd in 1969 robert guinn advertisement galaxy january 1972 p 157 influence on field isaac asimov in his memoirs recalled being deeply impressed by first issue of galaxy and that many fans including himself believed that magazine became field s leader almost immediately asimov in memory yet green p 602 in critic john clute s assessment galaxy indeed swiftly supplanted astounding and remained leading magazine in field until pohl resigned as editor in 1969 clute sf illustrated encyclopedia p 102 science fiction historian and critic mike ashley regarded galaxy success as main reason for subsequent boom in science fiction magazines commenting that it revolutionized field overnight ashley transformations p 24 under gold galaxy provided a market for social science fiction stories that might not have been accepted by astounding and fantasy science fiction other leading magazines james gunn quoted in rosheim galaxy magazine p 10 pohl stated in 1965 that almost every major science fiction writer whose career began after 1950 primarily wrote for galaxy and that others closely imitated gold s magazine he described galaxy as where stunning new kinds of science fiction flowered and changed everything in science fiction frederik pohl introduction in pohl greenberg olander galaxy thirty years of innovative science fiction p xii in his opinion gold s innovation was to ask writers to consider not just new technology but subsequent impact of that technology on society he adds what galaxy brought to magazine science fiction was a kind of sophisticated intellectual subtlety after galaxy it was impossible to go on being naive science fiction author brian stableford argues that galaxy quickly usurped astoundings position as pioneer of hardcore sf s progress because it embraced and gleefully pursued a new series of challenges to moral orthodoxy stableford p 47 sf historian david kyle ascribes galaxy influence specifically to gold saying that of all editors in and out of post war scene most influential beyond any doubt was h l gold and that new direction he set led inevitably to new wave celebrated science fiction literary movement of 1960s kyle a pictorial history of science fiction pp 119 120 kyle s assessment of gold is echoed by writer barry n malzberg who calls gold perhaps greatest editor in history of all fields for first half of his tenure sf authors and historians brian aldiss and david wingrove summarize galaxy history by saying that it lasted for thirty mainly glorious years aldiss wingrove trillion year spree p 228 it brought into sunlight a number of excellent satirists comedians and aldiss wingrove trillion year spree p 237 and through influence of its reduced focus on technology played an important role in attracting women to write science fiction aldiss wingrove trillion year spree p 259 publication details
