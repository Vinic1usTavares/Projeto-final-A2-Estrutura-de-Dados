with mick jagger left has been a source of highly acclaimed music as well as deep personal conflict for decades book was generally well received by critics with several commenting on honesty of work charles spencer of daily telegraph wrote life offers much more than vicarious thrills it captures true spirit of rock and roll nitty gritty of life on road and just what it feels like to be a heroin addict who doesn t know where his next fix is coming from it also movingly captures richards extraordinary love of music an even more powerful addiction for him than smack and perhaps more surprisingly his manifest destiny as a human being jim fusilli of wall street journal said that mr richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood family and fame and it s quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about joys of making music with a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief mr richards in life defies almost every public perception about him in independent john walsh commented he tells it with complete reckless disclosure sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine sometimes in tidier and more reflective sections you can detect hand of his co writer james white mischief fox but of this book are honesty confessionalism telling it straight new yorker said of life half book half brand extension it s an entertaining rambling monologue a slurry romp through life of a man who knew every pleasure denied himself nothing and never paid price new york times said mr richards now 66 writes with uncommon candor and immediacy he s decided that he s going to tell it as he remembers it and helped along with notebooks letters and a diary he once kept he remembers almost everything popular press focused on relationship between jagger and richards graham smith in daily mail said unsurprisingly rolling stones guitarist isn t entirely complimentary towards his childhood friend but nobody was expecting him to decimate jagger s status as a legendary ladies man by revealing singer has a tiny todger before quoting richards because i love man dearly i m still his mate but he makes it very difficult to be his friend tom bryant in daily mirror wrote keith says his songwriting partner started to become unbearable in early 80s adding i think mick thinks i belong to him but i haven t been
