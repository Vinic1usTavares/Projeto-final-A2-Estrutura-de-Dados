frank sutton originally situated in camp wilson in north carolina setting was moved to fictional camp henderson in california beck clark p 88 show was a fish out of water piece which like its contemporary beverly hillbillies featured rural characters out of their normal settings davis blythe winans and winans p p 331 like other comedies of 1960s show avoided political commentary especially concerning vietnam war and focused instead on predicaments that ensued from gomer s unintentional breaking of rules or sticking his foot in his mouth among themes explored were honesty and strong family values supposedly inherent in small town life according to author gerard jones gomer pyle s basic message was far simpler than any corporate suburban sitcoms with their lessons in compromise and role following it said merely that oldest most basic least sophisticated sort of sweetness could redeem even toughest modern types newcomb pp 113 115 author elizabeth hirschman noted that gomer represented a uniquely american archetype a large powerful man physically with simple honest nature of a child or animal she also noted that like stories with characters of such an archetype gomer s trusting nature was often taken advantage of though in end he reaps happiness because of his innocence hirschman pp 73 75 in his book watching m a s h watching america media and communications scholar james wittebols said that gomer pyle illustrated how class differences supposedly negated or diminished by military training made themselves apparent in military world wittebols p 12 characters gomer pyle played by jim nabors from mayberry north carolina is a good natured and innocent private whose naivete constantly annoys his drill instructor sergeant carter eventually however his unquestioning love and trust of world lead those in his platoon to befriend him his good nature attracts friendship of women meanwhile in so far as carter s abrasiveness repels women gomer is in position of salvaging numerous social occasions by charming women whose opinions are important to officers at marine base gomer was created as a stereotype of a rural american according to time he wears a gee whiz expression spouts homilies out of a lopsided mouth and lopes around uncertainly like a stepping through a field of cow dung he is a walking disaster area though never promoted beyond private
