aethelred lord of mercians or ealdorman aethelred of mercia died 911 became ruler of english mercia shortly after death of its last king ceolwulf ii in 879 his rule was confined to western half as eastern mercia was then part of viking ruled danelaw aethelred s ancestry is unknown he was probably leader of an unsuccessful mercian invasion of wales in 881 and soon afterwards he acknowledged lordship of king alfred great of wessex alliance was cemented by marriage of aethelred to alfred s daughter aethelflaed in 886 alfred took possession of london which had suffered greatly from several viking occupations as it had traditionally been a mercian town he handed control to aethelred in 892 vikings renewed their attacks and following year aethelred led an army of mercians west saxons and welsh to victory over a viking army at battle of buttington he spent next three years fighting them alongside alfred s son future king edward elder at some time in decade 899 to 909 aethelred s health may have declined and aethelflaed may have become effective ruler of mercia after aethelred s death aethelflaed ruled as lady of mercians until her own death in 918 couple s only child a daughter called aelfwynn then ruled briefly until deposed by her uncle king edward background 300px right england in time of aethelred mercia was dominant kingdom in southern england in eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by king egbert of wessex at battle of ellendun in 825 egbert briefly conquered mercia but it recovered its independence in 830 and thereafter two kingdoms became allies which was to be an important factor in english resistance to vikings keynes and lapidge alfred great pp 11 12 mercians traditionally held overlordship over wales and in 853 king burgred of mercia obtained assistance of king aethelwulf of wessex in an invasion of wales in order to reassert their hegemony same year burgred married aethelwulf s daughter keynes and lapidge alfred great p 12 charles edwards wales and britons p 486 in 865 viking great heathen army landed in east anglia and used it as a starting point for an invasion east anglians were forced to buy peace and following year vikings invaded northumbria where they established an obscure northumbrian man called egbert as puppet king in 867 they then moved on to nottingham in mercia where they spent winter of 867 868 burgred was joined by king aethelred of wessex and his brother future king alfred for a combined attack on vikings but they refused an engagement and in end mercians bought peace with them following year vikings conquered east anglia stenton anglo saxon england pp 247 248 they returned to mercia in 872 two years later they expelled burgred and ceolwulf became king with their support ceolwulf was described by anglo saxon chronicle as a foolish king s thegn who was a puppet of vikings but historian ann williams regards this view as partial and distorted he was accepted as a true king by mercians and by king alfred in 877 vikings divided mercia taking eastern part for themselves and leaving ceolwulf with west williams ceolwulf vikings went on to attack wessex leaving ceolwulf free to renew mercian claims of hegemony in wales at almost same time as alfred s victory over vikings in 878 at battle of edington ceolwulf defeated and killed rhodri mawr king of north welsh territory of gwynedd charles edwards wales and britons pp 486 488 after ceolwulf s disappearance in 879 mercia began to fall under hegemony of wessex life early rule aethelred s descent is unknown and he does not appear to have been closely related to his immediate predecessors although his name suggests possible descent from earlier mercian kings bailey aelfwynn pp 112 113 he may have been related to king alfred s mercian father in law aethelred mucel and brother in law aethelwulf who appears to have been a member of aethelred s court from mid 880s aethelwulf 21 pase aethelred may have been man of same name who attested two mercian charters in late 860s keynes king alfred and mercians p 19 but he is not listed in two surviving charters of ceolwulf lists of witnesses to charters show that aethelred s witan council shared bishops and at least two ealdormen with ceolwulf but ceolwulf s thegns all disappeared abels alfred great p 181 in view of ian walker he was a royal ealdorman whose power base lay in south west of mercia in former kingdom of hwicce around gloucester walker mercia p 69 however alex woolf suggests that he was probably son of king burgred of mercia and sister of alfred great although that would mean that aethelred s marriage was uncanonical as rome then forbade marriage between first cousins woolf view from west p 98 it is not known when aethelred took over following ceolwulf s death or disappearance but in view of thomas charles edwards a historian of medieval wales aethelred was almost certainly long hair leader of a mercian army which invaded gwynedd in 881 and was defeated by rhodri mawr s sons at battle of conwy this was described by welsh annals as revenge by god for rhodri defeat forced aethelred to abandon his ambitions in north wales but he continued to exercise overlordship over south eastern welsh kingdoms of glywysing and gwent charles edwards wales and britons pp 490 491 according to alfred s welsh biographer asser aethelred s might and tyrannical behaviour forced these kingdoms to submit to protection of king alfred s lordship keynes and lapidge alfred great pp 96 262 263 n 183 by 883 aethelred had accepted alfred s lordship charles edwards suggests that in 881 882 he tried to maintain his dominance in south east wales but alfred offered his protection to glywysing and gwent and in 882 883 aethelred accepted that west saxon power made continued independence impossible charles edwards comments implication of all this is that mercian submission to alfred a crucial step in creation of a single english kingdom occurred not just because of one battle alfred s victory over great army at edington in 878 but also because of another more distant battle god s revenge on mercians at conwy when anarawd of gwynedd and his brothers defeated aethelred and so brought about that collapse of mercian hegemony in wales from which alfred was only too pleased to benefit charles edwards wales and britons p 493 when aethelred made a grant to berkeley abbey in 883 he did it with approval of king alfred thus acknowledging alfred s lordship thereafter he usually acted with alfred s permission but issued some charters in his own name without reference to alfred such as at a meeting in risborough in buckinghamshire in 884 showing that english mercia extended quite far south east towards london keynes king alfred and mercians pp 20 21 29 after battle of edington in 878 alfred established a network of fortified settlements called burhs in wessex to protect his people and territory against viking attacks and when aethelred accepted alfred s lordship burhs were extended into mercia one of burhs was worcester where aethelred worked with its bishop and used standing roman walls in town s defences over next two generations worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen fleming britain after rome pp 246 248 london suffered severely from viking attacks and was several times occupied by viking armies in 886 alfred took possession of london and according to asser he restored city and made it habitable again he then handed control to aethelred fleming britain after rome pp 242 253 255 abels alfred great pp 174 176 historians however disagree about circumstances keynes king alfred and mercians p 22 according to frank stenton alfred recovered london by force from vikings and handed it to aethelred because it had previously been a mercian town and he respected traditions of other kingdoms stenton anglo saxon england pp 258 259 marios costambeys takes a similar view arguing that alfred s decision was probably due to need to maintain unity among english who were outside viking territory alfred p smyth suggests that chronicle s account reflects bias in alfred s favour and that aethelred took charge because he had a greater role in london s recovery than west saxon chronicler was willing to admit smyth king alfred great p 519 some versions of chronicle state that alfred besieged london in 883 and simon keynes argues that alfred probably took london at that time and that occupation in 886 may have been a restoration of london s defences following viking attacks close to city in 885 keynes king alfred and mercians pp 21 24 anglo saxon london called lundenwic was located a mile west of roman londinium but lundenwic was undefended and restoration was carried out inside walls of old roman city especially an area close to river thames now called but which was then known as aethelred s hythe after its mercian ruler aethelred moved quickly to restore area in 889 he and alfred granted property there to bishop of worcester and in 899 they made another grant to archbishop of canterbury both bishops were like aethelred mercians and strong allies of king alfred who had right to all tolls from markets along river bank fleming britain after rome pp 254 256 thumb aethelflaed as depicted in thirteenth

after restoration of london alfred received submission of all english people who were not under subjection to danes keynes king alfred and mercians pp 24 25 and alliance between wessex and mercia was cemented by marriage of aethelred to alfred s oldest daughter aethelflaed she is first recorded as aethelred s wife in a charter of 887 but keynes thinks that marriage may have taken place two or three years earlier keynes king alfred and mercians p 27 and historian maggie bailey dates it to between 882 and 887 with most likely political context being occupation of london in 886 aethelred was probably much older than his wife costambeys aethelred they had a daughter aelfwynn and according to twelfth century chronicler william of malmesbury she was their only child bailey aelfwynn p 113 in

took part in defence after defeat of one viking leader hastein alfred became godfather to one of hastein s two sons and aethelred to other soon afterwards english captured hastein s wife and children but they were returned to him because sons were godsons of english leaders charles edwards alliances godfathers p 57 in 893 aethelred brought troops from london to join alfred s son edward against a viking army at thorney in buckinghamshire but vikings were too strong for a direct attack so they were allowed to leave english territory later in year a larger viking force marched from essex through mercia to welsh border followed by aethelred with a joint force of mercians and west saxons welsh kings joined aethelred to meet vikings at battle of buttington where according to smyth these invaders were utterly routed in what was most decisive battle in war although marios costambeys states that vikings eventually cut their way out and retreated back to essex smyth scandinavian york and dublin pp 33 35 viking army finally dispersed in 896 for much of time alfred had been in west country defending devonshire and in view of richard abels king alfred had little to do directly with great victories enjoyed by english in 893 896 his son edward and his ealdormen in particular his son in law aethelred had won glory abels alfred great pp 304 305 in last years of ninth century three sub

alhhelm was responsible for lands bordering northern danelaw aethelwulf and alhhelm are not recorded after turn of century and aethelfrith may have been aethelflaed s chief lieutenant when aethelred s health collapsed soon afterwards keynes sees aethelfrith as an ealdorman of west saxon origin probably appointed by alfred to look after his interests in south east mercia keynes king alfred and mercians p 21 n 90 evidence from charters show that aethelred and aethelflaed supported religious communities in 883 they freed berkeley abbey from obligations to king s payments in kind and in 887 they confirmed possession of land and transferred manpower to minster in oxfordshire in 901 they gave land to much wenlock abbey and donated a gold chalice weighing thirty mancuses in honour of its former abbess saint in 903 they negotiated a settlement over a former monastic estate which bishops of worcester had been trying to recover since 840s and bishop wrote we never could get anywhere

maggie bailey believe that it occurred by 902 bailey cites mercian register entries from 902 showing aethelflaed acting alone or in conjunction with edward in military operations hart athelstan half king p 116 irish annals called three fragments also suggest that aethelred was unable to take an active part in government from about 902 wainwright collected papers pp 141 308 309 although he did

his life keynes king alfred and mercians p 37 n 159 but in a summary of his career in 2014 keynes does not mention this stating that aethelred and aethelflaed cooperated with king edward in campaigns

priory in gloucester according to a pact of paternal piety which formerly he pledged with aethelred ealdorman of people of mercians when king edward died in 924 aethelstan initially faced opposition

recorded his death in 911 as that of lord of mercians keynes edward king of anglo saxons pp 43 44 king edward s influence over mercia is unclear and he may have had less power than his father edward s

rule of mercians which come close to describing them as king and queen ryan conquest reform and making of england pp 296 298 pauline stafford comments that alfred s dominance in 890s over aethelred lord of mercians was as debatable at time as it still is stafford annals of aethelflaed p 112 in view of ann williams though he accepted west saxon overlordship aethelred behaved rather as a king of mercia than an ealdorman and charles insley states that mercia remained an independent kingdom until 920 insley pp 329 330 to welsh and irish looking east mercian rulers still kept all their old regality until aethelflaed s death in 918 and nick higham argues that celtic visions of aethelred and aethelflaed as king and queen certainly offer a different and equally valid contemporary take on complex politics of this transition to a new english state charles edwards wales and britons p 494 higham p 308 keynes takes west saxon view arguing that alfred created kingdom of anglo saxons inherited by his son edward elder in 899 and aethelred ruled mercia under king keynes points out that according to asser welsh king anarawd submitted to alfred on same terms as aethelred namely that in every respect he would be obedient to royal will keynes regards designation k king aethelred ii in handbook of british chronology as a delightfully provocative extension of received wisdom that mercia retained a real measure of independence in aethelred s time keynes edward king of anglo saxons pp 40 handbook of british chronology p 17 however keynes also says aethelred usually acted with permission of or in association with king alfred but occasionally he acted independently of him although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on royal in other words there is no mistaking that mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity but there is also no mistaking that aethelred moved in an alfredian world keynes king alfred and
