seconds it was carpentier s first racing victory since 1996 atlantic championship race at laguna seca both franchitti and jourdain were separated by a photo finish in duel for second since official

100 000 he spoke of his delight with win and was crying on his way to pit road it s been a long time coming and today we were a lap down were struggling at beginning of race and i never thought i would win this one there were some races in past that we thought we had a serious chance of winning and today for awhile we didn t think so you need everything to win a race you need yellow flags to work for you and you need to have a good car a car that lasts and good pit stops with team then with good luck and good timing everything worked out for us today franchitti congratulated carpentier on his win and was generous over coming second it was an eventful day for first time in my career i started last because of way they decided qualifying i was really lucky to not go a lap down it s not last to first but last to second isn t too bad and we picked up some good points jourdain said of his third place finish what an unbelievable race my team did a great job and we gained positions in pits on last lap i was sure it was going to be dario and i pat was there whole time but then alex appeared from nowhere i think dario and i should both get points for second thumb upright dario franchitti pictured in 2007 was awarded second place by cart after a photo finish with michel jourdain jr tagliani s manoeuvre on last lap that led to him providing carpentier with drafting assistance attracted criticism from franchitti and jourdain but both refused to voice their anger towards him franchitti stated his belief that in event any driver went a lap down it was up to that person to attempt to remain in front of competitor by having sufficient driving standards it s different at a superspeedway than it is at a smaller oval like chicago but at that point at end of race when there are five guys on lead lap i think it would be nice to fight it out amongst ourselves but it s very difficult to police something like that jourdain spoke of his feeling that manoeuvre was pretty dangerous because it had potential to create a multi car accident i was sure we were both gone i was really scared at that point because i thought four of us tagliani jourdain franchitti and carpentier were going to crash it was an eight or a nine on a 10 scale very dangerous carpentier responded by noting that while manoeuvre was dangerous it aided in his victory i think it was a risky move but in a series as competitive as we have today one point or two points can make a huge difference at end of year if he was racing for points with paul hey it s racing media and series reactions to race were positive autoweek s bill mcguire wrote it might have been last 500 mile cart race at michigan international speedway but it was certainly one of best charles googe of albuquerque tribune
