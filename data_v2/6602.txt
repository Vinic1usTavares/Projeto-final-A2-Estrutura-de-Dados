one of notable characteristics of deir ghassaneh was concentration of 16 local muslim shrines or saintly person tombs maqam pl maqamat in its vicinity which served as visitation sites for pre 20th century palestinian community according to author and ethnographer johann bussow their locations near jerusalem also contributed to image of an islamic holy land which brought further prosperity to inhabitants of villages of bani zeid who benefited from providing services to pilgrims barghouti family served as patrons for various religious sheikhs who oversaw shrines maqamat were dedicated either to prophets recognized by qur an or saintly persons known as welys whom locals believed had been close to god bussow 2011 pp 123 124 veneration of welys tombs a common feature in peasant life did not derive from orthodox islam which was practiced more strictly in urban centers and was rooted in local pre islamic including christian tradition maraqa 2004 p 55 all maqamat of bani zeid were designed differently with some being rustic tombstones and others built more elaborately latter types consisted of a domed mausoleum known as a a shelter known as a makan a garden a well and either a distinguishable olive or oak tree most of upkeep of buildings was provided by religious endowments one of shrines was considered by local peasantry to be a place to safeguard firewood and outside reach of potential thieves maqamat were also divided by status with some bearing significance only to an individual village or clan and some collectively revered by residents of sheikhdom amiry 1987 p 208 of all sites in bani zeid sheikhdom most venerated shrine was that of nabi salih dedicated to prophet nabi salih which held special significance beyond bani zeid maqam al khawwas one of notable

reflecting muslim tradition of heavenly light and spirit in color white a few verses from qur an were written on parts of walls tomb of al khawwas was covered in white cloth a small niche on western wall was fitted for an oil lamp amiry 1987 p 213 an important feature that distinguished maqam al khawwas from deir ghassaneh mosque was that it acted primarily as a women s domain whereas mosque had largely been a male domain in pre british mandate era it was frequented by women on a daily basis and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as al banat during this pilgrimage which coincided with nabi salih pilgrimage a largely male affair large groups of women and children from villages of bani zeid would visit khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities socialize with other women and
