buckton castle was a medieval enclosure castle near in stalybridge greater manchester england it was surrounded by a stone curtain wall and a ditch wide by deep buckton is one of earliest stone castles in north west england and only survives as buried remains overgrown with heather and peat it was most likely built and demolished in 12th century earliest surviving record of site dates from 1360 by which time it was lying derelict few finds retrieved during archaeological investigations indicate that buckton castle may not have been completed in 16th century site may have been used as a beacon for pilgrimage of grace during 18th century castle was of interest to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver had been discovered at buckton site was used as an anti aircraft decoy site during second world war between 1996 and 2010 buckton castle was investigated by archaeologists as part of tameside archaeology survey first by university of manchester archaeological unit then university of salford s centre for applied archaeology project involved community archaeology and more than 60 volunteers took part castle close to buckton vale quarry is a scheduled ancient monument location buckton castle lies above sea level on buckton hill a steep sandstone ridge to south and west are valleys of carr brook and river tame respectively buckton vale quarry is close to east of castle while town of stalybridge is about south west of site to north and north east of castle are areas of moorland with heather and peat site may have been chosen to allow castle s garrison to guard tame valley during middle ages buckton castle was at eastern end of cheshire county shares its western border with wales both castle and valley were in medieval manor of tintwistle a manor was a division of land administered by a lord of manor or his representative in tintwistle s case it was part of larger lordship of longdendale compared to herefordshire and shropshire which were also on anglo welsh border cheshire has far fewer castles per square kilometre most of county s castles are close to western border where historically richer parts of cheshire are concentrated county is mostly lowland and beeston is only other castle in area that rises as prominently above surrounding landscape according to archaeologist rachel swallow hilltop castles in area which include buckton beeston halton and mold are predominantly a symbol of significant offensive and elite personal power in these landscapes history construction and use upright thumb alt a partly ruined rectangular stone tower seen across a grass slope peveril s great tower cost ps184 to build in late 12th century earliest castles in england typically were constructed from timber at least when they were first built as building in stone was more expensive paleoenvironmental evidence shows that between 9th and 11th centuries area where buckton castle would later be built was cleared of woodland this left little timber and may partly explain why stone was used as a building material it became more common to use stone in 12th century castles and buckton is amongst earliest masonry castles in north west england buckton castle was probably built in 12th century and there are three identifiable periods of medieval activity at site initial construction phase in which ditch was dug and curtain wall and gatehouse built re cutting of ditch and further building work behind curtain wall and finally deliberate demolition slighting little datable material has been recovered from site four sherds of pennine gritty ware broadly date to late 12th century as is case with many castles especially of 12th century there is no record of how much it cost to build buckton castle based on comparison to peveril castle in derbyshire where construction of great tower in 1175 1177 cost ps184 according to pipe rolls it is estimated that work at buckton would have cost around ps100 this was close to median annual income for a baron in 1200 partly because of cost and partly because cheshire was a palatine county in which earl had authority over who was permitted to build castles it is likely that castle was built by one of earls of chester compared to other english counties along anglo welsh border cheshire has fewer castles per square kilometre indicating that earl may have limited castle building construction of castle may have been prompted by earls involvement in anarchy a civil war during king stephen s reign in middle of 12th century or revolt of 1173 74 against henry ii during anarchy david i of scotland gained control of most of northern england including parts of lancashire prompting construction of buckton castle to serve as a safeguard for cheshire after anarchy many castles were slighted to restore england to its state before conflict which may explain why buckton was demolished alternatively it could have been slighted after revolt of 1173 74 to punish earl of chester for taking part in a war against king while it is likely earls of chester built castle it is possible it could have been built by william de neville when he held lordship of longdendale under earl between 1181 and 1186 though he may not have had financial means to do so dearth of artefacts recovered from buckton castle and lack of finely finished stonework indicate that site was never finished but re cutting of ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy or abandonment followed by repairs to fortifications later history and investigation thumb excavation of stone curtain wall in 2007 university of manchester archaeological unit excavated buckton castle between 2007 and 2008 alt a low stone wall being excavated with a town in background thumb alt a group of archaeologists digging with rubble in foreground a final season of excavation was carried out by university of salford s centre for applied archaeology in 2010 an estate survey from 1360 recorded that there is one ruined castle called and of no value this is earliest surviving reference to castle at time lordship of longdendale was property of edward black prince and castle was derelict site of castle may have been used as a beacon in 16th century first during pilgrimage of grace of 1536 37 and later in 1580s when country was under threat of invasion from spain particularly with spanish armada in 1588 this usage may have been reprised in 1803 when a beacon hut is recorded near mossley a settlement less than a mile west of castle in 18th century people began treasure hunting at buckton castle while hunting was largely unsuccessful in 1767 one such venture discovered a gold necklace and a silver vessel though these artefacts have since been lost this prompted interest of local antiquarians several of whom visited in 18th and 19th centuries often drawing plans of castle since 1924 castle has been designated as a scheduled ancient monument which is intended to protect important archaeological sites from change this was probably to protect castle from buckton vale quarry as it expanded during second world war starfish sites were built as decoys for bombing raids nine were built around manchester including one close to buckton castle at this time a brick hut was built over part of castle ditch starfish site went out of use in 1943 in 20th century it was suggested that buckton castle may have been an iron age hillfort but a study of hillforts in cheshire and lancashire found that buckton was topographically different from these sites and therefore unlikely to have been built in iron age excavation in 1998 demonstrated that site was medieval with no sign of earlier activity archaeologists d j cathcart king and leslie alcock suggested that castle was a ringwork a type of fortification where earthworks formed an integral part of defence this was before excavation established that first phase of castle was a curtain wall and earthworks seen today are result of collapse of structure and accumulation of soil on top buckton is now understood to be an enclosure castle with stone walls forming key defence tameside archaeology survey began in 1990 carried out by university of manchester archaeology unit with more than ps500 000 of funding from tameside council ps300 000 of this was directed towards excavations at buckton castle a topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record castle earthworks and examine a possible outer bailey latter was revealed to be a 20th century feature probably related to nearby mining activity illegal digging by unknown parties in 1999 and 2002 necessitated remedial work and test pitting in 2007 full scale excavations at buckton castle began with aim of establishing date and history of site across three seasons 2007 2008 and 2010 trenches were opened across ditch northern entrance gap in circuit of earthworks on south side interior and curtain wall university of manchester archaeological unit closed in july 2009 and tameside archaeology survey along with work at buckton castle was transferred to new centre for applied archaeology at university of salford brian directed excavations throughout more than 60 volunteers were involved in excavations between 2007 and 2010 including people from tameside archaeological society south trafford archaeological group south manchester archaeological research team and students from several universities layout buckton was a small highland enclosure castle with a sandstone curtain wall nothing survives above ground it is roughly oval and measures covering an area of castle is surrounded by a ditch apart from south west part where steep slope of hill makes ditch unnecessary when ditch was dug some of material was used to raise interior of castle by buckton is similar in size to clitheroe castle s inner enclosure which is also oval and has a curtain wall clitheroe was also built on a rocky peak and small size of its great tower may be due to its naturally defensible position and location in an economically deprived area buckton castle was entered through a gatehouse in north west measuring east side was occupied by gate passage and west by a chamber though structure no longer survives above ground it was probably at least two storeys tall constructed in 12th century buckton s gatehouse was earliest in north west england and was one of six stone gatehouses in region that were built in 12th or 13th centuries buckton egremont brough clitheroe carlisle s inner gatehouse and agricola tower at chester they are broadly similar in size and take form of a gate passage piercing a single tower with rooms in floors above buckton s gatehouse differs slightly in having passage offset to one side in 1770s antiquarian thomas percival recorded a well within castle close to south curtain and walls of buildings inside castle still standing to a height of a plan created by saddleworth geological society in 1842 recorded a ruined structure within castle s south east area in addition to well percival noted trenches in castle s interior did not reveal structures on plans from 18th and 19th centuries although discovery of a posthole indicates there was activity in this area gap in southern part of curtain wall not evident in 1842 plan by saddleworth geological society was probably created in 19th century there is a feature resembling a spoil heap consisting of pieces of sandstone this may have been a by product from construction of castle nothing remains of buckton castle above ground today and until late 20th century vegetation obscured existence of a stone structure see also castles in great britain and ireland list of castles in greater manchester list of
