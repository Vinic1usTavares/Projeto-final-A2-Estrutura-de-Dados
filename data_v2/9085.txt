vere gordon childe 14 april 1892 19 october 1957 was an australian archaeologist who specialised in study of european prehistory he spent most of his life in united kingdom working as an academic for university of edinburgh and then institute of archaeology london and wrote twenty six books during his career initially an early proponent of culture historical archaeology he later became first exponent of marxist archaeology in western world born in sydney to a middle class english migrant family childe studied classics at university of sydney before moving to england to study classical archaeology at university of oxford there he embraced socialist movement and campaigned against first world war viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to detriment of europe s working class returning to australia in 1917 he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism instead working for labor party as private secretary of politician john storey growing critical of labor he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined far left industrial workers of world emigrating to london in 1921 he became librarian of royal anthropological institute and journeyed across europe to pursue his research into continent s prehistory publishing his findings in academic papers and books in doing so he introduced continental european concept of an archaeological culture idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group to british archaeological community from 1927 to 1946 he worked as abercromby professor of archaeology at university of edinburgh and then from 1947 to 1957 as director of institute of archaeology london during this period he oversaw excavation of archaeological sites in scotland and northern ireland focusing on society of neolithic orkney by excavating settlement of skara brae and chambered tombs of maeshowe and quoyness in these decades he published prolifically producing excavation reports journal articles and books with stuart piggott and grahame clark he co founded prehistoric society in 1934 becoming its first president remaining a committed socialist he embraced marxism and rejecting culture historical approaches used marxist ideas as an interpretative framework for archaeological data he became a sympathiser with soviet union and visited country on several occasions although he grew sceptical of soviet foreign policy following hungarian revolution of 1956 his beliefs resulted in him being legally barred from entering united states despite receiving repeated invitations to lecture there upon retirement he returned to australia s blue mountains where he committed suicide one of best known and most widely cited archaeologists of twentieth century childe became known as great synthesizer for his work integrating regional research with a broader picture of near eastern and european prehistory he was also renowned for his emphasis on role of revolutionary technological and economic developments in human society such as neolithic revolution and urban revolution reflecting influence of marxist ideas concerning societal development although many of his interpretations have since been discredited he remains widely respected among archaeologists early life childhood 1892 1910 childe was born on 14 april 1892 in sydney he was only surviving

university in sydney and oxford 1911 1917 childe studied for a degree in classics at university of sydney in 1911 although focusing on written sources he first came across classical archaeology through work of archaeologists heinrich schliemann and arthur evans at university he became an active member of debating society at one point arguing in favour of proposition that socialism is desirable increasingly interested in socialism he read works of karl marx and friedrich engels as well as those of philosopher g w f hegel whose dialectics heavily influenced marxist theory at university he became a great friend of fellow undergraduate and future judge and politician herbert vere evatt with whom he remained in lifelong contact ending his studies in 1913 childe graduated following year with various honours and prizes including professor francis anderson s prize for philosophy wishing to continue his education he gained a ps200 cooper graduate scholarship in classics allowing him to pay tuition fees at queen s college part of university of oxford england he set sail for britain aboard ss orsova in august 1914 shortly after outbreak of world war i at queen s childe was entered for a diploma in classical archaeology followed by a literae humaniores degree although he never completed former whilst there he studied under john beazley and arthur evans latter being childe s supervisor in 1915 he published his first academic paper on date and origin of minyan ware in journal of hellenic studies and following year produced his b litt thesis influence of indo europeans in prehistoric greece displaying his interest in combining philological and archaeological evidence at oxford he became actively involved with socialist movement antagonising conservative university authorities becoming a noted member of left wing reformist oxford university fabian society he was there in 1915 when it changed its name to oxford university socialist society following a split from fabian society his best friend and flatmate was rajani palme dutt a fervent socialist and marxist pair often got drunk and tested each other s knowledge about classical history late at night with britain in midst of world war i many socialists refused to fight for british army despite government imposed conscription they believed that ruling classes of europe s imperialist nations were waging war for their own interests at expense of working classes these socialists thought that class war was only conflict they should be concerned with dutt was imprisoned for refusing to fight and childe campaigned for release of both him and other socialists and pacifist conscientious objectors childe was never required to enlist in army most likely because of his poor health and eyesight his anti war sentiments concerned authorities intelligence agency mi5 opening a file on him his mail was intercepted and he was kept under observation early career in australia 1918 1921 upright 1 thumb right from 1919 to 1921 childe worked for leftist politician john storey as his personal assistant childe returned to australia in august 1917 as a known socialist agitator he was placed under surveillance by security services who intercepted his mail in 1918 he became senior resident tutor at st andrew s college sydney university joining sydney s socialist and anti conscription movement in easter 1918 he spoke at third inter state peace conference an event organised by australian union of democratic control for avoidance of war a group opposed to prime minister billy hughes s plans to introduce conscription conference had a prominent socialist emphasis its report argued that best hope to end international war was abolition of capitalist system news of childe s participation reached principal of st andrew s college who forced childe to resign despite much opposition from staff staff members secured him work as a tutor in ancient history in department of tutorial classes but university chancellor william cullen feared that he would promote socialism to students and fired him leftist community condemned this as an infringement of childe s civil rights and centre left politicians william mckell and t j smith raised issue in parliament of australia moving to maryborough queensland in october 1918 childe took up employment teaching latin at maryborough grammar school here too his political affiliations became known and he was subject to an opposition campaign from local conservative groups and maryborough chronicle resulting in abuse from some pupils he soon resigned realising he would be barred from an academic career by university authorities childe sought employment within leftist movement in august 1919 he became private secretary and speech writer to politician john storey a prominent member of centre left labor party then in opposition to new south wales nationalist party government representing sydney suburb of balmain on new south wales legislative assembly storey became state premier in 1920 when labor achieved electoral victory working within labor party allowed childe greater insight into its workings deeper his involvement more he became critical of labor believing that once in political office they betrayed their socialist ideals and moved to a centrist pro capitalist stance he joined radical leftist industrial workers of world which at time was banned in australia in 1921 storey sent childe to london to keep british press updated about developments in new south wales but storey died in december and an ensuing new south wales election restored a nationalist government under george fuller s premiership fuller thought childe s job unnecessary and in early 1922 terminated his employment london and early books 1922 1926 unable to find an academic job in australia childe remained in britain renting a room in bloomsbury central london and spending much time studying at british museum and royal anthropological institute library an active member of london s socialist movement he associated with leftists at 1917 club in gerrard street soho he befriended members of marxist communist party of great britain cpgb and contributed to their publication labour monthly but had not yet openly embraced marxism having earned a good reputation as a prehistorian he was invited to other parts of europe to study prehistoric artefacts in 1922 he travelled to vienna austria to examine unpublished material about painted neolithic pottery from bukovina held in prehistoric department of natural history museum he published his findings in 1923 volume of journal of royal anthropological institute childe used this excursion to visit museums in czechoslovakia and hungary bringing them to attention of british archaeologists in a 1922 article in man after returning to london in 1922 childe became a private secretary for three members of parliament including john hope simpson and frank gray both members of centre left liberal party supplementing this income childe worked as a translator for publishers kegan paul trench trubner co and occasionally lectured in prehistory at london school of economics in 1923 london labour company published his first book how labour governs examining australian labor party and its connections to australian labour movement it reflects childe s disillusionment with party arguing that once elected its politicians abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort childe s biographer sally green noted that how labour governs was of particular significance at time because it was published just as british labour party was emerging as a major player in british politics threatening two party dominance of conservatives and liberals in 1923 labour formed their first government childe planned a sequel expanding on his ideas but it was never published in may 1923 he visited museums in lausanne bern and zurich to study their prehistoric artefact collections that year he became a member of royal anthropological institute in 1925 he became institute s librarian one of only archaeological jobs available in britain through which he cementing connections with scholars across europe his job made him well known in britain s small archaeological community he developed a great friendship with o g s crawford archaeological officer to ordnance survey influencing crawford s move toward socialism and marxism in 1925 kegan paul trench trubner co published childe s second book dawn of european civilisation in which he synthesised data about european prehistory that he had been exploring for several years an important work it was released when there were few professional archaeologists across europe and most museums focused on their locality dawn was a rare example that looked at larger picture across continent its importance was also due to fact that it introduced concept of archaeological culture into britain from continental scholarship thereby aiding in development of culture historical archaeology childe later stated that book aimed at distilling from archaeological remains a substitute for conventional politico military history with cultures instead of statesmen as actors and migrations in place of battles in 1926 he published a successor aryans a study of indo european origins exploring theory that civilisation diffused northward and westward into europe from near east via an indo european linguistic group known as aryans with ensuing racial use of term aryan by german nazi party childe avoided mention of book in these works childe accepted a moderate version of diffusionism idea that cultural developments diffuse from one place to others rather than being independently developed in many places in contrast to hyper diffusionism of grafton elliot smith childe suggested that although most cultural traits spread from one society to another it was possible for same traits to develop independently in different places later life abercromby professor of archaeology 1927 1946 in 1927 scotland s university of edinburgh offered childe post of abercromby professor of archaeology a new position established in bequest of prehistorian lord abercromby although sad to leave london childe took job moving to edinburgh in september 1927 aged 35 childe became only academic prehistorian in a teaching post in scotland many scottish archaeologists disliked childe regarding him as an outsider with no specialism in scottish prehistory he wrote to a friend that i live here in an atmosphere of hatred and envy he nevertheless made friends in edinburgh including archaeologists like w lindsay scott alexander curle j g callender and walter grant as well as non archaeologists like physicist charles galton darwin becoming godfather to darwin s youngest son initially lodging at liberton he moved into semi residential hotel de vere on crescent at edinburgh university childe focused on research rather than teaching he was reportedly kind to his students but had difficulty talking to large audiences many students were confused that his bsc degree course in archaeology was structured counter chronologically dealing with more recent iron age first before progressing backward to palaeolithic founding edinburgh league of prehistorians he took his more enthusiastic students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit an early proponent of experimental archaeology he involved his students in his experiments in 1937 he used this method to investigate vitrification process evident at several iron age forts in northern britain childe regularly travelled to london to visit friends among whom was stuart piggott another influential british archaeologist who succeeded childe as edinburgh s abercromby professor another friend was grahame clark whom childe befriended and encouraged in his research trio were elected onto committee of prehistoric society of east anglia at clark s suggestion in 1935 they used their influence to convert it into a nationwide organisation prehistoric society of which childe was elected president membership of group grew rapidly in 1935 it had 353 members and by 1938 it had 668 childe spent much time in continental europe and attended many conferences there having learned several european languages in 1935 he first visited soviet union spending 12 days in leningrad and moscow impressed with socialist state he was particularly interested in social role of soviet archaeology returning to britain he became a vocal soviet sympathiser and avidly read cpgb s daily worker although was heavily critical of certain soviet policies particularly molotov ribbentrop pact with nazi germany his socialist convictions led to an early denunciation of european fascism and he was outraged by nazi co option of prehistoric archaeology to glorify their own conceptions of an aryan racial heritage supportive of british government s decision to fight fascist powers in second world war he thought it probable that he was on a nazi blacklist and made decision to drown himself in a canal should nazis conquer britain though opposing fascist germany and italy he also criticised imperialist capitalist governments of united kingdom and united states he repeatedly described latter as being full of loathsome fascist hyenas this did not prevent him from visiting u s in 1936 he addressed a conference of arts and sciences marking tercentenary of harvard university there university awarded him an honorary doctor of letters degree he returned in 1939 lecturing at harvard university of california berkeley and university of pennsylvania excavations thumb upright 1 3 right neolithic dwellings at skara brae in orkney site excavated by childe in 1927 30 childe s university position meant that he was obliged to undertake archaeological excavations something he loathed and believed he did poorly students agreed but recognised his genius for interpreting evidence unlike many contemporaries he was scrupulous with writing up and publishing his findings producing almost annual reports for proceedings of society of antiquaries of scotland and unusually ensuring that he acknowledged help of every digger his best known excavation was undertaken from 1928 to 1930 at skara brae in orkney islands having uncovered a well preserved neolithic village in 1931 he published excavation results in a book titled skara brae he made an error of interpretation erroneously attributing site to iron age during excavation childe got on particularly well with locals for them he was every inch professor because of his eccentric appearance and habits in 1932 childe collaborating with anthropologist c daryll forde excavated two iron age hillforts at earn s hugh on berwickshire coast while in june 1935 he excavated a promontory fort at near to in northern ireland together with wallace thorneycroft another fellow of society of antiquaries of scotland childe excavated two vitrified iron age forts in scotland at finavon angus 1933 34 and at argyllshire 1936 37 in 1938 he and walter grant oversaw excavations at neolithic settlement of their investigation ceased during second world war but resumed in 1946 publications childe continued writing and publishing books on archaeology beginning with a series of works following on from dawn of european civilisation and aryans by compiling and synthesising data from across europe first was most ancient near east 1928 which assembled information from across mesopotamia and india setting a background from which spread of farming and other technologies into europe could be understood this was followed by danube in prehistory 1929 which examined archaeology along danube river recognising it as natural boundary dividing near east from europe childe believed it was via danube that new technologies travelled westward although childe had used culture historical approaches in earlier publications danube in prehistory was his first publication to provide a specific definition of concept of an archaeological culture revolutionising theoretical approach of british archaeology childe s next book bronze age 1930 dealt with bronze age in europe and displayed his increasing adoption of marxist theory as a means of understanding how society functioned and changed he believed that metal was first indispensable article of commerce and that metal smiths were therefore full time professionals who lived off social surplus in 1933 childe travelled to asia visiting iraq a place he thought great fun and india which he felt was detestable due to hot weather and extreme poverty touring archaeological sites in two countries he opined that much of what he had written in most ancient near east was outdated going on to produce new light on most ancient near east 1935 in which he applied his marxist influenced ideas about economy to his conclusions after publishing prehistory of scotland 1935 childe produced one of defining books of his career man makes himself 1936 influenced by marxist views of history childe argued that usual distinction between pre literate prehistory and literate history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed through a series of technological economic and social revolutions these included neolithic revolution when hunter gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities through to urban revolution when society moved from small towns to first cities and up to more recent times when industrial revolution changed nature of production after outbreak of second world war childe was unable to travel across europe instead focusing on writing prehistoric communities of british isles 1940 childe s pessimism regarding war s outcome led him to believe that european civilization capitalist and stalinist alike was irrevocably headed for a dark age in this state of mind he produced a sequel to man makes himself titled what happened in history 1942 an account of human history from palaeolithic through to fall of roman empire although oxford university press offered to publish work he released it through penguin books because they could sell it at a cheaper price something he believed pivotal in providing knowledge for those he called masses this was followed by two short works progress and archaeology 1944 and story of tools 1944 latter an explicitly marxist text written for young communist league institute of archaeology london 1946 1956 right thumb upright 1 5 neolithic passage tomb of maes howe on mainland orkney excavated by childe from 1954 55 in 1946 childe left edinburgh to take up position as director and professor of european prehistory at institute of archaeology ioa in london anxious to return to capital he had kept silent over his disapproval of government policies so that he would not be prevented from getting job he took up residence in building near to hampstead located in st john s lodge in inner circle of regent s park ioa was founded in 1937 largely by archaeologist mortimer wheeler but until 1946 relied primarily on volunteer lecturers childe s relationship with conservative wheeler was strained for their personalities were very different wheeler was an extrovert who pursued limelight was an efficient administrator and was intolerant of others shortcomings while childe lacked administrative skill and was tolerant of others childe was popular among institute s students who saw him as a kindly eccentric they commissioned a bust of childe from marjorie maitland howard his lecturing was nevertheless considered poor as he often mumbled and walked into an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk he further confused his students by referring to socialist states of eastern europe by their full official titles and by referring to towns by their slavonic names rather than names with which they were better known in english he was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars where he devoted more time to interacting with his students as director childe was not obliged to excavate though he did undertake projects at orkney neolithic burial tombs of quoyness 1951 and maes howe 1954 55 in 1949 he and crawford resigned as fellows of society of antiquaries they did so to protest selection of james mann keeper of tower of london s armouries as society s president believing that wheeler a professional archaeologist was a better choice childe joined editorial board of periodical past present founded by marxist historians in 1952 during early 1950s he also became a board member for modern quarterly later marxist quarterly working alongside board s chairman rajani palme dutt his best friend and flatmate from his oxford days he authored occasional articles for palme dutt s socialist journal labour monthly but disagreed with him over hungarian revolution of 1956 palme dutt defended soviet union s decision to quash revolution using military force but childe like many western socialists strongly opposed with it event made childe abandon faith in soviet leadership but not in socialism or marxism he retained a love of soviet union having visiting on multiple occasions he was also involved with a satellite body society for cultural relations with ussr and served as president of its national history and archaeology section from early 1950s until his death in april 1956 childe was awarded gold medal of society of antiquaries for his services to archaeology he was invited to lecture in united states on multiple occasions by robert braidwood william duncan strong and leslie white but u s state department barred him from entering country due to his marxist beliefs whilst working at institute childe continued writing and publishing books dealing with archaeology history 1947 promoted a marxist view of past and reaffirmed childe s belief that prehistory and literate history must be viewed together whilst prehistoric migrations 1950 displayed his views on moderate diffusionism in 1946 he also published a paper in southwestern journal of anthropology this was archaeology and anthropology which argued that disciplines of archaeology and anthropology should be used in tandem an approach that would be widely accepted in decades following his death retirement and death 1956 1957 in summer of 1956 childe retired as ioa director a year prematurely european archaeology had rapidly expanded during 1950s leading to increasing specialisation and making synthesising that childe was known for increasingly difficult that year institute was moving to gordon square bloomsbury and childe wanted to give his successor w f grimes a fresh start in new surroundings to commemorate his achievements proceedings of prehistoric society published a festschrift edition on last day of his directorship containing contributions from friends and colleagues from all over world something that touched childe deeply upon his retirement he told many friends that he planned to return to australia visit his relatives and commit suicide he was terrified of becoming old senile and a burden on society and suspected he had cancer subsequent commentators suggested that a core reason for his suicidal desires was a loss of faith in marxism following hungarian revolution and nikita khrushchev s denouncement of joseph stalin although bruce trigger dismissed this explanation noting that while childe was critical of soviet foreign policy he never saw state and marxism as synonymous thumb upright 1 5 left a view of grose valley from leap site where childe chose to end his life sorting out his affairs childe donated most of his library and all of his estate to institute after a february 1957 holiday visiting archaeological sites in gibraltar and spain he sailed to australia reaching sydney on his 65th birthday here university of sydney which had once barred him from working there awarded him an honorary degree he travelled around country for six months visiting family members and old friends but was unimpressed by australian society believing it reactionary increasingly suburban and poorly educated looking into australian prehistory he found it a profitable field for research and lectured to archaeological and leftist groups on this and other topics taking to australian radio to criticise academic racism towards indigenous australians writing personal letters to many friends he sent one to grimes requesting that it not be opened until 1968 in it he described how he feared old age and stated his intention to take his own life remarking that life ends best when one is happy and strong on 19 october 1957 childe went to area of govett s leap in blackheath an area of blue mountains where he had grown up leaving his hat spectacles compass pipe and mackintosh atop cliffs he fell 1000 feet 300 m to his death a coroner ruled his death as accidental but his death was recognised as suicide when his letter to grimes was published in 1980s his remains were cremated at northern suburbs crematorium and his name added to a small family plaque in crematorium gardens following his death an unprecedented level of tributes and memorials were issued by archaeological community all testifying to his status as europe s greatest prehistorian and a wonderful human being archaeological theory biographer sally green noted that childe s beliefs were never dogmatic always idiosyncratic and continually changing throughout his life his theoretical approach blended together marxism diffusionism and functionalism childe was critical of evolutionary archaeology dominant during nineteenth century he believed that archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts than on humans who had made them like most archaeologists in western europe and united states at time childe did not regard humans as naturally inventive or inclined to change thus he tended to perceive social change in terms of diffusion and migration rather than internal development or cultural evolution during decades in which childe was working most archaeologists adhered to three age system first developed by danish antiquarian christian jurgensen thomsen this system rested upon an evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory into stone age bronze age and iron age but childe highlighted that many of world s societies were still effectively stone age in their technology he nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio economic development when combined with a marxist framework he therefore used technological criteria for dividing up prehistory into three ages but instead used economic criteria for sub dividing stone age into palaeolithic and neolithic rejecting concept of mesolithic as useless informally he adopted division of past societies into framework of savagery barbarism and civilisation that engels had employed culture historical archaeology in early part of his career childe was a proponent of culture historical approach to archaeology coming to be seen as one of its founders and chief exponents culture historical archaeology revolved around concept of culture which it had adopted from anthropology this was a major turning point in history of discipline allowing archaeologists to look at past through a spatial dynamic rather than a temporal one childe adopted concept of culture from german philologist and archaeologist gustaf although this influence might have been mediated through leon kozlowski a polish archaeologist who had adopted kossina s ideas and who had a close association with childe trigger expressed view that while adopting kossina s basic concept childe displayed no awareness of racist connotations that kossina had given it childe s adherence to culture historical model is apparent in three of his books dawn of european civilisation 1925 aryans 1926 and most ancient east 1928 but in none of these does he define what he means by culture only later in danube in prehistory 1929 did childe give culture a specifically archaeological definition in this book he defined a culture as a set of regularly associated traits in material culture i e pots implements ornaments burial rites house forms that recur across a given area he stated that in this respect a culture was archaeological equivalent of a people childe s use of term was non racial he considered a people to be a social grouping not a biological race he opposed equation of archaeological cultures with biological races as various nationalists across europe were doing at time and vociferously criticised nazi uses of archaeology arguing that jewish people were not a distinct biological race but a socio cultural grouping in 1935 he suggested that culture worked as a living functioning organism and emphasised adaptive potential of material culture in this he was influenced by anthropological functionalism childe accepted that archaeologists defined cultures based on a subjective selection of material criteria this view was later widely adopted by archaeologists like colin renfrew later in his career childe tired of culture historical archaeology by late 1940s he was questioning utility of culture as an archaeological concept and thus basic validity of culture historical approach mcnairn suggested that this was because term culture had become popular across social sciences in reference to all learned modes of behaviour and not just material culture as childe had done by 1940s childe was doubtful as to whether a certain archaeological assemblage or culture really reflected a social group who had other unifying traits such as a shared language in 1950s childe was comparing role culture historical archaeology had among prehistorians to place of traditional politico military approach among historians marxist archaeology childe has typically been seen as a marxist archaeologist being first archaeologist in west to use marxist theory in his work marxist archaeology emerged in soviet union in 1929 when archaeologist vladislav i ravdonikas published a report titled for a soviet history of material culture criticising archaeological discipline as inherently bourgeois and therefore anti socialist ravdonikas s report called for a pro socialist marxist approach to archaeology as part of academic reforms instituted under joseph stalin s rule it was during mid 1930s around time of his first visit to soviet union that childe began to make explicit reference to marxism in his work many archaeologists have been profoundly influenced by marxism s socio political ideas as a materialist philosophy marxism emphasises idea that material things are more important than ideas and that social conditions of a given period are result of existing material conditions or mode of production thus a marxist interpretation foregrounds social context of any technological development or change marxist ideas also emphasise biased nature of scholarship each scholar having their own entrenched beliefs and class loyalties marxism thus argues that intellectuals cannot divorce their scholarly thinking from political action green stated that childe accepted marxist views on a model of past because they offer a structural analysis of culture in terms of economy sociology and ideology and a principle for cultural change through economy mcnairn noted that marxism was a major intellectual force in childe s thought while trigger stated that childe identified with marx s theories both emotionally and intellectually childe stated that he used marxist ideas when interpreting past because and in so far as it works he criticised many fellow marxists for treating socio political theory as a set of dogmas childe s marxism often differed from marxism of his contemporaries both because he made reference to original texts of hegel marx and engels rather than later interpretations and because he was selective in using their writings mcnairn considered childe s marxism an individual interpretation that differed from popular or orthodox marxism trigger called him a a creative marxist thinker gathercole thought that while childe s debt to marx was quite evident his attitude to marxism was at times ambivalent marxist historian eric hobsbawm later described childe as most original english marxist writer from days of my youth aware that in context of cold war his affiliation with marxism could prove dangerous for him childe sought to make his marxist ideas more palatable to his readership in his archaeological writings he sparingly made direct reference to marx there is a distinction in his published works from latter part of his life between those that are explicitly marxist and those in which marxist ideas and influences are less obvious many of childe s fellow british archaeologists did not take his adherence to marxism seriously regarding it as something which he did for shock value childe was influenced by soviet archaeology but remained critical of it disapproving of how soviet government encouraged country s archaeologists to assume their conclusions before analysing their data he was also critical of what he saw as sloppy approach to typology in soviet archaeology as a moderate diffusionist childe was heavily critical of trend in soviet archaeology based on theories of georgian philologist nicholas marr which rejected diffusionism in favour of unilinear evolutionism in his view it cannot be un marxian to understand spread of domesticated plants animals and ideas through diffusionism childe did not publicly air these criticisms of his soviet colleagues perhaps so as not to offend communist friends or to provide ammunition for right wing archaeologists instead he publicly praised soviet system of archaeology and heritage management contrasting it favourably with britain s because it encouraged collaboration rather than competition between archaeologists after first visiting country in 1935 he returned in 1945 1953 and 1956 befriending many soviet archaeologists but shortly before his suicide sent a letter to soviet archaeological community stating that he was extremely disappointed that they had methodologically fallen behind western europe and north america other marxists such as george derwent thomson and neil faulkner argued that childe s archaeological work was not truly marxist because he failed to take into account class struggle as an instrument of social change a core tenet of marxist thought while class struggle was not a factor childe considered in his archaeological work he accepted that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted past through their own class interests arguing that most of his contemporaries produced studies with an innate bourgeois agenda childe further diverged from orthodox marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology he also denied marxism s ability to predict future development of human society and unlike many other marxists did not consider humanity s progress into pure communism inevitable instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct neolithic and urban revolutions influenced by marxism childe argued that society experienced changes in relatively short periods of time citing industrial revolution as a modern example this idea was absent from his earliest work in studies like dawn of european civilisation he talked of societal change as transition rather than revolution in writings from early 1930s such as new light on most ancient east he began to describe social change using term revolution although had yet to fully develop these ideas at this point term revolution had gained marxist associations due to russia s october revolution of 1917 childe introduced his ideas about revolutions in a 1935 presidential address to prehistoric society presenting this concept as part of his functional economic interpretation of three age system he argued that a neolithic revolution initiated neolithic era and that other revolutions marked start of bronze and iron ages following year in man makes himself he combined these bronze and iron age revolutions into a singular urban revolution which corresponded largely to anthropologist lewis h morgan s concept of civilization for childe neolithic revolution was a period of radical change in which humans who were then hunter gatherers began cultivating plants and breeding animals for food allowing for greater control of food supply and population growth he believed that urban revolution was largely caused by development of bronze metallurgy and in a 1950 paper proposed ten traits that he believed were present in oldest cities they were larger than earlier settlements they contained full time craft specialists surplus was collected together and given to a god or king they witnessed monumental architecture there was an unequal distribution of social surplus writing was invented sciences developed naturalistic art developed trade with foreign areas increased and state organisation was based on residence rather than kinship childe believed that urban revolution had a negative side in that it led to increased social stratification into classes and oppression of majority by a power elite not all archaeologists adopted childe s framework of understanding human societal development as a series of transformational revolutions many believed that term revolution was misleading because processes of agricultural and urban development were gradual transformations influence on processual and post processual archaeology through his work childe contributed to two of major theoretical movements in anglo american archaeology that developed in decades after his death processualism and post processualism former emerged in late 1950s emphasised idea that archaeology should be a branch of anthropology sought discovery of universal laws about society and believed that archaeology could ascertain objective information about past latter emerged as a reaction to processualism in late 1970s rejecting idea that archaeology had access to objective information about past and emphasising subjectivity of all interpretation processual archaeologist colin renfrew described childe as one of fathers of processual thought due to his development of economic and social themes in prehistory an idea echoed by faulkner trigger argued that childe s work foreshadowed processual thought in two ways by emphasising role of change in societal development and by adhering to a strictly materialist view of past both of these arose from childe s marxism despite this connection most american processualists ignored childe s work seeing him as a who was irrelevant to their search for generalised laws of societal behaviour in keeping with marxist thought childe did not agree that such generalised laws existed believing that behaviour was not universal but was conditioned by socio economic factors peter one of childe s successors as director of institute of archaeology highlighted that childe accepted subjectivity of archaeological interpretation something in stark contrast to processualists insistence that archaeological interpretation could be objective as a result trigger thought childe to be a prototypical post processual archaeologist personal life thumb right upright 1 bronze bust of childe by marjorie maitland howard it has been kept in library of institute of archaeology since 1958 childe thought that it made him look like a neanderthal childe s biographer sally green found no evidence that childe ever had a serious intimate relationship she assumed he was heterosexual because she found no evidence of same sex attraction conversely his student don brothwell thought him to be homosexual he had many friends of both sexes although remained awkward and uncouth without any social graces despite his difficulties in relating to others he enjoyed interacting and socialising with his students often inviting them to dine with him he was shy and often hid his personal feelings brothwell suggested that these personality traits may reflect undiagnosed asperger syndrome childe believed that study of past could offer guidance for how humans should act in present and future he was known for his radical left wing views being a socialist from his undergraduate days he sat on committees of several left wing groups although avoided involvement in marxist intellectual arguments within communist party and with exception of how labour governs did not commit his non archaeological opinions to print many of his political views are therefore evident only through comments made in private correspondence renfrew noted that childe was liberal minded on social issues but thought that although childe deplored racism he did not entirely escape pervasive nineteenth century view on distinct differences between different races trigger similarly observed racist elements in some of childe s culture historical writings including suggestion that nordic peoples had a superiority in physique although childe later disavowed these ideas in a private letter childe wrote to archaeologist christopher hawkes he stated that he disliked jews childe was an atheist and critic of religion viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition that served interests of dominant elites in history 1947 he commented that magic is a way of making people believe they are going to get what they want whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to want what they get he nevertheless regarded christianity as being superior over what he regarded as primitive religion commenting that christianity as a religion of love surpasses all others in stimulating positive virtue in a letter written during 1930s he stated that only in days of exceptional bad temper do i desire to hurt peoples religious convictions childe was fond of driving cars enjoying feeling of power he got from them he often told a story about how he had raced at high speed down piccadilly london at 3 o clock in morning for sheer enjoyment of it only to be pulled over by a policeman he loved practical jokes and allegedly kept a halfpenny in his pocket to trick pickpockets on one occasion he played a joke on delegates at a prehistoric society conference by lecturing them on a theory that neolithic monument of had been constructed as an imitation of stonehenge by a nouveau riche chieftain some audience members failed to realise that he was being tongue in cheek he could speak several european languages having taught himself in early life when he was travelling across continent childe s other hobbies included walking in british hillsides attending classical music concerts and playing card game contract bridge fond of poetry his favourite poet was john keats although his favourite poems were william wordsworth s ode to duty and robert browning s a grammarian s funeral he was not particularly interested in reading novels but his favourite was d h lawrence s kangaroo 1923 a book echoing many of childe s own feelings about australia he was a fan of good quality food and drink and frequented restaurants known for his battered tatty attire childe always wore his wide brimmed black hat purchased from a hatter in jermyn street central london as well as a tie which was usually red a colour chosen to symbolise his socialist beliefs he regularly wore a black mackintosh raincoat often carrying it over his arm or draped over his shoulders like a cape in summer he frequently wore shorts with socks sock suspenders and large boots legacy and influence on his death childe was praised by his colleague stuart piggott as greatest prehistorian in britain and probably world archaeologist randall h mcguire later described him as probably best known and most cited archaeologist of twentieth century an idea echoed by bruce trigger while barbara mcnairn labelled him one of most outstanding and influential figures in discipline archaeologist andrew sherratt described childe as occupying a crucial position in history of archaeology sherratt also noted that childe s output by any standard was massive over course of his career childe published over twenty books and around 240 scholarly articles archaeologist brian fagan described his books as simple well written narratives which became archaeological canon between 1930s and early 1960s by 1956 he was cited as most translated australian author in history having seen his books published in such languages as chinese czech dutch french german hindi hungarian italian japanese polish russian spanish sweden and turkish archaeologists david lewis williams and david pearce considered childe probably most written about archaeologist in history commenting that his books were still required reading for those in discipline in 2005 known as great synthesizer childe is primarily respected for developing a synthesis of european and near eastern prehistory at a time when most archaeologists focused on regional sites and sequences since his death this framework has been heavily revised following discovery of radiocarbon dating his interpretations have been largely rejected and many of his conclusions about neolithic and bronze age europe have been found to be incorrect childe himself believed that his primary contribution to archaeology was in his interpretative frameworks an analysis supported by alison and peter gathercole according to sherratt what is of lasting value in his interpretations is more detailed level of writing concerned with recognition of patterns in material he described it is these patterns which survive as classic problems of european prehistory even when his explanations of them are recognised as inappropriate childe s theoretical work had been largely ignored in his lifetime and remained forgotten in decades after his death although it would see a resurgence in late 1990s and early 2000s it remained best known in latin america where marxism remained a core theoretical current among archaeologists throughout latter 20th century despite his global influence childe s oeuvre was poorly understood in united states where his work on european prehistory never became well known as a result in united states he erroneously gained reputation of being a near eastern specialist and a founder of neo evolutionism alongside julian steward and leslie white despite fact that his approach was more subtle and nuanced than theirs steward repeatedly misrepresented childe as a unilinear evolutionist in his writings perhaps as part of an attempt to distinguish his own evolutionary approach from ideas of marx and engels in contrast to this american neglect and misrepresentation trigger believed that it was an american archaeologist robert mccormick adams jr who did most to posthumously develop childe s most innovative ideas childe also had a small following of american archaeologists and anthropologists in 1940s who wanted to bring back materialist and marxist ideas into their research after years in which particularism had been dominant within discipline in u s his name was also referenced in 2008 blockbuster film indiana jones and kingdom of crystal skull academic conferences and publications following his death several articles examining childe s impact on archaeology were published in 1980 bruce trigger s gordon childe revolutions in archaeology appeared which studied influences that extended over childe s archaeological thought same year saw publication of barbara mcnairn s method and theory of v gordon childe examining his methodological and theoretical approaches to archaeology following year sally green published prehistorian a biography of v gordon childe in which she described him as most eminent and influential scholar of european prehistory in twentieth century peter gathercole thought work of trigger mcnairn and green was extremely important ruth tringham considered it all part of a let s get to know childe better movement in july 1986 a colloquium devoted to childe s work was held in mexico city marking 50th anniversary of man makes himself s publication in september 1990 university of queensland s australian studies centre organised a centenary conference for childe in brisbane with presentations examining both his scholarly and his socialist work in may 1992 a conference marking his centenary was held at ucl institute of archaeology in london co sponsored by institute and prehistoric society both organisations that he had formerly headed conference proceedings were published in a 1994 volume edited by david r harris institute s director entitled archaeology of v gordon childe contemporary perspectives harris stated that book sought to demonstrate dynamic qualities of childe s thought breadth and depth of his scholarship and continuing relevance of his work to contemporary issues in archaeology in 1995 another conference collection was published titled childe and australia archaeology politics and ideas it was edited by peter gathercole t h irving and gregory further papers appeared on subject of childe in ensuing years looking at such subjects as his personal correspondences and final resting place selected publications title year publisher how labour governs a study of
