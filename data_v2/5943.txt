euston is a london underground station served by victoria line and both central branches of northern line it directly connects with euston main line station above it station is in travelcard zone 1 euston was constructed as two separate underground stations three of four northern line platforms date from station s opening in 1907 fourth northern line platform and two victoria line platforms were constructed in 1960s when station was significantly altered to accommodate victoria line plans for high speed 2 and crossrail 2 both include proposals to modify station to provide interchanges with new services on northern line s bank branch station is between camden town and king s cross st pancras on charing cross branch it is between mornington crescent and warren street on victoria line it is between warren street and king s cross st pancras station is near euston square station allowing connections at street level to circle hammersmith city and metropolitan lines history northern line planning an underground station to serve euston station was first proposed by hampstead st pancras charing cross railway in 1891 company planned a route to run from heath street in hampstead to strand in charing cross with a branch diverging from main route to run under drummond street to serve euston st pancras and king s cross stations following parliamentary review of proposals and a change in name to charing cross euston and hampstead railway cce hr permission was granted for route in 1893 although branch line was only permitted as far as euston for remainder of 1890s cce hr struggled unsuccessfully to raise necessary capital to fund construction of new line whilst doing so it continued to develop its route proposals in 1899 parliamentary permission was obtained to modify route so that euston branch was extended northwards to connect to main route at south end of camden high street section of main route between two ends of loop was omitted in 1900 cce hr was taken over by a consortium led by american financier charles yerkes which raised necessary finance same year a proposal was presented to parliament by islington and euston railway i er for an extension of city and south london railway c slr from angel to euston at time c slr was in process of constructing an extension to angel from its recently opened terminus at moorgate street extension plan was initially permitted in 1901 but delays in parliamentary process meant that it had to be re submitted following year second submission was opposed by metropolitan railway which saw extension as competition to its service between king s cross and moorgate and plan was rejected a third attempt presented to parliament in november 1902 by c slr itself was successful and approved in 1903 construction and opening thumb left locations of two companies stations highlighted on a 1914 map alt map with funding obtained tunnelling for cce hr was carried out between september 1903 and december 1905 after which station buildings and fitting out of tunnels commenced c slr s euston extension was constructed at same time from newly opened angel station and opened on 12 may 1907 with station building designed by sidney smith located on east side of eversholt street cce hr opened on 22 june 1907 its building designed by leslie green is located at corner of drummond street and melton street thumb disused cce hr station building on corner of drummond street and melton street alt a red tiled building sited on a corner of a road junction five large semi circular windows fill much of upper storey with two on corner removed and replaced with ventilation grilles although built and initially operated as two separate stations by two companies c slr and cce hr platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between passages of two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between lines another passage led to lifts that surfaced within main line station itself with entrance within main line station able to serve both sets of platforms satisfactorily separate station buildings were considered unnecessary and they both closed on 30 september 1914 cce hr building remains converted for use as an electrical substation but c slr s building was demolished in 1934 to enable construction of euston house for london midland and scottish railway reconstruction and extension most of c slr s route had been constructed with tunnels or in diameter smaller than diameter that had been adopted as standard for cce hr and other deep level tube lines smaller tunnel size restricted capacity of c slr s trains and in 1912 c slr published a bill for their enlargement a separate bill was published at same time by london electric railway ler that included plans to construct tunnels to connect c slr at euston to cce hr s station at camden town together works proposed in these bills would enable trains of each company to run over route of other effectively combining two separate railways reconstruction and extension works were postponed during world war i and did not begin until 1922 c slr platforms and tunnels between euston and moorgate were closed for reconstruction on 8 august 1922 they reopened on 20 april 1924 along with new link to camden town london north western railway thumb map of lnwr s proposed loop railway line under euston station alt map showing an elongated loop of tunnel beneath tracks of surface station and surrounding streets in 1906 london and north western railway lnwr operator of main line station announced proposals to construct an underground station of its own company planned to construct new tracks parallel with its line to watford first section of which would have been constructed as a single track loop long and deep beneath surface station single platform underground station would have been close to cce hr s platforms proposal was presented to parliament in november 1906 and received royal assent on 26 july 1907 lnwr did not proceed with loop plan and underground station which were dropped in 1911 victoria line planning plans for route that eventually became victoria line date from 1940s a proposal for a new underground railway line linking north east london with centre was included in county of london plan in 1943 between 1946 and 1954 a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in south and north or north east london each of these connected three main line termini at king s cross euston and victoria a route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later though funding for construction was not approved by government until 1962 construction and opening thumb left plan of euston station showing arrangement of platforms and alterations needed to accommodate victoria line alt diagram of station layout below ground showing six crossing tunnels of three lines passing through euston station at euston major reconstruction works were undertaken to incorporate new victoria line platforms so that cross platform interchanges could be provided with northern line s bank branch former c slr route to king s cross and bank unlike charing cross branch tracks which were in separate tunnels with side platforms bank branch tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel these platforms suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times to provide cross platform interchange a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound bank branch trains which were diverted to a new platform south of original alignment redundant northbound track bed in station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform new victoria line platforms were excavated between and parallel to original and new bank branch tunnels each pair of platforms was linked via a concourse served by escalators thumb extra wide southbound platform of northern line s bank branch formed by removal of northbound track passengers on right are standing where northbound track was alt a wide concrete platform in a circular tunnel railway track runs along left with posters fixed to wall opposite platform in conjunction with reconstruction of main line station above a new ticket hall was excavated below concourse with two sets of escalators replacing lifts escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level which in turn gives access to northern line charing cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators one set each serving northbound and southbound victoria and northern line bank branch platforms interchanges between northbound and southbound victoria and northern bank line platforms are made via a passageway at lower level so as to avoid need to use escalators an emergency stair to intermediate interchange level is located midway along passageway victoria line platforms opened on 1 december 1968 when second section of line was opened between highbury islington and warren street disused passages remain with tiling and posters from 1960s future proposals unlike neighbouring main line termini st pancras and king s cross euston is not served by circle hammersmith city and metropolitan lines euston square station which is served by these lines is approximately to south west plans for redevelopment of main line station for high speed 2 hs2 include construction of a direct connection to euston square cce hr station building on melton street sits within hs2 development site area and will be demolished to make way for station proposals for crossrail 2 include an underground station serving euston and st pancras that will be integrated with existing london underground station a new underground line
