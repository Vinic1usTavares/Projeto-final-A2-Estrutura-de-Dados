campaigns in 1957 and 1958 a report by human rights in china hric states that re education through labor was first used by communist party of china in 1955 to punish counter revolutionaries and in 1957 was officially adopted into law to be implemented by ministry of public security law allowed police to sentence both minor offenders and counter revolutionaries or anti socialist elements to incarceration in labor camps without right to a judicial hearing or trial and did not allow judicial review to take place until after punishment was being enforced in beginning there were no limits to length for which detainees could be sentenced and it was not until 1979 that a maximum sentence of four years three years sentence plus one year extension was set in 1983 management and implementation of re education through labor system was passed from ministry of public security to ministry of justice when falun gong was banned in mainland china in 1999 re education through labor became a common

reform of system but reform did not happen immediately though china daily reported that there was general consensus that reform was needed in march 2007 however chinese government did announce that it would abolish re education through labor system and replace it with a more lenient set of laws according to proposal maximum sentence would be lowered from four years to 18 months re education centers would be renamed correction centers and have their fences and gates removed a month later chongqing municipality passed a law allowing lawyers to offer legal counsel in re education through labor

judicial system so individuals are rarely charged or tried before being detained public security bureaus police offices are able to carry out administrative detentions for minor infringements that are not considered criminal acts rojek 2001 p 100 at least one analyst has suggested that local public security bureaus often abuse their authority and detain individuals for things such as personal vendettas seymour 2005 p 151 individuals may also be sentenced to re education through labor by courts but proportion of individuals who receive trials rather than going directly into administrative detention is determined in part by how much capacity that province has for re education detainees provinces with large re education through labor apparatus generally allow fewer detainees to have trials seymour 2005 pp 150 1 where detainees have been allowed a trial their lawyers have faced intimidation and abuse according to some reports section 1e denial of fair public trial and individuals

re education through labor detainees is geared towards agriculture or producing goods many of which are sold internationally since re education through labor detainees are not counted as official prisoners and therefore not subject to international treaties laogai handbook 2006 p 17 they also perform work ranging from tending vegetables and emptying septic pits to cutting stone blocks and construction work although drug abusers are ostensibly placed in re education through labor to be treated for their addictions some testimonial evidence has suggested that little meaningful treatment takes place in at least some of centers and that drug abusers often relapse into addiction upon their release from detention facilities have been widely criticized for physical abuse that is said to go on within them corporal punishment is commonly used and torture and physical abuse are also thought to be widespread in facilities in april 2003 zhang bin an inmate at re education facility city correctional camp was beaten to death reportedly by other inmates and by labor supervisor zhang s death along with march 2003 death of inmate sun in a custody and repatriation prison sparked calls within china for reform of system although reforms were not made immediately though most reports describe conditions of re education camps as brutal there are some claims of prisoners being well treated for example when he was released from a three year re education sentence in 1999 dissident liu xiaobo said that he had been treated very mildly that he had been allowed to spend time reading and that conditions had been pretty good forced labor may include breaking rocks and assembling car seat covers and even gold farming in world of warcraft according to xinhua official news agency of

detention was kept under house arrest and five men who attempted to visit him were themselves detained criticism re education through labor system has been criticized by human rights groups foreign governments and un bodies and chinese rights lawyers some chinese government agencies and reformers within government have likewise criticized system as being unconstitutional and advocated for its reform or abolition human rights watch has stated that re education through labor system violates international law specifically article 9 4 of international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr which provides that anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court in order that court may decide without delay on lawfulness of his detention re education through labor has also been criticized by numerous human rights groups for not offering procedural guarantees for accused and for being used to detain political dissidents teachers chinese house church leaders and falun gong practitioners laogai handbook 2006 p 1 furthermore even though law up until 2007 specified a maximum length of detainment of four years at least one source mentions a retention for in camp employment system that allowed authorities to keep detainees in camps for longer than their official sentences re education through labor has been a focus of discussion not only among foreign human rights groups but also among legal scholars in china some of whom were involved in drafting of 2007 laws meant to replace system in addition to legal scholars supreme people s court of people s republic of china had criticized system in light of widespread disapproval of system hric called in 2001 for system to be abolished entirely among its criticisms it cited fact that wording of re education through labor laws was excessively vague allowing authorities to manipulate it fact that punishment given in re education centers was too severe for crimes committed abusive conditions at re education centers and variation of re education through labor laws from one province to another chinese ministry of justice has also noted that system violated items in chinese constitution wang vice director of institute of justice research affiliated to ministry of justice said that re education through labor system contradicts several items in constitution criminal procedure law and international covenant on civil and political rights which china signed in 1998 although many human rights groups and legal scholars both within and without

issuing a report titled changing soup but not medicine amnesty s report concludes that camp closures are a positive step forward for human rights but fundamental problems of arbitrary detention remain in china many of policies and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to rtl have not fundamentally changed quite contrary there is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force latest anti falun gong campaign launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years shows that ccp s determination to rid china of this spiritual group has not abated falun gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to brainwashing centres and other forms
