lamented to nina sharp blair brown his need to have william bell leonard nimoy back to make himself whole realizes that only reason osmium lutetium alloy became lighter than air was due to his own

person to call forth soul of another walter believes bell had arranged for someone in prime universe to be his vessel and rings bell that bell had bequeathed to nina believing it to be instrument that will activate soul magnets and call forth bell simultaneously peter joshua jackson has decided to open up to olivia anna torv and shows her five data discs from shapeshifters he killed after doomsday

hugo hurley reyes in lost made a cameo appearance in os episode was co written by co executive producer josh singer and executive story editor graham roland while former fringe producer brad anderson directed it return of william bell character to series was inspired by leonard nimoy from earlier seasons in his first appearance on fringe in first season finale there s more than one of everything nimoy requested that a bell be placed on his desk so that his character would be able to ring it as a play on character s name when writers considered how to bring bell back for third season they recalled this mannerism and wrote it into larger mythos being means by which bell s mind emerged from olivia s at end of this episode on march 3 entertainment weekly reported that actor jorge garcia would be making a cameo appearance in an upcoming fringe episode garcia who previously starred as hugo hurley reyes from j j abrams lost appears as a massive dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with walter at start of episode alan ruck guests as dr crick person behind floating bodies ruck was approached by show s producers having envisioned him for role ruck described character he is no dummy and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it ultimately he would like to use it for good but in so doing he causes a lot of damage so i guess you can say he s obsessed and this particular point in time where episode of fringe starts time is fleeting and he s just under gun on his character s possible reappearance ruck commented i think not technically yes he could come back but probably not as with other fringe episodes fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with science olympiad for grade school children focusing on science seen in os with intention of having students learn about meteorites and ways of finding them reception ratings on its first broadcast os maintained a 1 5 5 rating share for adults between ages of 18 and 49 as with several previous episodes with an estimated 3 76 million viewers in 18 49 demographic fringe was second most watched show in its time slot after csi ny time shifted viewing increased episode s ratings among adults by 53 percent to a 2 3 ratings share this was largest increase in time shifting viewing for week among network shows reviews reviews of episode were generally positive ken tucker from entertainment weekly praised guest actor alan ruck s sustained understated performance and also called olivia being revealed as bell s vessel a clever development especially praising actress anna torv s imitation of nimoy s voice rather than doing obvious thing and hav ing her lip synch nimoy reading lines a v club s emily vanderwerff graded episode with a b explaining that unlike tucker she thought idea of soul magnets was just so goofy that it s almost too much for me to handle vanderwerff also felt there wasn t much of a connection between episode and ongoing storyline until show tries to force one in a way that doesn t feel as elegant as show usually makes this stuff feel she did however praise ruck as well cast and wrote episode very nearly managed to parallel walter s desperate measures to desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science which reviewer considered strongest asset of show writing for los angeles times critic andrew hanson referred to audiences friday night plans away from television when he commented episode was better than any movie you re going to see in theater right now hanson thought mystery produced surprises around every corner ign s ramsey isler rated episode 8 0 10 explaining he enjoyed classic fringe opening scene decent acting job by ruck and john noble s performance he also thought script was very clever as it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks isler wasn t sure what to make of bell olivia plot twist however commenting that this new william bell thing is either going to end up as best plot device of season or cheesiest thing in recent sci fi history billy grifter from den of geek was slightly disappointed with mad scientist storyline as he felt it had been done before but found several redeeming qualities alan ruck s performance and last five minutes featuring noble and blair brown and torv with joshua jackson grifter thought noble brown scene was actually very funny praising two actors performances and added that this humor made following torv jackson scene s impact even greater referring to torv s passable nimoy impression grifter concluded that strength of fringe is that it can take a rather light and fluffy premise like one in os and embellish it with wonderful character moments and a genuine surprise or two references external links
