baseball is a bat and ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding game proceeds when a player on fielding team called pitcher throws a ball which a player on batting team tries to hit with a bat objective of offensive team batting team is to hit ball into field of play allowing it to run bases having its runners advance counter clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs objective of defensive team fielding team is to prevent batters from becoming runners and to prevent runners advance around bases a run is scored when a runner legally advances around bases in order and touches home plate place where player started as a batter team that scores most runs by end of game is winner first objective of batting team is to have a player reach first base safely a player on batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner either immediately or during teammates turns batting fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out which forces them out of field of play both pitcher and fielders have methods of getting batting team s players out opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding batting team s turn to bat is over once fielding team records three outs one turn batting for each team constitutes an inning a game is usually composed of nine innings and team with greater number of runs at end of game wins if scores are tied at end of nine innings extra innings are usually played baseball has no game clock although most games end in ninth inning baseball evolved from older bat and ball games already being played in england by mid 18th century this game was brought by immigrants to north america where modern version developed by late 19th century baseball was widely recognized as national sport of united states baseball is popular in north america and parts of central and south america caribbean and east asia particularly in japan and south korea in united states and canada professional major league baseball mlb teams are divided into national league nl and american league al each with three divisions east west and central mlb champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in world series top level of play is similarly split in japan between central and pacific leagues and in cuba between west league and east league world baseball classic organized by world baseball softball confederation is major international competition of sport and attracts top national teams from around

professional and professional style games children often play on smaller fields a baseball game is played between two teams each composed of nine players that take turns playing offense batting and baserunning and defense pitching and fielding a pair of turns one at bat and one in field by each team constitutes an inning a game consists of nine innings seven innings at high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues and six innings at little league level one team customarily visiting team bats in top or first half of every inning other team customarily home team bats in bottom or second half of every inning goal of game is to score more points runs than other team players on team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases in order set at corners of square shaped baseball diamond a player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding counterclockwise from first base to second base third base and back home to score a run team in field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs which remove opposing players from offensive action until their next turn at bat comes up again when three outs are recorded teams switch roles for next half inning if score of game is tied after nine innings extra innings are played to resolve contest many amateur games particularly unorganized ones involve different numbers of players and innings thurston 2000 p 15 game is played on a field whose primary boundaries foul lines extend forward from home plate at 45 degree angles 90 degree area within foul lines is referred to as fair territory 270 degree area outside them is foul territory part of field enclosed by bases and several yards beyond them is infield area farther beyond infield is outfield in middle of infield is a raised pitcher s mound with a rectangular rubber plate rubber at its center outer boundary of outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence which may be of any material and height fair territory between home plate and outfield boundary is baseball s field of play though significant events can take place in foul territory as well there are three basic tools of baseball ball bat and glove or mitt baseball is about size of an adult s fist around 9 inches 23 centimeters in circumference it has a rubber or cork center wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide with red stitching porterfield 2007 p 23 bat is a hitting tool traditionally made of a single solid piece of wood other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games it is a hard round stick about 2 5 inches 6 4 centimeters in diameter at hitting end tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches 86 centimeters long and not longer than 42 inches 106 centimeters glove or mitt is a fielding tool made of padded leather with webbing between fingers as an aid in catching and holding onto ball it takes various shapes to meet specific needs of different fielding positions protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters thurston 2000 pp 21 30 31 at beginning of each half inning nine players of fielding team arrange themselves around field one of them pitcher stands on pitcher s mound pitcher begins pitching delivery with one foot on rubber pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate another fielding team player catcher squats on far side of home plate facing pitcher rest of fielding team faces home plate typically arranged as four infielders who set up along or within a few yards outside imaginary lines basepaths between first second and third base and three outfielders in standard arrangement there is a first baseman positioned several steps to left of first base a second baseman to right of second base a shortstop to left of second base and a third baseman to right of third base basic outfield positions are left fielder center fielder and right fielder with exception of catcher all fielders are required to be in fair territory when pitch is delivered a neutral umpire sets up behind catcher porterfield 2007 pp 16 18 25 34 35 other umpires will be distributed around field as well thumb right david ortiz batter awaiting a pitch with catcher and umpire play starts with a member of batting team batter standing at home plate holding a bat batter waits for pitcher to throw a pitch ball toward home plate and attempts to hit ball with bat catcher catches pitches that batter does not hit as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect and returns them to pitcher a batter who hits ball into field of play must drop bat and begin running toward first base at which point player is referred to as a runner or until play is over a batter runner a batter runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base a batter runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond however far player believes can be reached safely a player who reaches base despite proper play by fielders has recorded a hit a player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single if a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit it is a double third base a triple if ball is hit in air within foul lines over entire outfield and outfield fence if there is one or otherwise safely circles all bases it is a home run batter and any runners on base may all freely circle bases each scoring a run this is most desirable result for batter a player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit instead responsible fielder is charged with an error any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land or contact ground in fair territory before or after ball lands a runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play if a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through infield it becomes dead and any runners must return to base they occupied when play began if ball is hit in air and caught before it lands batter has out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up contact base they occupied when play began as or after ball is caught runners may also attempt to advance to next base while pitcher is in process of delivering ball to home plate a successful effort is a stolen base a pitch that is not hit into field of play is called either a strike or a ball a batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out a batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk a free advance to first base a batter may also freely advance to first base if batter s body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside strike zone provided batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit crucial to determining balls and strikes is umpire s judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through strike zone a conceptual area above home plate extending from midpoint between batter s shoulders and belt down to hollow of knee thumb a shortstop tries to tag out a runner who is sliding headfirst attempting to reach second base while team at bat is trying to score runs team in field is attempting to record outs in addition to strikeout common ways a member of batting team may be put out include ground out force out and tag out it is possible to record two outs in course of same play this is called a double play three outs in one play a triple play is possible though rare players put out or retired must leave field returning to their team s dugout or bench a runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on team stranded runners do not benefit team in its next turn at bat as every half inning begins with bases empty an individual player s turn batting or plate appearance is complete when player reaches base hits a home run makes an out or hits a ball that results in team s third out even if it is recorded against a teammate on rare occasions a batter may be at plate when without batter s hitting ball a third out is recorded against a teammate for instance a runner getting caught stealing tagged out attempting to steal a base a batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off team s next turn batting any balls or strikes recorded against batter previous inning are erased a runner may circle bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn once a player has completed a plate appearance that player may not bat again until eight other members of player s team have all taken their turn at bat in batting order batting order is set before game begins and may not be altered except for substitutions once a player has been removed for a substitute that player may not reenter game children s games often have more lenient rules such as little league rules which allow players to be substituted back into same game thurston 2000 p 100 if designated hitter dh rule is in effect each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat and run dh takes place of another player almost invariably pitcher in batting order but does not field thus even with dh each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players porterfield 2007 p 19 thurston 2000 p 153 personnel

league and by level of organized play a major league baseball mlb team has a roster of 25 players with specific roles a typical roster features following players see e g eight position players catcher four infielders and three outfielders all of whom play on a regular basis five starting pitchers who constitute team s pitching rotation or starting rotation six relief pitchers including one closer who constitute team s bullpen named for off field area where pitchers warm up one backup or substitute catcher two backup infielders two backup outfielders one pinch hitter or a utility player or a

central league in japan and national league do not have rule and high level minor league clubs connected to national league teams are not required to field a dh in leagues that apply designated hitter rule a typical team has nine offensive regulars including dh five starting pitchers seven or eight relievers a backup catcher and two or three other reserve players other manager or head coach oversees team s major strategic decisions such as establishing starting rotation setting lineup or batting order before each game and making substitutions during games in particular bringing in relief pitchers managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches they may have specialized responsibilities such as working with players on hitting fielding pitching or strength and conditioning at most levels of organized play two coaches are stationed on field when team is at bat first base coach and third base coach whom occupy designated coaches boxes just outside foul lines these coaches assist in direction of baserunners when ball is in play and relay tactical signals from manager to batters and runners during pauses in play cleon most signs given by coaches are merely camouflage baseball digest december 1960 january 1961 pp 47 49 in contrast to many other team sports baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team s uniforms coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on field to confer with players during a game fans speak out baseball digest staff baseball digest august 1999 pp 9 10 any baseball game involves one or more umpires who make rulings on outcome of each play at a minimum one umpire will stand behind catcher to have a good view of strike zone and call balls and strikes additional umpires may be stationed near other bases thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs in mlb four umpires are used for each game one near each base in playoffs six umpires are used one at each base and two in outfield along foul lines zoss 2004 p 293 strategy and tactics many of pre game and in game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact in general right handed batters tend to be more successful against left handed pitchers and to an even greater degree left handed batters tend to be more successful against right handed pitchers a manager with several left handed batters in regular lineup who knows team will be facing a left handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of right handed backups on team s roster during late innings of a game as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions manager of fielding team trying to arrange same handed pitcher batter matchups and manager of batting team trying to arrange opposite handed matchups with a team that has lead in late innings a manager may remove a starting position player especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again for a more skillful fielder known as a defensive substitution see e g davis hank small town heroes images of minor league baseball univ of iowa press 1997 p 186 pitching and fielding tactics right thumb a first baseman receives a pickoff throw as runner dives back to first base tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection by gripping and then releasing baseball in a certain manner and by throwing it at a certain speed pitchers can cause baseball to break to either side or downward as it approaches batter thus creating differing pitches that can be selected among resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown four basic types are fastball changeup or off speed pitch and two breaking balls curveball and slider pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing conventionally before each pitch catcher signals pitcher what type of pitch to throw as well as its general vertical and or horizontal location stallings and bennett 2003 p 192 if there is disagreement on selection pitcher may shake off sign and catcher will call for a different pitch with a runner on base and taking a lead pitcher may attempt a pickoff a quick throw to a fielder covering base to keep runner s lead in check or optimally effect a tag out pickoff attempts however are subject to rules that severely restrict pitcher s movements before and during pickoff attempt violation of any one of these rules could result in umpire calling a balk against pitcher which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity if an attempted stolen base is anticipated catcher may call for a pitchout a ball thrown deliberately off plate allowing catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base stallings and bennett 2003 pp 126 132 facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of field fielding team may employ a shift with most or all of fielders moving to left or right of their usual positions with a runner on third base infielders may play in moving closer to home plate to improve odds of throwing out runner on a ground ball though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn in infield stallings and bennett 2003 p 45 batting and baserunning tactics several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base including fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter runner takes off with pitch drawing shortstop or second baseman over to second base creating a gap in infield for batter to poke ball through stallings and bennett 2003 pp 5 46 47 sacrifice bunt calls for batter to focus on making soft contact with ball so that it rolls a short distance into infield allowing runner to advance into scoring position as batter is thrown out at first a batter particularly one who is a fast runner may also attempt to bunt for a hit a sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base aimed at bringing that runner home is known as a squeeze play stallings and bennett 2003 pp 42 43 47 48 with a runner on third and fewer than two outs a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that even if it is caught will be deep enough to allow runner to tag up and score a successful batter in this case gets credit for a sacrifice fly manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in count i e has more balls than strikes to take or not swing at next pitch stallings and bennett 2003 p 186 history evolution of baseball from older bat and ball games is difficult to trace with precision consensus once held that today s baseball is a north american development from older game rounders popular among children in

essentially independent of each other while coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics execution of play itself is a series of solitary acts if batter hits a line drive outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on bounce and for succeeding or failing statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard while individual focus in cricket is mitigated by importance of batting partnership and practicalities of tandem running it is enhanced by fact that a batsman may occupy wicket for an hour or much more there is no statistical equivalent in cricket for fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal

dimensions of foul territory thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between foul lines and stands but a in a park with more expansive foul ground powers 2003 p 219 a fence in foul territory that is close to outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward fielders while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in corner these variations can make difference between a double and a triple or inside park home run puhalla krans and goatley 2003 p 198 surface of field is also unregulated while adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement and one used by virtually all mlb teams with naturally surfaced fields teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare some fields including several in mlb use an artificial surface such as astroturf surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning similarly presence of a roof seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs can greatly affect how fly balls are played while football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering size and shape of their fields are much more standardized area out of bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play way foul territory in baseball does so variations in that regard are largely insignificant puhalla krans and goatley 2003 p 207 thumb a new york yankees batter and a boston red sox catcher at fenway park these physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark other local factors such as altitude and climate can also significantly affect play a given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher s park or a hitter s park if one or other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements most exceptional park in this regard is coors field home of colorado rockies its high altitude above sea level is partly responsible for giving it strongest hitter s park effect in major leagues due to low air pressure keri 2007 pp 295 301 wrigley field home of chicago cubs is known for its fickle disposition a hitter s park when strong winds off lake michigan are blowing out it becomes more of a pitcher s park when they are blowing in absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out but nature of team rosters and players statistical records for example hitting a fly ball into right field might result in an easy catch on warning track at one park and a home run at another a team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field such as new york yankees will tend to stock its roster with left handed pull hitters who can best exploit it on individual level a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter s park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time even more so if his talents are especially suited to park see also powers 2003 p 85 statistics organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports each play is
