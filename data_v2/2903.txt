return to california with their husbands to establish a new dynasty complete with both sexes as a christian nation etymology thumb an early conception of island of california this map is result of partial exploration and guesswork first voyage of christopher columbus in late 15th century sparked a new interest in search for terrestrial paradise a legendary land of ease and riches with beautiful women wearing gold and pearls spanish author garci rodriguez de montalvo drew upon reports from new world to add interest to his fantasy world of chivalry and battle of riches victory and loss of an upside down depiction of traditional sex roles around year 1500 in his novel adventures of esplandian he writes explorer hernan cortes and his men were familiar with book putnam 1917 pp 300 301 cortes quoted it in 1524 as governor of mexico he sent out an expedition of two ships one guided by famous pilot ximenez who led a mutiny killing expedition s leader diego becerra and a number of sailors faithful to becerra putnam 1917 pp 327 328 after mutiny ximenez continued sailing north by northwest and in early 1534 landed at what is known today as la paz baja california sur ximenez who reported pearls found believed land was a large island he and his escort of sailors were killed by natives when they went ashore for water few remaining sailors brought ship and its story back to cortes there is some dispute whether land was named at this time no record exists of ximenez giving it a name in 1535 cortes led an expedition back to land arriving on may 1 1535 a day known as santa cruz de mayo and in keeping with methods of contemporary discoverers he named it santa cruz putnam 1917 pp 333 334 it is not known who first named area california but between 1550 and 1556 name appears three times in reports about cortes written by giovanni battista ramusio however name california also appears in a 1542 journal kept by explorer juan rodriguez cabrillo who used it casually as if it were already popular chapman 1921 p 66 in 1921 california historian charles e chapman theorized that ximenez named new land california but name was not accepted by cortes because ximenez was a who killed becerra a kinsman of cortes chapman 1921 pp 65 66 despite this name became one used popularly by spaniards only name used by non spaniards and by 1770 entire pacific coast controlled by spain was officially known as california spanish speaking people who lived there were called for many years rodriguez de montalvo novel languished in obscurity with no connection known between it and name of california in 1864 a portion of original was translated by edward everett hale for antiquarian society and story was printed in atlantic monthly magazine hale supposed that in inventing names rodriguez de montalvo held in his mind spanish word calif term for a leader of muslim people polk 1995 p 130 hale s joint derivation of calafia and california was accepted by many then questioned by a few scholars who sought further proof and offered their own interpretations george davidson wrote in 1910 that hale s theory was best yet presented but offered his own addition putnam 1917 pp 293 294 in 1917 ruth putnam printed an exhaustive account of work performed up to that time she wrote that both calafia and california most likely came from arabic word khalifa which means ruler or leader same word in spanish was califa easily made into california to stand for land of caliph or calafia to stand for female caliph putnam 1917 p 356 putnam discussed davidson s 1910 theory based on greek word meaning beautiful but discounted it as exceedingly unlikely a conclusion that dora beale polk agreed with in 1995 calling theory far fetched putnam also wrote that song of roland held a passing mention of a place called califerne perhaps named thus because it was caliph s domain a place of infidel rebellion chapman elaborated on this connection in 1921 there can be no question but that a learned man like ordonez de montalvo was familiar with chanson de roland this derivation of word california can perhaps never be proved but it is too plausible and it may be added too interesting to be overlooked chapman 1921 pp 63 64 polk characterized this theory as imaginative speculation adding that another scholar offered interestingly plausible suggestion that roland s califerne is a corruption of persian kar i farn a mythological mountain of paradise where griffins lived polk 1995 p 131 in 1923 prosper boissonnade dean of literature at university of poitiers wrote that a fortified capital city in 11th century algeria was built and defended by beni iferne tribe of berber people this city was called iferne or kal iferne by arabs and was certainly known at time in spain today it is ruins known as beni hammad fort boissonnade said arab name of this fortress city likely inspired roland and later rodriguez de montalvo such that kal iferne became first califerne and then california first published in french as p boissonnade 1923 du nouveau sur la chanson de roland champion john william templeton describes how hernan cortes expedition in search of california had africans as a third of his crew including his second in command juan garrido templeton says that calafia is exemplary of a genre of literature from 14th to 16th centuries that featured black women as powerful wealthy and

fought like men as well story of an island paradise filled with gold and pearls was a recurring theme that rodriguez de montalvo was familiar with in seeking new land spanish explorers were often led onward after hearing about a land of gold or a land ruled by women california historian lynn townsend white jr wrote that they considered as yet undiscovered california a land of orient with fantastic attributes novel about esplandian and calafia s domain had a strong influence on searching conquistadors who believed they might find a nation of women and riches somewhere at edge of known world

greek tales including those by homer and they are usually killed or otherwise subdued by male warriors male hostility to woman warriors is expressed by dictys of crete who wrote that an amazon queen transgressed boundaries of nature and of her sex niketas choniates a medieval greek historian wrote about women warriors who fought alongside men in second crusade riding horses unashamedly astride rather than modestly sidesaddle dressed as men and maintaining a very warlike appearance jacques de vitry a bishop of acre and a historian of crusades wrote about amazons who fought who were stronger than men because their vitality was not consumed in frequent copulation in some stories women warriors fought alongside muslim men and in others they allied themselves to christian armies some of

modern 1994 p 555 that was inhabited only by women a tale told to him by many of natives of west indies columbus did not call matinino women amazons but comparison was drawn by his contemporaries when encountering natives in new world spanish explorers were occasionally told of a tribe composed entirely of women one such tale was related to cortes about a group of amazons supposedly living in a province called juan de grijalva was told of amazons during his 1518 expedition through tabasco region of mexico nuno de guzman followed tales of a nation of women who lived in riches on or near sea women with whiter skin who were accounted goddesses by natives he described how they used bows and arrows and lived in many towns haase 1994 p 305 polk characterized guzman as driven by lust for sex
