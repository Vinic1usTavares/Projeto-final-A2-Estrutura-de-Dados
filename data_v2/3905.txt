spanish conquest of peten was last stage of conquest of guatemala a prolonged conflict during spanish colonisation of americas a wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest peten contains a central drainage basin with a series of lakes and areas of savannah it is crossed by several ranges of low karstic hills and rises to south as it nears guatemalan highlands conquest of peten a region now incorporated into modern republic of guatemala climaxed in 1697 with capture of nojpeten island capital of itza kingdom by martin de ursua y arizmendi with defeat of itza last independent and unconquered native kingdom in americas fell to european colonisers sizeable maya populations existed in peten before conquest particularly around central lakes and along rivers peten was divided into different maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities most important groups around central lakes were itza yalain and kowoj other groups with territories in peten included kejache acala lakandon ch ol xocmo chinamita icaiche and manche ch ol peten was first penetrated by hernan cortes with a sizeable expedition that crossed territory from north to south in 1525 in first half of 16th century spain established neighbouring colonies in yucatan to north and guatemala to south spanish missionaries laid groundwork for extension of colonial administration in extreme south of peten from 1596 onwards but no further spanish entry of central peten took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at itza capital having travelled from spanish town of merida in yucatan in 1622 a military expedition set out from yucatan led by captain francisco de mirones and accompanied by franciscan friar diego delgado this expedition was a disaster and spanish were massacred by itza in 1628 manche ch ol of south were placed under administration of colonial governor of verapaz within captaincy general of guatemala manche ch ol unsuccessfully rebelled against spanish control in 1633 in 1695 a military expedition tried to reach lake peten itza from guatemala this was followed in 1696 by missionaries from merida and in 1697 by martin de ursua s expedition from yucatan that resulted in final defeat of independent kingdoms of central peten and their incorporation into spanish empire geography thumb right alt view across a flat grassy plain dotted with palm trees peten savannah

guerra land of war covers a broad northern swathe of mountains and southern portion of lowlands map of northern lowlands of guatemala at time of spanish contact although there is insufficient data to

to conquest christopher columbus discovered americas for kingdom of castile and leon in 1492 by 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one spanish kingdom private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with spanish crown to conquer newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and power to rule in first decades after discovery spanish colonised caribbean and established a centre of operations on island of cuba they heard rumours of rich empire of aztecs on mainland to west and in 1519 hernan cortes set sail with eleven ships to explore mexican coast by august 1521 aztec capital of tenochtitlan had fallen to spanish within three years of fall of tenochtitlan spanish had conquered a large part of mexico extending as far south as isthmus of tehuantepec newly conquered territory became new spain headed by a viceroy who answered to spanish crown via council of indies cortes despatched pedro de alvarado with an army to conquer mesoamerican kingdoms of guatemalan sierra madre and neighbouring pacific plain military phase of establishment of spanish colony of guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541 captaincy general of guatemala had its capital at santiago de los caballeros de guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included mexican state of chiapas as well as el salvador honduras and costa rica spanish imposed colonial rule over yucatan between 1527 and 1546 and over verapaz from 16th to 17th centuries leaving area between essentially peten and much of belize independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated impact of old world diseases thumb right illustration depicting smallpox victims in 16th century florentine codex a single soldier arriving in mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated devastating plagues that swept through native populations of americas european diseases that ravaged indigenous inhabitants of americas also severely affected various maya groups of peten it is estimated that there were approximately 30 000 ch ol and ch olti maya in western peten at start of 16th century between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease war and enforced relocations when nojpeten fell in 1696 there were approximately 60 000 maya living around lake peten itza including a considerable number of refugees from other areas it is estimated that 88 of inhabitants died during first decade of colonial rule because of disease and war although disease was responsible for majority of deaths internecine warfare between rival maya groups and spanish expeditions also took their toll weaponry and armour conquistadors often wore steel armour that included chainmail and helmets spanish were sufficiently impressed by quilted cotton armour of their maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify discomfort of wearing european armour quilted cotton armour although still uncomfortably hot was flexible and weighed much less maya armour was adapted by spanish who used knee length quilted cotton tunics and spanish style caps horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour after final push to peten lakes in early 1697 spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 dutch and french made muskets three calibre light cannons cast from iron and mounted on carriages four iron and two bronze pedreros 2 chambered stone launchers and six of at least eight bronze light cannons known as native weaponry spanish described weapons of war of peten maya as bows and arrows fire sharpened poles flint headed spears and two handed swords known as hadzab that were crafted from strong wood with blade fashioned from inset obsidian these were similar to aztec macuahuitl they had a thin wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in wood shaft was up to long and was crafted from hard dark wood of a flowering tree called chulul by maya bows used by maya were described as almost as high as a man and were made from same chulul wood as hadzab with bowstring fashioned from fibre bow was called a arrows were made from reeds with flint bone or arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers in hand to hand combat maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a chulul wood handle they were about long maya spears were referred to as sometimes tip was fire hardened sometimes they were set with a stone blade spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin maya used several different sizes of spear with smaller spears probably employed as a missile longer spears were a similar size as those used by spanish distinguished maya warriors entered battle wearing armour upper body was covered by a short jacket that was filled with rock salt and forearms and legs were protected with tight bindings of cloth or leather salt packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers commoners did not wear armour in battle usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint warriors carried shields made from two right angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them strategies and tactics spanish were aware that itza maya had become centre of anti spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their trade routes over course of almost two hundred years itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against spanish advance spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns or reducciones also known as congregaciones native resistance to new nucleated settlements took form of flight of indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as forest or joining neighbouring maya groups that had not yet submitted to spanish those that remained behind in reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases in addition to military expeditions a contract for conquest was issued to dominican order which engaged missionaries for peaceful pacification of native populations so they would accept roman catholicism and submit to spanish rule this tactic worked in neighbouring mountains of verapaz to south although their success there was aided by threat of spanish garrisons stationed within striking distance in lowland peten this approach was not so successful since maya could disappear easily into rainforest leaving spanish with deserted settlements likewise franciscan order engaged in generally peaceful attempts to incorporate maya into spanish empire via attempted christian conversion of native leaders franciscan order routinely embraced practice of missionary violence including corporal punishment and defence of idea of holy war against non christians in many cases maya remained christian only while missionaries were present and they would immediately become apostate as soon as friars left in guatemala in late 17th century franciscan friar francisco de asis vazquez de herrera argued that war against apostate indians was obligatory missionary penetration of peten was not risk free and many missionaries were killed in region independent maya frequently attacked christianised maya settlements and encouraged such settlements to abandon their new religion and resist spanish as spanish military expeditions were launched against maya with increasing frequency independent maya communities began to request presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict itza attempted to use neighbouring maya groups such as yalain as a buffer against spanish encroachment they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into spanish empire with spanish attempts to penetrate region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in yucatan and guatemala at times itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on other cortes in peten thumb right hernan cortes conqueror of aztecs travelled

across itza kingdom in what is now northern peten department of guatemala his aim was to subdue rebellious cristobal de olid whom he had sent to conquer honduras olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory cortes had 140 spanish soldiers 93 of them mounted 3 000 mexican warriors 150 horses a herd of pigs artillery munitions and other supplies he also had with him 600 chontal maya carriers from acalan they arrived at north shore of lake peten itza on 13 march 1525 roman catholic priests accompanying expedition celebrated mass in presence of aj kan ek king of itza who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship cross and to destroy his idols cortes accepted an invitation from kan ek to visit nojpeten also known as tayasal and crossed to maya city with 20 spanish soldiers while rest of his army continued around lake to meet him on south shore on his departure from nojpeten cortes left behind a cross and a lame horse that itza treated as a deity attempting to feed it poultry meat and flowers but animal soon died spanish did not officially contact itza again until arrival of franciscan priests in 1618 when cortes cross was said to still be standing at nojpeten from lake cortes continued south along western slopes of maya mountains a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover during which he lost more than two thirds of his horses when he came to a river swollen with constant torrential rains that had been falling during expedition cortes turned upstream to gracias a dios rapids which took two days to cross and cost him more horses on 15 april 1525 expedition arrived at maya village of with local guides they headed into hills north of lake izabal where their guides abandoned them to their fate expedition became lost in hills and came close to starvation before they captured a maya boy who led them to safety cortes found a village on shore of lake izabal perhaps xocolo he crossed dulce river to settlement of nito somewhere on amatique bay with about a dozen companions and waited there for rest of his army to regroup over next week by this time remnants of expedition had been reduced to a few hundred cortes succeeded in contacting spaniards he was searching for only to find that cristobal de olid s own officers had already put down his rebellion cortes then returned to mexico by sea prelude to conquest from 1527 onwards spanish were increasingly active in yucatan peninsula establishing several colonies and towns by 1544 including campeche and valladolid in what is now mexico spanish impact on northern maya encompassing invasion epidemic diseases and export of up to 50 000 maya slaves caused many maya to flee southwards to join itza around lake peten itza within modern borders of guatemala dominican missionaries were active in verapaz and southern peten from late 16th century through 17th century attempting non violent conversion with limited success in 17th century franciscans came to conclusion that pacification and christian conversion of maya would not be possible as long as itza held out at lake peten itza constant flow of escapees fleeing spanish held territories to find refuge with itza was a drain on workforce managed by encomienda system missions in southern peten first catholic missionaries entered southern peten in 1596 to convert manche ch ol and mopan q eqchi of verapaz long had close ties with manche ch ol colonial maya towns of coban and cahabon in alta verapaz traded quetzal feathers chile cotton salt and spanish produced iron tools with their lowland lakandon and manche ch ol neighbours receiving cacao and in exchange many q eqchi from verapaz fled spanish control to settle among lakandon and manche ch ol these fugitives strengthened existing ties between independent ch ol and spanish controlled maya of verapaz constant flow of maya between colonial verapaz and independent peten led to religious syncretism that spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent this relationship did not hinder spanish from using q eqchi to help conquer and reduce manche ch ol from middle of 16th century dominican order had been tasked with peaceful conversion of ch ol of verapaz and southern peten and their concentration into new colonial towns itza became fearful that newly converted manche ch ol would lead spanish to nojpeten in 1628 towns of manche ch ol were placed under administration of governor of verapaz with dominican friar francisco moran as their ecclesiastical head moran favoured a more robust approach to conversion of manche and moved spanish soldiers into region to protect against raids from itza to north new spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy spanish military presence provoked manche to revolt which was followed by abandonment of indigenous settlements itza worried about southern approaches to their territory may have instigated a manche rebellion that took place in lent 1633 towards end of 17th century spanish priorities changed and failure of peaceful efforts of dominicans to convert ch ol combined with increasing british presence in caribbean led colonial authorities to end dominican monopoly and allow franciscans and other orders to enter region military options were also viewed more favourably between 1685 and 1689 q eqchi of coban and cahabon were forced to assist spanish in their armed expeditions against manche ch ol and in forcibly relocating them to verapaz these actions depopulated southern peten and led to breakdown of trade routes linking colonial guatemala with independent maya of peten from 1692 to 1694 franciscan friars antonio margil and melchor lopez were active among manche and lakandon ch ol they were eventually expelled by ch ol upon their return to santiago de guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern peten and neighbouring chiapas throughout 17th century spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among manche until spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled at time of contact there were perhaps 10 000 manche these were devastated by war and disease with survivors relocated to rabinal in modern department of baja verapaz after 1700 manche ch ol ceased to play any part in history of peten mopan population has been estimated at between 10 000 and 20 000 people at time of contact in 1692 council of indies ordered that manche ch ol and mopan be dealt with decisively population suffered effects of war and disease and few survivors were moved into spanish reducciones in southeastern peten before being moved to colonial settlements in other parts of peten in 1695 colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect province of guatemala with yucatan and soldiers commanded by jacinto de barrios leal president of royal audiencia of guatemala conquered several ch ol communities most important of these was sakb ajlan on river in eastern chiapas now in mexico which was renamed as nuestra senora de dolores or dolores del lakandon in april 1695 this was one part of a three pronged attack against independent inhabitants of peten and neighbouring chiapas a second group joined up with barrios leal having marched from huehuetenango third group under juan diaz de velasco marched from verapaz against itza barrios leal was accompanied by franciscan friar antonio margil who served as an advisor as well as his personal confessor and chaplain to his troops spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 spanish soldiers friar diego de rivas was based at dolores del lakandon and he and his fellow mercederians baptised several hundred lakandon ch ols in following months and established contacts with neighbouring ch ol communities resistance against spanish continued and hostile ch ol killed several newly baptised christian indians in early march 1696 such was success of friars that captain jacobo de and mercederians decided to try to reach lake peten itza they headed eastwards towards pasion river with 150 heavily armed soldiers plus native guides travelling in five large canoes they got as far as savannah to southeast of lake before turning back for unknown reasons antonio margil remained in dolores del lakandon until 1697 ch ol of lacandon jungle were resettled in huehuetenango in early 18th century conquest of

rest of yucatan peninsula and more than 160 years after conquest of guatemalan highlands lengthy delay in conquering peten region was due to a combination of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and fierce reputation of its maya inhabitants during this time itza used yalain as an eastern buffer against spanish approach from belize lengthy indirect contact between itza and spanish invaders allowed itza to develop an understanding of spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over period of almost two centuries that itza were surrounded by european dominated territories this understanding distinguished conquest of peten from 16th century conquests of aztecs maya and incas in contrast spanish had a very poor understanding of itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by satan from efforts of spanish empire and roman catholic church from time that hernan cortes crossed peten in early 16th century spanish mistakenly

for almost a hundred years in 1618 two franciscan friars set out from merida in yucatan on a mission to attempt peaceful conversion of still pagan itza in central peten bartolome de fuensalida and juan de orbita were accompanied by some christianised maya andres carrillo de a criollo who was alcalde of bacalar a colonial official joined party at bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as tipuj returning to bacalar once he was certain of friars receiving a good welcome there after an arduous six month journey travellers were well received by current kan ek they stayed at nojpeten for some days in an attempt to evangelise itza but aj kan ek refused to renounce his maya religion although he showed interest in masses held by catholic missionaries kan ek informed them that according to ancient itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert in time since cortes had visited nojpeten itza had made a statue of deified horse juan de orbita was outraged when he saw idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces fuensalida was able to save lives of visitors from infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven attempts to convert itza failed and friars left nojpeten on friendly terms with kan ek friars returned in 1619 arriving in october and staying for eighteen days again kan ek welcomed them in a friendly manner but this time maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of missionaries influence upon king they persuaded kan ek s wife to convince him to expel unwelcome visitors missionaries lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors and friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return juan de orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an itza warrior missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived journey back to merida before early 17th century western peten had been heavily populated by ch ol and ch olti maya and was an important trade route for itza by mid 17th century these populations had been devastated by war disease and enforced movement of inhabitants into colonial settlements negating economic importance of region for itza at same time kejache were becoming important intermediaries between itza and yucatan acalan subgroup of kejache had previously traded directly with itza but had been relocated by spanish remaining kejache devastated by disease and subject to intense attentions of spanish missionaries were no longer able to supply itza directly and became middlemen instead spanish setbacks in 1620s in march 1622 governor of yucatan diego de cardenas ordered captain francisco de mirones to launch an assault upon itza he set out from yucatan with 20 spanish soldiers and 80 mayas from yucatan his expedition was later joined by franciscan friar diego delgado expedition first camped at in may they moved to sakalum southwest of bacalar where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements en route to nojpeten delgado believed that soldiers treatment of maya was excessively cruel and he left expedition to make his own way to nojpeten with eighty christianised maya from tipuj in belize in meantime itza had learnt of approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further spanish missionary attempts when mirones learnt of delgado s departure he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse soldiers caught up with him just before tipuj but he was determined to reach nojpeten from tipuj delgado sent a messenger to kan ek asking permission to travel to nojpeten itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for missionary and his companions party was initially received in peace at itza capital but as soon as spanish soldiers let their guard down itza seized and bound new arrivals soldiers were sacrificed to maya gods with their hearts cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around town after sacrifice of spanish soldiers itza took delgado cut his heart out and dismembered him they displayed his head on a stake with others fate of leader of delgado s maya companions was no better with no word from delgado s escort mirones sent two spanish soldiers with bernardino ek a maya scout to learn their fate when they arrived upon shore of lake peten itza itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them they escaped to a canoe by lakeshore but two spanish slowed by their bonds were soon recaptured ek escaped and returned to mirones with news soon afterwards on 27 january 1624 an itza war party led by ajk in p ol caught mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in church at sakalum and slaughtered them spanish reinforcements led by juan bernardo casanova arrived too late spanish soldiers had been sacrificed hanged and beheaded with their corpses burned and impaled on stakes at entrance to village mirones and franciscan priest had been bound to church posts and then sacrificed with their hearts cut out a number of local maya men and women had also been hanged but not decapitated and attackers had burned town following these massacres spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern yucatan and rewards were offered for whereabouts of ajk in p ol maya governor of fernando kamal set out with 150 maya archers to track down they succeeded in capturing itza captain and his followers together with silverware from looted sakalum church and items belonging to mirones prisoners were taken back to spanish captain antonio mendez de interrogated under torture tried and condemned to be hanged drawn and quartered they were decapitated and heads were displayed in plazas of towns throughout colonial partido de la sierra in what is now mexico s yucatan state these events ended all spanish attempts to contact itza until 1695 in 1640s internal strife in spain distracted government from attempts to conquer unknown lands spanish crown lacked time money or interest in such colonial adventures for next four decades late 17th century in 1692 basque nobleman martin de ursua y arizmendi proposed to spanish king construction of a road from merida southwards to link with guatemalan colony in process reducing any independent native populations into colonial congregaciones this was part of a greater plan to subjugate lakandon and manche ch ol of southern peten and upper reaches of usumacinta river original plan was for province of yucatan to build northern section and for guatemala to build southern portion with both meeting somewhere in ch ol territory plan was later modified to pass further east through kingdom of itza spanish itza diplomatic contacts 1695 in december 1695 spanish colonial authorities in merida received a diplomatic visit sent by aj kan ek diplomatic contact had been negotiated by spanish captain francisco hariza y alcalde of bacalar at chunjujub hariza had sent a christian maya ambassador to nojpeten from tipuj in april 1695 who arrived around same time that itza were preparing to defend themselves against a spanish party entering from guatemala nonetheless emissary was received in peace and despatched back to hariza with promises of submission to spain in august hariza travelled to merida in company of a group of seven tipuj natives offering submission to spain four members of this party were not from tipuj at all but were itza diplomats sent incognito from yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with colonial authorities leader of itza delegation was ajchan a nephew of itza king when friar avendano was in merida in september 1695 between attempts to reach nojpeten he met with itza yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through yalain after visiting nojpeten in january 1696 ajchan and his companions returned to nojpeten in november but did not stay long before leaving for merida again thumb

negotiate peace with spain with three itza companions they were accompanied to merida by a small number of mopans from tipuj region ajchan through family ties and marriage had a key role as a middleman between itza yalain and kowoj he also had family ties with semi christianised maya at tipuj and his mother was from chichen itza in northern yucatan his marriage to a kowoj woman had been an attempt ultimately unsuccessful to defuse itza kowoj hostility kan ek sent ajchan to merida with a message of peaceful submission to spanish empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of itza even if this meant sacrificing itza independence from spain itza king s uncle and kowoj were fundamentally opposed to any negotiations with spanish and viewed ajchan s embassy as treachery spanish were unaware of tensions between different maya factions in central peten which by now had escalated into a state of inter maya warfare ajchan was baptised as martin francisco on 31 december 1695 with martin de ursua governor of yucatan acting as his godfather arrival of ajchan and his subsequent baptism was an important diplomatic coup for ursua who used visit for his own political advancement promoting embassy as peaceful final submission of itza kingdom to spanish crown this formal submission of itza kingdom to spain was a critical turning point since from a spanish legal viewpoint itza were now subjects and royal prohibition on military conquest could be sidestepped ajchan left merida with his companions and a spanish escort in middle of january 1696 and arrived back at tipuj around end of month after a few days at tipuj he learnt of violent events unfolding around lake peten itza including battle at ch ich and subsequent killing of two franciscans fearing

muleteers and labourers garcia had previous experience from military expeditions around sajkab chen near modern in southern campeche state expedition advanced some way south of sajkab chen into kejache territory which began at chunpich about north of modern border between mexico and guatemala he rounded up some natives to be moved into colonial settlements but met with armed kejache resistance a skirmish ensued at a kejache village resulting in deaths of eight kejache warriors prisoners taken during skirmish informed garcia that many independent maya lived in area both kejache and others garcia decided to retreat around middle of april probably to escort captured kejache back to sajkab chen to be put to work on garcia s encomienda captain garcia reported back to ursua on 21

out from cahabon in alta verapaz with 70 spanish soldiers accompanied by a large number of maya archers from verapaz and native muleteers four dominican friars led by criollo friar agustin cano accompanied expedition theoretically spanish soldiers were provided solely as an escort for dominicans guatemalan expedition under orders of president jacinto de barrios leal were secretly trying to reach itzas before martin de ursua could reach them from yucatan existence of expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between guatemala and governor of yucatan it formed a part of a three pronged attack against independent inhabitants of peten and neighbouring chiapas other two expeditions were launched against lakandon expedition proceeded northwards through ch ol territory and into mopan territory there they camped at mopan town modern san luis due to their fear of their warlike itza neighbours both ch ol and mopans claimed not to know of any paths to lake peten itza spanish were held up at mopan for several days by supply problems and desertions among their native carriers dominicans took advantage of delay to proselytise mopans and cano wrote that he had converted four native chiefs there although chan king of mopans had fled with many of local inhabitants cano believed that mopans were ruled by king of itzas first skirmish spanish believed that by pressing ahead to lake peten itza they would link up with a simultaneous expedition headed by president barrios himself unaware that barrios had not reached region diaz de velasco sent out a scouting party of 50 musketeers accompanied by native archers on 6 april they soon found evidence of recent itza camps in area estimated to be a month old scouts found a clear road heading north to itza kingdom and army set off along it main force camped about ten leagues 26 miles or 42 km south of lake while a smaller scouting party was sent off ahead this consisted of two spanish soldiers two archers and two muleteers from verapaz with two ch ol speaking native interpreters scouting party advanced to savannah just to south of lake peten itza where they encountered about 30 itza hunters armed with spears shields and bows accompanied by hunting dogs hunters drew their weapons and prepared to fight but mopan interpreter was instructed to explain that spanish party were traders who came in peace accompanied by missionaries spanish began to suspect that interpreter was plotting against them with itza hunters and one of verapaz archers dragged him out from among hunters encounter degenerated into a scuffle and itzas once again drew weapons spanish fired their muskets fatally wounding two hunters and a verapaz indian charged itzas with a machete hunters fled leaving scouting party in possession of food and arrows at hunting camp second skirmish five days after this skirmish antonio machuca led a party of 12 musketeers 25 archers and 13 muleteers to try to find president barrios to scout a river route to lake and to capture another interpreter previous one no longer being trusted main party arrived on savannah near lake following night one of advance party came back into camp with an itza prisoner captured after a fierce struggle with scouts interrogation of prisoner revealed that he was from a high ranking itza lineage and that he had been sent out to find spanish party and to see if they came as traders or invaders rest of machuca s scouting party soon returned to main camp reporting that they had camped four leagues approximately 10 4 miles or 16 7 km from lake where they encountered another hunting party of about a dozen itzas spanish tried to use their interpreter to talk to them but itzas responded with a volley of arrows spanish musketeers tried to respond with but found their gunpowder too wet to fire properly itza warriors charged upon them with spears axes and machetes and ensuing hand to hand battle lasted an hour during which six of itzas were killed rest finally retreated thanks to their padded cotton armour spanish party received no injuries from skirmish spanish pursued fleeing itzas and another fierce skirmish ensued lasting another hour during which most of remaining itzas were killed three itzas escaped and their leader was rendered unconscious with machete blows to head he was taken prisoner and later made a full recovery machuca s party reached lakeshore and could see nojpeten across water but saw such a large force of itzas that they retreated south back to main camp an itza account of this encounter reached colonial authorities in yucatan via tipuj itza reported that guatemalan party approached on horseback to within sight of nojpeten and about thirty curious itzas gathered to talk to intruders whereupon they were attacked by spanish resulting in deaths of thirty itzas capture of one and yet more wounded a christian maya emissary from bacalar at chunjujub yucatan was in nojpeten around this time and reported that itza gathered 3 000 4 000 warriors ready to repulse diaz de velasco s party retreat to guatemala on 24 april first prisoner escaped from main camp same day that injured second prisoner was taken in by machuca and his men interrogation of new prisoner who turned out to be an itza nobleman revealed that itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel spanish friar cano met with his fellow dominicans to discuss what should be done having had information from both machuca and his prisoner that itza were ready for war dominicans were highly critical of spanish soldiers readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them and suspected that president barrios was nowhere near lake furthermore spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness and verapaz indian recruits were deserting daily diaz agreed with dominicans two muleteers had already died from sickness and he recognised that size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with itza nation expedition almost immediately withdrew back to cahabon new prisoner ajk ixaw was later taken back to santiago de los caballeros de guatemala where dominicans questioned him in detail in guatemala ajk ixaw learnt spanish and returned to peten in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition before turning on his captors after spanish retreated to guatemala rumours ran rife among itza and kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of maya population large tracts of territory were abandoned in response including many towns in an area

unexpectedly returned to campeche in early may 1695 governor martin de ursua was already preparing reinforcements for his expedition with garcia s arrival he was immediately allocated extra soldiers on 11 may ursua ordered garcia to begin a second expedition southwards and was allotted 100 salaried maya to accompany him these workers were to be paid three pesos per month and received a suspension of their obligations to supply encomienda work and tribute garcia paid for additional spanish soldiers from his own funds as did jose fernandez de estenos a campeche resident who was to serve as second in command final force numbered 115 spanish soldiers and 150 maya musketeers plus maya labourers and muleteers final tally was more than 400 people which was regarded as a considerable army in impoverished yucatan province ursua also ordered two companies of maya musketeers from tek ax and oxk utzkab to join expedition at b en kawich some southeast of city of campeche bonifacio us was captain of tek ax company diego uk was that of oxk utzkab company marcos pot was overall cacique captain of these two maya companies all three officers were maya a maya company from sajkab chen served

native and mulattos mixed race spanish and black on 18 may ursua requested three missionaries to support expedition from franciscan provincial superior friar antonio de silva by 30 may three friars were ready to join spanish force accompanied by a lay brother who had not yet taken vows in addition silva sent another group of franciscans led by friar andres de avendano who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother this second group was only to remain with garcia while convenient for them to do so and were to continue onwards independently to nojpeten to make contact with itzas with tacit approval of ursua in fact avendano and his party left merida on 2 june a week before party assigned to garcia on 23 june ursua received a message informing him of occupation of sakb ajlan dolores del lakandon by guatemalan troops by this time garcia was at tzuktok near kejache border although ursua s purported plan as authorised by spanish crown was to build a road uniting yucatan with guatemala he now realised that he was in a race to conquer itza kingdom president barrios of guatemala had reached sakb ajlan and was returning to santiago to prepare another expedition and guatemalan soldiers had already reached lakeshore of peten itza any linking road to dolores del lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory instead yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to lake where it could connect with south road via cahabon in verapaz this route would leave dolores del lakandon and lakandon ch ol isolated to west ursua issued new orders to garcia his desire to conquer itza his letter ordered garcia to link up with president barrios at dolores del lakandon and gave him a precise route that would take him instead to lake a short time after receiving these orders garcia ordered construction of a fort at chuntuki some 25 leagues approximately 65 miles or 105 km north of lake peten itza this would serve as main military base for camino real royal road project supply base was at kawich under command of juan del castillo y arrue on 27 july ursua authorised creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce garcia two were spanish companies and one was a mixed race company consisting of mestizos and pardos skirmish at chunpich sajkab chen company of native musketeers pushed ahead with road builders from to first kejache town at chunpich which kejache had fled leaving behind a substantial amount of food company s officers sent for reinforcements from garcia at tzuktok but before any could arrive some 25 kejache returned to chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food nervous sajkab chen sentries feared that residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them with both groups then retreating musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching kejache archers several musketeers were injured in ensuing skirmish and kejache retreated along a forest path without injury mocking invaders sajkab chen company followed path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food they seized food and retreated back along path reinforcements around 3 august garcia moved his entire army forward to chunpich and by october spanish soldiers had established themselves near source of san pedro river by november tzuktok was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at chuntuki in that month garcia once again returned to campeche by december 1695 ursua was under pressure to complete conquest of itza and he approved despatch of reinforcements along camino real to join main garrison reinforcements included 150 spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 maya soldiers together with labourers and muleteers an advance group of 150 mixed maya and non maya soldiers met up with garcia at campeche and proceeded southwards along camino real towards san pedro river rest of reinforcements did not leave campeche until march 1696 avendano s entry from yucatan june 1695 in may 1695 antonio de silva had appointed two groups of franciscans to head for peten first group was to join up with garcia s military expedition second group was to head for lake peten itza independently this second group was headed by friar andres de avendano avendano was accompanied by friar antonio perez de san roman lay brother alonso de vargas and six maya christians recruited from merida and towns en route to campeche this latter group left merida on 2 june 1695 and made its way to juan del castillo y arrue s supply base at kawich set up to support garcia s military expedition on 24 june avendano s party left kawich and set off across sparsely inhabited territory on 29 june they arrived at an abandoned maya temple which he referred to by name nojku meaning big temple spanish had already passed through and had broken many idols but friars climbed temple and managed to find about 50 additional ceremonial sculptures which they destroyed they also placed a cross inside other group of friars on their way to join garcia passed through nojku a few days later and found that local maya had already placed new offerings within avendano s group continued southwards and found increasing signs of habitation and arrived at military camp of captain jose fernandez de estenos at deserted maya town of ub which had been cleared by spanish under garcia some sixteen years previously avendano continued south along course of new road finding increasing evidence of spanish military activity with rounding up of local inhabitants and raiding of fields and orchards for provisions by spanish troops franciscans overtook garcia at b uk te about before tzuktok avendano s party arrived at tzuktok near kejache border by 10 july and left two weeks later around same time that garcia arrived there with his captives rounded up at b uk te for forced labour before leaving franciscans protested to garcia and his officers about poor treatment of local inhabitants officers promised better treatment of maya in future on 3 august garcia advanced to chunpich but tried to persuade avendano to stay behind to minister to prisoners from b uk te avendano instead split his group and left in secret with just four christian maya companions seeking chunpich kejache that had attacked one of garcia s advance companies and had now retreated into forest he was unable to find kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to itza kingdom he met four exhausted sajkab chen musketeers who were carrying a letter addressed to him from captain fernandez de estenos this letter explained that further south there were various deserted maya towns with only rotten maize abandoned by their occupiers avendano returned to tzuktok and reconsidered his plans franciscans were short of supplies and forcefully congregated maya that they were charged with converting were disappearing back into forest daily additionally spanish officers ignored concerns of friars and garcia was abducting local maya women and children to be taken back to his encomienda for forced labour franciscans set upon a different ultimately unsuccessful plan they would follow road back north to jop elch en near campeche city and attempt to reach itza via tipuj this route was blocked when secular clergy prevented franciscans from attempting it antonio de silva ordered avendano to return to merida and he arrived there on 17 september 1695 other group of franciscans led by juan de san buenaventura chavez continued following roadbuilders into kejache territory through ixb am b atkab and chuntuki modern near carmelita peten san buenaventura among kejache september november 1695 thumb right alt a view

region from el tintal near former spanish mission at chuntuki juan de san buenaventura s small group of franciscans had arrived in chuntuki on 30 august 1695 and found that army had opened road southwards for another seventeen leagues approximately 44 2 miles or 71 1 km almost half way to lake peten itza but returned to chuntuki due to seasonal rains san buenaventura was accompanied by friar joseph de jesus maria lay friar tomas de alcoser and lay brother lucas de san francisco with avendano s return to merida provincial superior antonio de silva despatched two additional friars to join san buenaventura s group diego de echevarria and diego de salas one of these was to convert kejache in tzuktok and other was to do same at chuntuki although initially reluctant to permit group to continue into itza territory by late october garcia de paredes had relented and acquiesced to de silva s instructions for san buenaventura and his original companions to continue to nojpeten although it appears that this never happened on 24 october san buenaventura wrote to provincial superior reporting that warlike kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that itza were ready to receive spanish in friendship on that day 62 kejache men had voluntarily come to chuntuki from pak ek em where another 300 kejache resided san buenaventura sent lay brother lucas de san francisco to convince them to relocate to chuntuki mission lucas de san francisco destroyed idols in pak ek em but inhabitants were not brought to mission because of worries about feeding new arrivals instead in early november 1695 friar tomas de alcoser and brother lucas de san francisco were sent to establish a mission at pak ek em where they were well received by cacique and his pagan priest pak ek em was sufficiently far from new spanish road that it was free from military interference and friars oversaw building of a church in what was largest mission town in kejache territory a second church was built at b atkab to attend to over 100 k refugees who had been gathered there under stewardship of friar diego de echevarria a further church was established at tzuktok overseen by diego de salas avendano s entry from yucatan december 1695 january 1696 franciscan andres de avendano left merida on 13 december 1695 and arrived in nojpeten around 14 january 1696 he followed new road as far as possible then continued towards nojpeten with local maya guides he was accompanied by friars antonio perez de san roman joseph de jesus maria and diego de echevarria and by lay brother lucas de san francisco some of these he collected on his journey south along camino real on 5 january they caught up with and passed main contingent of army at b atkab continuing to chuntuki from chuntuki they followed an indian trail that led them past source of san pedro river and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins which was recorded as tanxulukmul by avendano from tanxulukmul they followed small acte river to a chak an itza town called they arrived at western end of lake peten itza to an enthusiastic welcome by local itza unknown to franciscans northern chak an itza province of itza kingdom was allied with kowoj and was at war with itza king chak an itzas carried off most of gifts that spanish party had brought for itza king in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing following day current aj kan ek travelled across lake with eighty canoes to greet visitors at chak an itza port town of nich on west shore of lake peten itza franciscans returned to nojpeten with kan ek and baptised over 300 itza children over following four days avendano tried to convince kan ek to convert to christianity and surrender to spanish crown without success franciscan friar tried to convince itza king that k atun 8 ajaw a twenty year maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697 was right time for itza to finally embrace christianity and to accept king of spain as overlord king of itza like his forebear cited itza prophecy and said time was not yet right he asked spanish to return in four months at which time itza would convert and swear fealty to king of spain on 19 january ajkowoj king of kowoj arrived at nojpeten and spoke with avendano arguing against acceptance of christianity and spanish rule discussions between avendano kan ek and ajkowoj exposed deep divisions among itza and apparent treachery of itza king in offering his kingdom to spanish undermined kan ek s power over his own people kan ek learnt of a plot by kowoj and their chak an itza allies to ambush and kill franciscans and itza king advised them to return to merida via tipuj itza king s efforts to save his spanish guests effectively ended his power to rule from that point on anti spanish sentiment governed itza responses to spanish franciscans were guided to yalain where they were well received but while they were there yalain heard rumours of battle and a spanish advance towards lake peten itza franciscans were shown a path that led to tipuj but their yalain guides soon abandoned them spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships including death of one of avendano s companions but after a month wandering in forest found their way back to chuntuki and from there made their way back to merida battle at ch ich 2 february 1696 kan ek had sent emissaries to merida in december 1695 to inform martin de ursua that itza would peacefully submit to spanish rule by mid january captain garcia de paredes had advanced from b atkab to advance portion of camino real at chuntuki by now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters with many of his soldiers deserting as force advanced towards lake peten itza they were further delayed by necessity of building an oar powered longboat or piragua to cross san pedro river soon after avendano s flight eastward from nojpeten a group of 60 maya warriors entered chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons they claimed to have been sent by avendano to collect religious regalia and another friar this was not case and they were almost certainly a scouting party sent by kowoj and their chak an itza allies to see what progress spanish army was making along road they spoke with garcia and then rapidly departed without taking any of items that they had supposedly been sent to collect garcia despatched two kejache scouts to lakeshore to discover avendano s whereabouts at same time avendano s kejache guides were returning to chuntuki from nojpeten with news of avendano s flight itzas at lake handed over an open letter written by avendano before his departure from nojpeten as a token of friendship between itza and spanish friar juan de san buenaventura was enthused by letter and wished to travel on to nojpeten himself garcia sent captain pedro de zubiaur his senior officer on towards lake he arrived at lake peten itza with 60 musketeers friar san buenaventura and another franciscan and allied yucatec maya warriors they were also accompanied by about 40 maya porters on 2 february expedition was approached by two itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a guatemalan expedition and itza these two itzas guided party to a nearby itza settlement and letter from avendano was shown to captain zubiaur convincing him that he could advance safely port town of ch ich was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached judged to be as many as 300 by spanish captain bearing perhaps 2 000 itza warriors warriors began to mingle freely with spanish party and began to load spanish supplies into canoes with a promise of transporting expedition across to nojpeten with one soldier in each canoe franciscans readily boarded canoes with two soldiers as an escort a scuffle then broke out a dozen more of spanish party were forced into canoes and two porters were beaten to death one of captured spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated at this point spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets and itza retreated across lake with their prisoners spanish party retreated from lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by about 2 000 itza warriors who attempted to disarm them itzas managed to seize another spaniard and immediately struck off his head at this point about 10 000 itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among lakeside mangroves and zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 itzas realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered spanish retreated towards chuntuki abandoning their captured companions to their fate a christian maya musketeer and six other indians fled at start of battle and took news to garcia that entire expedition had been slaughtered zubiaur and survivors of his expedition marched back into base camp at chuntuki two days later ursua later reported that spanish prisoners were taken back to nojpeten where they were all killed this was also confirmed by ajchan at a later date bones of dead were said to have been found by spanish after final assault on nojpeten in 1697 ajk in kan ek itza high priest later reported that he had bound san buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes and cut out their hearts this turn of events convinced martin de ursua that kan ek would not surrender peacefully and he began to organise an all out assault on nojpeten enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached garcia s camp work on road was redoubled and about a month after battle at ch ich spanish arrived at lakeshore now supported by artillery again a large number of canoes gathered and nervous spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets no casualties were reported among itza who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance amesqueta s entry from verapaz february march 1696 guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between colonial authorities in yucatan and itza in second half of 1695 president barrios began planning another expedition against itza from verapaz following harsh criticism of juan diaz de velasco s retreat from near lake peten itza in april of that year barrios died in november and oidor jose de escals became acting head of guatemalan colonial administration he appointed oidor bartolome de amesqueta to lead next expedition against itza amesqueta marched his men through torrential rain from cahabon to mopan arriving on 25 february 1696 guatemalans were still unaware of clashes between garcia s forces and itza amesqueta s expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies twenty five of his 150 men were sick and his advance stalled as force rested up at mopan captain diaz de velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to lake he was accompanied by dominican friars cristobal de prada and jacinto de vargas he was also accompanied by ajk ixaw itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on diaz s previous expedition who served as a trusted guide scout and translator they set out from mopan on 7 march and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at rio chakal two forces combined giving diaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from verapaz once they arrived at ixb ol near shore of lake peten itza ajk ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to nojpeten amesqueta s attempt to locate diaz de velasco back in mopan amesqueta had received additional supplies and decided to catch up with his advance party he left mopan on 10 march 1696 with friar agustin cano and about 10 soldiers he arrived at chakal a week later but there was still no word from diaz or ajk ixaw on 20 march amesqueta left chakal with 36 men and four days supplies to find diaz s party whom he assumed would be nearby after two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some verapaz porters that diaz had left behind they followed diaz s trail to shore of lake peten itza near to itza capital as they scouted along south shore they were shadowed by about 30 itza canoes and more itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance there were plentiful signs that diaz s party had passed that way and amesqueta assumed that they had crossed to nojpeten he wrote a letter to diaz which was passed to an itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it various itzas now approached party including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with amesqueta during various attempts at communication to verify diaz s whereabouts itza became agitated and responded angrily although no one in spanish party could understand itza language itzas indicated that spanish should proceed to lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in small canoes that were stationed nearby one of amesqueta s officers recognised an indian among itzas as a mopan who had served as a soldier in diaz s first expedition and thought that mopan was trying to tell him not to trust itzas amesqueta was extremely suspicious of small canoes being supplied knowing that itza had 30 man canoes he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among lowland maya to separate and kill spanish intruders he suspected that ajk ixaw had betrayed them and that this was precisely what had happened to diaz and his men as nightfall approached low on rations in a vulnerable location and with no sign of diaz and his men amesqueta retreated from lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby in early hours of morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight using just a few torches they arrived back at chakal on 25 march and from there retreated to san pedro martir on 9 april beset by worsening conditions a hurricane sickness and rumours of enemies battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues approximately 23 4 miles or 37 7 km north of mopan fate of diaz de velasco s expedition writing after fall of nojpeten friar cano described ultimate fate of diaz de velasco and his companions he claimed to have received information from interviews with soldiers from yucatan who had stormed itza capital and from ch ol witnesses although there were no ch ol at nojpeten diaz s party arrived at lakeshore and were told by local itza that franciscan friars were at nojpeten they were wary at first and asked for proof upon which an itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token looking across lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across these were itza dressed in habits of two franciscans who had recently been killed at island diaz and his companions then boarded itza canoes leaving thirty maya porters with their mules and supplies once on lake itza overturned some of canoes and killed some of diaz s men others were wounded and dragged ashore to be killed diaz dominicans and two other men were in a large canoe that was not overturned and were taken to nojpeten where a fierce struggle ensued as diaz attempted to defend himself with his sword killing several itzas two other men were immediately killed while friars were beaten and tied to x shaped crosses before having their hearts cut out across lake itza attacked porters guarding expedition supplies and killed all of them itza killed a total of 87 expedition members including 50 soldiers two dominicans and about 35 maya helpers remains of small group that were killed on nojpeten were later retrieved by spanish after fall of city and were taken back to santiago de los caballeros de guatemala for burial aftermath of amesqueta s entry over following weeks scouts were sent out to try to make contact with local mopan and ch ol communities including chok ajaw ixb ol and manche without success most of natives had fled leaving forest deserted at san pedro martir he received news of ajchan s embassy to merida in december 1695 and formal surrender of itza to spanish authority unable to reconcile news with loss of his men at lake peten itza and with appalling conditions in san pedro martir amesqueta abandoned unfinished fort friar cano recommended to new guatemalan president that ch ol be moved to verapaz where they could be properly administered as a result of failed expedition cano s recommendation was accepted fort was dismantled and any maya that could be captured across a wide swathe of southern peten was forcibly relocated to belen near rabinal in verapaz this relocation was brutal and ruthless and was condemned by several high ranking colonial officials including oidor jose de escals and even by amesqueta fall of nojpeten thumb right upright 1 5 alt map showing lake peten itza extending east west two smaller lakes lie

and soldiers were despatched from campeche to take nojpeten once and for all final assault was made possible by gradual opening of road from merida to peten by december 1696 this road had reached lake shore although it was unfinished and still almost impassable in places by this time deep divisions between political leaders of itza were such that a unified defence of itza kingdom had become

reinforcements to 130 spanish fortified their positions at ch ich and deployed heavy artillery for its defence martin de urzua y arizmendi arrived on western shore of lake peten itza with his soldiers on 26 february 1697 and once there built heavily armed galeota attack boat which was assembled at ch ich over a space of 12 days in early march galeota had a keel of 30 cubits or it had 12 oars on each side and a rudder with an iron screw galeota carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces including a light cannon and four pedreros mortars piragua longboat used to cross san pedro river was also transported to lake to be used in attack on itza capital this boat had 6 oars and a rudder from 28 february onwards spanish expedition was repeatedly approached by hostile itzas who sometimes shot arrows in direction of intruders but inflicted no casualties at same time small groups of curious itzas mingled freely with spanish and received trinkets from them such as belts necklaces and earrings assault on nojpeten on 10 march itza and yalain emissaries arrived at ch ich to negotiate with ursua first came ajchan who had already met him in merida he was followed by chamach xulu ruler of yalain kan ek then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries including itza high priest who offered peaceful surrender ursua received embassy in peace and invited kan ek to visit his encampment three days later on appointed day kan ek failed to arrive instead maya warriors massed both along shore and in canoes upon lake ursua decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of itza into spanish empire were pointless and a assault was launched upon kan ek s capital on morning of 13 march encampment at ch ich was left defended by 25 spanish soldiers three maya musketeers and several artillery pieces ursua boarded galeota with 108 soldiers two secular priests five personal servants baptised itza emissary ajchan and his brother in law and an itza prisoner from nojpeten attack boat was rowed east from ch ich towards itza capital halfway across lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across approach to nojpeten covering about from one shore to another ursua simply gave order to row through them a large number of defenders had gathered along shore of nojpeten and on roofs of city as galeota approached more canoes put out from shore and spanish were surrounded once they had surrounded galeota itza archers began to shoot at invaders ursua gave orders to his men not to fire but arrows wounded several soldiers one of wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point officers lost control of their men defending itza soon fled from withering spanish gunfire city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many itza warriors died spanish suffered only minor casualties spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on island surviving itza abandoned their capital and swam across to mainland with many dying in water after battle surviving defenders melted away into forests leaving spanish to occupy an abandoned maya town martin de ursua planted his standard upon highest point of island and renamed nojpeten as nuestra senora de los remedios y san pablo laguna del itza our lady of remedy and saint paul lake of itza itza nobility fled dispersing to maya settlements throughout peten in response spanish scoured region with search parties kan ek was soon captured with help from yalain maya ruler chamach xulu kowoj king aj kowoj was also soon captured together with other maya nobles and their families with defeat of itza last independent and unconquered native kingdom in americas fell to european colonisers aftermath martin de ursua had little interest in administering newly conquered territory and delegated its control to military officers who he did very little to support either militarily or financially with nojpeten safely in hands of spanish ursua returned to merida leaving kan ek and other high ranking members of his family as prisoners of spanish garrison at nuestra senora de los remedios y san pablo isolated among hostile itza and kowoj who still dominated mainland garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from santiago de los caballeros de guatemala accompanied by mixed race ladino civilians who came to found their own town around military camp settlers brought disease with them which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through indigenous population guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to santiago de los caballeros de guatemala taking captive itza king with them together with his son and two of his cousins cousins died on long journey to santiago ajaw kan ek and his son spent rest of their lives under house arrest in colonial capital when spanish conquered peten lakes in 1697 yalain were initially cooperative and assisted in capture of king of itza at this time yalain was ruled by chamach xulu yalain leadership encouraged christian conversion as a means of maintaining peace with occupying spanish forces as time went on yalain cooperation with spanish appears to have decreased soon after conquest yalain fled their settlements to avoid foraging spanish parties that were abducting maya women for service at their barracks at this time such was hostility that was felt towards occupying forces that inhabitants of yalain settlements preferred to burn their fields and break all their pottery rather than leave anything for spanish yalain capital is recorded as having been burned in 1698 final years of conquest in late 17th century small population of ch ol maya in southern peten and belize was forcibly removed to alta verapaz where people were absorbed into q eqchi population after conquest colonial administration of peten was divided between ecclesiastical authorities in yucatan and secular administration as part of captaincy general of guatemala there was never a strong spanish presence in area which remained remote although spanish built a fortress prison castillo de it was finished in 1700 distance from nuestra senora de los remedios y san pablo formerly nojpeten to merida combined with difficult terrain and hostility of natives led to road from yucatan falling into a state of disrepair in 1701 ursua y realised that road was in such a poor state that spanish garrison could not be supplied from yucatan he wrote to king of spain requesting that peten be transferred from jurisdiction of yucatan to audiencia real of guatemala in 1703 ursua s petition was granted with condition that ecclesiastical authority over peten would pass to dominican order between 1703 and 1753 reducciones were established at san jose and san andres on lake peten itza santa ana just south of lake and at san luis santo toribio and dolores in south not to be confused with dolores del lakandon each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to general with spanish garrison at nuestra senora de los remedios y san pablo in first decades of 18th century churches were built in five colonial towns dolores remedios san andres san jose and santo toribio church in dolores was built in 1708 construction was probably overseen by juan antonio ruiz y bustamante in 1699 there were nine priests in peten but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial peten in spite of objections of dominicans who had been working in southern peten franciscans continued to provide clergy from yucatan and it was franciscans who oversaw spiritual welfare of peten during colonial period was one of lords of northern chak an itza province of conquered itza kingdom friar avendano had met him during his expedition to nojpeten after conquest he relocated from north shore of lake peten itza to mompana a region lying between lake yaxha and classic period ruins of tikal for some years after conquest he established mompana region as a refuge from spanish and engaged in internecine war against surviving kowoj to south reductions around lake peten itza at time of fall of nojpeten there are estimated to have been 60 000 maya living around lake peten itza including a large number of refugees from other areas it is estimated that 88 of them died during first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war although disease was responsible for majority of deaths spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part catholic priests from yucatan founded several mission towns around lake peten itza in 1702 1703 first towns to be concentrated into colonial reducciones were ixtutz which became new town of san jose and neighbouring san andres both on north shore of lake peten itza they were first subjugated by one of ursua s officers cristobal de before being passed into care of dominican friars for christian conversion of inhabitants surviving itza and kowoj were resettled in new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force kowoj and itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook nojpeten but although well planned rebellion was quickly crushed its leaders were executed and most of mission towns were abandoned by 1708 only about 6 000 maya remained in central peten reductions failed in large part because missionaries charged with converting inhabitants could not speak itza language legacy of conquest martin de ursua used his conquest of itza as a stepping stone to achieving coveted post of governor general of philippines which he took up in 1709 european introduced diseases devastated native population of peten with effects of disease compounded by psychological impact of defeat population around lake peten itza numbered between 20 000 and 40 000 in 1697 by 1714 a census recorded just over 3 000 individuals in spanish peten including non indians this number would not have included so called wild maya living in forest far from spanish administration and control by 1700 new colonial capital of peten was mainly inhabited by colonists soldiers and convicts during second half of 18th century adult male indians were heavily taxed often being forced into debt peonage western peten and neighbouring chiapas remained sparsely populated and maya inhabitants avoided contact with spanish san jose on northwest shore of lake peten itza is home of last surviving speakers of itza language surname kowoj still survives but kowoj and itza have fully merged and no longer exist as separate ethnicities in modern times there is a history of conflict between san jose former itza town of chakok ot and neighbouring san andres former kowoj allied town of chak an and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between itza and kowoj historical sources thumb right upright page 13 alt page in antiquated typeface with archaic spanish text reading title page of historia de la conquista de la
