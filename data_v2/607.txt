from outset and fire ayres s death and funeral and fundraising for and erection of memorial were all reported in detail in local and national press and throughout british empire a secular canonisation british government had traditionally paid little attention to poor but in wake of industrial revolution attitudes towards accomplishments of lower classes were changing growth of railways mechanisation of agriculture and need for labour in new inner city factories had broken traditional feudal economy and caused rapid growth of cities while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in media and current affairs among ordinary workers in 1856 first military honour for bravery open to all ranks victoria cross had been instituted while in 1866 albert medal first official honour open to civilians of all classes was introduced additionally a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving most prominently royal humane society 1776 and royal national lifeboat institution 1824 were increasing in activity and prominence and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice painter and sculptor george frederic watts and his second wife designer and artist mary fraser tytler had long been advocates of idea of art as a force for social change and of principle that narratives of great deeds would provide guidance to address serious social problems of british cities watts had recently painted a series of portraits of leading figures he considered to be a positive social influence hall of fame which was donated to national portrait gallery sandy nairne in since at least 1866 he had proposed as a companion piece a monument to unknown worth celebrating bravery of ordinary people on 5 september 1887 a letter was published in times from watts proposing a scheme to commemorate golden jubilee of queen victoria by means of collecting and commemorating a complete record of stories of heroism in every day life he cited death of alice ayres as an example of type of event he proposed to commemorate and included in his letter a distorted account of ayres s actions during union street fire watts had originally proposed that monument take form of a colossal bronze figure but by 1887 was proposing that memorial take form of a kind of campo santo consisting of a covered way and marble wall inscribed with names of everyday heroes to be built in hyde park watts s suggestion was not taken up leading watts to comment that if i had proposed a race course round hyde park there would have been plenty of sympathisers however his high profile lobbying further raised already high public awareness of death of alice ayres depiction in literature and art emilia aylmer blake wrote perhaps first poem about ayres titled alice ayres which she recited at a social gathering in june 1885 sir francis hastings doyle also wrote a well received poem in honour of ayres as did leading social reformer and women s rights campaigner laura ormiston chant by late 1880s ayres was coming to be seen as a model of british devotion to duty and her story was told in collections of heroic and inspirational stories for children including as first story in f j cross s influential beneath banner in which cross remarked that she had tried to do her best always her loving tenderness to children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was any thought of her dying a heroic death so when great trial came she was prepared and what seems to us

proposals panels depicted instances of heroism in everyday life watts himself refused to become involved in project as his proposed monument was intended to be a source of inspiration and contemplation as opposed to simply commemoration and he felt that an artistic work would potentially distract viewers from most important element of cases heroic sacrifices of individuals involved

approach building by depicting ayres with fireman and sailor widely seen as symbols of british heroism and british strength crane s picture further enhanced her growing reputation as a heroic figure crane s picture in red cross hall was itself mentioned in alice ayres a border ballad by national trust founder canon hardwicke rawnsley published in his 1896 ballads of brave deeds for which george frederic watts wrote preface memorial to heroic self sacrifice in 1898 george frederic watts was approached by henry gamble vicar of st botolph s church in city of london st botolph s former churchyard had recently been converted along with two smaller adjoining burial grounds into postman s park one of largest public parks in city of london and church was engaged in a protracted financial and legal dispute over ownership of part of park to provide a public justification for keeping disputed land as part of park and to raise park s profile and assist in fundraising church offered part of park as a site for his proposed memorial watts agreed and in 1900 memorial to heroic self sacrifice was unveiled by alfred newton lord mayor of london and mandell creighton bishop of

bricklayer s labourer who by intrepid conduct saved 3 children from a burning house in union street borough at cost of her own young life april 24 1885 changing attitudes and differing perceptions although public would have been familiar with concept of a female national heroic figure following widespread coverage and public admiration of harriet newell grace darling and florence nightingale ongoing coverage of ayres and her elevation as a national hero was unusual for period ayres was an uneducated working class woman who after her death underwent what has been described as a secular canonisation at a time when despite gradual formal recognition of contributions of lower classes national heroes were generally male and engaged in exploration military religion or science and engineering this was a period in which political pressures for social reform were growing version of ayres presented to public as a woman devoted entirely to duty embodied idealised british character at time while image of a hard working but uncomplaining woman who set welfare of others above her own embodied idealised vision of working class presented by social reformers and ideal selfless and dedicated woman presented by campaigners for women s rights at unveiling of memorial to heroic self sacrifice lord mayor alfred newton had remarked that it was intended to perpetuate acts of heroism which belonged to working classes while george frederic watts although he was opposed in principle to discrimination based on class and saw memorial as being theoretically open to all classes had remarked that higher classes do not or ought not to require reminders or inducements watts saw purpose of his memorial not as a commemoration of deeds but as a tool for education of lower classes watts s view was shared by others who sought to provide inspirational material on british heroes and authors writing about ayres systematically altered fact that children rescued were members of her family instead describing them as children of her employer press reports at time of fire described ayres variously as a little nursemaid a willing honest hard working servant and a poor little domestic as well as watts s 1887 description of ayres as maid of all work at an s cross s chapter on ayres in beneath banner is titled only a nurse girl while rawnsley called her nursemaid in household barrington writing five years after fire at unveiling of price s panel acknowledges in a footnote that ayres was related to chandlers but nonetheless describes her as displaying typical english virtues courage fortitude and an unquestioning sense of duty while george and mary watts and their fellow social reformers along with broadly sympathetic mainstream british press portrayed ayres as an inspirational selfless servant to her employer others had a different view left wing reynolds s weekly newspaper complained that lack of support for ayres s family from state was symbolic of poor treatment of workers as a whole pioneering feminist periodical englishwoman s review described their righteous pride at ayres s instinctive motherhood on other hand young england an imperialist children s story paper said that there is no sex in self sacrifice lauding ayres as a model of devotion to duty later years right thumb 180px ayres street alt a long narrow deserted street
