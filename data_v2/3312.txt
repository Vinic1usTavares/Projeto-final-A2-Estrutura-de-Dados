2001 north indian ocean cyclone season was fairly quiet although activity was evenly spread between arabian sea and bay of bengal there were six depressions tracked by india meteorological department imd which is official regional specialized meteorological center for northern indian ocean agency also tracked four cyclonic storms which have maximum winds of at least 65 km h 40 mph sustained over 3 minutes american based joint typhoon warning center jtwc tracked an additional storm tropical storm vamei which crossed over from south china sea at a record low latitude first storm originated on may 21 and became strongest recorded storm in arabian sea at time imd estimated peak 3 minute winds of 215 km h 135 mph while storm was off west coast of india storm weakened greatly before making landfall in gujarat and although impact on land was minor it left up to 950 fishermen missing a few weeks later first bay of bengal system originated a short lived depression that dropped heavy rainfall upon striking odisha after a period of inactivity during monsoon season there were cyclonic storms in september and october in northern arabian sea both lasted only a few days and dissipated due to unfavorable wind shear another cyclonic storm formed in bay of bengal and struck andhra pradesh which dropped heavy rainfall that was equivalent to 300 of average october precipitation total rains caused flooding particularly in cuddapah where a dam was deliberately opened and inundated town overnight there were 153 deaths due to storm and rs5 billion indian rupees us 104 million in damage final storm of season tracked by imd was a short lived depression in november in bay of bengal toc season summary india meteorological department imd in new delhi official regional specialized meteorological center for northern indian ocean as recognized by world meteorological organization issued warnings for tropical cyclones developing in region basin s activity is sub divided between arabian sea and bay of bengal on opposite coasts of india and is generally split before and after monsoon season imd utilized satellite imagery to track storms and used dvorak technique to estimate intensity toward end of year convection was generally lower than normal in bay of bengal despite being a typical hotspot for activity there were no deaths or damage throughout year outside of india and damage there was lower than what occurred in previous few seasons systems extremely severe cyclonic storm arb 01 first storm of season originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of somalia on may 18 over following few days system gradually organized becoming a depression on may 21 it moved eastward toward coastline of southwestern india and rapidly intensified on may 22 strengthening from a deep depression to a very severe cyclonic storm within 24 hours after approaching coastline storm turned to north and northwest away from land due to a ridge based on well defined eye and storm s satellite presentation imd estimated peak winds of 215 km h 135 mph on may 24 and jtwc estimated 1 minute winds of 205 km h 125 mph it became strongest storm on record in arabian sea only to be surpassed by cyclone gonu in 2007 soon after reaching peak intensity cyclone rapidly weakened as it turned northward by may 28 it had deteriorated into a deep depression and imd downgraded storm to a remnant low before circulation reached gujarat coast ahead of storm all ports in gujarat including kandla one of largest in country were closed as a precautionary measure over 10 000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in threatened region offshore between 1 500 and 2 000 fishing vessels lost contact with mainland immediately after storm however because storm remained offshore coast only experienced minor damage although rainfall was widespread about 200 houses were washed away in and one person died in about 950 fishermen were missing after storm which prompted a helicopter search cyclonic storm arb 02 an upper level disturbance spawned a low pressure area in eastern arabian sea on september 24 it initially consisted of a well defined circulation on eastern edge of an area of convection about 370 km 230 mi west southwest of mumbai with low wind shear beneath subtropical ridge system gradually organized and developed curved banding features while moving west northwestward at 0900 utc on september 24 imd classified system as a depression and nine hours later upgraded it further to a deep depression on same day jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert although they did not begin advisories due to center being on east side of convection at 0900 utc on september 25 imd upgraded system to a cyclonic storm estimating peak winds of 65 km h 40 mph early on september 26 circulation moved beneath convection prompting jtwc to begin advisories on tropical cyclone 02a around that time storm s outskirts dropped light rainfall in western india forecasters initially anticipated that storm would strengthen to winds of 95 km h 60 mph and strike southern arabian peninsula however persistent wind shear dislocated circulation from convection and imparted weakening imd downgraded storm to a deep depression and later depression on september 27 by which time thunderstorms were rapidly dwindling jtwc issued their last advisory on september 28 after circulation had no nearby convection at that time storm was located 185 km 115 mi east southeast of masirah island off oman imd also downgraded depression to a low pressure area on september 28 and noted that remnant system became poorly defined following day cyclonic storm arb 03 similar to previous storm an area of convection formed in arabian sea about 185 km 115 mi west southwest of mumbai on october 7 it was associated with a circulation that moved westward from indian coast which formed as a well defined low pressure area over western india convection organized and increased aided by low wind shear and good outflow late on october 8 imd classified system as a depression and early next day upgraded it to a deep depression a low level circulation formed beneath a well defined mid level storm with intense convection and strong winds north of center at 06 00 utc on october 9 jtwc began classifying system as tropical cyclone 03a with increasing banding features storm strengthened while moving west northwestward steered by a ridge to north at 09 00 utc that day imd upgraded system to a cyclonic storm estimating peak winds of 65 km h 40 mph soon thereafter storm began weakening due to increased dry air and upper level environment becoming unfavorable thunderstorms diminished and disappeared over circulation by october 10 that day jtwc discontinued advisories and imd downgraded it to a remnant low pressure area south of pakistan storm brushed indian coast with rainfall reaching in gujarat state although there was no major damage cyclonic storm bob 01 early on october 14 a low pressure area formed off eastern coast of india while moving generally westward system quickly organized into a depression that day on october 15 imd estimated peak winds of 65 km h 40 mph based on satellite imagery appearance warranting a dvorak rating of 2 5 this made it a cyclonic storm however circulation remained removed from deep convection early on november 16 storm made landfall near nellore andhra pradesh it quickly weakened over land degenerating into a remnant low pressure area over on october 17 while moving ashore storm dropped heavy rainfall in andhra pradesh and extending into tamil nadu causing flooding in some areas for first time in 40 years in a 24 hour period recorded of precipitation and 13 stations recorded daily totals of over 100 mm 4 in highest two day rainfall total was and some areas received 300 of average october rainfall within 36 hours damage was heaviest in andhra pradesh particularly in nellore and kadapa although floods also extended into bihar several regional roads and rail lines were damaged including portions of national highway 5 which stranded hundreds of trucks routes were reopened within two weeks rains breached 1 635 water tanks while of crop fields mostly rice and groundnuts were impaired about 1 000 head of cattle were killed as well in cuddapah excess water was released from irrigation dams along river water levels rose in middle of night catching residents off guard and damaging 18 244 houses dam was also breached in nellore and many towns in region were inundated or isolated for two days across state storm damaged 55 747 houses accounting for rs5 billion indian rupees us 104 million in losses there were 153 deaths related to floods and storm mostly in cuddapah following storm indian red cross society used funds related to previous floods and an earthquake to help 2 000 families after floods indian government provided food and housing to 61 681 residents in 130 shelters and distributed 20 kg of rice to each household army flew helicopters to drop off food candles and kerosene to stranded families in cuddapah stagnant waters were disinfected after floods and deceased cattle were burned to reduce infection other systems right thumb satellite image of november depression east of india for several days in june jtwc monitored a disturbance in northern bay of bengal for potential development associated with southwest monsoon on june 9 a low pressure area formed and it became well defined by june 11 by that time there was convection located west of an exposed circulation early on following day imd classified it as a depression estimating peak winds of 45 km h 30 mph strong wind shear prevented much development shortly after forming system moved northwestward and made landfall near paradip odisha it quickly weakened below depression intensity on june 13 while progressing inland degenerating into a remnant low near madhya pradesh on june 15 system dropped heavy rainfall along its path with a daily peak of in vidarbha on november 7 a cycling area of convection was persistent off east coast of india associated with a broad circulation embedded within a trough thunderstorms expanded and gradually organized aided by good outflow and low wind shear on november 11 imd upgraded system to a depression off coast of tamil nadu and andhra pradesh on same day jtwc began classifying depression as tropical cyclone 04b located within a weakness of ridge depression moved slowly to north and northeast and was initially expected to move ashore however increasing shear removed convection from center and storm remained offshore while weakening on november 12 imd downgraded system back to a low pressure area storm brought rainfall to coastal portions of eastern india peaking at in paradip near equator tropical storm vamei crossed sumatra from south china sea at end of december according to japan meteorological agency official agency covering western pacific ocean storm weakened into a remnant low on december 28 along east coast of sumatra on next day remnants entered bay of bengal and thunderstorms soon reformed over circulation due to weak to moderate wind shear after remnants of vamei regenerated jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 05b on december 30 although agency later treated it as a continuation of original storm moving west northwest storm re intensified to a secondary peak of 65 km h 40 mph however an increase in wind shear left circulation center exposed vamei quickly weakened dissipating early on january 1 2002 imd never tracked storm see also list of notable tropical cyclones 2001 atlantic hurricane season 2001 pacific hurricane season 2001 pacific typhoon season south west indian
