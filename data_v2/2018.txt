us 666 with 666 designation this road was nicknamed devil s highway because of significance of number 666 to many christian denominations which is believed by some that 666 is number of beast this satanic connotation combined with a high fatality rate along new mexico portion convinced some people highway was cursed problem was compounded by persistent sign theft these factors led to two efforts to renumber highway first by officials in arizona later in new mexico there have been safety improvement projects in recent years and fatality rates have subsequently decreased highway now a spur route of us 91 via its connection to us 191 runs through colorado new mexico and utah as well as tribal nations of navajo nation and ute mountain ute tribe highway passes by two mountains

thumb left abajo mountains near monticello alt snow covered mountains protruding from a plain with tilled soil in foreground before mexican american war when this area was ceded to united states main trade route through this part of mexico was old spanish trail this trail extended from santa fe new mexico to los angeles trail had multiple routes however main route proceeded north towards moab utah one of few places where colorado river can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs modern us 491 roughly correlates with main route of old spanish trail between cortez colorado and its northern terminus before 1926 all of modern us 491 existed as state routes in new mexico us 666 absorbed a portion of state road 32 nm 32 from gallup to shiprock and completely replaced nm 121 from shiprock to colorado state line portion in colorado was numbered state highway 108 sh 108 from new mexico state line to cortez and sh 10 from cortez to utah at time sh 10 traversed southern portion of colorado while most of this route was absorbed by u s highway system a portion of it still exists in utah route was originally numbered state route 9 sr 9 which also included what is now us 191 from monticello to crescent junction utah has since re used sr 9 designation for a different road u s route 666 thumb right old and new route number at intersection with us 191 in monticello alt sign assembly with 4 signs top left old us 666 top right new us 491 bottom left north us 191 straight ahead bottom right us 491 right turn route was upgraded to a u s highway in 1926 as u s route 666 this number was appropriate and in accordance with road numbering guidelines for u s highways being sixth spur along highway s parent highway famed cross continental highway u s route 66 from which us 491 breaks around gallup new mexico this number was assigned by american association of state highway officials aasho a coordinating body that created u s highway system at that time northern terminus of route was in cortez at an intersection with then us 450 modern us 160 over time route became known as devil s highway a reference to number of beast this nickname and association made some visitors uncomfortable as well as making signs targets for theft because of highway s number accidents and other phenomena became repeated as legend these legends convinced some people highway was cursed one unnamed highway patrol officer was quoted in usa today as stating a drunk driving suspect told him triple 6 is evil everyone dies on that highway skeptics point out that highway has a lower than average fatality rate in utah and colorado only new mexico portion is statistically a dangerous highway skeptics further state high fatality rate in new mexico can be explained by an inadequate design for traffic loads at time several people suggested that highway improvements started at same time as renumbering have done more to reduce fatalities than renumbering itself curse of us 666 is briefly discussed in jonathan d rosenblum s book copper crucible which investigates arizona copper mine strike of 1983 this strike occurred along highway near morenci arizona highway was used as a plot element in films and television including route 666 natural born killers and repo man as well as a two part episode of series married with children titled route 666 these pieces are not accurate in portraying route for example one depicts route in nevada extensions into arizona and utah by 1942 southern terminus of route was extended to douglas arizona at mexican border it ran concurrent with us 66 for 30 miles 48 3 km before turn south arizona portion of highway is known as coronado trail scenic byway as it approximated path of spanish explorer francisco vasquez de coronado this portion is noted for mountainous terrain with hairpin turns and steep grades that reaches an altitude of over curves force a speed limit of in spots thumb left 100px us 491 was originally us 666 alt us 666 shield in 1970 several u s highways in four corners region were re aligned as part of this change us 160 was rerouted west of cortez to serve four corners monument and enter arizona instead of utah us 666 was extended up part of old route of us 160 to monticello utah at an intersection with then us 163 now us 191 in 1985 utah department of transportation petitioned to extend us 666 northwest to richfield but proposal was rejected proposed extension followed sr 95 sr 24 and sr 119 a concurrency with us 191 would have been routed through blanding and monticello to connect to rest of route one of reasons cited for rejecting proposal was that portions of sr 24 were not built to standards desired for additions to u s highway system elimination and renumbering of us 666 thumb shiprock a sacred mountain to navajo people is accessed via us 491 alt solid rock spire protruding from desert in 1985 us 66 designation was eliminated leaving us 666 and other routes as orphans this fact would be used as a supporting factor in later petitions to renumber highway in 1992 part in arizona was renumbered as an extension of us 191 this truncated us 666 again at gallup new mexico now at i 40 route in other three states became u s route 491 in 2003 mainly through efforts of new mexico governor bill richardson he requested change due to infamy brought by inopportune naming of road while campaigning for governor richardson promised to renumber highway as part of a larger plan to improve highway and build relations between new mexico and navajo nation although traditional navajo culture does not share belief of 666 being an evil number some navajos had attempted for years to change number as a way to raise awareness about dangerous highway highway had largely been ignored with few improvements made since it was first paved by 1997 us 666 was named one of 20 most dangerous highways in united states some navajo leaders were concerned that efforts to reduce poverty on navajo lands via promoting tourism and outside investment were being hampered by christian aversion to number in new mexico s motion to renumber highway they selected u s route 393 since route came nowhere near us 93 aashto instead suggested us 491 noting it as a branch of us 191 at monticello utah although next three digit child of us 91 would have been u s route 291 both 291 and 391 designations were already in use as state route numbers in at least one of affected states at news that motion had passed a new mexico spokesperson stated devil s out of here and we say goodbye and good riddance referring to motion passing with a different number from what new mexico requested another spokesperson responded as long as it s not 666 and it s nothing satanic that s ok us 666 officially ceased to exist on may 31 2003 although temporary new 491 old 666 signs were posted after change to aid travelers using old maps thumb ute mountain in southwest colorado is sacred mountain and namesake of ute mountain ute tribe alt mountain range with one prominent peak in center left of photograph although sign theft has always been a problem along this highway thefts reached epidemic proportions when pending number change was announced within days of announcement virtually every us 666 sign had been stolen some for sale on ebay officials in utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen while new mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts as a theft deterrent had been stolen officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into sign post to break welds dedication of new highway was postponed until july 30 2003 to coincide with start of construction projects to improve safety on highway at dedication george blue horse a navajo medicine man performed a ceremony to remove curse from highway in navajo language he stated road itself never ends it goes on generation to generation new number is a good one new road will be a medicine newspapers and television stations interviewed people along route about their opinions on changing of highway s number even some people who believed in 666 curse disagreed with change one went on record as stating highway officials are messing with wrong guy they re making devil mad they should have left 666 alone others were more sarcastic one monticello resident stated we ll really miss all stopping and taking pictures of route 666 sign most residents took pride in living along devil s highway and opposed change some commented that no matter number they would still call road devil s highway post renumbering since renumbering in 2003 portions of us 491 in new mexico have been upgraded to a four lane divided highway with grade separations at busiest interchanges new mexico department of transportation has noted that as sections are upgraded fatality rates improve on four lane portions but remain high on two lane portions as construction has proceeded most dangerous portions of highway have moved to points where four lane portion ends and traffic merges to two lanes this has caused department to coordinate phases of upgrades to minimize number of two lane four lane transitions construction on final phase was originally scheduled to begin january 2008 however state applied for american recovery and reinvestment act funds to finish project and completion was delayed until 2012 major intersections note utah mileposts are posted in a west to east direction while colorado s and new mexico s mileposts are posted in a south to north direction
