thumb upright 1 5 solitary predator a polar bear feeds on a bearded seal it has killed thumb upright 1 5 social predators meat ants cooperate to feed on a cicada far larger than themselves predation is a biological interaction where one organism predator kills and eats another organism its prey it is one of a family of common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and which usually do not kill host and parasitoidism which always does eventually it is distinct from scavenging on dead prey though many predators also scavenge it overlaps with herbivory as a seed predator is both a predator and a herbivore predators may actively search for prey or sit and wait for it when prey is detected predator assesses whether to attack it this may involve ambush or pursuit predation sometimes after stalking prey if attack is successful predator kills prey removes any inedible parts like shell or spines and eats it predators are adapted and often highly specialized for hunting with acute senses such as vision hearing or smell many predatory animals both vertebrate and invertebrate have sharp claws or jaws to grip kill and cut up their prey other adaptations include stealth and aggressive mimicry that improve hunting efficiency predation has a powerful selective effect on prey and prey develop antipredator adaptations such as warning coloration alarm calls and other signals camouflage mimicry of well defended species and defensive spines and chemicals sometimes predator and prey find themselves in an evolutionary arms race a cycle of adaptations and counter adaptations predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least cambrian period definition thumb upright left spider wasps paralyse and eventually kill their hosts but are considered parasitoids not predators at most basic level predators kill and eat other organisms however concept of predation is broad defined differently in different contexts and includes a wide variety of feeding methods and some relationships that result in prey s death are not generally called predation a parasitoid such as an ichneumon wasp lays its eggs in or on its host eggs hatch into larvae which eat host and it inevitably dies zoologists generally call this a form of parasitism though conventionally parasites are thought not to kill their hosts a predator can be defined to differ from a parasitoid in two ways it kills its prey immediately and it has many prey captured over its lifetime where a parasitoid s larva has just one or at least has its food supply provisioned for it on just one occasion thumb upright 1 5 relation of predation to other feeding strategies there are other difficult and borderline cases are small animals that like predators feed entirely on other organisms they include fleas and mosquitoes that consume blood from living animals and aphids that consume sap from living plants however since they typically do not kill their hosts they are now often thought of as parasites animals that graze on phytoplankton or mats of microbes are predators as they consume and kill their food organisms but herbivores that browse leaves are not as their food plants usually survive assault however when animals eat seeds seed predation or granivory or eggs egg predation they are consuming entire living organisms which by definition makes them predators albeit unconventional ones for instance a mouse that eats grass seeds has no adaptations for tracking catching and subduing prey and its teeth are not adapted to slicing through flesh scavengers organisms that only eat organisms found already dead are not predators but many predators such as jackal and hyena scavenge when opportunity arises among invertebrates social wasps yellowjackets are both hunters and scavengers of other insects taxonomic range while examples of predators among mammals and birds are well known predators can be found in a broad range of taxa they are common among insects including mantids dragonflies lacewings and scorpionflies in some species such as alderfly only larvae are predatory adults do not eat spiders are predatory as well as other terrestrial invertebrates such as scorpions centipedes some mites snails and slugs nematodes and worms in marine environments most cnidarians e g jellyfish ctenophora comb jellies echinoderms e g sea stars sea urchins sand dollars and sea cucumbers and flatworms are predatory among crustaceans lobsters crabs shrimps and barnacles are predators and in turn crustaceans are preyed on by nearly all cephalopods including octopuses squid and cuttlefish thumb paramecium a predatory ciliate feeding on bacteria seed predation is restricted to mammals birds and insects and is found in almost all terrestrial ecosystems egg predation includes both specialist egg predators such as some colubrid snakes and generalists such as foxes and badgers that opportunistically take eggs when they find them some plants like pitcher plant venus fly trap and sundew are carnivorous and consume insects some carnivorous fungi catch nematodes using either active traps in form of constricting rings or passive traps with adhesive structures many species of protozoa eukaryotes and bacteria prokaryotes prey on other microorganisms feeding mode is evidently ancient and evolved many times in both groups among freshwater and marine zooplankton whether single celled or multi cellular predatory grazing on phytoplankton and smaller zooplankton is common and found in many species of dinoflagellates ciliates rotifers a diverse range of animal larvae and two groups of crustaceans namely copepods and summarizes findings from many authors foraging thumb upright 1 8 a basic foraging cycle for a predator with some variations indicated to feed a predator must search for pursue and kill its prey these actions form a foraging cycle predator must decide where to look for prey based on its geographical distribution and once it has located prey it must assess whether to pursue it or to wait for a better choice if it chooses pursuit its physical capabilities determine mode of pursuit e g ambush or chase having captured prey it may also need to expend energy handling it e g killing it removing any shell or spines and ingesting it search predators have a choice of search modes ranging from sit and wait to active or widely foraging sit and wait method is most suitable if prey are dense and mobile and predator has low energy requirements wide foraging expends more energy and is used when prey is sedentary or sparsely distributed there is a continuum of search modes with intervals between periods of movement ranging from seconds to months sharks sunfish insectivorous birds and shrews are almost always moving while web building spiders aquatic invertebrates praying mantises and kestrels rarely move in between plovers and other shorebirds freshwater fish including and larvae of beetles ladybirds alternate between actively searching and scanning environment thumb left black browed albatross regularly flies hundreds of kilometres across nearly empty ocean to find patches of food prey distributions are often clumped and predators respond by looking for patches where prey is dense and then searching within patches where food is found in patches such as rare shoals of fish in a nearly empty ocean search stage requires predator to travel for a substantial time and to expend a significant amount of energy to locate each food patch for example black browed albatross regularly makes foraging flights to a range of around up to a maximum foraging range of for breeding birds gathering food for their young with static prey some predators can learn suitable patch locations and return to them at intervals to feed optimal foraging strategy for search has been modelled using marginal value theorem search patterns often appear random one such is levy walk that tends to involve clusters of short steps with occasional long steps it is a good fit to behaviour of a wide variety of organisms including bacteria honeybees sharks and human hunter gatherers assessment thumb seven spot ladybirds select plants of good quality for their aphid prey having found prey a predator must decide whether to pursue it or keep searching decision depends on costs and benefits involved a bird foraging for insects spends a lot of time searching but capturing and eating them is quick and easy so efficient strategy for bird is to eat every palatable insect it finds by contrast a predator such as a lion or falcon finds its prey easily but capturing it requires a lot of effort in that case predator is more selective one of factors to consider is size prey that is too small may not be worth trouble for amount of energy it provides too large and it may be too difficult to capture for example a mantid captures prey with its forelegs and they are optimized for grabbing prey of a certain size mantids are reluctant to attack prey that is far from that size there is a positive correlation between size of a predator and its prey a predator may also assess a patch and decide whether to spend time searching for prey in it this may involve some knowledge of preferences of prey for example ladybirds can choose a patch of vegetation suitable for their aphid prey capture to capture prey predators have a spectrum of pursuit modes that range from overt chase pursuit predation to a sudden strike on nearby prey ambush predation another strategy in between ambush and pursuit is ballistic interception where a predator observes and predicts a prey s motion and then launches its attack accordingly ambush ambush or sit and wait predators are carnivorous animals that capture prey by stealth or surprise in animals ambush predation is characterized by predator s scanning environment from a concealed position until a prey is spotted and then rapidly executing a fixed surprise attack vertebrate ambush predators include frogs fish such as angel shark northern pike and eastern frogfish among many invertebrate ambush predators are trapdoor spiders on land and mantis shrimps in sea ambush predators often construct a burrow in which to hide improving concealment at cost of reducing their field of vision some ambush predators also use lures to attract prey within striking range capturing movement has to be rapid to trap prey given that attack is not modifiable once launched ballistic interception thumb chameleon attacks prey by shooting out its tongue ballistic interception is strategy where a predator observes movement of a prey predicts its motion works out an interception path and then attacks prey on that path this differs from ambush predation in that predator adjusts its attack according to how prey is moving ballistic interception involves a brief period for planning giving prey an opportunity to escape some frogs wait until snakes have begun their strike before jumping reducing time available to snake to its attack and maximising angular adjustment that snake would need to make to intercept frog in real time ballistic predators include insects such as dragonflies and vertebrates such as archerfish attacking with a jet of water chameleons attacking with their tongues and some colubrid snakes pursuit in pursuit predation predators chase fleeing prey if prey flees in a straight line capture depends only on predator s being faster than prey if prey manoeuvres by turning as it flees predator must react in real time to calculate and follow a new intercept path such as by parallel navigation as it closes on prey many pursuit predators use camouflage to approach prey as close as possible unobserved stalking before starting pursuit pursuit predators include terrestrial mammals such as lions cheetahs and wolves marine predators such as dolphins and many predatory fishes such as tuna predatory birds raptors such as falcons and insects such as dragonflies an extreme form of pursuit is endurance or persistence hunting in which predator tires out prey by following it over a long distance sometimes for hours at a time method is used by human hunter gatherers and in canids such as african wild dogs and domestic hounds african wild dog is an extreme persistence predator tiring out individual prey by following them for many miles at relatively low speed compared for example to cheetah s brief high speed pursuit a specialised form of pursuit predation is lunge feeding of baleen whales these very large marine predators feed on plankton especially krill diving and actively swimming into concentrations of plankton and then taking a huge gulp of water and filtering it through their feathery baleen plates pursuit predators may be social like lion and wolf that hunt in groups or solitary like cheetah handling once predator has captured prey it has to handle it very carefully if prey is dangerous to eat such as if it possesses sharp or poisonous spines as in many prey fish some catfish such as have spines on back dorsal and belly pectoral which lock in erect position as catfish thrashes about when captured these could pierce predator s mouth possibly fatally some fish eating birds like osprey avoid danger of spines by tearing up their prey before eating it solitary versus social predation in social predation a group of predators cooperates to kill prey this makes it possible to kill creatures larger than those they could overpower singly for example hyenas and wolves collaborate to catch and kill herbivores as large as buffalo and lions even hunt elephants it can also make prey more readily available through strategies like flushing of prey and herding it into a smaller area for example when mixed flocks of birds forage birds in front flush out insects that are caught by birds behind spinner dolphins form a circle around a school of fish and move inwards concentrating fish by a factor of 200 by hunting socially chimpanzees can catch colobus monkeys that would readily escape an individual hunter while cooperating harris hawks can trap rabbits thumb upright 2 3 center wolves social predators cooperate to hunt and kill bison predators of different species sometimes cooperate to catch prey in coral reefs when fish such as grouper and coral trout spot prey that is inaccessible to them they signal to giant moray eels napoleon wrasses or octopuses these predators are able to access small crevices and flush out prey killer whales have been known to help whalers hunt baleen whales isbn r 9 social hunting allows predators to tackle a wider range of prey but at risk of competition for captured food solitary predators have more chance of eating what they catch at price of increased expenditure of energy to catch it and increased risk that prey will escape ambush predators are often solitary to reduce risk of becoming prey themselves of 245 terrestrial carnivores 177 are solitary and 35 of 37 wild cats are solitary including cougar and cheetah however solitary cougar does allow other cougars to share in a kill and coyote can be either solitary or social other solitary predators include northern pike wolf spiders and all thousands of species of solitary wasps among arthropods and many microorganisms and zooplankton specialization physical adaptations under pressure of natural selection predators have evolved a variety of physical adaptations for detecting catching killing and digesting prey these include speed agility stealth sharp senses claws teeth filters and suitable digestive systems for detecting prey predators have well developed vision smell or hearing predators as diverse as owls and jumping spiders have forward facing eyes providing accurate binocular vision over a relatively narrow field of view whereas prey animals often have less acute all round vision animals such as foxes can smell their prey even when it is concealed under of snow or earth many predators have acute hearing and some such as echolocating bats hunt exclusively by active or passive use of sound predators including big cats birds of prey and ants share powerful jaws sharp teeth or claws which they use to seize and kill their prey some predators such as snakes and fish eating birds like herons and cormorants swallow their prey whole some snakes can unhinge their jaws to allow them to swallow large prey while fish eating birds have long spear like beaks that they use to stab and grip fast moving and slippery prey fish and other predators have developed ability to crush or open armoured shells of molluscs many predators are powerfully built and can catch and kill animals larger than themselves this applies as much to small predators such as ants and shrews as to big and visibly muscular carnivores like cougar and lion diet and behaviour predators are often highly specialized in their diet and hunting behaviour for example eurasian lynx only hunts small ungulates others such as leopards are more opportunistic generalists preying on at least 100 species specialists may be highly adapted to capturing their preferred prey whereas generalists may be better able to switch to other prey when a preferred target is scarce when prey have a clumped uneven distribution optimal strategy for predator is predicted to be more specialized as prey are more conspicuous and can be found more quickly this appears to be correct for predators of immobile prey but is doubtful with mobile prey in size selective predation predators select prey of a certain size large prey may prove troublesome for a predator while small prey might prove hard to find and in any case provide less of a reward this has led to a correlation between size of predators and their prey size may also act as a refuge for large prey for example adult elephants are relatively safe from predation by lions but juveniles are vulnerable camouflage and mimicry members of cat family such as snow leopard treeless highlands tiger grassy plains reed swamps ocelot forest fishing cat waterside thickets and lion open plains are camouflaged with coloration and disruptive patterns suiting their habitats in aggressive mimicry certain predators including insects and fishes make use of coloration and behaviour to attract prey female fireflies for example copy light signals of other species thereby attracting male fireflies which they capture and eat flower mantises are ambush predators camouflaged as flowers such as orchids they attract prey and seize it when it is close enough frogfishes are extremely well camouflaged and actively lure their prey to approach using an esca a bait on end of a rod like appendage on head which they wave gently to mimic a small animal gulping prey in an extremely rapid movement when it is within range venom many smaller predators such as box jellyfish use venom to subdue their prey and venom can also aid in digestion as is case for rattlesnakes and some spiders marbled sea snake that has adapted to egg predation has atrophied venom glands and gene for its three finger toxin contains a mutation deletion of two nucleotides that it these changes are explained by fact that its prey does not need to be subdued electric fields thumb an electric ray showing location of electric organ and electrocytes stacked within it several groups of predatory fish have ability to detect track and sometimes as in electric ray to incapacitate their prey by generating electric fields using electric organs electric organ is derived from modified nerve or muscle tissue physiology physiological adaptations to predation include ability of predatory bacteria to digest complex peptidoglycan polymer from cell walls of bacteria that they prey upon carnivorous vertebrates of all five major classes fishes amphibians reptiles birds and mammals have lower relative rates of sugar to amino acid transport than either herbivores or omnivores presumably because they acquire plenty of amino acids from animal proteins in their diet antipredator adaptations to counter predation prey have a great variety of defences they can try to avoid detection they can detect predators and warn others of their presence if detected they can try to avoid being target of an attack for example by signalling that a chase would be unprofitable or by forming groups if they become a target they can try to fend off attack with defences such as armour quills or mobbing and they can escape an attack in progress by startling predator shedding body parts such as tails or simply fleeing avoiding detection prey can avoid detection by predators with morphological traits and coloration that make them hard to detect they can also adopt behaviour that avoids predators by for example avoiding times and places where predators forage misdirection prey animals make use of a variety of mechanisms including camouflage and mimicry to misdirect visual sensory mechanisms of predators enabling prey to remain unrecognized for long enough to give it an opportunity to escape camouflage delays recognition through coloration shape and pattern among many mechanisms of camouflage are countershading and disruptive coloration resemblance can be to biotic or non living environment such as a mantis resembling dead leaves or to other organisms in mimicry an organism has a similar appearance to another species as in drone fly which resembles a bee yet has no sting behavioural mechanisms thumb left black woodpecker attending its chicks relatively safe inside an excavated hole in a tree animals avoid predators with behavioural mechanisms such as changing their habitats particularly when raising young reducing their activity foraging less and forgoing reproduction when they sense that predators are about eggs and nestlings are particularly vulnerable to predation so birds take measures to protect their nests where birds locate their nests can have a large effect on frequency of predation it is lowest for those such as woodpeckers that excavate their own nests and progressively higher for those on ground in canopies and in shrubs to compensate shrub nesters must have more broods and shorter nesting times birds also choose appropriate habitat e g thick foliage or islands and avoid forest edges and small habitats similarly some mammals raise their young in dens by forming groups prey can often reduce frequency of encounters with predators because visibility of a group does not rise in proportion to its size however there are exceptions for example human fishermen can only detect large shoals of fish with sonar detecting predators recognition prey species use sight sound and odor to detect predators and they can be quite discriminating for example belding s ground squirrel can distinguish several aerial and ground predators from each other and from harmless species prey also distinguish between calls of predators and non predators some species can even distinguish between dangerous and harmless predators of same species in northeastern pacific ocean transient killer whales prey on seals but local killer whales only eat fish seals rapidly exit water if they hear calls between transients prey are also more vigilant if they smell predators thumb upright eurasian jay is constantly alert for predators warning of their presence with loud alarm calls abilities of prey to detect predators do have limits belding s ground squirrel cannot distinguish between harriers flying at different heights although only low flying birds are a threat wading birds sometimes take flight when there does not appear to be any predator present although such false alarms waste energy and lose feeding time it can be fatal to make opposite mistake of taking a predator for a harmless animal vigilance prey must remain vigilant scanning their surroundings for predators this makes it more difficult to feed and sleep groups can provide more eyes making detection of a predator more likely and reducing level of vigilance needed by individuals many species such as eurasian jays give alarm calls warning of presence of a predator these give other prey of same or different species an opportunity to escape and signal to predator that it has been detected avoiding an attack signalling unprofitability if predator and prey have spotted each other prey can signal to predator to decrease likelihood of an attack these honest signals may benefit both prey and predator because they save effort of a fruitless chase signals that appear to deter attacks include stotting for example by thomson s gazelle push up displays by lizards and good singing by skylarks after a pursuit begins simply indicating that predator has been spotted as a hare does by standing on its hind legs and facing predator may sometimes be sufficient many prey animals are aposematically coloured or patterned as a warning to predators that they are distasteful or able to defend themselves such or toxicity is brought about by chemical defences found in a wide range of prey especially insects but skunk is a dramatic mammalian example forming groups by forming groups prey can reduce attacks by predators there are several mechanisms that produce this effect one is dilution where in simplest scenario if a given predator attacks a group of prey chances of a given individual being target is reduced in proportion to size of group however it is difficult to separate this effect from other group related benefits such as increased vigilance and reduced encounter rate other advantages include confusing predators such as with motion dazzle making it more difficult to single out a target fending off an attack chemical defences include toxins such as bitter compounds in leaves absorbed by leaf eating insects are used to dissuade potential predators mechanical defences include sharp spines hard shells and tough leathery skin or exoskeletons all making prey harder to kill some species mob predators cooperatively reducing likelihood of attack escaping an attack when a predator is approaching an individual and attack seems imminent prey still has several options one is to flee whether by running jumping climbing burrowing or swimming prey can gain some time by startling predator many butterflies and moths have eyespots wing markings that resemble eyes when a predator disturbs insect it reveals its hind wings in a deimatic or bluffing display startling predator and giving insect time to escape some other strategies include playing dead and uttering a distress call coevolution thumb left bats use echolocation to hunt moths at night predators and prey are natural enemies and many of their adaptations seem designed to counter each other for example bats have sophisticated echolocation systems to detect insects and other prey and insects have developed a variety of defences including ability to hear echolocation calls many pursuit predators that run on land such as wolves have evolved long limbs in response to increased speed of their prey their adaptations have been characterized as an evolutionary arms race an example of coevolution of two species in a gene centered view of evolution genes of predator and prey can be thought of as competing for prey s body however life dinner principle of dawkins and krebs predicts that this arms race is asymmetric if a predator fails to catch its prey it loses its dinner while if it succeeds prey loses its life thumb upright 0 7 eastern coral snake itself a predator is venomous enough to kill predators that attack it so when they avoid it this behaviour must be inherited not learnt metaphor of an arms race implies ever escalating advances in attack and defence however these adaptations come with a cost for instance longer legs have an increased risk of breaking while specialized tongue of chameleon with its ability to act like a projectile is useless for lapping water so chameleon must drink dew off vegetation life dinner principle has been criticized on multiple grounds extent of asymmetry in natural selection depends in part on heritability of adaptive traits also if a predator loses enough dinners it too will lose its life on other hand fitness cost of a given lost dinner is unpredictable as predator may quickly find better prey in addition most predators are generalists which reduces impact of a given prey adaption on a predator since specialization is caused by predator prey coevolution rarity of specialists may imply that predator prey arms races are rare it is difficult to determine whether given adaptations are truly result of coevolution where a prey adaptation gives rise to a predator adaptation that is countered by further adaptation in prey an alternative explanation is escalation where predators are adapting to competitors their own predators or dangerous prey apparent adaptations to predation may also have arisen for other reasons and then been co opted for attack or defence in some of insects preyed on by bats hearing evolved before bats appeared and was used to hear signals used for territorial defence and mating their hearing evolved in response to bat predation but only clear example of reciprocal adaptation in bats is stealth echolocation a more symmetric arms race may occur when prey are dangerous having spines quills toxins or venom that can harm predator predator can respond with avoidance which in turn drives evolution of mimicry avoidance is not necessarily an evolutionary response as it is generally learned from bad experiences with prey however when prey is capable of killing predator as can a coral snake with its venom there is no opportunity for learning and avoidance must be inherited predators can also respond to dangerous prey with counter adaptations in western north america common garter snake has developed a resistance to toxin in skin of rough skinned newt role in ecosystems trophic level thumb secondary consumer a mantis tenodera eating a bee one way of classifying predators is by trophic level carnivores that feed on herbivores are secondary consumers their predators are tertiary consumers and so forth at top of this food chain are apex predators such as lions many predators however eat from multiple levels of food chain a carnivore may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers this means that many predators must contend with predation where other predators kill and eat them for example coyotes compete with and sometimes kill gray foxes and bobcats biodiversity maintained by apex predation predators may increase biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant such predators are known as keystone species and may have a profound influence on balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem introduction or removal of this predator or changes in its population density can have drastic cascading effects on equilibrium of many other populations in ecosystem for example grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over thumb center upright 2 8 riparian willow recovery at blacktail creek yellowstone national park after reintroduction of wolves local keystone species and apex predator left in 2002 right in 2015 elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on trophic pyramid in that area wolves are both keystone species and apex predators without predation herbivores began to over graze many woody browse species affecting area s plant populations in addition wolves often kept animals from grazing near streams protecting beavers food sources removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver population as their habitat became territory for grazing increased browsing on willows and conifers along blacktail creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because reduced beaver population was no longer able to slow water down and keep soil in place predators were thus demonstrated to be of vital importance in ecosystem population dynamics thumb upright 1 5 harvest of canada lynx pelts from 1825 to 2002 in absence of predators population of a species can grow exponentially until it approaches carrying capacity of environment predators limit growth of prey both by consuming them and by changing their behavior increases or decreases in prey population can also lead to increases or decreases in number of predators for example through an increase in number of young they bear cyclical fluctuations have been seen in populations of predator and prey often with offsets between predator and prey cycles a well known example is that of snowshoe hare and lynx over a broad span of boreal forests in alaska and canada hare populations fluctuate in near synchrony with a 10 year period and lynx populations fluctuate in response this was first seen in historical records of animals caught by fur hunters for hudson bay company over more than a century thumb upright 1 35 left predator prey population cycles in a lotka volterra model a simple model of a system with one species each of predator and prey lotka volterra equations predicts population cycles however attempts to reproduce predictions of this model in laboratory have often failed for example when protozoan is added to a culture containing its prey paramecium latter is often driven to extinction lotka volterra equations rely on several simplifying assumptions and they are structurally unstable meaning that any change in equations can stabilize or destabilize dynamics for example one assumption is that predators have a linear functional response to prey rate of kills increases in proportion to rate of encounters if this rate is limited by time spent handling each catch then prey populations can reach densities above which predators cannot control them another assumption is that all prey individuals are identical in reality predators tend to select young weak and ill individuals leaving prey populations able to regrow many factors can stabilize predator and prey populations one example is presence of multiple predators particularly generalists that are attracted to a given prey species if it is abundant and look elsewhere if it is not as a result population cycles are only found in northern temperate and subarctic ecosystems because food webs are simpler snowshoe hare lynx system is subarctic but even this involves other predators including coyotes goshawks and great horned owls and cycle is reinforced by variations in food available to hares a range of mathematical models have been developed by relaxing assumptions made in lotka volterra model these variously allow animals to have geographic distributions or to migrate to have differences between individuals such as sexes and an age structure so that only some individuals reproduce to live in a varying environment such as with changing seasons and analysing interactions of more than just two species at once such models predict widely differing and often chaotic predator prey population dynamics presence of refuge areas where prey are safe from predators may enable prey to maintain larger populations but may also destabilize dynamics evolutionary history predation dates from before rise of commonly recognized carnivores by hundreds of millions perhaps billions of years predation has evolved repeatedly in different groups of organisms rise of eukaryotic cells at around 2 7 gya rise of multicellular organisms at about 2 gya and rise of mobile predators around 600 mya 2 gya probably around 1 gya have all been attributed to early predatory behavior and many very early remains show evidence of boreholes or other markings attributed to small predator species it likely triggered major evolutionary transitions including arrival of cells eukaryotes sexual reproduction multicellularity increased size mobility including insect flight and armoured shells and exoskeletons earliest predators were microbial organisms which engulfed or grazed on others because fossil record is poor these first predators could date back anywhere between 1 and over 2 7 gya billion years ago predation visibly became important shortly before cambrian period around as evidenced by almost simultaneous development of calcification in animals and algae and predation avoiding burrowing however predators had been grazing on micro organisms since at least with evidence of selective rather than random predation from a similar time fossil record demonstrates a long history of interactions between predators and their prey from cambrian period onwards showing for example that some predators drilled through shells of bivalve and gastropod molluscs while others ate these organisms by breaking their shells among cambrian predators were invertebrates like with appendages suitable for grabbing prey large compound eyes and jaws made of a hard material like that in exoskeleton of an insect some of first fish to have jaws were armoured and mainly predatory placoderms of silurian to devonian periods one of which is considered world s first vertebrate preying upon other predators insects developed ability to fly in early carboniferous or late devonian enabling them among other things to escape from predators among largest predators that have ever lived were theropod dinosaurs such as tyrannosaurus from cretaceous period they preyed upon herbivorous dinosaurs such as hadrosaurs ceratopsians and ankylosaurs in human society thumb upright left san hunter botswana humans are to some extent predatory using weapons and tools to fish hunt and trap animals they also use other predatory species such as dogs cormorants and falcons to catch prey for food or for sport two mid sized predators dogs and cats are animals most often kept as pets in western societies neolithic hunters including san of southern africa used persistence hunting a form of pursuit predation where pursuer may be slower than prey such as a kudu antelope over short distances but follows it in midday heat until it is exhausted a pursuit that can take up to five hours in biological pest control predators and parasitoids from a pest s natural range are introduced to control populations at risk of causing unforeseen problems natural predators provided they do no harm to non pest species are an environmentally friendly and sustainable way of reducing damage to crops and an alternative to
