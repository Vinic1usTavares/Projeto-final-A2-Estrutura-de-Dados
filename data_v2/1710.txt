firm and described casting as an easy choice hardin flew to vancouver every few weeks to film his scenes carter called hardin s portrayal very very good according to carter it was evident that x files

smiling bearded man sitting in front of a microphone seth green pictured in 2011 was cast as stoner kid emil and spent production goofing off with star david duchovny scenes in which mulder infiltrates air base were shot at a real united states airbase with a small budget and a television schedule to think of carter said effects seemed good given restrictions they faced ufo was digitally constructed based around what visual effects supervisor mat beck described as a sort of disco light rig that was rented from a party supplier carter commented on sackheim s direction noting that episode was shot well towards end of filming night time scenes sun was beginning to rise forcing crew member john bartley to rig angles to keep scenes as dark as possible one scene in which mulder infiltrates air force base had already been rewritten to change its daytime setting to night rising sun forced scene to be filmed as originally conceived house used for exterior shots of budahas family s home was reused in carter s next series millennium as home of protagonist frank black house s owner was a flight attendant who frequently met cast and crew members as they traveled in and out of vancouver initial scene with duchovny and anderson in bar was shot at a vancouver restaurant called meat market which according to carter was a much location than production designers would have you believe meat market was only bar crew could find that had not been renovated in wake of expo 86 and retained a well travelled feel it later appeared in third season episode piper maru roadside diner used for interior shots of flying saucer diner was remote enough from other filming locations that a bus was made available to transport crew members to save on travel expenses only key grip al campbell made use of this bus service causing producers to abandon idea until fourth season episode herrenvolk guest star seth green said that despite being cast as stoner kid emil and having cornered market on affable stoner in tv and film he had never used cannabis before green related that his first day on set came just after duchovny had finished filming his final scene green was impressed with duchovny s demeanour and improvisational acting and added that two just goofed off whole time post production carter claimed that scenes with flashing lights in sky were worst effects we ve ever done given limits on money and time he also commented that special effects were still in their infancy beck was special effects producer and supervisor during season one he and carter unsuccessfully tried to make special effects look three dimensional and better according to carter result looked like a kind of hi tech pong game this episode marks mark snow s debut as a solo composer for series carter stated he and production crew were fearful of using too much music in episode and first season as a whole anderson s voice over narration towards end of episode was inserted after complaints from fox executives who desired more closure executives felt that viewers were not supposed to be confused after watching and must have at least a slight idea of what was going on voiceovers became a common technique for remainder of series themes mossinger s warning to mulder that some truths should be kept hidden from public has been cited by scholars as representing difficulty of forcing large organizations to take responsibility for wrongdoing kowalski 2007 pp 71 72 episode s final revelation that aliens have been on earth for a long long time has been cited as following a trend of post futurism established by science fiction cinema in 1980s this trend has replaced traditional science fiction topics such as space exploration with themes inspired by watergate scandal and spread of
