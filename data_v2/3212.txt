new forest pony is one of recognised mountain and moorland or native pony breeds of british isles height varies from around ponies of all heights should be strong workmanlike and of a good riding type they are valued for hardiness strength and sure footedness breed is indigenous to new forest in hampshire in southern england where equines have lived since before last ice age remains dating back to 500 000 bc have been found within of heart of modern new forest dna studies have shown ancient shared ancestry with celtic type asturcon and pottok ponies many breeds have contributed to foundation bloodstock of new forest pony but today only ponies whose parents are both registered as purebred in approved section of stud book may be registered as purebred new forest pony can be ridden by children and adults can be driven in harness and competes successfully against larger horses in horse show competition all ponies grazing on new forest are owned by new forest commoners people who have rights of common of pasture over forest lands an annual marking fee is paid for each animal turned out to graze population of ponies on forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for young stock numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945 but have since risen steadily and thousands now run loose in semi feral conditions welfare of ponies grazing on forest is monitored by five agisters employees of verderers of new forest each agister takes responsibility for a different area of forest ponies are gathered annually in a series of drifts to be checked for health wormed and they are tail marked each pony s tail is trimmed to pattern of agister responsible for that pony purebred new forest stallions approved by breed society and by new forest verderers run out on forest with mares for a short period each year many of foals bred on forest are sold through beaulieu road pony sales which are held several times each year characteristics thumb left a new forest pony at an exhibition standards for breed are stipulated by new forest pony breeding and cattle society maximum height allowed is although there is no minimum height standard in practice new forest ponies are seldom less than in shows they normally are classed in two sections competition height a and under and competition height b over new forest ponies should be of riding type workmanlike and strong in conformation with a sloping shoulder and powerful hindquarters body should be deep and legs straight with strong flat bone and hard rounded hooves larger ponies although narrow enough in barrel for small children to ride comfortably are also capable of carrying adults smaller ponies may not be suitable for heavier riders but they often have more show quality new forest pony has free even gaits active and straight but not exaggerated and is noted for sure footedness agility and speed ponies are most commonly bay chestnut or grey few coat colours are excluded piebald skewbald and blue eyed cream are not allowed palomino and very light chestnut are only accepted by stud book as geldings and mares blue eyes are never accepted white markings on head and lower legs are allowed unless they appear behind head above point of hock in hind leg or above metacarpal bone at bend in knee in foreleg ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in purebred section of stud book but are recorded in appendix known as x register offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred new forest ponies as stud book is closed and only offspring of purebred approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred thumb new forest pony in winter coat new forest ponies have a gentle temperament and a reputation for intelligence strength and versatility on whole they are a sturdy and hardy breed one known hereditary genetic disorder found in breed is congenital a muscular condition also found in humans dogs cats and goats it was identified in netherlands in 2009 after a clinically affected foal was presented to equine clinic of utrecht university dna sequencing revealed that affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in gene encoding a protein which regulates excitability of skeletal muscle mutated allele was found in both foal s parents its siblings and two other related animals none of whom exhibited any clinical signs researchers concluded that condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance whereby both parents have to contribute mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype study suggested that mutation was of relatively recent origin founder of mutated gene as all ponies who tested positive for mutation are direct descendants of this stallion probable founder stallion has been identified as kantje s ronaldo testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry mutated gene all carriers will be removed from breeding section of new forest pony breeding cattle society s stud book and all new forest stallions licensed in uk also will be tested whether or not they descend from kantje s ronaldo to cover possibility that mutated gene may have appeared earlier in pedigree although it is believed that mutated gene has now been eradicated from british breeding stock all breeding stock imported to uk also will be tested history thumb left 11th century normans shipping horses to england bayeux tapestry ponies have grazed in area of new forest for many thousands of years predating last ice age spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at eartham pit boxgrove about from heart of modern new forest dated 500 000 bc demonstrates that early humans were hunting horses in area at that time and remains of a large ice age hunting camp have been found close to ringwood on western border of modern new forest evidence from skeletal remains of ponies from bronze age suggests that they resembled modern exmoor pony horse bones excavated from iron age ritual burial sites at danebury about from heart of modern new forest indicate that animals were approximately a height similar to that of some of smaller new forest ponies of today william conqueror who claimed new forest as a royal hunting ground shipped more than two thousand horses across english channel when he invaded england in 1066 earliest written record of horses in new forest dates back to that time when rights of common of pasture were granted to area s inhabitants a popular tradition linking ancestry of new forest pony to spanish horses said to have swum ashore from wrecked ships at time of spanish armada has according to new forest national park authority long been accepted as a myth however offspring of forest mares probably bred at royal stud in lyndhurst were exported in 1507 for use in renaissance wars a genetic study in 1998 suggested that new forest pony has ancient shared ancestry with two endangered spanish celtic type pony breeds asturcon and pottok most notable stallion in early history of breed was a thoroughbred named marske sire of eclipse and a great grandson of darley arabian marske was sold to a ringwood farmer for 20 guineas on death of prince william duke of cumberland and was used to breed with country mares in 1760s in 1850s and 1860s quality of ponies was noted to be declining a result of poor choice of breeding stallions and introduction of arab to improve breed was recommended census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing forest and by 1884 number had dropped to 2 250 profits from sale of young ponies affected number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years drop in numbers on forest may have been a consequence of introducing arab blood to breed in 1870s resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies or to increase in profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies arab blood may have reduced ponies natural landrace hardiness to thrive on open forest over winter numbers of ponies on forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to introduction of motor vehicles later second world war drove up demand for and thus market value of young animals for horse meat thumb new forest ponies in their natural habitat founded in 1891 society for improvement of new forest ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions to run them on forest in 1905 burley and district nf pony breeding and cattle society was set up to start stud book and organise breed show two societies merged in 1937 to form new forest pony breeding and cattle society overall numbers of livestock grazing forest including ponies tended to decline in early twentieth century in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured by 1956 number of ponies of all breeds on forest had more than doubled to 1 341 twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3 589 rising to 4 112 in 1994 before dipping back below four thousand until 2005 as of 2011 there were 4 604 ponies grazing on new forest in 2014 rare breeds survival trust rbst conservation charity watch listed new forest pony in its minority breed category given presence of less than 3 000 breeding females in forest over course of five years number of foals born each year had dropped by two thirds from 1 563 to just 423 in 2013 a change attributed by new forest pony breeding and cattle society to a declining market and by new forest verderers to steps that had been taken to improve quality rather than quantity of foals for a variety of reasons including normal trade in area and attempts to improve breed arabian thoroughbred welsh pony and hackney blood had been added to ponies in new forest over time however better quality ponies were sold off leaving poorer quality and less hardy animals as forest breeding stock to address this situation as well as to increase stock s hardiness and restore native type in early twentieth century animals from other british native mountain and moorland pony breeds such as fell dales highland dartmoor and exmoor were introduced to forest this practice ended in 1930 and since that time only purebred new forest stallions may be turned out new forest pony breeding and cattle society has been publishing stud book since 1960 new forest ponies have been exported to many parts of world including canada u s europe and australia and many countries now have their own breed societies and stud books see for example usa new forest pony association registry australia new forest

suomen new forest in finnish all retrieved 15 june 2012 uses thumb a new forest pony jumping in past smaller ponies were used as pit ponies today new forest pony and related crossbreeds are still working pony of choice for local farmers and commoners as their sure footedness agility and sound sense will carry them and their rider safely across varied and occasionally hazardous terrain of open forest sometimes at great speed during autumn drifts new forest ponies also are used today for show jumping cross country dressage driving and eventing ponies can carry adults and in many cases compete on equal terms with larger equines while doing so for example in 2010 new forest pony enthusiasts club a registered riding club whose members compete only on purebred registered new forest ponies won quadrille competition at london international horse show at olympia this was a significant win as british riding clubs quadrille is a national competition with only four teams from whole of britain selected to compete at national final from british riding clubs org uk retrieved 9 june 2012 ponies on new forest ponies grazing new forest are considered to be iconic they together with cattle donkeys pigs and sheep owned by commoners local people with common grazing rights are called architects of forest it is grazing and browsing of commoners animals over a thousand years which created new forest ecosystem as it is today left thumb stallion engaging in courtship behaviour with a mare near camp cattle and ponies living on new forest are not completely feral but are owned by commoners who pay an annual fee for each animal turned out animals are looked after by their owners and by agisters employed by verderers of new forest verderers are a statutory body with ancient roots who share management of forest with forestry commission and national park authority approximately 80 per cent of animals depastured on new forest are owned by just 10 per cent of families ponies living full time on new forest are almost all mares although there are also a few geldings for much of year ponies live in small groups usually consisting of an older mare her daughters and their foals all keeping to a discrete area of forest called a haunt under new forest regulations mares and geldings may be of any breed although ponies are predominantly new foresters other breeds such as shetlands and their crossbred descendants may be found in some areas stallions must be registered new foresters and are not allowed to run free all year round on forest they normally are turned out only for a limited period in spring and summer when they gather several groups of mares and into larger herds and defend them against other stallions a small number usually fewer than 50 are turned out generally between may and august this ensures that foals are born neither too early before spring grass is coming through nor too late as colder weather is setting in and grazing and browsing on forest is dying back in following year colts are assessed as two year olds by new forest pony breeding and cattle society for suitability to be kept as stallions any animal failing assessment must be gelded once approved every spring usually in march stallions must pass verderers assessment before they are permitted onto forest to breed stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in ponies running out on new forest and to counteract this and preserve hardiness of forest run ponies verderers introduced bloodline diversity project which will use hardy forest run mares mostly over eleven years old bred to stallions that have not been run out on forest or closely related to those that have thumb ponies gathered in a pound at a drift drifts to gather animals are carried out in autumn most colts and some fillies are removed along with any animals considered too poor to remain on forest over winter remaining fillies are branded with their owner s mark and many animals are wormed many owners choose to remove a number of animals from forest for winter turning them out again following spring animals surplus to their owner s requirements often are sold at beaulieu road pony sales run by new forest livestock society tail hair of ponies is trimmed and cut into a recognisable pattern to show that pony s grazing fees have been paid for year each agister has his own tail mark indicating area of forest where owner lives agisters keep a constant watch over condition of forest running stock and an animal may be ordered off forest at any time rest of year lives of ponies are relatively unhindered unless they need veterinary attention or additional feeding when they are usually taken off forest open nature of new forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads ponies actually have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars in an effort to reduce traffic fatalities but despite this many ponies along with commoners cattle pigs and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year human interaction with ponies is also a problem well meaning but misguided visitors to forest frequently feed them which can create dietary problems and sickness e g colic and cause ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food new forest ponies are raced in an annual point to point meeting in forest usually on boxing day finishing at a different place each year races do not have a fixed course but instead are run across open forest so competitors choose their own routes around obstructions such as inclosures forestry plantations fenced paddocks and bogs riders with a detailed knowledge of forest are thus at an advantage location of meeting place is given to competitors on previous evening and starting point of race is revealed once riders have arrived at meeting point references bibliography external links new forest pony breeding and cattle society verderers of new forest new forest
