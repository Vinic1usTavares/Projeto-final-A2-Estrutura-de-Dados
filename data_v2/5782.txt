dragon quest series dragon quest iiis scenario was designed by yuji horii whereas artwork was done by akira toriyama of dragon ball fame koichi sugiyama composed all music for dragon quest iii chunsoft president koichi nakamura co creator of dragon quest stated he contributed about 10 of games programming game was released a year after original a longer period of development than its predecessor and reflected ever lengthening game development process of series yuji horii in a 1989 interview said that developers had perfected series game structure in dragon quest iii and this was reflected by transition from one character s quest to a party of heroes password system used on first two dragon quest titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to horii s dislike of long codes that players needed to memorize or record horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere which turned out to be unworkable during dragon quest iiis development when game s world map concept was used first by another game maker in mirai but horii s team was too far into development to change anything horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make player feel like they have become main character but at one point in story horii was forced to make hero shout leave him to us run quick 1991 north american localization game was localized in north america as dragon warrior iii in 1991 though not officially released until 1992 several changes were made in this version among them were addition of a new title sequence in original it was on a simple black screen with title of game in center and a new prologue which depicted ortega who also was given a brand new sprite in this version fighting a dragon and being dragged into volcano in original player was unaware of ortega s fate until talking to king for first time there were also brand new music cues including one for title sequence and one that played after ortega died for real near end to accompany localization credits ending theme was extended to include a reprise of alefgard theme it s unclear whether sugiyama was brought back to score these new tracks or someone else was brought in menu when starting a new or old save file also added menu music from dragon quest iv in original menu was silent finally most of monsters were given a tremendous boost in experience points

themselves decided to hold off release of future dragon quest games until weekends north american release of dragon quest iii did not meet nearly as much success considered an improvement over first two games dragon quest iii kept same ugly graphical style and clumsy interface explained kurt kalata of gamasutra north american release s poor sales are partly due to fact that game was released
