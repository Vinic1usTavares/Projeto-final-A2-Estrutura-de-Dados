klaus emil julius fuchs 29 december 1911 28 january 1988 was a german theoretical physicist and atomic spy who supplied information from american british and canadian manhattan project to soviet union during and shortly after world war ii while at los alamos national laboratory fuchs was responsible for many significant theoretical calculations relating to first nuclear weapons and later early models of hydrogen bomb after his conviction in 1950 he served nine years in prison in united kingdom and then moved to east germany where he resumed his career as a physicist and scientific leader son of a lutheran pastor fuchs attended university of leipzig where his father was a professor of theology and became involved in student politics joining student branch of social democratic party of germany spd and reichsbanner schwarz rot gold spd s paramilitary organisation he was expelled from spd in 1932 and joined communist party of germany kpd he went into hiding after 1933 reichstag fire and fled to united kingdom where he received his phd from university of bristol under supervision of nevill mott and his dsc from university of edinburgh where he worked as an assistant to max born after second world war broke out in europe he was interned in isle of man and later in canada after he returned to britain in 1941 he became an assistant to rudolf peierls working on tube alloys british atomic bomb project he began passing information on project to soviet union through ruth kuczynski codenamed sonia a german communist and a major in soviet military intelligence who had worked with richard sorge s spy ring in far east in 1943 fuchs and peierls went to columbia university in new york city to work on manhattan project in august 1944 fuchs joined theoretical physics division at los alamos laboratory working under hans bethe his chief area of expertise was problem of implosion necessary for development of plutonium bomb after war he returned to uk and worked at atomic energy research establishment at harwell as head of theoretical physics division in january 1950 fuchs confessed that he was a spy a british court sentenced him to fourteen years imprisonment and stripped him of his british citizenship he was released in 1959 after serving nine years and emigrated to german democratic republic east germany where he was elected to academy of sciences and became a member of socialist unity party of germany sed central committee he was later appointed deputy director of institute for nuclear research in rossendorf where he served until he retired in 1979 early life klaus emil julius fuchs was born in russelsheim grand duchy of hesse on 29 december 1911 third of four children of a lutheran pastor emil fuchs and his wife else wagner fuchs was always known by his last given name klaus he had an older brother gerhard an older sister elisabeth and a younger sister kristel family moved to eisenach where fuchs attended gymnasium and took his abitur at school

in 1912 and reichsbanner schwarz rot gold party s paramilitary organisation his father took up a new position as professor of religion at pedagogical academy in kiel and in autumn fuchs transferred to university of kiel which his brother gerhard and sister elisabeth also attended fuchs continued his studies in mathematics and physics at university in october 1931 his mother committed suicide by drinking hydrochloric acid family later discovered that his maternal grandmother had also taken her own life in march 1932 german presidential election spd supported paul von hindenburg for president fearing that a split vote would hand job to national socialist german workers party nsdap candidate adolf hitler however when communist party of germany kpd ran its own candidate ernst thalmann fuchs offered to speak for him and was expelled from spd that year fuchs and all three of his siblings joined kpd fuchs and his brother gerhard were active speakers at public meetings and occasionally attempted to disrupt nsdap gatherings at one such gathering fuchs was beaten up and thrown into river when hitler became chancellor of germany in january 1933 fuchs decided to leave kiel where nsdap was particularly strong and he was a well known kpd member he enrolled at kaiser wilhelm institute for physics in berlin on 28 february he took an early train to berlin for a kpd meeting there on train he read about reichstag fire in a newspaper fuchs correctly assumed that opposition parties would be blamed for fire and quietly removed his hammer and sickle lapel pin kpd meeting in berlin was held in secret fellow party members urged him to continue his studies in another country he went into hiding for five months in apartment of a fellow party member in august 1933 he attended an anti fascist conference in paris chaired by henri barbusse where he met an english couple ronald and jessie gunn who invited fuchs to stay with them in clapton somerset he was expelled from kaiser wilhelm

she arranged for fuchs to meet nevill mott bristol s professor of physics and he agreed to take fuchs on as a research assistant fuchs earned his ph d in physics there in 1937 a paper on a quantum mechanical calculation of elastic constants of monovalent metals was published in proceedings of royal society in 1936 proc roy soc a vol 153 no 880 feb 1 1936 pp 622 639 by this time mott had a number of german refugees working for him and lacked positions for them all he did not think that fuchs would make much of a teacher so he arranged a research post for fuchs at university of edinburgh working under max born who was himself a german refugee fuchs published papers with born on statistical mechanics of condensing systems and on fluctuations in electromagnetic radiation in proceedings of royal society he also received a doctorate in science degree from edinburgh fuchs proudly mailed copies back to his father in germany in germany emil had been dismissed from his academic post and disillusioned with lutheran church s support of nsdap had become a quaker in 1933 he was arrested for speaking out against government but was only held for one month elisabeth married a fellow

and rental cars were impounded gerhard and karin fled to czechoslovakia elisabeth was released and went to live with emil while kittowski sentenced to six years later escaped from prison and also made his way to czechoslovakia in august 1939 elisabeth committed suicide by throwing herself from a train leaving emil to raise young klaus second world war fuchs applied to become a british citizen in august 1939 but his application had not been processed before second world war broke out in europe in september 1939 there was a classification system for enemy aliens but born provided fuchs with a reference that said that he had been a member of spd from 1930 to 1932 and an anti nazi there matters stood until june 1940 when police arrived and took fuchs into custody he was first interned on isle of man and then in july he was sent to an internment camp in sherbrooke quebec canada during his internment in 1940 he continued to work and published four more papers with born mass centre in relativity reciprocity part ii scalar wave functions reciprocity part iii reciprocal wave functions and reciprocity part iv spinor wave functions and one by himself on statistical method in nuclear theory thumb left poynting physics building at university of birmingham while interned in quebec he joined a communist discussion group led by hans kahle kahle was a kpd member who had fought in spanish civil war after fleeing to britain with his family kahle had helped jurgen kuczynski organise kpd in britain kristel arranged for israel halperin brother in law of a friend of hers wendell h furry to bring fuchs some magazines max born lobbied for his release on christmas day 1940 fuchs and kahle were among first group of internees to board a ship to return to britain fuchs returned to edinburgh in january and resumed working for born in may 1941 he was approached by rudolf peierls of university of birmingham to work on tube alloys program british atomic bomb research project despite wartime restrictions he was granted british citizenship on 7 august 1942 and signed an official secrets act declaration form as accommodation was scarce in wartime birmingham he stayed with rudolf and genia peierls fuchs and peierls did some important work together which included a fundamental paper about isotope separation soon after fuchs contacted jurgen kuczynski who was now teaching at london school of economics kuczynski put him in contact with simon kremer codename alexander secretary to military attache at soviet union s embassy who worked for gru russian noe red army s foreign military intelligence directorate after three meetings fuchs was teamed up with a courier so he would not have to find excuses to travel to london she was ruth kuczynski codename sonia sister of jurgen kuczynski she was a german communist a major in soviet military intelligence and an experienced agent who had worked with richard sorge s spy ring in far east in late 1943 fuchs codename rest he became charles in may 1944 transferred along with peierls to columbia university in new york city to work on gaseous diffusion as a means of uranium enrichment for manhattan project although fuchs was an asset of gru in britain his control was transferred to nkgb russian komissariat soviet union s civilian intelligence organisation when he moved to new york he spent christmas 1943 with kristel and her family in cambridge he was contacted by harry gold codename raymond an nkgb agent in early 1944 thumb los alamos id badge from august 1944 fuchs worked in theoretical physics division at los alamos laboratory under hans bethe his chief area of expertise was problem of imploding fissionable core of plutonium bomb at one point fuchs did calculation work that edward teller had refused to do because of lack of interest he was author of techniques such as still used fuchs nordheim method for calculating energy of a fissile assembly that goes highly prompt critical and his report on blast waves is still considered a classic fuchs was one of many los alamos scientists present at trinity test in july 1945 in april 1946 he attended a conference at los alamos that discussed possibility of a thermonuclear weapon one month later he filed a patent with john von neumann describing a method to initiate fusion in a thermonuclear weapon with an implosion trigger bethe considered fuchs one of most valuable men in my division and one of best theoretical physicists we had fuchs who was known as karl rather than klaus at los alamos dated grade school teachers evelyn kline and jean parker he befriended richard feynman fuchs and peierls were only members of british mission to los alamos who owned cars and fuchs lent his buick to feynman so feynman could visit his dying wife in hospital in albuquerque klaus fuchs s main courier was harry gold allen weinstein author of haunted wood soviet espionage in america 1999 has pointed out nkvd had chosen gold an experienced group handler as fuchs contact on grounds that it was safer than having him meet directly with a russian operative but semyon was ultimately responsible for fuchs relationship gold reported after his first meeting with klaus fuchs post war at request of norris bradbury who had replaced robert oppenheimer as director of los alamos laboratory in october 1945 fuchs stayed on at laboratory into 1946 to help with preparations for operation crossroads weapons tests us atomic energy act of 1946 mcmahon act prohibited transfer of information on nuclear research to any foreign country including britain without explicit official authority and fuchs supplied highly classified u s information to nuclear scientists in britain as well as to his soviet contacts british official files on fuchs were still being withheld he was highly regarded as a scientist by british who wanted him to return to united kingdom to work on britain s post war nuclear weapons programme he returned in august 1946 and became head of theoretical physics division at atomic energy research establishment at harwell from late 1947 to may 1949 he gave alexander feklisov his soviet case officer principal theoretical outline for creating a hydrogen bomb and initial drafts for its development as work progressed in england and america meeting with feklisov six times he provided results of test at eniwetok atoll of uranium and plutonium bombs and key data on production of uranium 235 also in 1947 fuchs attended a conference of combined policy committee cpc a committee created to facilitate exchange of atomic secrets at highest levels of governments of united states united kingdom and canada donald maclean another soviet spy was also in attendance as british co secretary of cpc confession by september 1949 information from venona project indicated to gchq that fuchs was a spy but british intelligence services were wary of indicating source of their information soviets had broken off contact with him in february fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by kim philby in october 1949 fuchs approached henry arnold head of security at harwell with news that his father had been given a chair at university of leipzig in east germany under interrogation by mi5 officer william skardon at an informal meeting in december 1949 fuchs initially denied being a spy and was not detained in january 1950 fuchs arranged another interview with skardon and voluntarily confessed that he was a spy three days later he also directed a statement more technical in content to michael perrin deputy controller of atomic energy within ministry of supply fuchs told interrogators that nkgb had acquired an agent in berkeley california who had informed soviet union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium 235 in 1942 or earlier fuchs s statements to british and american intelligence agencies were used to implicate harry gold a key witness in trials of david greenglass and julius and ethel rosenberg in united states fuchs later testified that he passed detailed information on project to soviet union through courier harry gold in 1945 and further information about edward teller s unworkable super design for a hydrogen bomb in 1946 and 1947 value of fuchs s data to soviet project hans bethe once said that klaus fuchs was only physicist he knew who truly changed history because head of soviet project beria used foreign intelligence as a third party check rather than giving it directly to scientists as he did not trust information by default it is unknown whether fuchs s fission information had a substantial effect considering that pace of soviet program was set primarily by amount of uranium they could procure it is hard for scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved according to on a field of red a history of comintern communist international by anthony cave brown and charles b macdonald fuchs s greatest contribution to soviets may have been disclosing how uranium could be processed for use in a bomb fuchs gave gold technical information in january 1945 that was acquired only after two years of experimentation at a cost of 400 million fuchs also disclosed amount of uranium or plutonium americans planned to use in each atomic bomb whether information fuchs passed relating to hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated most scholars agree with hans bethe s 1952 assessment which concluded that by time fuchs left thermonuclear program in mid 1946 too little was known about mechanism of hydrogen bomb for his information to be useful to soviet union successful teller ulam design was not devised until 1951 soviet physicists later noted that they could see as well as americans eventually did that early designs by fuchs and edward teller were useless later archival work by soviet physicist german goncharov ru suggested that while fuchs s early work did not help soviet efforts towards hydrogen bomb it was closer to final correct solution than anyone recognized at time and indeed spurred soviet research into useful problems that eventually provided correct answer since most of fuchs s work on bomb including a 1946 patent on a particular model for weapon are still classified in united states it has been difficult for scholars to fully assess these conclusions in any case it seems clear that fuchs could not have just given soviets secret to hydrogen bomb since he did not actually know it himself trial and imprisonment it is likely that fuchs espionage led u s to cancel a 1950 anglo american plan to give britain american made atomic bombs he was prosecuted by sir hartley shawcross and was convicted on 1 march 1950 of four counts of breaking official secrets act by communicating information to a potential enemy after a trial lasting less than 90 minutes lord goddard sentenced him to fourteen years imprisonment maximum for espionage because soviet union was classed as an ally at time in december 1950 he was stripped of his british citizenship head of british h bomb project sir william penney visited fuchs in prison in 1952 while imprisoned he was friendly with irish republican army prisoner seamus murphy whom he played chess with and helped escape it was suggested by some that fuchs had turned ira leader cathal goulding into a marxist but seamus murphy denied this saying fuchs never tried to turn anyone it was hard to get a word out of him fuchs was released on 23 june 1959 after serving nine years and four months of his sentence as then required in england where long term prisoners were entitled by law to one third off for good behaviour in prison at wakefield prison and promptly emigrated to german democratic republic gdr career in east germany on arrival at berlin schonefeld airport in gdr fuchs was met by grete margarete a friend from his years as a student communist they were married on 9 september 1959 in gdr fuchs continued his scientific career and achieved considerable prominence as a leader of research he became a member of sed central committee in 1967 and in 1972 was elected to academy of sciences where from 1974 to 1978 he was head of research area of physics nuclear and materials science he was then appointed deputy director of institute for nuclear research in rossendorf where he served until he retired in 1979 from 1984 fuchs was head of scientific councils for energetic basic research and for fundamentals of microelectronics he received patriotic order of merit order of karl marx and national prize of east germany thumb right upright grave of klaus fuchs in berlina tutorial fuchs gave to qian and other chinese physicists helped them to develop first chinese atomic bomb 596 which was tested five years later according to thomas reed and daniel stillman authors of nuclear express a political history of bomb and its proliferation 2009 three historians of nuclear weapons history robert s norris jeremy bernstein and peter d zimmerman challenged this particular assertion as unsubstantiated conjecture and asserted that nuclear express is an ambitious but deeply flawed book death fuchs died in
