which was being developed simultaneously with game shugo noted that original would have been more serious and contained deeper gameplay but with fewer mario esque gimmicks there was also a willingness not to update graphics only without exploring advancements to concepts and gameplay which hiroyuki stated would be unacceptable for a mario game due to success of its predecessor brothers felt pressure to make a game that was original and would not appear too similar to its predecessor on first sight following release ign interviewed hiroyuki regarding development of game he revealed that camelot had received co operation from nintendo in relation to voice acting and animation which takahashi stated as contributing quite a bit to improvement of game s graphics takahashi proceeded to explain why role playing game elements that were present in mario tennis were excluded from power tennis stating that he felt they were more suitable for deep single player experience present in portable consoles regarding themed courts in game he explained that concepts were conceived during long brainstorming sessions with courts selected that would both remind gamers of older mario games and introduce new gamers to mario games they may not have played when questioned regarding difficulties in developing game takahashi noted effort used in making opening sequences developing special games and animations which caused problems with meeting schedule although there was speculation about online capabilities before release takahashi refrained from making game online compatible due to
