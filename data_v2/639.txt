surf rock band which included jimmy greenspoon known as new dimensions and later group entered stereo masters studio to record three albums during which time lloyd first became acquainted with fowley while attending hollywood professional school lloyd befriended harris brothers who recorded regional hit ski storm with rival act snowmen in early 1965 shaun harris collaborated with lloyd in his

formed laughing wind which recorded single good to be around for tower records later that year recordings made or produced by these pre wcpaeb acts were collected years later on compilation album west coast pop art experimental band companion in 2011 markley became motivated by large crowd a rock band like yardbirds attracted particularly number of teenage girls and proposed he would finance and secure a recording contract for laughing wind in exchange for his inclusion into group impressed and slightly seduced by much older markley s wealth and entourage band accepted his offer decision to record as west coast pop art experimental band rather than laughing wind was made by markley who envisioned band as a west coast counterpart to velvet underground looking to have something tangible to represent band in 1966 wcpaeb released their debut album on markley s fifo label volume one much of album was recorded at lloyd s personal studio and a rented store front on la cienega boulevard before markley joined group however tracks such as don t break my balloon and if you want this love indicate he had some influence over later sessions for album s development while volume one did feature a small selection of original material majority of album was cover versions including louie louie you really got me and it s all over now baby blue reprise years 1967 1968 wcpaeb embarked on their first tour in june 1966 establishing themselves as a live favorite with los angeles hippies at venues such as other place and wild thing group shared bill with mothers of invention seeds iron butterfly and yardbirds among others according to ware group s performances were ultimate street happening for a while highlighted by their ambitious psychedelic light show which was operated by buddy walters who also arranged light shows for jimi hendrix and animals in a review of a gig in 1967 los angeles free press commended wcpaeb s musicianship but was critical of markley for his attitude and non rhythmic tambourine playing although his bandmates did not like his pretentious on and off stage antics markley did manage to negotiate a three album deal with talent scouts of reprise records who had attended wcpaeb s performances in may 1967 band recorded and released their first album for reprise part one by time recording sessions began markley had assumed absolute control of wcpaeb s publishing rights which explains his unusual selection for a side of album s singles a spoken rap composition 1906 co penned with session musician ron morgan and a cover of mothers of invention s song help i m a rock album itself featured songs that exhibited a wide ranging stylistic variety including byrds esque folk rock garage rock and baroque pop song i won t hurt you was one of two compositions other being if you want this love from group s debut album re recorded for part one where it was given a much more subdued atmosphere and a heartbeat rhythm shaun harris sang reworked version of i won t hurt you rather than lloyd who aside from some backing vocals on album would not sing lead on a wcpaeb release until 1969 album where s my daddy markley and lloyd did not get on which led to latter leaving group and morgan joining full time according to lloyd markley became increasingly overbearing on wcpaeb s creative output and he started to believe that he was like you know real deal as opposed to guy who doesn t sing and doesn t really have any musical thoughts and stuff like that he wasn t content anymore just being guy who ended up with girls that he could get from it lloyd remained in los angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with fowley and mike curb such as october country smoke st john green and fire escape in august 1967 just prior to recording sessions for wcpaeb s third reprise album shaun harris took a hiatus from band his departure was partly due to his disillusionment with group primarily with wcpaeb s lack of success and it served as a waiting period while his brother danny was being treated for depression he formed california spectrum with danny lloyd and jimmy greenspoon group toured midwest with markley s state of art light show and released two singles in its brief recording career sassafras same version featured on volume one and a cover of left banke s she may call you up tonight none of which were met with much attention when harris returned to wcpaeb in 1968 he touted a completely different line up and promoted california spectrum with his column in teen zine tiger beat until group disbanded sometime in early 1969 in late 1967 wcpaeb released their third album vol 2 breaking through which was band s most ambitious albeit less consistent than its predecessor work to date album featured a peculiar cover photo of markley and harris brothers sitting bare chested in a silver bathroom and a bold declaration on backside every song in this album has been written arranged sung and played by group no one censored us we got to say everything we wanted to say in way we wanted to say it for first time each track was credited either in whole or in part to members of wcpaeb however markley s manic narratives and questionable lyrical content particularly young girls dominate record an edited version of morgan markley composition smell of incense was issued just ahead of vol 2 breaking through but it failed to chart dallas psychedelic pop group southwest fob covered song in 1968 which reached no 56 on billboard hot 100 among its ten tracks album included politically satirical in arena possibly inspired by watts riots vol 2 breaking through also features anti war song suppose they gave a war and no one comes full version of smell of incense and a rare instance of markley singing is found on unfree child wcpaeb s fourth album volume 3 a child s guide to good and evil was released in july 1968 album represented a creative leap forward for band and is often considered their most accomplished work band biographer tim forster described volume 3 as group s most extraordinary achievement one which utilized a bizarre fusion of innocence and malice heavily affected by exuberance of british invasion folk rock and flower power era being swept away in a tide of bad drugs paranoia and protest album also saw morgan experimenting with droning quality of electric sitar featured prominently on ritual 1 until poorest of people have money title track and ritual 2 in addition volume 3s front cover design showcased butterfly mind artwork of john van who also is credited with covers of crown of creation exile on main st and magical mystery tour like wcpaeb s earlier albums volume 3 failed to sell in sufficient quantities to reach u s charts and reprise dropped band independent labels 1969 1970 late in 1968 jimmy bowen established his label amos records and signed group following year while band worked on where s my daddy album danny harris rejoined and lloyd returned to provide backing vocals and co write where s my daddy where money rules everything and coming of age in l a with markley it became apparent on album however that echoing vocal harmonies found on band s preceding works were replaced by a closely miked sound album loosely possessed components of a concept piece narrated through eyes of a young homeless girl named poor patty as she journeys through chaos of post summer of love los angeles however where s my daddy as well as its accompanying single free as bird failed to reverse wcpaeb s commercial fortunes and it is regarded by critics and fans as group s most lackluster album release lloyd negotiated with curb to distribute group s fifth and final album on forward records released in 1970 markley insisted album originally self titled should be released under name markley a group album benefited from full involvement and production experience of lloyd who sang majority of lead vocals provided keyboards and organized orchestral arrangements danny harris was a key influence on album writing half of its tracks however although album is generally considered an improvement over where s my daddy group could no longer cope with markley s erratic behavior and disbanded soon after album s release aftermath markley continued his playboy lifestyle at a beach house he purchased in los angeles he produced jim stallings j j light european hit heya and album of same name before vanishing from music business according to various accounts by band members and fowley in 1972 markley had evaded imprisonment and kept a low profile after an incident involving two underage girls markley sporadically contacted his former bandmates however fowley recollected a conversation with stallings in 1992 he stallings told me that bob had been sitting in this rowing boat on a lake near las vegas he was like a recluse it got loose from its moorings and he drifted off alone for a day and a half he was already pretty messed up but he got very badly dehydrated when they eventually found him he was taken to some hospital and placed on a life support system unable to speak or think markley died on september 9 2003 in a hospital in

titled debut solo album in 1973 which explored his country rock influences later on he became president of barry manilow s publishing company and most recently harris has written a play about his life
