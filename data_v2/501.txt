production development idea of film initially came to jonze in early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence for first maybe 20 seconds of it it had this real buzz said jonze i d say hey hello and it would say hey how are you and it was like whoa this is trippy after 20 seconds it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works and it wasn t that impressive but it was still for 20 seconds really exciting more people that talked to it smarter it got jonze s interest in project was renewed after directing short film i m here 2010 which shares similar themes inspiration also came from kaufman s writing approach for synecdoche new york 2008 jonze explained kaufman said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment all ideas and feelings at that time and put it into script i was very inspired by that and tried to do that in her and a lot of feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory jonze took five months to write first draft of script his first screenplay written alone one of first actors he envisioned for film was joaquin phoenix in late 2011 phoenix signed on to project with warner bros pictures acquiring distribution rights carey mulligan entered negotiations to star in film although she was cast she later dropped out due to scheduling difficulties in april 2012 rooney mara signed on to replace mulligan in role chris pratt s casting was announced in may 2013 jonze s long time director of photography lance acord was not available to work on movie in his place jonze hired hoyte van hoytema in discussing film s look jonze told van hoytema that he wanted to avoid a dystopian look instead two decided on a style that van hoytema termed kind of a hybrid between being a little bit conceptual and being very theoretical van hoytema took particular inspiration from japanese photographer rinko kawauchi in keeping with film s theme van hoytema sought to eliminate color blue as much as possible feeling it was too well associated with sci fi genre he also felt that by eliminating color it would give rest of colors a specific identity filming principal photography on her took place in mid 2012 with a production budget of 23 million it was primarily filmed in los angeles with an additional two weeks of filming in shanghai during production of film actress samantha morton performed role of samantha by acting on set in a four by four carpeted soundproof booth made of black painted plywood and soft noise muffling fabric at jonze s suggestion she and joaquin phoenix avoided seeing each other on set during filming morton was later replaced by scarlett johansson jonze explained it was only in post production when we started editing that we realized that what character movie needed was different from what samantha and i had created together so we recast and since then scarlett has taken over that role morton is credited as an associate producer jonze met johansson in spring of 2013 and worked with her for four months following recast new scenes were shot in august 2013 which were either newly imagined or new scenes that jonze had wanted to shoot originally but didn t post production eric zumbrunnen and jeff buchanan served as film s editors zumbrunnen stated that there was rewriting in a scene between theodore and samantha after theodore goes on a blind date he explained that their goal in scene was to make it clear that samantha was connecting with theodore and feeling for him you wanted to get sense that conversation was drawing them closer steven soderbergh became involved in film when jonze s original cut ran over 150 minutes and soderbergh cut it down to 90 minutes this was not final version of film but it assisted jonze in removing unnecessary sub plots consequently a supporting character played by chris cooper that was subject of a documentary within
