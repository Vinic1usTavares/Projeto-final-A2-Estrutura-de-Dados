in a sweater vest and new york yankees baseball cap russell simmons pictured was originally going to produce album with larry smith but could not attend studio sessions in london after working on their debut self titled album whodini embarked on a three month european tour two and a half weeks into this tour they were joined by kid and group had also planned to tour in israel and australia following their european tour but refused to do so as they had been away from home for three weeks and found tour rigorous singer songwriter jalil hutchins later said somebody should ve stepped in and made us continue tour whodini member john fletcher ecstasy said that group thought european audiences would be unfamiliar with their music but they found that lots of kids lots of club owners had made a real effort to get hold of our music when we discovered that we realized that music we were working with really was universal that we didn t have to think of a particular market people everywhere like to dance sweat and party and they like same kind of sounds group worked well with german producer conny plank on whodini and were trying to find a similar producer according to hutchins conny had an understanding of what hip hop was and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us we would ve produced some special records on next album we decided that we needed to get somebody from us that understood where we were coming from although jive records initially hired russell simmons and larry smith to produce escape commitments in new york kept simmons from recording sessions hutchins had met smith at disco fever in new york city although they were friends and often discussed music he said that they did not originally consider working together jive records could not find a producer and hutchins asked smith to come to europe and produce album producer initially refused for financial reasons but called hutchins following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off smith and hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to label recording bass for five minutes of funk thumb alt ecstasy and flavor flav onstage at a festival ecstasy and flavor flav in 2009 ecstasy was pleasantly surprised by whodini s overseas popularity after release of their first album escape was recorded in 16 days at battery studios in london with hutchins often writing lyrics in studio he found it difficult to write a complete song at home and finished lyrics later hutchins worked well with smith and said that producer became involved in music making and would start talking a lot of shit to us to let us feel like he felt smith s presence is evident on friends whose beat was according to hutchins nothing like way it sounded after he got to it whodini often argued with studio personnel hutchins said that he never seen studio sessions like ours criticism would be flying around that studio like and bullets but we knew we got something right when larry started grabbing his dick and that was craziest thing in world smith encouraged whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track from linn lm 1 and roland tr 707 drum machines to a fender jazz bass music music on escape in particular five minutes of funk was originally intended to be rock music oriented with hutchins suggesting that song would be similar to rawer work of groups such as isley brothers whodini had planned to use a minimoog synthesizer on track although smith left his at home assuming that he could find one in united kingdom unable to locate one group then heard run d m c s rock box and decided to follow a more r b oriented direction smith said that although he was told by jive records to make album sound like run d m c he didn t want to do exactly that whodini s a bit more adult i think and rap s not just for kids anymore record has been called rhythm blues based rap and has been cited as a major influence on new jack swing a hip hop influenced form of funk which became dominant form of contemporary r b from 1987 to 1993 nelson george described escape music as a style which black radio embraces specifically a radio friendly singles oriented hip hop as opposed to hard core more rhyme centered rap retrospective commentary on their music suggested that although group sounded tame when compared to later work of artists such as too short and ol dirty bastard as well as groups like 2 live crew whodini were considered raunchy and racy during mid 1980s on songs such as freaks come out at night unlike other hip hop musicians whodini s backing music and beats were synthesizer based escape contains tracks with minimal musical backing such as big mouth and friends and faster paced music such as escape i need a break hutchins believed that fender jazz bass was part of whodini s signature sound and used it on five minutes of funk escape lyrics are generally egocentric but also explored difficulty of city life escape i need a break failed romance friends and new york s party lifestyle freaks come out at night release album was released on october 17 1984 by jive records group had a developed a large following in britain and europe prior to release of escape although success in united states had initially been limited five minutes of funk and freaks come out at night became their first legitimate hits in their home country according to new york times these could be heard almost constantly in new york dance clubs as well as on local urban contemporary radio stations ecstasy said that audiences were finally ready for hip hop music and whodini were just beginning to break through on radio rather than listening to stevie wonder or someone do an inferior version of rap people want to hear real thing with original complexity to it this is most complex interesting stuff going on in black music today and radio s just beginning to discover that public eats it up by december 1984 7 and 12 inch singles friends and five minutes of funk were approaching sales of 350 000 and received more airplay than magic s wand and haunted house of rock from whodini s first album billboard reported airplay noting that despite increased play songs were unreported and often played during night month before escape release whodini

comparing groups in 1986 los angeles times reported though whodini s record sales are impressive run d m c has been a greater media attraction and a bigger critical favorite escape was re released on compact disc in 2011 by traffic group with several bonus tracks critical reception in a contemporary review robert christgau gave escape a grade of b and wrote that hutchins and smith turn out ingratiating variations on a formula fortunately formula isn t tired yet although christgau found lyrics of freaks come out at night less intellectual than escape or friends and less musically interesting than five minutes of funk he still considered it a strong song nme described escape as superior to whodini s first album and praised smith s production writing that his sparse dmc sound here gives way to a rich and warm electronic soundscape they went on to dub title track as being best song on album followed by big mouth out of control we are whodini and friends they went on to say that featuring grandmaster dee was escape weak link calling it a pointless instrumental reworking of five minutes of funk spin praised escape i need a break comparing it to grandmaster flash and furious five s message writing that whodini s song focuses on guy affected by social condition not on condition itself among retrospective reviews fact noted that escape was eclipsed by antics of new school and that it had tumbled off of most casual fans bucket lists according to allmusic album was a vast improvement over previous year s debut with a countless amount of memorable lines and productions and has held up over time better than debut but that it was not a conceptual masterpiece reviewer called freaks come out at night and five minutes of funk classics and said that we are whodini distills essence of group more than other groundbreaking tracks here and still retains a sense of freshness trouser press found album airy without being simple and called it appealing and innovative fact placed escape at number 98 on their list of top 1980s albums calling it diverting from end to end something spoonie g cold crush brothers and furious five conspicuously failed to
