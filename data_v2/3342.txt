sequel to frankenstein as early as its 1931 preview screenings following which film s original ending was changed to allow for henry frankenstein s survival curtis p 154 james whale initially refused to direct bride believing he had squeezed idea dry p 80 on first film following success of whale s invisible man producer carl laemmle jr realized that whale was only possible director for bride whale took advantage of situation in persuading studio to let him make one more river curtis p 234 whale believed sequel would not top original so he decided instead to make it a memorable hoot according to a studio publicist whale and universal s studio psychiatrist decided monster would have mental age of a ten year old boy and emotional age of a lad of fifteen screenwriter robert florey wrote a treatment entitled new adventures of frankenstein monster lives but it was rejected without comment early in 1932 universal staff writer tom reed wrote a treatment under title return of frankenstein a title retained until filming began following its acceptance in 1933 reed wrote a full script that was submitted to hays office for review script passed its review but whale who by then had been contracted to direct complained that it stinks to heaven curtis p 134 l g blochman and philip macdonald were next writers assigned but whale also found their work unsatisfactory in 1934 whale set john l balderston to work on yet another version and it was he who returned to an incident from novel in which creature demands a mate in novel frankenstein creates a mate but destroys it without bringing it to life balderston also created mary shelley prologue after several months whale was still not satisfied with balderston s work and handed project to playwright william j hurlbut and edmund pearson final script combining elements of a number of these versions was submitted for hays office review in november 1934 curtis pp 234 36 kim newman reports that whale planned to make elizabeth heart donor for bride but film historian scott macqueen states that whale never had such an intention sources report that bela lugosi and claude rains were considered with varying degrees of seriousness for role of frankenstein s mentor pretorius lennig p 92 others report that role was created specifically for ernest thesiger skal p 185 because of mae clarke s ill health valerie hobson replaced her as henry frankenstein s love interest elizabeth early in production whale decided that same actress cast to play bride should also play mary shelley in film s prologue to represent how story and horror in general springs from dark side of imagination vieira p 82 he considered brigitte helm and phyllis brooks before deciding on elsa lanchester lanchester who had accompanied husband charles laughton to hollywood had met with only moderate success while laughton had made a strong impact with several films including private life of henry viii for which he had won an oscar and whale s own old dark house lanchester had returned alone to london when whale contacted her to offer her dual role curtis pp 243 44 lanchester modeled bride s hissing on hissing of swans she gave herself a sore throat while filming hissing sequence which whale shot from multiple angles vieira p 86 colin clive and boris karloff reprised their roles from frankenstein as creator and creation respectively hobson recalled clive s alcoholism had worsened since filming original but whale did not recast role because his hysterical quality was necessary for film karloff strongly objected to decision to allow monster to speak speech stupid my argument was that if monster had any impact or charm it was because he was inarticulate this great lumbering inarticulate creature moment he spoke you might as well play it straight gifford p 55 this decision also meant that karloff could not remove his dental plate so now his cheeks did not have sunken look of original film whale and studio psychiatrist selected 44 simple words for monster s vocabulary by looking at test papers of ten year olds working at studio dwight frye returned to play doctor s assistant karl having played hunchback fritz in original frye also filmed a scene as an unnamed villager and role of nephew glutz a man who murdered his uncle and blamed death on monster boris karloff is credited simply as karloff which was universal s custom during height of his career elsa lanchester is credited for mary wollstonecraft shelley but in a nod to earlier film monster s bride is credited only as just as boris karloff had been in opening credits of frankenstein thumb 300px right alt bride of frankenstein has black hair with a white streak running through it is dressed in a white gown and has a blank expression she is standing

karloff in bride of frankenstein bride s conical hairdo with its white lightning trace streaks on each side has become an iconic symbol of both character and film universal makeup artist jack pierce paid special attention to monster s appearance in this film he altered his 1931 design to display after effects of mill fire adding scars and shortening monster s hair curtis p 237 over course of filming pierce modified monster s makeup to indicate that monster s injuries were healing as film progressed pierce co created bride s makeup with strong input from whale especially regarding bride s iconic hair style based on nefertiti lanchester s hair was given a marcel wave over a wire frame to achieve style lanchester disliked working with pierce who she said really did feel that he made these people like he was a god in morning he d be dressed in white as if he were in hospital to perform an operation vieira p 85 to play mary shelley lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies stars and moons which actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make lanchester said of her bride costume i drank as little liquid as possible it was too much of an ordeal to go to bathroom all those bandages and having to be accompanied by my dresser kenneth strickfaden created and maintained laboratory equipment strickfaden recycled a number of fancifully named machines he had created for original frankenstein for use in bride including cosmic ray diffuser goldman p 165 and goldman p 183 a lightning bolt generated by strickfaden s equipment has become a stock scene appearing in any number of films and television shows picart et al p 40 man behind film s special photographic effects was john p fulton head of special effects department at universal studios at time picart et al p 39 fulton and david s created homunculi over course of two days by shooting actors in full size jars against black velvet and aligning them with perspective of on set jars foreground film plate was rotoscoped and matted onto rear plate diminutive actor billy barty is briefly visible from back in finished film as a homunculus infant in a high chair but whale cut infant s reveal before film s release whale met franz waxman at a party and asked him to score picture nothing will be resolved in this picture except end destruction scene would you write an unresolved score for it asked whale waxman created three distinctive themes one for monster one for bride and one for pretorius score closes at whale s suggestion with a powerful dissonant chord intended to convey idea that on screen explosion was so powerful that theater where film was being screened was affected by it curtis p 246 constantin conducted 22 musicians to record score in a single nine hour session curtis p 249 shooting began on january 2 1935 mank p xvii with a projected budget of us 293 750 as of almost exactly budget of original and an estimated 36 day shooting schedule curtis p 241 on first day karloff waded in water below destroyed windmill wearing a rubber suit under his costume air got into suit and expanded it like an obscene water lilly later that day karloff broke his hip necessitating a stunt double clive had also broken his leg shooting was completed on march 7 1935 film was ten days over schedule because whale shut down picture for ten days until heggie became available to play hermit curtis pp 248 49 with a final cost of 397 023 as of bride was more than 100 000 as of over budget as originally filmed henry died fleeing exploding castle whale re shot ending to allow for their survival although clive is still visible on screen in collapsing laboratory whale completed his final cut shortening running time from about 90 to 75 minutes and re shooting and re editing ending only days before film s scheduled premiere date censorship thumb left 230px boris karloff director james whale and cinematographer john j on set of bride of frankenstein 1935 bride of frankenstein was subjected to censorship both during production by hays office and following its release by local and national censorship boards joseph breen lead censor for hays office objected to lines of dialogue in originally submitted script in which henry frankenstein and his work were compared to that of god he continued to object to such dialogue in revised scripts skal pp 187 91 and to a planned shot of monster rushing through a graveyard to a figure of a crucified jesus and attempting to rescue figure from cross curtis p 247 breen also objected to number of murders both seen and implied by script and strongly advised whale to reduce number censor s office upon reviewing film in march 1935 required a number of cuts whale agreed to delete a sequence in which dwight frye s nephew glutz kills his uncle and blames monster curtis p 250 and shots of elsa lanchester as mary shelley in which breen felt too much of her breasts were visible curiously despite his earlier objection breen offered no objection to cruciform imagery throughout film including a scene with monster lashed christ like to a pole nor to presentation of pretorius as a coded homosexual bride of frankenstein was approved by production code office on april 15 1935 following its release with code seal of approval film was challenged by censorship board in state of ohio censors in england and china objected to scene in which monster gazes longingly upon as yet unanimated body of bride citing concerns that it looked like necrophilia johnson p 166 universal voluntarily withdrew film from sweden because of extensive cuts demanded and bride was rejected outright by trinidad palestine and hungary one unusual objection from japanese censors was that scene in which pretorius chases his miniature henry viii with tweezers constituted making a fool out of a king reception right thumb 360px colin clive elsa lanchester boris karloff and ernest thesiger bride of frankenstein was profitable for universal with a 1943 report showing that film had by then earned approximately 2 million in money for studio a profit of about 950 000 as of curtis p 251 film was critically praised upon its release although some reviewers did qualify their opinions based on film s being in horror genre new york world telegram called film good entertainment of its kind new york post described it as a grotesque gruesome tale which of its kind is swell hollywood reporter similarly called film a joy for those who can appreciate it curtis pp 250 51 variety did not so qualify its review it is one of those rare instances where none can review it or talk about it without mentioning cameraman art director and score composer in same breath as actors and director variety also praised cast writing that karloff manages to invest character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching thesiger as dr is a diabolic characterization if ever there was one lanchester handles two assignments being first in a preamble as author mary shelley and then created woman in latter assignment she impresses quite highly in another unqualified review time wrote that film had a vitality that makes their efforts fully equal of original picture screenwriters hurlbut balderston and director james whale have given it macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos for sheer evil that was frankenstein oakland tribune concurred it was a fantasy produced on a rather magnificent scale with excellent stagecraft and fine photographic effects while winnipeg free press thought that electrical equipment might have been better suited to buck rogers nonetheless reviewer praised film as exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome declaring that all who enjoyed frankenstein will welcome his bride as a worthy successor new york times called karloff so splendid in role that all one can say is he is monster times praised entire principal cast and whale s direction in concluding that bride is a first rate horror film and presciently suggested that monster should become an institution like charlie chan bride was nominated for one academy award for best sound recording gilbert kurland film s reputation has persisted and grown since its release on rotten tomatoes film has an approval rating of 100 based on 44 reviews with an average rating of 9 08 10 site s critical consensus reads an eccentric campy technically impressive and frightening picture james whale s bride of frankenstein has aged remarkably well in 1998 film was added to united states national film registry having been deemed culturally historically or aesthetically significant frequently identified as james whale s masterpiece film is lauded as finest of all gothic horror movies time rated bride of frankenstein in its all time 100 movies in which critics richard corliss and richard schickel overruled magazine s original review to declare film one of those rare sequels that is infinitely superior to its source in 2008 bride was selected by empire magazine as one of 500 greatest movies of all time also in 2008 boston herald named it second greatest horror film after nosferatu in 2016 james charisma of playboy ranked film 7 on a list of 15 sequels that are way better than originals entertainment weekly considers film superior to frankenstein interpretations christian imagery christian imagery appears throughout film in addition to scenes of monster trussed in a cruciform pose and crucified figure of jesus in graveyard hermit has a crucifix on wall of his hut which to whale s consternation editor ted kent made glow during a fade out and monster consumes christian sacraments of bread and wine at his last supper with hermit horror scholar david j skal suggests that whale s intention was to make a direct comparison of frankenstein s monster to christ skal p 189 film scholar scott macqueen noting whale s lack of any religious convictions disputes notion that monster is a christ figure rather monster is a mockery of divine since having been created by man rather than god it lacks divine spark in crucifying monster he says whale pushes audience s buttons by inverting central christian belief of death of christ followed by resurrection monster is raised from dead first then crucified queer reading in decades since its release modern film scholars have noted possible queer reading of film director james whale was openly gay and some of actors in cast including ernest thesiger and colin clive were gay or bisexual although james curtis whale s biographer rejects notion that whale would have identified with monster from a homosexual perspective curtis p 144 scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through film especially a camp sensibility skal p 184 particularly embodied in character of pretorius and his relationship with henry gay film historian vito russo in considering pretorius stops short of identifying character as gay instead referring to him as russo p 50 sissy itself being hollywood code for homosexual pretorius serves as a gay mephistopheles a figure of seduction and temptation going so far as to pull frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in unnatural act of creating non procreative life a novelization of film published in england made implication clear having pretorius say to frankenstein be fruitful and multiply let us obey biblical injunction you of course have choice of natural means but as for me i am afraid that there is no course open to me but scientific way egremont michael quoted in skal p 189 monster whose affections for male hermit and female bride he discusses with identical language friend has been read as sexually unsettled and bisexual gender studies author elizabeth young writes he has no innate understanding that male female bond he is to forge with bride is assumed to be primary one or that it carries a different sexual valence from his relationships with pretorius and hermit all affective relationships are as easily friendships as marriages young p 134 indeed his relationship with hermit has been interpreted as a same sex marriage that heterosexual society will not tolerate no mistake this is a marriage and a viable one but whale reminds us quickly that society does not approve monster outsider is driven from his scene of domestic pleasure by two gun toting who happen upon this startling alliance and quickly instinctively proceed to destroy it writes cultural critic gary morris for bright lights film journal creation of bride scene morris continues is whale s reminder to audience his hollywood bosses peers and everyone watching of majesty and power of homosexual creator filmmaker curtis harrington a friend and confidant of whale s dismissed this as a younger critic s evaluation all artists do work that comes out of unconscious mind and later on you can analyze it and say symbolism may mean something but artists don t think that way and i would bet my life that james whale would never have had such concepts in mind specifically in response to majesty and power reading harrington stated my opinion is that s just pure bullshit that s a critical interpretation that has nothing to do with original inspiration he concludes i think closest you can come to a homosexual metaphor in his films is to identify that certain sort of camp humor whale s companion david lewis stated flatly that whale s sexual orientation was not germane to his filmmaking saying jimmy was first and foremost an artist and his films represent work of an artist not a gay artist but an artist curtis p 144 remakes universal pictures has sought to remake bride of frankenstein on several occasions while novel frankenstein has been adapted to film many times bride of frankensteins closest remake was bride 1985 starring sting clancy brown and jennifer beals in
