was an aircraft carrier built by imperial japanese navy ijn during world war ii largest such built up to that time laid down in may 1940 as third of s shinanos partially complete hull was ordered to be converted to a carrier following japan s disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at battle of midway in mid 1942 her conversion was still not finished in november 1944 when she was ordered to sail from yokosuka naval arsenal to kure naval base to complete fitting out and transfer a load of 50 yokosuka ohka rocket propelled kamikaze flying bombs she was sunk en route 10 days after commissioning on 29 november 1944 by four torpedoes from u s navy submarine over a thousand sailors and civilians were rescued and 1 435 were lost including her captain she remains largest warship ever sunk by a submarine enright ryan p xiv design and description one of two additional yamato class battleships ordered as part of 4th naval armaments supplement program of 1939 enright ryan p 2 shinano was named after old province of shinano following japanese ship naming conventions for battleships silverstone p 336 she was laid down on 4 may 1940 at yokosuka naval arsenal to a modified yamato class design her armor would be thinner than that of earlier ships as it had proved to be thicker than it needed to be for desired level of protection and her heavy anti aircraft aa guns would be new 65 caliber 10 cm type 98 dual purpose gun as it had superior ballistic characteristics and a higher rate of fire than 40 caliber 12 7 cm type 89 guns used by her half sisters garzke dulin pp 74 75 construction and conversion as with shinanos half sisters and new ship s existence was kept a closely guarded secret a tall fence was erected on three sides of graving dock and those working on conversion were confined to yard compound serious punishment up to and including death awaited any worker who mentioned new ship as a result shinano was only major warship built in 20th century to have avoided being officially photographed during its construction ship is only known to have been photographed twice on 1 november 1944 by a boeing b 29 superfortress reconnaissance aircraft from an altitude of and ten days later by a civilian photographer aboard a harbor tug during shinanos initial sea trials in tokyo bay enright ryan p 13 in december 1941 construction on shinanos hull was temporarily suspended to allow ijn time to decide what to do with ship she was not expected to be completed until 1945 and sinking of british capital ships and by ijn bombers had called into question viability of battleships in war navy also wanted to make large drydock in which ship was being built available which required either scrapping portion already completed or finishing it enough to launch it and clear drydock ijn decided on latter albeit with a reduced work force which was expected to be able to launch ship in one year garzke dulin p 75 in month following disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at june 1942 battle of midway ijn ordered ship s unfinished hull converted into an aircraft carrier her hull was only 45 percent complete by that time with structural work complete up to lower deck and most of her machinery installed main deck lower side armor and upper side armor around ship s magazines had been completely installed and forward barbettes for main guns were also nearly finished navy decided that shinano would become a heavily armored support dulin p 78 carrying reserve aircraft fuel and ordnance in support of other carriers rather than a fleet carrier chesneau p 185 as completed shinano had a length of overall a beam of and a draft of she displaced at standard load at normal load and at full load shinano was heaviest aircraft carrier yet built a record she held until was launched in 1954 she was designed for a crew of 2 400 officers and enlisted men jentschura jung mickel p p 91 machinery shinanos machinery was identical to that of her half sisters ships were fitted with four geared steam turbine sets with a total of each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by 12 kampon water tube boilers ships had a designed speed of but shinano never conducted full speed sea trials so her actual performance is unknown brown pp 32 33 she carried of fuel oil which gave her an estimated range of at flight deck and hangar shinano was designed to load and fuel her aircraft on deck where it was safer for ship experiences in battles of midway and coral sea had demonstrated that existing doctrine of fueling and arming their aircraft below decks was a real danger to carriers if they were attacked while doing so much of shinanos hangar was left open for better ventilation although steel shutters could close off most of hangar sides if necessary this also allowed ordnance or burning aircraft to be jettisoned into sea something that earlier carriers could not do with their enclosed hangars carrier s flight deck was wide and overhung her hull at both ends supported by pairs of pillars a large island modeled on that fitted on was sponsoned off starboard side and integrated with ship s funnel much like earlier taiho design shinanos armored flight deck they were only japanese carriers with armored flight decks functioned as ship s strength deck and copied british practice as seen in their carriers designed to resist penetration by bombs dropped by a dive bomber flight deck consisted of of armor plate laid over of ordinary steel it was equipped with 15 transverse arrestor wires and three crash barriers that could stop a aircraft brown p 32 five of these wires were positioned further forward to allow ship to land aircraft over bow in case aft portion of flight deck was unusable unlike british carriers taiho and shinano had unarmored sides to their hangars for stability reasons latter only had a single hangar that was with a minimum width of aft and had a height of forward area of hangar was dedicated to maintenance and storage facilities aircraft were transported between hangar and flight deck by two elevators one at each end of hangar on centerline of flight deck larger of two measured they were capable of lifting aircraft weighing up to ship had an aviation gasoline avgas capacity of large ventilation fans were installed on hangar deck to expel fumes in case of damage to gasoline system taiho had been sunk by an explosion of gasoline fumes canvas wind scoops could also be rigged over elevator opening to force more air inside ship s organic air group was intended to consist of 18 mitsubishi a7m reppu allied reporting name sam fighters plus two in storage 18 aichi b7a ryusei grace torpedo dive bombers plus two in storage and 6 nakajima reconnaissance aircraft plus one in storage remainder of hangar space would have held up to 120 replacement aircraft for other carriers and land bases according to lynn lucious moore s shinano jinx carrier us naval institute proceedings february 1953 steel flight deck was covered with a thin shock absorbent latex sawdust composition origin of wood is unclear armament shinanos primary armament consisted of sixteen 40 caliber type 89 dual purpose guns in eight twin mounts two at each corner of hull when firing at surface targets guns had a range of they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute campbell pp 192 93 ship also carried 105 type 96 25 mm light aa guns in 35 triple gun mounts garzke dulin p 79 these guns had an effective range of and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of frequent need to change fifteen round magazines campbell p 200 this was standard japanese light aa gun during world war ii but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective according to historian mark stille weapon had many faults including an inability to handle high speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power its sights were inadequate for high speed targets it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast stille p 51 these guns were supplemented by a dozen 28 round aa rocket launchers each rocket weighed and had a maximum velocity of their maximum range was campbell p 216 four type 94 high angle fire control directors were fitted to control type 89 guns two controlling port side guns were adjacent to their guns while starboard directors were mounted fore and aft on island they could control all of forward and rear guns respectively as necessary type 22 and type 13 air search radars may have been fitted armor ship s original waterline armor belt thickness of was only retained where it had already been installed abreast magazines and reduced to elsewhere below it was a strake of armor that tapered in thickness from to at its bottom edge flat portion of armor deck over machinery and magazine spaces ranging from was retained and sloped portion that angled downward towards bottom of main armor belt was thick large external anti torpedo bulges below waterline provided main defense against torpedoes backed up by an armored bulkhead extending down from belt armor bulkhead was intended to prevent splinters from piercing main hull and though not watertight was backed by a second one which was joint between upper and lower armor belts was weak and proved to be a serious problem when struck by torpedoes garzke dulin pp 79 80 even though shinanos avgas tanks were protected by armor that could resist a shell ijn attempted to isolate tanks from rest of ship with a cofferdam however investigation into loss of taiho had revealed that her avgas tanks had sprung leaks after she was torpedoed resulting fumes then penetrated cofferdam and exploded therefore ijn thought it prudent to fill empty spaces between tanks and cofferdam with of concrete to prevent any fumes from escaping launching thumb 200px right toshio abe ship was originally scheduled for completion in april 1945 but construction was expedited after defeat at battle of philippine sea in june 1944 as ijn anticipated that united states would now be able to bomb japan with long range aircraft from bases in mariana islands builder was unable to increase number of workers on shinano and could not meet new deadline of october even so pressure to finish as quickly as possible led to poor workmanship by workforce garzke dulin p 80 shinanos launch on 8 october 1944 with captain toshio abe in command was marred by what some considered an ill omened accident during floating out procedure one of caissons at end of dock unexpectedly lifted as water rose to level of harbor no one had checked to ensure that all caissons were properly ballasted with seawater sudden of water into graving dock pushed carrier into forward end damaging bow structure below waterline and requiring repairs in drydock these were completed by 26 october commissioning and sinking departure from yokosuka on 19 november 1944 shinano was formally commissioned at yokosuka having spent previous two weeks fitting out and performing sea trials tully worried about her safety after a u s reconnaissance bomber fly over navy general staff ordered shinano to depart for kure by no later than 28 november where remainder of her fitting out would take place abe asked for a delay in sailing date as majority of her watertight doors had yet to be installed compartment air tests had not been conducted and many holes in compartment bulkheads for electrical cables ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed importantly fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable even though most of crew had sea going experience holtzworth pp 26 27 they lacked training in portable pumps on board garzke dulin pp 83 84 escorting destroyers and had just returned from battle of leyte gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate enright ryan pp 31 32 abe s request was denied and shinano departed as scheduled with escorting destroyers at 18 00 on 28 november abe commanded a crew of 2 175 officers and men also on board were 300 shipyard workers and 40 civilian employees watertight doors and hatches were left open for ease of access to machinery spaces as were some manholes in double and triple bottomed hull garzke dulin p 82 abe preferred a daylight passage since it would have allowed him extra time to train his crew and given destroyer crews time to rest however he was forced to make a nighttime run when he learned navy general staff could not provide air support enright ryan p 25 shinano carried six shinyo suicide boats and 50 ohka suicide flying bombs her other aircraft were not planned to come aboard until later her orders were to go to kure where she would complete fitting out and then deliver kamikaze craft to philippines and okinawa traveling at an average speed of she needed sixteen hours to cover 300 miles 480 km to kure as a measure of how important shinano was to naval command abe was slated for promotion to rear admiral once its fitting out was complete enright ryan pp 19 20 attacked thumb left archerfish on surface june 1945 at 20 48 american submarine commanded by commander joseph f enright picked up shinano and her escorts on her radar and pursued them on a parallel course over an hour and a half earlier shinano had detected submarine s radar enright ryan p 21 29 normally shinano would have been able to outrun archerfish but zig zagging movement of carrier and her escorts intended to evade any american subs in area inadvertently turned task group back into sub s path on several occasions at 22 45 carrier s lookouts spotted archerfish on surface and isokaze broke formation against orders to investigate abe ordered destroyer to return to formation without attacking because he believed that submarine was part of an american wolfpack he assumed archerfish was being used as a decoy to lure away one of escorts to allow rest of pack a clear shot at shinano he ordered his ships to turn away from submarine with expectation of outrunning it counting on his margin of speed over submarine around 23 22 carrier was forced to reduce speed to same speed as archerfish to prevent damage to propeller shaft when a bearing overheated enright ryan pp 66 94 101 at 02 56 on 29 november shinano turned to southwest and headed straight for archerfish eight minutes later archerfish turned east and submerged in preparation to attack enright ordered his torpedoes set for a depth of in case they ran deeper than set he also intended to increase chances of capsizing ship by punching holes higher up in hull a few minutes later shinano turned south exposing her entire side to archerfish a nearly ideal firing situation for a submarine escorting destroyer on that side passed right over archerfish without detecting her at 03 15 archerfish fired six torpedoes before diving to to escape a depth charge attack from escorts enright ryan pp 141 43 150 58 161 four torpedoes struck shinano at an average depth of first hit towards stern flooding refrigerated storage compartments and one of empty aviation gasoline storage tanks and killing many of sleeping engineering personnel in compartments above second hit compartment where starboard outboard propeller shaft entered hull and flooded outboard engine room third hit further forward flooding no 3 boiler room and killing every man on watch structural failures caused two adjacent boiler rooms to flood as well fourth flooded starboard air compressor room adjacent anti aircraft gun magazines and no 2 damage control station and ruptured adjacent oil tank enright ryan pp 159 60 sinking thumb upright 1 4 left diagram showing locations of torpedo hits and ensuing flooding red shows compartments immediately flooded orange slowly flooded and yellow deliberate flooding to offset ship s list though severe damage to shinano was at first judged to be manageable crew were confident in ship s armor and strength which translated into lax initial efforts to save ship this overconfidence extended to abe he doubted sub s torpedoes could inflict serious damage since he was well aware that american torpedoes were inferior to japanese torpedoes in both potency and accuracy he ordered carrier to maintain its maximum speed even after last torpedo hit this pushed more water through holes in hull resulting in extensive flooding within a few minutes she was listing 10 degrees to starboard despite crew pumping of water into port bilges list increased to 13 degrees enright ryan pp 162 65 when it became apparent damage was more severe than first thought abe ordered a change of course towards shiono point progressively increasing flooding increased list to 15 degrees by 03 30 fifty minutes later abe ordered empty port outboard tanks to be counter flooded reducing list to 12 degrees for a brief time after 05 00 he ordered civilian workers to be transferred to escorts as they were impeding crew in their duties enright ryan pp 172 75 a half hour later shinano was making 10 knots with a 13 degree list at 06 00 her list had increased to 20 degrees after starboard boiler room flooded at which point valves of port trimming tanks rose above waterline and became ineffective engines shut down for lack of steam around 07 00 and abe ordered all of propulsion compartments evacuated an hour later he then ordered three outboard port boiler rooms flooded in a futile attempt to reduce carrier s list he also ordered hamakaze and isokaze to take her in tow however two destroyers only displaced between them about one fourteenth of shinanos displacement and not nearly enough to overcome her deadweight first tow cables snapped under strain and second attempt was aborted for fear of injury to crews if they snapped again ship lost all power around 09 00 and was now listing over 20 degrees at 10 18 abe gave order to abandon ship by this time shinano had a list of 30 degrees as she heeled water flowed into open elevator well on her flight deck sucking many swimming sailors back into ship as she sank a large exhaust vent below flight deck also sucked many other sailors into ship as she submerged enright ryan pp 185 98 at 10 57 shinano finally capsized and sank stern first at coordinates from nearest land in approximately of water taking 1 435 officers men and civilians to their deaths dead included abe and both of his navigators who chose to go down with ship rescued were 55 officers and 993 petty officers and enlisted men plus 32 civilians for a total of 1 080 survivors after their rescue survivors were isolated on island of mitsuko jima until january 1945 to suppress news of carrier s loss enright ryan p 213 carrier was formally struck from naval register on 31 august us naval intelligence did not initially believe enright s claim to have sunk a carrier shinanos construction had not been detected through decoded radio messages or other means and american analysts believed that they had located all of japan s surviving carriers enright was eventually credited with sinking a carrier by acting commander of pacific fleet s submarine force on basis of a drawing enright submitted depicting ship he had attacked americans only learned about existence of shinano after war following this discovery enright was credited with her sinking and awarded navy cross blair pp 779 80 post war analysis of sinking post war analysis by u s naval technical mission to japan noted that shinano had serious design flaws specifically joint between waterline armor belt on upper hull and anti torpedo bulge on underwater portion was poorly designed a trait shared by yamato class battleships torpedoes all exploded along this joint force of torpedo explosions also dislodged an i beam in one of boiler rooms which punched a hole into another boiler room in addition failure to test for water tightness in each compartment played a role as potential leaks could not be found and patched before shinano put to sea holtzworth pp 26 28 executive officer blamed large amount of water that entered ship on failure to air test compartments for leaks he reported hearing air rushing through gaps in water tight doors just minutes after last torpedo hit a sign that seawater was rapidly entering ship proving doors were unseaworthy enright ryan p 164 see
