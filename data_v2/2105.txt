route 25 is a numbered state highway located in plymouth county and barnstable county massachusetts united states route is a nominally east west freeway for its entire length and less commonly known as blue star memorial highway an eastward continuation of interstate 495 route 25 provides freeway access to cape cod route s western terminus is at a trumpet interchange with i 495 and i 195 in wareham route has three numbered interchanges along its length before terminating at northern end of bourne bridge in bourne mainline of route 25 continues across bridge and over cape cod canal as massachusetts route 28 south prior to 1982 route 25 designation was given to that segment of what is now i 495 from route 24 in raynham to interchange with i 195 in wareham upon completion of i 495 segment between route 24 and i 95 that portion of existing freeway was redesignated as i 495 in various stages during 1970s and 1980s eventually reducing route 25 to a segment that continued eastward from i 495 to modern location of exit 2 in downtown wareham construction of an eastern continuation of route 25 to bourne bridge was delayed for nearly three decades due to property disputes and environmental concerns but final segment opened in 1987 freeway was originally planned to continue over bourne bridge into cape cod as part of southside connector but this plan was abandoned by massachusetts highway department masshighway in late 1970s route description thumb left alt ground level view of three lanes of a divided freeway with two green exit signs directly overhead sign on

village of buzzards bay to south route passes union pond and dicks pond to south and spectacle pond and sandy pond to north before entering town of plymouth in plymouth route 25 passes to north of several cranberry bogs and small ponds while freeway has no interchanges in plymouth a rest area is located off eastbound route 25 in town area is inaccessible from westbound route 25 due to state funding cutbacks services at rest area are limited to summer weekends friday to sunday as of 2010 after rest area route 25 passes over bourne road and turns sharply to head in a southwestern direction route passes under bournedale road after entering town of bourne in bourne route 25 has its final interchange exit 3 formerly exit 2 serves villages of buzzards bay and sagamore connecting to us 6 scenic highway and route 28 north from exit 3 us 6 is used to access sagamore bridge in northern bourne and towns of hyannis and provincetown on cape cod after exit 3 route 25 designation continues for six lane freeway narrows into a four lane undivided highway shortly before approach ramps to bourne bridge route 25 is concurrent with route 28 from exit 3 until us 6 underpass at which point route 25 designation officially ends two eastbound lanes of route 25 continue as route 28 south over bourne bridge and cape cod canal and onto cape cod route 28 continues southward to town of falmouth and then eastward to hyannis and orleans an estimated daily average of over 35 000 motorists utilized route 25 expressway in 2008 history early alignment thumb left alt ground level view of a three

date back to 1947 when massachusetts department of public works massdpw announced plans for an expressway that would link i 95 in foxborough with cape cod planned route was given route 25 designation northwest of a planned interchange with fall river expressway route 24 in raynham and route 28 designation to southeast of route 24 after ten years of planning studies route received preliminary approval from massdpw in 1957 and construction began in 1958 entire route was designated as route 25 in 1962 with route 28 instead being aligned on local roads portion of freeway between route 24 in raynham and i 195 in wareham was completed in 1967 in 1969 massdpw extended freeway eastward to us 6 in wareham in 1970s massdpw changed planned designation of unconstructed route 25 expressway northwest of route 24 to i 495 when this portion of i 495 was completed in 1982 state also designated existing alignment of route 25 between route 24 and i 195 interchange in wareham as i 495 after reassignment route 25 was shortened to a stretch from i 195 east to downtown wareham from 1969 until 1987 eastern terminus of route 25 was at a junction with maple springs road us 6 and route 28 in wareham near modern location of exit 2 massdpw and massachusetts highway department masshighway had plans to extend freeway eastward to cape cod as early as 1953 when route was included in proposed cape cod expressway that would connect new york city with cape cod route 25 was originally planned to connect to sagamore bridge which carried us 6 over cape cod canal and was used to access towns of hyannis and provincetown in 1962 however massdpw conducted traffic studies on two bridges crossing canal and found that sagamore bridge was above vehicular capacity whereas more southern bourne bridge had excess capacity route 25 freeway was then redesigned to cross over bourne bridge and connect with mid cape highway us 6 on southern side of canal via proposed southside connector connector would have been constructed through massachusetts military reservation in bourne but was canceled by massdpw and masshighway in 1977 when environmental tests indicated freeway would disturb underground aquifers serving as water sources for region massdpw instead changed proposed eastern terminus of route 25 expressway to approach ramps of bourne bridge completion of freeway thumb alt ground level view of three lanes of a divided expressway two large green exit signs are visible in distance and road is surrounded by dense forests eastbound route 25 near exit 3 and freeway s eastern terminus route 28 is unsigned at this interchange construction of route 25 east of wareham however was delayed for nearly three decades to property disputes environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in buzzards bay village who claimed freeway would divert all traffic and their business elsewhere leaving a ghost town in its wake proposed alignment ran through land where much of state s cranberry harvest was located and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays in particular farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests throughout 1970s and 1980s massdpw developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to cranberry crops engineers for department developed four different drainage systems to be used along length of freeway that would divert runoff away from wareham river basin in addition freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water freeway was also delayed due to a larger property dispute with hope ingersoll owner of grazing fields farm on bournedale road in bourne well known in region as an artists colony and a producer of organic food massdpw proposed constructing route 25 through center of farm but ingersoll hired engineers to develop an alternate routing in 1978 massdpw rejected ingersoll s design instead approving alignment that ran through farmland seized by eminent domain in 1980 a state judge ruled that massdpw had to conduct environmental studies on both original routing and ingersoll s proposal massdpw eventually opted to construct ingersoll s design giving route 25 a longer alignment that arced to north and east of grazing fields farm before turning westward toward buzzards bay business district and bourne bridge route finally began construction in 1982 and in 1989 massdpw was forced to pay ingersoll 2 6 million 1982 usd for of farmland seized for expressway s construction in 1987 final segment of route 25 from maple springs road in wareham to bourne bridge was completed a rest area and information center in plymouth also opened with freeway new expressway relieved congestion along us 6 and route 28 in buzzards bay business district greatly reducing number of accidents along approach to bourne bridge in 2007 masshighway completed a renumbering of three interchanges along length of route 25 as part of a signing upgrade project previously i 195 interchange had been numbered exit 1 as part of i 495 s numbering scheme with onset interchange also being exit 1 as part of route 25 s own scheme this led to a confusing situation in which road had two consecutive exit 1s so masshighway devised a solution in which i 495 and ma 25 would share exit 1 i 195 interchange and all other exits on ma 25 would be bumped up a number due to previous confusion and despite solution massdot has enacted a proposition which would have ma 25 cease to exist and be replaced by i 495 but has yet to implement plan which has been postponed indefinitely exit list all interchanges were to be renumbered to mileage based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016 proposed new numbers from west to east were 0 3 and 10 however this project was indefinitely postponed by massdot until on november 18 2019 massdot confirmed that beginning in late summer 2020 exit renumbering project will begin see also
