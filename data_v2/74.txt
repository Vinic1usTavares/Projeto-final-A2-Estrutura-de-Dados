musical chord comprising at least three adjacent tones in a scale prototypical tone clusters are based on chromatic scale and are separated by semitones for instance three adjacent piano keys such as c c and d struck simultaneously produce a tone cluster variants of tone cluster include chords comprising adjacent tones separated or on piano such clusters often involve simultaneous striking of neighboring white or black keys early years of twentieth century saw tone clusters elevated to central roles in pioneering works by ragtime artists jelly roll morton and scott joplin in 1910s two classical avant composer pianists leo ornstein and henry cowell were recognized as making first extensive explorations of tone cluster during same period charles ives employed them in several compositions that were not publicly performed until late 1920s or 1930s composers such as bela bartok and later lou harrison and karlheinz stockhausen became proponents of tone cluster which feature in work of many 20th and 21st century classical composers tone clusters play a significant role as well in work of free jazz musicians such as cecil taylor and matthew shipp in most western music tone clusters tend to be heard as dissonant clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously as well as by most groups of instruments or voices keyboard instruments are particularly suited to performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them music theory and classification thumb right 250px modern keyboard is designed for playing a diatonic scale on white keys and a pentatonic scale on black keys chromatic scales involve both three immediately adjacent keys produce a basic chromatic tone cluster prototypical tone clusters are chords of three or more adjacent notes on a chromatic scale that is three or more adjacent pitches each separated by only a semitone three note stacks based on diatonic and pentatonic scales are also strictly speaking tone clusters however these stacks involve intervals between notes greater than half tone gaps of chromatic kind this can readily be seen on a keyboard where pitch of each key is separated from next by one semitone visualizing black keys as extending to edge of keyboard diatonic scales conventionally played on white keys contain only two semitone intervals rest are full tones in western musical traditions pentatonic scales conventionally played on black keys are built entirely from intervals larger than a semitone commentators thus tend to identify diatonic and pentatonic stacks as tone clusters only when they consist of four or more successive notes in scale see nicholls 1991 p 155 in standard western classical music practice all tone clusters are classifiable as secundal chords that is they are constructed from minor seconds intervals of one semitone major seconds intervals of two semitones or in case of certain pentatonic clusters augmented seconds intervals of three semitones stacks of adjacent microtonal pitches also constitute tone clusters jones 2008 p 91 wilkins

distinguishing them from ornamented figures involving and like their effect also tends to be different where ornamentation is used to draw attention to harmony or relationship between harmony and melody tone clusters are for most part employed as independent sounds while by definition notes that form a cluster must sound at same time there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at same moment for example in r murray schafer s choral epitaph for moonlight 1968 a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section soprano alto tenor bass into four parts each of sixteen

seachrist 2003 p 215 n 15 a tone cluster is a dissonant group of tones lying close together as noted by alan belkin however instrumental timbre can have a significant impact on their effect clusters are quite aggressive on organ but soften enormously when played by strings possibly because slight continuous fluctuations of pitch in latter provide some inner mobility in his first published work on topic henry cowell observed that a tone cluster is more pleasing and acceptable to ear if its outer limits form a consonant interval cowell 1921 pp 112 113 cowell explains natural spacing of so called dissonances is as seconds as in overtone series rather than sevenths and groups spaced in seconds may be made to sound particularly if played in conjunction with fundamental chord notes taken from lower in same overtone series blends them together and explains them to ear cowell henry 1969 new musical resources p 111 139 new york something else tone clusters have also been considered noise as

promoting cluster harmonic technique ornstein abandoned concert stage in early 1920s and anyway clusters had served him as practical harmonic devices not as part of a larger theoretical mission in case of ives clusters comprised a relatively small part of his compositional output much of which went unheard for years for intellectually ambitious cowell who heard ornstein perform in new york in 1916 clusters were crucial to future of music he set out to explore their overall cumulative and often programmatic effects broyles 2004 p 342 n 10 dynamic motion 1916 for solo piano written when cowell was nineteen has been described as probably first piece anywhere using secundal chords independently for musical extension and variation bartok et al 1963 p 14 unpaginated though that is not quite accurate it does appear to be first piece to employ chromatic clusters in such a manner a solo piano piece cowell wrote following year tides of manaunaun 1917 would prove to be his most popular work and composition most responsible for establishing tone cluster as a significant element in western classical music cowell s early piano works are often erroneously dated in two cases above as 1914 and 1912 respectively correct dating of cowell s early works is per hicks 2002 pp 80 85 correct dating of cowell s work in general is per standard catalogue lichtenwanger 1986 assumed by some to involve an essentially random or more kindly aleatoric pianistic approach cowell would explain that precision is required in writing and performance of tone clusters no less than with any other musical feature tone clusters on piano are whole scales of tones used as chords or at least three contiguous tones along a scale being used as a chord and at times if these chords exceed number of tones that you have fingers on your hand it may be necessary to play these either with flat of hand or sometimes with full forearm this is not done from standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique although it actually amounts to that but rather because this is only practicable method of playing such large chords it should be obvious that these chords are exact and that one practices diligently in order to play them with desired tone quality and to have them absolutely precise in nature cowell 1993 12 16 13 14 historian and critic kyle gann describes broad range of ways in which cowell constructed and thus performed his clusters and used them as musical textures sometimes with a top note brought out melodically sometimes accompanying a left hand melody in parallel beginning in 1921 with an article serialized in freeman an irish cultural journal cowell popularized term tone cluster hicks 2002 pp 106 8 while he did not coin phrase as is often claimed he appears to have been first to use it with its current meaning see seachrist 2003 p 215 n 15 for an example of a claim that term was invented by henry cowell tone cluster had been used with a different meaning since

consistency to maintain a whole succession of clusters once they are begun since one alone or even two may be heard as a mere effect rather than as an independent and significant procedure carried with musical logic to its inevitable conclusion quoted in gann 1997 p 174 in later classical music thumb right bela bartok and henry cowell met in december 1923 early next year hungarian composer wrote cowell to ask whether he might adopt tone clusters without causing offense in 1922 composer dane a friend of cowell s declared approvingly that development of tone cluster imperilled existence
