1988 armenian earthquake also known as spitak earthquake occurred on december 7 at with a surface wave magnitude of 6 8 and a maximum msk intensity of x devastating shock occurred in northern region of armenia then part of soviet union which is vulnerable to large and destructive earthquakes and is part of a larger active seismic belt that stretches from alps to himalayas activity in area is associated with tectonic plate boundary interaction and source of event was slip on a thrust fault just to north of spitak complex incident ruptured multiple faults with a strike slip event occurring shortly after initiation of mainshock between 25 000 and 50 000 were killed and up to 130 000 were injured seismologists thoroughly studied effects of spitak event including mainshock and aftershock fault rupture mechanisms and were on site setting up temporary seismometers before end of 1988 earthquake engineering experts scrutinized building construction styles and found fault in poorly constructed apartments and other buildings that were built during era of stagnation under rule of leonid brezhnev cities of spitak leninakan gyumri and kirovakan were greatly affected with large losses of life and devastating effects to buildings and other structures a number of smaller outlying villages away from larger population centers were also severely affected despite tensions of cold war soviet leader mikhail gorbachev formally asked united states for humanitarian help within a few days of earthquake first such request since late 1940s one hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to soviet union in form of rescue equipment search teams and medical supplies private donations and assistance from non governmental organizations also had a large part of international effort while transporting some of these supplies to region a soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 military personnel and a transport plane from yugoslavia were both destroyed in separate incidents in support of relief effort recording artists united to produce several music related contributions for victims of quake a song was produced by a duo of french composers including charles aznavour and a studio album that featured songs donated by mainstream rock bands was released from rock aid armenia effort by british music industry preface beginning with late 1987 caucasus region was experiencing a surge in political turmoil with large and near constant demonstrations being held in capital of yerevan beginning in february 1988 for fifteen months prior to earthquake and at times up to hundreds of thousands of protesters represented by karabakh committee were demanding both democracy and unification of nagorno karabakh administered by soviet azerbaijan but disputed autonomous territory with an 80 armenian majority and azerbaijani minority in mountains of karabakh region unrest and opposition movement began in september 1988 with negotiations between karabakh committee and gorbachev taking place throughout most of 1989 relationship between soviet authorities and armenian society took a turn for worse in march and developments climaxed in november when a state of emergency was declared along with a nighttime curfew and a mass movement of up to 50 000 armenians fleeing ethnic violence arrived from azerbaijan earthquake thumb usgs shakemap showing december 7 mainshock intensity source of event was a fault rupture south of caucasus mountains a mountain range that has been produced by convergence of arabian and eurasian tectonic plates range is situated along an active seismic belt that stretches from alps in southern europe to himalayas in asia seismicity along this belt is marked by frequent major earthquakes from aegean sea through turkey and iran and into afghanistan though recurrence of seismic events in armenia does not reach high frequency that is seen in other segments of this zone rapid crustal deformation there is associated with active thrust faulting and volcanic activity mount ararat a dormant volcano lies to south of quake s epicenter in turkey earthquake occurred along a known thrust fault striking parallel to caucasus range and dipping to north northeast bruce bolt a seismologist and a professor of earth and planetary science at university of california berkeley walked length of fault scarp in 1992 and found that vertical displacement measured along most of length with southwest end reaching during earthquake northeast facing side of spitak section rode up and over southwest facing side waveform modeling established that faulting originated at a depth of with epicenter on alavar thrust fault on slopes of lesser caucasus mountains north of mount aragats mainshock produced surface rupture and propagated to west with a separate strike slip sub event occurring two seconds later that propagated to southeast going westward fault split into two branches a north dipping reverse fault north branch and a right slip fault south branch but neither produced surface rupture a total of five sub events occurred in first eleven seconds and an aftershock measuring 5 8 local magnitude occurred four minutes and twenty seconds later damage thumb left building damage in leninakan some of strongest shaking occurred in industrial areas with chemical and food processing plants electrical substations and power plants metsamor nuclear power plant around from epicenter experienced only minor shaking and no damage occurred there but was eventually closed for a period of six years due to vulnerability concerns it was reopened in 1995 amid criticism of lack of training political instability in caucasus region and accusations that plant was of inadequate design at that time international atomic energy agency s assistant director general morris rosen said of situation you would never build a plant in that area that s for sure with what s known now many buildings did not hold up to shaking of earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space but lack of effective medical care and poor planning also contributed to substantial scope of disaster buildings that didn t collapse featured well maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for building to resist seismic waves most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood earthquake but hospitals did not fare well most collapsed killing two thirds of their doctors destroying equipment and medicine and reducing capacity to handle critical medical needs in region soviet news media and government officials soon began to discuss apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of armenia s buildings to collapse gorbachev in a tv interview several weeks after his expedited return from new york city said that concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete and suggested that concrete had been stolen leonid deputy chairman of state building committee stated that many newer homes collapsed as well and that he was beginning an investigation into matter and that criminal charges would be brought official communist party newspaper pravda said that poor construction like other issues of neglect in soviet system could be blamed on era of stagnation from era of leonid brezhnev a team of earthquake and engineering experts from united states spent a period of time in armenia in december 1988 and january 1989 group including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic resistant designs agreed that building inadequacies were primary reason why strong but not huge earthquake was so damaging although freezing temperatures also played a role in unusually high death toll earthquake death toll was by far highest worldwide in 1980s and third highest worldwide in period 1971 2003 33 years engineers who scrutinized damaged buildings and rescue workers who had dismantled buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for failure of buildings soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate known seismic risk in area but they acknowledged to team that many of buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude an engineer with team stated that regulations for area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on twelve degree medvedev sponheuer karnik scale earthquake s effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale thumb severely damaged masonry buildings in spitak three cities closest to fault rupture experienced different levels of damage both leninakan and kirovakan were roughly equidistant from shock yet leninakan had greater damage this may be explained by a sedimentary layer that is present beneath city earthquake engineering research institute s team compared building damage in each city and observed similar results when comparing stone buildings four stories or less in height but for taller frame stone buildings 62 were destroyed at leninakan while only 23 collapsed at kirovakan while on site during aftershock monitoring us research team verified presence of soil amplification effects when pronounced difference in readings were observed when compared with nearby rock sites uneven distribution of seismic energy may have also contributed to fluctuation in damage in late december last of survivors that were able to be extricated were pulled from fallen buildings rescue operations ceased and cleanup began beginning with destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired six friends were in basement of a nine story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on december 7 their injuries were minor but one person did suffer a broken arm they supposedly sustained themselves on food supplies fruit salad pickles and smoked ham that were available in basement for 35 days before their rescue in january but this turned out to be a hoax aftershocks area where armenia lies is of interest to seismologists and geologists because of relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because earthquake s strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting twelve days after mainshock a french soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in epicentral area to record aftershock activity a separate expedition from united states also visited site initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up seismometers and optimizing their operation and with that complete two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1 500 km2 final stage concluded with seven weeks through end of february 1989 of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units instrumentation included ten smoked paper analog seismometers that were configured to allow for 48 hours of continuous single component data recording six digital recorders built by institut de physique du globe de strasbourg were also used to record signals from three component seismometers eight of selected sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an fm telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three component unit was stationed there seismic signals were digitized along with an internal time signal and an external time signal and stored on magnetic tape tapes were then played back and p wave and s wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for first several days of expedition and at end of recording period in february equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from more accurate telemetry network soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of tnt in a hole drilled near mainshock epicenter and resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5 3 to 5 4 km s epicenters of recorded aftershocks formed a relatively narrow band on east end events were shallow while western side where majority of larger aftershocks were concentrated were up to deep shocks at southeastern segment indicated right lateral strike slip movement along a nearly vertical fault and may have been related to alavar fault moving westward closer to central segments though a transition of fault type was becoming apparent where an almost equal distribution of reverse fault mechanisms were observed as strike slip type east central segment coincided with surface breaks between spitak and while west central portion s break was concealed under an anticline and was not visible at surface along western segments fault split into two branches with one to southwest and other to northwest liquefaction buildings and other structures were extensively damaged during earthquake but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist but few exist with respect to gravel and gravelly sands in certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands first well documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was in regard to 1983 borah peak earthquake in united states several investigations of that event took place in 1980s and early 1990s and primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils three locations between spitak and to west that were within several kilometers of fault were examined for ground disturbances and each site was scrutinized for effects of liquefaction first site was on highway that linked three most damaged cities and was adjacent to a tributary of pambak river where water table was close to surface highway s embankment failed and though site was repaired immediately resulting damage to highway caused considerable delay in getting people and supplies into and out of area following disaster numerous sand boils were seen in region northwest of spitak including within of failed embankment a second site that was close to fault also near pambak river and with similar soil deposits did not experience liquefaction though it would have experienced same high peak ground accelerations as failed highway embankment aftermath thumb 240px holy saviour s church in gyumri after earthquake avant garde musician pierre schaeffer led a 498 member french rescue team to look for survivors in leninakan and worked there until all foreign personnel were asked to leave after plan to bulldoze what was left of ruins was formulated total number of volunteer rescue personnel in leninakan totalled 2 000 with teams from austria canada switzerland united states and yugoslavia nikolai ryzhkov then chairman of council of ministers was awarded national hero of armenia for his work in rebuilding city following earthquake seventy eight people were killed while on a relief mission to leninakan when a soviet ilyushin il 76 crashed on approach to airport there nine crew and 69 military personnel were on board plane that struck a helicopter in foggy conditions at small airport that was overrun with rescue flights in days following earthquake normally quiet airstrip was receiving up to 180 flights per day carrying food medical supplies and disaster management experts those who were killed on plane were planning to join an estimated 20 000 soldiers and 85 000 civil defence workers in rescue efforts by searching for survivors supplying food and water and setting up sanitation facilities in region at yerevan airport western pilots reported a breakdown in air traffic control communications with flight controllers not delivering necessary flight navigation instructions allowing for a critical lack of separation as foreign planes made their way into area a second air transport incident occurred following day at yerevan capital of armenian soviet socialist republic when an antonov an 12 from yugoslavia crashed killing all seven crew on board crash was blamed on pilots failure to properly adjust altimeter following a miscommunication with air traffic controllers a group of french recording artists and actors came together with french writer and composer charles aznavour to record 1989 song pour toi for you armenia aznavour together with armenian french composer georges formed a foundation called aznavour for armenia and composed song as a call for help for armenians it took six weeks from creation of song to completion of disc and with almost two million copies sold foundation was able to build 47 schools and three orphanages for victims of disaster rock aid armenia also known in earlier stages as live aid armenia was a humanitarian effort by british music industry to raise money to help those affected by earthquake a monument armenian earthquake expressing appreciation of armenian people for assistance from u s was erected in washington d c in 1990 response thumb a french search and rescue worker searches for buried people with aid of a detection dog gorbachev set aside 5 billion rubles about us 8 billion in funds for a start on what would likely be a recovery cost that would exceed cleanup bill for 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in ukraine while foreign doctors did assist with chernobyl incident soviet relief effort after earthquake was augmented by largest foreign cooperation since world war ii that deluge of western aid was a byproduct of disaster that may have had a positive effect on soviet union united states relations cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for perestroika gorbachev s plan for economic restructuring another adverse effect of disaster was that armenians were already distrustful of gorbachev s dismissal of their claims to disputed territory of nagorno karabakh which armenians had been contesting with neighboring azerbaijan world responded rapidly to disaster in leninakan and spitak with much of europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies rescue equipment and trained personnel to assist in recovery and even more reinforcement came in from latin america and far east mikhail gorbachev was in new york on his first day of visits with ronald reagan and george h w bush at time of earthquake and once scale of disaster was realized a quick departure was made back to armenia with kremlin formally asking for american help washington immediately responded with offers of doctors medical equipment and rescue teams and by first weekend first us plane arrived in yerevan with search and rescue teams and detection dogs french arrived in armenia in late evening on friday december 9 and relieved exhausted armenian workers who then returned to yerevan japan sent a monetary gift of 9 million while italy had plans to build a prefabricated village for victims and west germany offered to send more than a dozen heavy cranes americans donated generously as well with washington dispatching eight official of official relief aid plus a lockheed c 141 starlifter from italy private donations from united states were also significant chrysler chairman lee arranged for a fund drive and in chicago one of five major armenian population centers in us community raised 800 000 and donated of supplies thumb left mikhail gorbachev with ronald reagan and george h w bush in new york on day of earthquake american businessman and philanthropist armand hammer well known to soviet union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties left los angeles for armenia on board a boeing 727 loaded with of medical supplies that were provided by american red cross hammer known for his decades of work with occidental petroleum corporation had spoken with gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him 1 million in relief funds half of those funds were from world vision international a california based relief and development umbrella organization and other half were his own personal donation flight also carried robert president of world vision and a ucla doctor who had worked in aftermath of 1985 mexico city earthquake red tape inevitably held up some of rescue efforts and criticism of perceived flawed processes soon followed newspaper pravda complained that lack of cranes meant that seconds and hours are being lost that means lives paper also stated that too many soviet personnel were giving advice and not enough people were actually searching daily newspaper noted that there were families living out in open even while there were an abundance of tents available health minister yevgeniy urged creation of a governmental body to assist with disaster management baxter international an american health care company with headquarters in deerfield illinois designed and built a flying medical lab set up with 20 dialysis machines to be used with victims suffering from crush syndrome trauma associated with building collapses but were unable to get started for four days until visas were available with hospitals destroyed and their limited knowledge of care requirements soviets were not well equipped to deal with cases of crush syndrome author and professor of geopolitics pierre verluise detailed in his 1995 book armenia in crisis 1988 earthquake how a french doctor and director of a leninakan hospital described that he had seen one hundred victims suffering from syndrome each day during first three days in order to prevent kidney failure or death treatment requires prompt hospitalization and according to doctor victims were not receiving adequate medication and dialysis and as a result most died before arrival of first foreign dialysis machines rebuilding in february 1989 one hundred construction workers were assembling temporary housing for themselves in leninakan with a plan to start on local population s housing by end of month though schools and factories were also on list of facilities to be rebuilt deputy chairman of a city building and architecture council said that updated building codes like those in united states were being drafted along with a strict requirement that new protocols be respected and that new buildings would be no taller than four stories and would be located away from areas with highest seismic risk other officials decided that town would be relocated several kilometers to southwest as of july 1989 about 500 million in donations had been delivered to armenians from 113 countries most of those funds went into initial relief work and medical care plus beginning portion of rebuilding phase yuri s mkhitarian an armenian state building committee official gave an updated damage report that included some of outlying communities away from population centers stating that 342 villages were damaged and another 58 were destroyed negative effect earthquake had on economy of armenia was apparent mkhitarian said that 130 factories were destroyed and 170 000 people were out of work officials acknowledged that work to complete rebuilding may take up to five years or longer a supposition that more than doubled gorbachev s estimate of two years at that time 20 projects had completed planning process and some had been approved and construction started in leninakan there was a need for 18 new hospitals 12 of which could be funded with assistance of republics of soviet union but foreign help would be required to build six additional facilities boris karapetyan director of earthquake studies at yerevan polytechnical institute said of difficult rebuilding process coordination is a major major problem this is a massive undertaking and foreign involvement is both a necessary and a complicating factor we need foreign assistance and there is no doubt about that but our friends do not know local conditions and propose things that cannot or should not be built in an earthquake prone region soviets and an american group of architects each devised separate outlines for rebuilding town of spitak following an invitation by soviets for a critique of their plan american proposal was ultimately accepted as way forward new plan would deviate from soviet styles that were found to be rigid and outdated and would mirror characteristics of local culture for many years following world war ii soviets practiced a methodical top down approach to urban planning and building constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units and soviets plan for rebuilding spitak did not diverge from that approach soviet s grid plan road scheme was found to not take into account hillside at new city s location and american plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped together in an open and communal style gallery other events earthquake on october 20 1827 was centred about southeast of spitak and had a maximum intensity of viii on medvedev sponheuer karnik scale while that shock may have been related to pambak sevan fault october 22 1926 leninakan
