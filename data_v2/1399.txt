glodwick by james howe carse 1831 depicts early skyline and industrial activities of oldham all green space has since been urbanised much of oldham s history is concerned with textile manufacture during industrial revolution it has been said that if ever industrial revolution placed a town firmly and squarely on map of world that town is oldham oldham s soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing and so for decades prior to industrialisation area was used for grazing sheep which provided raw material for a local woollen weaving trade by 1756 oldham had emerged as centre of hatting industry in england rough felt used in production process is origin of term owdham roughyed a nickname for people from oldham it was not until last quarter of 18th century that oldham changed from being a cottage industry township producing woollen garments via domestic manual labour to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories climate geology and topography of oldham were unrelenting constraints upon social and economic activities of human inhabitants at above sea level and with no major river or visible natural resources oldham had poor geographic attributes compared with other settlements for investors and their engineers as a result oldham played no part in initial period of industrial revolution although it did later become seen as obvious territory to industrialise because of its convenient position between labour forces of manchester and southwest yorkshire cotton spinning and milling were introduced to oldham when its first mill lees hall was built by william clegg in about 1778 beginning of a spiralling process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation within a year 11 other mills had been constructed and by 1818 there were 19 not a large number in comparison with other local settlements oldham s small local population was greatly increased by mass migration of workers from outlying villages resulting in a population increase from just over in 1801 to in 1901 speed of this urban growth meant that oldham with little pre industrial history to speak of was effectively born as a factory town thumb royd mill built in 1907 and seen here in 1983 was one of more than 360 textile mills that operated night and day during oldham s peak oldham became world s manufacturing centre for cotton spinning in second half of 19th century

rectangular brick built mills oldham was hit hard by lancashire cotton famine of 1861 1865 when supplies of raw cotton from united states were cut off wholly reliant upon textile industry cotton famine created chronic unemployment in town by 1863 a committee had been formed and with aid from central government land was purchased with intention of employing local cotton workers to construct alexandra park which opened on 28 august 1865 said to have over relied upon textile sector as importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during 20th century oldham s economy declined into a depression

baronet was most prominent and famous of stott mill architects he established his own practice in 1883 and designed over a hundred mills in several countries his factories which improved upon his father s fireproof mills accounted for a 40 increase in oldham s spindles between 1887 and 1914 although textile related engineering declined with processing industry leading to demise of both stotts and platts other engineering firms existed notably electrical and later electronic engineers ferranti in 1896 ferranti went into receivership in 1993 but some of its former works continue in other

addition to oldham included towns of middleton and chadderton to west oldham coalfield was site of over 150 collieries during its recorded history although some contemporary sources suggest there was coal mining in oldham at a commercial scale by 1738 older sources attribute commercial expansion of coal mining with arrival in town of two welsh labourers john evans and william jones around 1770 foreseeing growth in demand for coal as a source of motive and steam power they acquired colliery rights for oldham which by 1771 had 14 colliers mines were largely to southwest of town around hollinwood and werneth and provided enough coal to accelerate oldham s rapid development at centre of cotton boom at its height in mid 19th century when it was dominated by lees and jones families oldham coal was mainly sourced from many small collieries whose lives varied from a few years to many decades although two of four largest collieries survived to nationalisation in 1851 collieries employed more than 2 000 men in oldham although amount of coal in town was somewhat overestimated however and production began to decline even before that of local spinning industry today only visible
