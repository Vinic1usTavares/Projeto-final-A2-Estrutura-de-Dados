syndication episode was written by brannon braga and directed by robert wiemer executive producer jeri taylor wrote final scene of episode but was uncredited set in 24th century series follows adventures of crew of federation starship enterprise in this episode lt worf michael dorn returns from a bat leth tournament and slowly discovers that he is being moved across parallel universes crew of an alternative enterprise realise what is happening and seek to return him to his own reality but after an attack by a bajoran ship a space time fissure explodes causing hundreds of thousands of alternative versions of enterprise to enter same universe after worf reverses course through fissure he and all versions of enterprise are returned to their respective universes braga intended to focus parallels on jean luc picard patrick stewart but this was changed to worf change was made in order to make differences more obvious across timelines as braga worried that picard s relationships could not significantly differ across near universes producers were concerned with confusing nature of initial proposal but felt that further changes greatly improved it wil wheaton appeared as wesley crusher replacing initial plan to include tasha yar after braga was concerned about copying yesterday s enterprise parallels received nielsen ratings of 12 8 percent one of highest for season but some fans were upset at a worf deanna troi romance critics responded favorably to episode with praise directed at both dorn and marina sirtis plot after competing in a bat leth tournament on planet forcas iii lieutenant worf returns to enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party much to his annoyance as he attends party he starts to notice subtle changes such as flavor of cake changing and a painting given to him by data appearing on a different wall changes start to become more pronounced as a cardassian vessel attacks enterprise unfamiliar controls result in worf failing to raise shields leading to death of geordi la forge despite retaining his initial memories worf has no evidence that reality has changed and his own personal logs support stories given by other crew members other major changes occur riker is captain of enterprise in a reality wherein picard was killed by borg bajorans became oppressors of cardassians and enemies of federation wesley crusher is a lieutenant on enterprise alyssa ogawa is chief medical officer and worf finds himself married to deanna troi upon investigation crew find that worf s rna has an unusual quantum signature and confirm that he is from a different universe crew theorizes that worf on his original return from bat leth tournament passed through a time space fissure with shuttlecraft s engines causing worf to quantum flux between several parallel universes data determines that worf s proximity to la forge s visor caused worf to shift between universes and that each universe covers a different possibility in effect anything that could possibly happen has done so in a parallel universe hence believable changes in reality that worf is experiencing enterprise returns to location of fissure attempting to return worf to his original universe enterprise is then attacked by a bajoran ship which causes fissure to destabilize and various realities to merge resulting in over 285 000 versions of enterprise appearing in same area of space data determines that only way to restore realities is to send worf via shuttlecraft to enterprise of his universe passing through fissure and using shuttlecraft s engines to reseal it after locating correct ship worf begins to travel back but is attacked by another enterprise that has come from a borg overrun universe its crew refusing to return enterprise that he left fires upon hostile ship trying to disable it and accidentally destroys it worf safely passes through fissure finding himself back in normality with a single enterprise in front of him after boarding worf finds that no time has passed since he initially entered fissure when he returns to his room expecting a surprise party he finds only troi waiting to give him a single present and knowing that two are married in many alternate universes he invites her to share dinner with him production writer brannon braga initially conceived of episode as centered on captain picard rather than worf altman gross 1995 p 33 it was only when planning out story that he realised that there would not be a great deal of personal differences across realities with picard as such he decided to include worf as main character and chose to place him in a romance with troi as he felt that most people would not have expected it altman gross 1995 p 34 braga considered writing tasha yar into episode but he felt that this would have copied yesterday s enterprise so he replaced her with wesley crusher played by wil wheaton further changes were made to script as braga had intended for worf to be sung happy birthday to you in klingon language but cost for rights to song would have been prohibitive and so idea was dropped executive producer jeri taylor approved initial outline but was concerned that it might be potentially confusing she was happy with outcome and described it as having worked like gangbusters she felt that worf troi romance had been subtly played by writers on show since fifth season episode ethics and had been an ambition on show since a fistful of datas in sixth season after being included in parallels relationship was featured several times during final season of next generation michael piller was not enthused with initial idea but taylor felt that means by which it evolved saved it braga thought in hindsight that crusher s appearance could have been explained more but at time he felt it was most intriguing if he was just there he also wanted to avoid suggesting that worf was going insane since that theme had been covered in previous season in episode frame of mind director robert wiemer sought to have a conclusive ending to episode to state worf s future intentions worf s suggestion of champagne to troi was written by taylor to accommodate this parallels re used a number of previously seen props and costumes including troi s entire uniform wardrobe with exception of first season outfits other elements such as argus array a space station model had appeared in other episodes and alternative comm badges used in episode had been seen in future imperfect space station deep space 5 was a re dress of regula one from star trek ii wrath of khan modifications were made to bridge set in one reality these would later be re used for future enterprise in series finale all good things effect shot with multiple copies of enterprise was achieved by photographing same model from multiple angles resulting in more than 100 appearing on screen scene with multiple was produced through use of split screens and stand ins nemecek 2003 p 276 this simultaneous portrayal of numerous different universes was cited by roberto orci one of screenwriters for 2009 film star trek as proof that despite movie s creation of a secondary timeline regular trek universe was unaffected and everything from original series onward still went on as it had before he said that parallels was using many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a new timeline does not overwrite a previous one unlike previous episodes in franchise such as city on edge of forever and yesterday s enterprise themes multiverse idea featured in parallels has been discussed by commentators theoretical physicist lawrence m krauss praised episode for inclusion of idea in his book physics of star trek although added that it incorrectly explained measurement in quantum mechanics krauss 1995 p 196 this quantum mechanics theory explained during episode was called a little sketchy by michelle and duncan barrett in their book star trek human factor they based this on mathematical physicist roger penrose s theory that there is no identified physics for bridging gap between physics and quantum physics noted use that star trek franchise has made of idea of multiverse barrett barrett 2001 p 104 and different timelines barrett barrett 2001 p 103 reception and home media release episode aired during week commencing november 27 1993 in broadcast syndication
