city they perceived this route as being expensive to build with no benefit for state nevada officials and lincoln highway association pleaded with utah authorities to change their position even offering funds to help offset additional cost of paving that route however lincoln highway directed travelers destined for both southern and northern california on a route away from utah cities towards central nevada utah instead paved wendover cutoff part of victory highway modern interstate 80 that only directed traffic for northern california out of state choice not to pave lincoln
