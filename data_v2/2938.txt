oxygen toxicity is a condition resulting from harmful effects of breathing molecular oxygen at increased partial pressures severe cases can result in cell damage and death with effects most often seen in central nervous system lungs and eyes historically central nervous system condition was called paul bert effect and pulmonary condition lorrain smith effect after researchers who pioneered discoveries and descriptions in late 19th century oxygen toxicity is a concern for underwater divers those on high concentrations of supplemental oxygen particularly premature babies and those undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia an excess of oxygen in body tissues body is affected in different ways depending on type of exposure central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure symptoms may include disorientation breathing problems and vision changes such as myopia prolonged exposure to above normal oxygen partial pressures or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes collapse of alveoli in lungs retinal detachment and seizures oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing exposure to increased oxygen levels studies show that in long term a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible protocols for avoidance of effects of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher than normal partial pressures including underwater diving using compressed breathing gases hyperbaric medicine neonatal care and human spaceflight these protocols have resulted in increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to problems of managing premature infants in recent years oxygen has become available for recreational use in oxygen bars us food and drug administration has warned those suffering from problems such as heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100 oxygen and should have specific training in using such gases classification center 700px alt effects of high inspired oxygen pressure 1 chemical toxicity pulmonary damage hypoxemia 2 retinal damage erythrocyte hemolysis liver damage heart damage endocrine effects kidney damage destruction of any cell 3 toxic effects on central nervous system twitching convulsions death breathing air with high oxygen pressure can lead to several adverse effects effects of oxygen toxicity may be classified by organs affected producing three principal forms central nervous system characterised by convulsions followed by unconsciousness occurring under hyperbaric conditions pulmonary lungs characterised by difficulty in breathing and pain within chest occurring when breathing increased pressures of oxygen for extended periods ocular conditions characterised by alterations to eyes occurring when breathing increased pressures of oxygen for extended periods central nervous system oxygen toxicity can cause seizures brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness and is of concern to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to lungs causing pain and difficulty in breathing oxidative damage to eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of retina pulmonary and ocular damage are most likely to occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment particularly to newborn infants but are also a concern during hyperbaric oxygen therapy oxidative damage may occur in any cell in body but effects on three most susceptible organs will be primary concern it may also be implicated in damage to red blood cells haemolysis liver heart endocrine glands adrenal glands gonads and thyroid or kidneys and general damage to cells in unusual circumstances effects on other tissues may be observed it is suspected that during spaceflight high oxygen concentrations may contribute to bone damage hyperoxia can also indirectly cause carbon dioxide narcosis in patients with lung ailments such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or with central respiratory depression hyperventilation of atmospheric air at atmospheric pressures does not cause oxygen toxicity because sea level air has a partial pressure of oxygen of whereas toxicity does not occur below

tunnel vision ringing in ears tinnitus nausea twitching especially of face behavioural changes irritability anxiety confusion and dizziness this may be followed by a tonic clonic seizure consisting of two phases intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds tonic phase followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking clonic phase seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness postictal state onset of seizure depends upon partial pressure of oxygen in breathing gas and exposure duration however exposure time before onset is unpredictable as tests have shown a wide variation both amongst individuals and in same individual from day to day in addition many external factors such as underwater immersion exposure to cold and exercise will decrease time to onset of central nervous system symptoms decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide other factors such as darkness and caffeine increase tolerance in test animals but these effects have not been proven in humans lungs pulmonary toxicity symptoms result from an inflammation that starts in airways leading to lungs and then spreads into lungs tracheobronchial tree symptoms appear in upper chest region and regions this begins as a mild tickle on inhalation and progresses to frequent coughing if breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen continues patients experience a mild burning on inhalation along with uncontrollable coughing and occasional shortness of breath dyspnoea physical findings related to pulmonary toxicity have included bubbling sounds heard through a stethoscope bubbling fever and increased blood flow to lining of nose of nasal mucosa x rays of lungs show little change in short term but extended exposure leads to increasing diffuse shadowing throughout both lungs pulmonary function measurements are reduced as noted by a reduction in amount of air that lungs can hold vital capacity and changes in expiratory function and lung elasticity tests in animals have indicated a variation in tolerance similar to that found in central nervous system toxicity as well as significant variations between species when exposure to oxygen above is intermittent it permits lungs to recover and delays onset of toxicity eyes in premature babies signs of damage to eye retinopathy of prematurity or rop are observed via an ophthalmoscope as a demarcation between vascularised and non vascularised regions of an infant s retina degree of this demarcation is used to designate four stages i demarcation is a line ii demarcation becomes a ridge iii growth of new blood vessels occurs around ridge iv retina begins to detach from inner wall of eye choroid causes oxygen toxicity is caused by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which body is normally exposed this occurs in three principal settings underwater diving hyperbaric oxygen therapy and provision of supplemental oxygen particularly to premature infants in each case risk factors are markedly different central nervous system toxicity exposures from minutes to a few hours to partial pressures of oxygen above about eight times normal atmospheric partial pressure are usually associated with central nervous system oxygen toxicity and are most likely to occur among patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and divers since sea level atmospheric pressure is about central nervous system toxicity can only occur under hyperbaric conditions where ambient pressure is above normal divers breathing air at depths beyond face an increasing risk of an oxygen toxicity hit seizure divers breathing a gas mixture enriched with oxygen such as nitrox can similarly suffer a seizure at shallower depths should they descend below maximum operating depth allowed for mixture lung toxicity thumb upright 1 8 alt pulmonary toxicity tolerance curves refer to caption curves show typical decrement in lung vital capacity when breathing oxygen lambertsen concluded in 1987 that 0 5 bar could be tolerated indefinitely lungs and remainder of respiratory tract are exposed to highest concentration of oxygen in human body and are therefore first organs to show toxicity pulmonary toxicity occurs only with exposure to partial pressures of oxygen greater than corresponding to an oxygen fraction of 50 at normal atmospheric pressure earliest signs of pulmonary toxicity begin with evidence of or inflammation of upper airways after an asymptomatic period between 4 and 22 hours at greater than 95 oxygen with some studies suggesting symptoms usually begin after approximately 14 hours at this level of oxygen at partial pressures of oxygen of 100 oxygen at 2 to 3 times atmospheric pressure these symptoms may begin as early as 3 hours after exposure to oxygen experiments on rats breathing oxygen at pressures between suggest that pulmonary manifestations of oxygen toxicity may not be same for normobaric conditions as they are for hyperbaric conditions evidence of decline in lung function as measured by pulmonary function testing can occur as quickly as 24 hours of continuous exposure to 100 oxygen with evidence of diffuse alveolar damage and onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome usually occurring after 48 hours on 100 oxygen breathing 100 oxygen also eventually leads to collapse of alveoli while at same partial pressure of oxygen presence of significant partial pressures of inert gases typically nitrogen will prevent this effect preterm newborns are known to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50 and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin therefore current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60 likewise divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions in addition to any oxygen exposure during dive ocular toxicity prolonged exposure to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes damage to retina damage to developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for disorder called or retinopathy of prematurity rop in infants in preterm infants retina is often not fully vascularised retinopathy of prematurity occurs when development of retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally associated with growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue scar tissue that may contract to cause retinal detachment supplemental oxygen exposure while a risk factor is not main risk factor for development of this disease restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce rate of retinopathy of prematurity and may raise risk of hypoxia related systemic complications hyperoxic myopia has occurred in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures it also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy this is due to an increase in refractive power of lens since axial length and readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift it is usually reversible with time mechanism thumb 300px lipid peroxidation mechanism shows a single radical initiating a chain reaction which converts unsaturated lipids to lipid peroxides alt an unsaturated lipid reacts with a hydroxyl radical to form a lipid radical initiation which then reacts with di oxygen forming a lipid radical this then reacts with another unsaturated lipid yielding a lipid peroxide and another lipid radical which can continue reaction propagation biochemical basis for toxicity of oxygen is partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species which are natural by products of normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling one species produced by body superoxide anion is possibly involved in iron acquisition higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism and blood supplies it to all parts of body when oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread with most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable during times of environmental stress levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress while all reaction mechanisms of these species within body are not yet fully understood one of most reactive products of oxidative stress is hydroxyl radical oh which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of lipid peroxidation in unsaturated lipids within cell membranes high concentrations of oxygen also increase formation of other free radicals such as nitric oxide peroxynitrite and which harm dna and other biomolecules although body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against oxidative stress these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen and rate of cell damage exceeds capacity of systems that prevent or repair it cell damage and cell death then result diagnosis diagnosis of central nervous system oxygen toxicity in divers prior to seizure is difficult as symptoms of visual disturbance ear problems dizziness confusion and nausea can be due to many factors common to underwater environment such as narcosis congestion and coldness however these symptoms may be helpful in diagnosing first stages of oxygen toxicity in patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in either case unless there is a prior history of epilepsy or tests indicate hypoglycaemia a seizure occurring in setting of breathing oxygen at partial pressures greater than suggests a diagnosis of oxygen toxicity diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborn infants with breathing difficulties is difficult in first few weeks however if infant s breathing does not improve during this time blood tests and x rays may be used to confirm bronchopulmonary dysplasia in addition an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity in infants is typically suggested by clinical setting prematurity low birth weight and a history of oxygen exposure are principal indicators while no hereditary factors have been shown to yield a pattern prevention thumb label on diving cylinder shows that it contains oxygen rich gas 36 and is boldly marked with a maximum operating depth of 28 metres alt closeup of a diving cylinder with a band reading nitrox a hand printed label at neck reads mod 28m 36 o2 with 28 in much larger size prevention of oxygen toxicity depends entirely on setting both underwater and in space proper precautions can eliminate most pernicious effects premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth in this case prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity must be carried out without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve infant s life underwater oxygen toxicity is a catastrophic hazard in diving because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning seizure may occur suddenly and with no warning symptoms effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness during which victims can lose their regulator and drown one of advantages of a full face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss in event of a seizure as there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives long dives and dives where oxygen rich breathing gases are used divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen rich breathing gases and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth in some diver training courses for these types of diving divers are taught to plan and monitor what is called oxygen clock of their dives this is a notional alarm clock which ticks more quickly at increased oxygen pressure and is set to activate at maximum single exposure limit recommended in national oceanic and atmospheric administration diving manual for following partial pressures of oxygen limits are 45 minutes at 120 minutes at 150 minutes at 180 minutes at and 210 minutes at but it is impossible to predict with any reliability whether or when toxicity symptoms will occur many nitrox capable dive computers calculate an oxygen loading and can track it across multiple dives aim is to avoid activating alarm by reducing partial pressure of oxygen in breathing gas or by reducing time spent breathing gas of greater oxygen partial pressure as partial pressure of oxygen increases with fraction of oxygen in breathing gas and depth of dive diver obtains more time on oxygen clock by diving at a shallower depth by breathing a less oxygen rich gas or by shortening duration of exposure to oxygen rich gases diving below on air would expose a diver to increasing danger of oxygen toxicity as partial pressure of oxygen exceeds so a gas mixture must be used which contains less than 21 oxygen a hypoxic mixture increasing proportion of nitrogen is not viable since it would produce a strongly narcotic mixture however helium is not narcotic and a usable mixture may be blended either by completely replacing nitrogen with helium resulting mix is called heliox or by replacing part of nitrogen with helium producing a trimix pulmonary oxygen toxicity is an entirely avoidable event while diving limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare and even then reversible complication for divers established guidelines enable divers to calculate when they are at risk of pulmonary toxicity hyperbaric setting presence of a fever or a history of seizure is a relative contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatment schedules used for treatment of decompression illness allow for periods of breathing air rather than 100 oxygen oxygen breaks to reduce chance of seizure or lung damage u s navy uses treatment tables based on periods alternating between 100 oxygen and air for example usn table 6 requires 75 minutes three periods of 20 minutes oxygen 5 minutes air at an ambient pressure of equivalent to a depth of this is followed by a slow reduction in pressure to over 30 minutes on oxygen patient then remains at that pressure for a further 150 minutes consisting of two periods of 15 minutes air 60 minutes oxygen before pressure is reduced to atmospheric over 30 minutes on oxygen vitamin e and selenium were proposed and later rejected as a potential method of protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity there is however some experimental evidence in rats that vitamin e and selenium aid in preventing in vivo lipid peroxidation and free radical damage and therefore prevent retinal changes following repetitive hyperbaric oxygen exposures normobaric setting bronchopulmonary dysplasia is reversible in early stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage one or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks are needed to cause such damage retinopathy of prematurity is largely preventable by screening current guidelines require that all babies of less than 32 weeks gestational age or having a birth weight less than should be screened for retinopathy of prematurity at least every two weeks national cooperative study in 1954 showed a causal link between supplemental oxygen and retinopathy of prematurity but subsequent curtailment of supplemental oxygen caused an increase in infant mortality to balance risks of hypoxia and retinopathy of prematurity modern protocols now require monitoring of blood oxygen levels in premature infants receiving oxygen setting in low pressure environments oxygen toxicity may be avoided since toxicity is caused by high partial pressure of oxygen not merely by high oxygen fraction this is illustrated by modern pure oxygen use in spacesuits which must operate at low pressure also historically very high percentage oxygen and lower than normal atmospheric pressure was used in early spacecraft for example gemini and apollo spacecraft in such applications as extra vehicular activity high fraction oxygen is non toxic even at breathing mixture fractions approaching 100 because oxygen partial pressure is not allowed to chronically exceed management thumb alt diagram of an eye in cross section retina red is detached at top of eye thumb alt diagram of an eye with a scleral buckle in cross section silicone band scleral buckle blue is placed around eye this brings wall of eye into contact with detached retina allowing retina to re attach during hyperbaric oxygen therapy patient will usually breathe 100 oxygen from a mask while inside a hyperbaric chamber pressurised with air to about seizures during therapy are managed by removing mask from patient thereby dropping partial pressure of oxygen inspired below a seizure underwater requires that diver be brought to surface as soon as practicable although for many years recommendation has been not to raise diver during seizure itself owing to danger of arterial gas embolism age there is some evidence that glottis does not fully obstruct airway this has led to current recommendation by diving committee of undersea and hyperbaric medical society that a diver should be raised during seizure s clonic convulsive phase if regulator is not in diver s mouth as danger of drowning is then greater than that of age but ascent should be delayed until end of clonic phase otherwise rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during convulsive phase they then ensure that where victim s air supply is established it is maintained and carry out a controlled buoyant lift lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies upon reaching surface emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention u s navy has procedures for completing decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available occurrence of symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or acute respiratory distress syndrome is treated by lowering fraction of oxygen administered along with a reduction in periods of exposure and an increase in break periods where normal air is supplied where supplemental oxygen is required for treatment of another disease particularly in infants a ventilator may be needed to ensure that lung tissue remains inflated reductions in pressure and exposure will be made progressively and medications such as bronchodilators and pulmonary surfactants may be used retinopathy of prematurity may regress spontaneously but should disease progress beyond a threshold defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity both and laser surgery have been shown to reduce risk of blindness as an outcome where disease has progressed further techniques such as scleral buckling and surgery may assist in re attaching retina prognosis although convulsions caused by central nervous system oxygen toxicity may lead to incidental injury to victim it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to nervous system following seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage an overview of these studies by bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen no long term neurological damage from seizure remains majority of infants who have survived following an incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia will eventually recover near normal lung function since lungs continue to grow during first 5 7 years and damage caused by bronchopulmonary dysplasia is to some extent reversible even in adults however they are likely to be more susceptible to respiratory infections for rest of their lives and severity of later infections is often greater than that in their peers retinopathy of prematurity rop in infants frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years where disease has progressed to stages requiring surgery outcomes are generally good for treatment of stage 3 rop but are much worse for later stages although surgery is usually successful in restoring anatomy of eye damage to nervous system by progression of disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision presence of other complicating diseases also reduces likelihood of a favourable outcome epidemiology thumb 400px alt percentage of severe visual impairment and blindness due to rop in children in schools for blind in different regions of world europe 6 17 latin america 4 1 38 6 eastern europe 25 9 asia 16 9 africa 10 6 retinopathy of prematurity rop in 1997 was more common in middle income countries where neonatal intensive care services were increasing but greater awareness of problem leading to preventive measures had not yet occurred incidence of central nervous system toxicity among divers has decreased since second world war as protocols have developed to limit exposure and partial pressure of oxygen inspired in 1947 donald recommended limiting depth allowed for breathing pure oxygen to which equates to an oxygen partial pressure of over time this limit has been reduced until today a limit of during a recreational dive and during shallow decompression stops is generally recommended oxygen toxicity has now become a rare occurrence other than when caused by equipment malfunction and human error historically u s navy has refined its navy diving manual tables to reduce oxygen toxicity incidents between 1995 and 1999 reports showed 405 surface supported dives using helium oxygen tables of these oxygen toxicity symptoms were observed on 6 dives 1 5 as a result u s navy in 2000 modified schedules and conducted field tests of 150 dives none of which produced symptoms of oxygen toxicity revised tables were published in 2001 variability in tolerance and other variable factors such as workload have resulted in u s navy abandoning screening for oxygen tolerance of 6 250 oxygen tolerance tests performed between 1976 and 1997 only 6 episodes of oxygen toxicity were observed 0 1 central nervous system oxygen toxicity among patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy is rare and is influenced by a number of a factors individual sensitivity and treatment protocol and probably therapy indication and equipment used a study by in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107 264 patients 0 015 while hampson and atik in 2003 found a rate of 0 03 yildiz ay and in a summary of 36 500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003 reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents giving a rate of 0 008 a later review of over 80 000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate 0 0024 reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask rather than a hood to deliver oxygen bronchopulmonary dysplasia is among most common complications of prematurely born infants and its incidence has grown as survival of extremely premature infants has increased nevertheless severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen has resulted in disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia in 1997 a summary of studies of neonatal intensive care units in industrialised countries showed that up to 60 of low birth weight babies developed retinopathy of prematurity which rose to 72 in extremely low birth weight babies defined as less than at birth however severe outcomes are much less frequent for very low birth weight babies those less than at birth incidence of blindness was found to be no more than 8 history thumb upright left paul bert a french physiologist first described oxygen toxicity in 1878 alt photograph of a man with receding hairline and grey moustache he is dressed in a formal jacket and waistcoat typical of victorian fashion central nervous system toxicity was first described by paul bert in 1878 he showed that oxygen was toxic to insects arachnids myriapods molluscs earthworms fungi germinating seeds birds and other animals central nervous system toxicity may be referred to as paul bert effect pulmonary oxygen toxicity was first described by j lorrain smith in 1899 when he noted central nervous system toxicity and discovered in experiments in mice and birds that had no effect but of oxygen was a pulmonary irritant pulmonary toxicity may be referred to as lorrain smith effect first recorded human exposure was undertaken in 1910 by bornstein when two men breathed oxygen at for 30 minutes while he went on to 48 minutes with no symptoms in 1912 bornstein developed cramps in his hands and legs while breathing oxygen at for 51 minutes smith then went on to show that intermittent exposure to a breathing gas with less oxygen permitted lungs to recover and delayed onset of pulmonary toxicity albert r behnke et al in 1935 were first to observe visual field contraction tunnel vision on dives between and during world war ii donald and yarbrough et al performed over 2 000 experiments on oxygen toxicity to support initial use of closed circuit oxygen rebreathers naval divers in early years of oxygen rebreather diving developed a mythology about a monster called oxygen pete who lurked in bottom of admiralty experimental diving unit wet pot a water filled hyperbaric chamber to catch unwary divers they called having an oxygen toxicity attack getting a pete in decade following world war ii lambertsen et al made further discoveries on effects of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in development of standard operating procedures when breathing increased pressures of oxygen lambertsen s work showing effect of carbon dioxide in decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure guidelines to future breathing apparatus design retinopathy of prematurity was not observed before world war ii but with availability of supplemental oxygen in decade following it rapidly became one of principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries by 1960 use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia related complications since then more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity bronchopulmonary dysplasia was first described by northway in 1967 who outlined conditions that would lead to diagnosis this was later expanded by and in 1988 by shennan who suggested need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks could predict long term outcomes nevertheless et al in 1998 concluded that radiographic evidence was most accurate predictor of long term effects bitterman et al in 1986 and 1995 showed that darkness and caffeine would delay onset of changes to brain electrical activity in rats in years since research on central nervous system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance sensitivity to central nervous system oxygen toxicity has been shown to be affected by factors such as circadian rhythm drugs age and gender in 1988 hamilton et al wrote procedures for national oceanic and atmospheric administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations even today models for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen society and culture recreational scuba divers commonly breathe nitrox containing up to 40 oxygen while technical divers use pure oxygen or nitrox containing up to 80 oxygen divers who breathe oxygen fractions greater than of air 21 need to be trained in dangers of oxygen toxicity and how to prevent them in order to buy nitrox a diver has to show evidence of such qualification since late 1990s recreational use of oxygen has been promoted by oxygen bars where customers breathe oxygen through a nasal cannula claims have been made that this reduces stress increases energy and lessens effects of hangovers and headaches despite lack of any scientific evidence to support them there are also devices on sale that offer oxygen massage and oxygen detoxification with claims of removing body toxins and reducing body fat american lung association has stated there is no evidence that oxygen at low flow levels used in bars can be dangerous to a normal person s health but u s center for drug evaluation and research cautions that people with heart or lung disease need their supplementary oxygen carefully regulated and should not use oxygen bars victorian society had a fascination for rapidly
