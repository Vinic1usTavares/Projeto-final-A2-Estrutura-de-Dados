random or alterations to gameplay elements in individual maps synopsis setting mankind divided is set in 2029 two years after deus ex human revolution deus ex series is set in a cyberpunk future rife with secret organizations and conspiracies including illuminati before human revolution advances in biotechnology and cybernetics led to development of augmentations artificial organs capable of enhancing human performance augmentation requires use of neuropozyne a scarce expensive immunosuppressive drug which prevents body from rejecting augmentation they also created social divides between humans who have accepted augmentation technology and normal humans who are either morally opposed to it too poor to afford it or whose bodies actively reject it during human revolution illuminati planned to place limitations on augmented people with a biochip they are opposed by adam jensen chief of security at pro augmentation corporation sarif industries who is heavily augmented after an attack on his employers critically injures him illuminati member hugh darrow subverts illuminati s plan to prejudice humanity against augmentations broadcasting a signal from arctic research base panchaea which drove anyone with biochip insane mass chaos is later called aug incident jensen stops signal and has a choice to broadcast stories supporting darrow illuminati or his employer or to destroy panchaea and let humanity decide jensen destroys panchaea in canonical ending but social trauma from aug incident and illuminati s manipulation cause augmented people to be stigmatized humanity has imposed a mechanical apartheid on augmented people by mankind divided isolating them in ghettos and stripping them of their rights story focuses on events in prague with some events set in dubai and london several factions play key roles in game world one of most prominent is illuminati a group of corporate elites which influences society for its own aims illuminati are opposed by juggernaut collective a group of led by shadowy janus and precursors of underground movements in original deus ex two main factions in mankind divided are task force 29 tf29 an interpol run anti terrorist team based in prague and augmented rights coalition arc originally an aid group for augmented people and now a controversial body opposing abuse of augmented characters human revolution protagonist adam jensen returns as lead character presumed dead after panchaea s destruction he was rescued and secretly implanted with advanced augmentations due to a genetic trait which allows augmentations without neuropozyne jensen occupies a middle ground between humans who mistrust augmented people and those whose augmentations are decaying due to a lack of neuropozyne adam becomes part of tf29 as a double agent for juggernaut collective to expose illuminati interacting with collective s unseen leader janus through alex vega his co workers in tf29 are director jim miller and psychologist auzenne adam s main opponents are arc leader talos rucker and viktor marchenko a member of arc who becomes a terrorist central characters in downloadable content dlc episodes are frank

learns that marchenko is planning an attack on a london summit hosted by influential ceo nathaniel brown brown is lobbying against human restoration act an illuminati backed law which would permanently segregate augmented in isolated metropolis of rabi ah adam fails to convince brown of threat and confronts marchenko s men after they infiltrate summit poisoning miller with orchid miller

discovers their identities adam can defuse situation or take sides leading to different fates for guerrero and fixer asking auzenne if she would kill to protect a mission development eidos montreal developed human revolution as a prequel of deus ex and a reboot of series after several years of dormancy although human revolution was greeted with skepticism during its development it was released in 2011 to critical and commercial success lead writer mary demarle said that team had no plans for a sequel during production of human revolution since their primary goal was to return deus ex to public eye as development finished core team realized that they needed to produce a sequel sequel was originally to be produced by obsidian entertainment studio ceo feargus urquhart estimated that their version would have been released in 2014 but plan failed to materialize due to unspecified circumstances production of mankind divided began in 2011 after completion of missing link an expansion of human revolution team aimed to improve and streamline experience of human revolution with mankind divided keeping well received elements intact and polishing those which had been criticized at launch or left untouched due to time constraints sequel s production took five years with its long development explained by demarle and gameplay director patrick fortier as due to upgraded technology and depth of narrative production was completed on july 29 2016 with eidos montreal confirming that game was gold indicating that it was being prepared for duplication and release scenario according to demarle team met to discuss where to go from human revolution inspired by aug incident at end of human revolution they wanted to explore its impact and aftermath although human revolution ended with a player choice team realized that world s population would be too busy dealing with tragedy to notice this allowed development of a sequel where each player s choice was valid demarle was in charge of narrative design overseeing a large group of writers who were split into teams some handled main narrative with demarle others side quests and others helping with elements such as dialogue trees with boss characters one of contributors to scenario was james swallow who had previously written additional media and helped with writing of human revolution and deus ex fall describing mankind divided narrative design producer olivier proulx said that team wanted to redesign narrative structure with less opportunity for players to use a save to play through several set endings as in human revolution key plot twists were present through to end of game impacting dialogue and story options some plot elements were left unresolved by end of mankind divided attributed by demarle to production time limits and problems caused by game s narrative detail about where narrative was supposed to go fortier said that team wanted to evolve first game s focus on transhumanism this led to incorporating theme of discrimination apparently logical outcome of social divisions created by augmentations although themes aligned with contemporary real world events fortier said that this was primarily coincidental these elements played into series cyberpunk setting and its focus on conspiracy theories prague was chosen because team wanted to focus on europe after much of human revolution was set in america prague was a good example of a city with a combination of old and new architecture team also chose it because of myth of golem originating according to fleur marty in central europe reflected by golem city ghetto while creating her narrative demarle needed to remember established deus ex narrative she approached it as history written by winner with established fact in original deus ex not being accurate this fit with seeking of truth a theme of mankind divided supplementary information in game helped connect mankind divided to human revolution and future deus ex games illuminati key antagonists in series were portrayed differently in mankind divided than they were in original deus ex where they were part of a 90s era x files style paranoia demarle wrote them as a loosely aligned elite where each member pursues their own goals she compared illuminati of mankind divided with bankers described in book too big to fail both were too arrogant to unite in a common cause and bankers were closest she could get to fictional illuminati an early decision brought human revolution protagonist adam jensen back for mankind divided according to proulx his badass persona made him a favorite of staff demarle did not see adam as having a long life in deus ex series and he died at end of one of her drafts for human revolution a core part of adam s portrayal in mankind divided was his acceptance of his augmentations after they were forced on him described by game director jean francois dugas as a tool and a weapon adam accepted his augmented status in mankind divided and decided to use it for greater good and his personal goals although human revolution portrayed adam as reactive in mankind divided demarle insisted that he be rewritten as proactive his interactions with miller had to take into account adam s reworked persona and necessities of a mission based game elias toufexis returned to voice adam and was called in to begin recording in 2013 about returning to role toufexis described it as easy since he knew adam s character better it was still difficult however since adam s personality was defined by player toufexis needed to have several versions of adam in memory so he could change his voice accordingly game design discussing game design of mankind divided director jean francois dugas said that although their first game was characterized by their overall naivete mankind divided required courage to bring deus ex gameplay to next level they had a solid base with human revolution but team wanted to evolve from that base and address problems raised by players and critics issues included balance problems stiff mechanics weak combat and boss fights which seemed to penalize a non lethal playing style some of these problems were resolved in human revolution director s cut and feedback from that enabled team to further tailor and balance design of mankind divided gameplay had to reflect narrative surrounding jensen s acceptance of his augmentations team focused on creating an immersive environment and opportunities for player choice from non linear exploration to primitively completing objectives on a large and small scale praxis upgrade system was carried over from human revolution and weapons were based on their real life counterparts ai system was upgraded with two different subsystems for open combat and stealth which would react differently and transition smoothly in response to player actions augmentations were based on telemetry from human revolution which indicated what was popular with players team evaluated boss battles in context of mankind divided including classic bosses who needed to be fought and encounters which could be navigated verbally although fortier did not want classic boss battles he realized that game s mechanical limitations necessitated them in response to complaints about outsourced boss battles in human revolution those in mankind divided were developed in house every boss was navigable with conversation or non lethal options breach mode originated when team wanted to diverge from main game s realism a live team led by fleur marty created breach to bring mankind divided mechanics into a non realistic setting although team wanted to experiment with a multiplayer mode it would be difficult to implement and explain in deus ex setting and they decided on an asynchronous system they implemented elements which encouraged fast completion early builds had a more difficult path back to each level s exit which was changed due to its negative impact on stealth based gameplay team included microtransactions but marty said in an interview that players were not required to pay anything their aim was to make breach lighter than hearthstone a mode which was part of a retail game rather than a free to play standalone mode technology mankind divided runs on dawn engine a game engine designed for eighth generation gaming hardware it was built on glacier 2 an in house engine created by io interactive team had several choices of engine technology after human revolution they included unreal engine used by another team in company to develop 2014 thief reboot cdc engine created by crystal dynamics for tomb raider underworld and its upcoming 2013 series reboot and io interactive glacier 2 engine used by hitman absolution due to its more extensive tool suite eidos montreal chose glacier 2 and expanded its basic framework to create dawn engine team introduced physics based rendering a new animation system as part of redesign and engine was optimized for game s narrative base creating environments was a challenge for developers who wanted to be as realistic as possible within game s planned design and available technology characters hair designed to appear as lifelike as possible was animated with in house technology based on tressfx dedicated lighting programming allowed realism in changing light conditions environmental scale was troublesome interior rooms with realistic proportions and high detail were too large to fit in their exterior structures and team used programming tricks to maintain illusion of reality multiple lighting filters were created at different levels to achieve a dynamic realistic lighting system and game s use of light dovetailed with its artistic themes due to a lack of console specific functions in house technology was used for anti aliasing filters to maintain a smooth image when navigating its environments an element of original glacier 2 engine which was carried over into dawn engine was entity system an advanced ai system which allowed quick creation of new ai behavior based on existing designs this eliminated need for a dedicated ai programmer advantage of dawn engine technology was its ability to hold a large number of entities at one time which was suited to large game environments its entity driven architecture allowed artists deep involvement with environment and level design teams more powerful technology allowed inclusion of more interactive and environmental objects and elements central to deus ex series such as air ducts and cover team wanted to avoid obvious walls preventing player from moving beyond map boundaries so they integrated areas into environment and looped major streets to create an illusion of size art design martin dubeau was mankind divided art director and human revolution art director jonathan jacques belletete remained as executive art director like human revolution renaissance and baroque artists including johannes vermeer rembrandt and leonardo da vinci provided design inspirations for team humanity s attitude to augmentation was described as a metaphorical and overt expression of transition between dark ages and age of enlightenment with gold remaining a symbolic representation of pro augmentation factions black and gold were dominant colors for human revolution but mankind divided made less use of these colors due to its narrative instead it used blue and gray to create a subdued setting its game world aimed to make locations recognizable while adding futuristic cyberpunk elements since game was set in near future dubeau represented more subdued tone and violent reaction against augmentations by using cold raw and opaque materials for modern architecture golem city prague s ghetto for augmented citizens was based on kowloon walled city and corporate housing for dubai team was inspired by work of zaha hadid adam s outfit was changed referring to his first appearance in human revolution and his evolution after that game although jacques belletete was satisfied with first game s design dubeau wanted to use it as starting point for a new design after working on it internally for some time art team decided to collaborate with an external partner they contacted hugh co founder of berlin based design house acronym to design adam s coat his new outfit aimed at a military feel while incorporating stylistic elements from its earlier form fashion elements common to hugh s work and practical fastenings and alterations to accommodate adam s augmentations marchenko s design reflected a life of work and hardship character of rucker was designed as symbolic of his own hardships and his position in arc his death scene included a sunset which according to dubeau represented death of cyber renaissance police officer designs reflected theme of regression and their body armor was modeled on medieval knights in addition to adam s coat hugh and acronym collaborated on game s general clothing design its costume design was inspired by work of fashion designer gareth pugh music human revolution composer michael mccann returned as a co composer for mankind divided mccann was joined by sascha dikiciyan whose work included borderlands and tron evolution according to audio director steve szczepkowski team wanted to build on human revolution musical foundation while communicating darker themes of mankind divided due to game s scale another composer was sought to join mccann after hearing dikiciyan s music szczepkowski talked with him about joining team dikiciyan shared his enthusiasm for series and came on board breach mode music was composed by ed harrison and game s ending theme was composed by misha mansoor of progressive metal band periphery two soundtrack albums for mankind divided were released on december 2 2016 a standard edition and an extended edition with additional tracks release mankind divided was confirmed in a 2013 press release from eidos montreal

models from human revolution and eidos montreal s design documents eidos montreal collaborated with visual works on trailer s aesthetic design and content although their previous projects had settings based on european fantasy or advanced science fiction futures team used real world prague for bombing scenes action scenes were worked out in advance with motion capture actors most difficult scene for visual works was where adam activated titan armor augmentation to block a hail of bullets pc version was created by nixxes software and advanced micro devices amd who focused on control scheme and graphics options for different computer systems nixxes and amd enabled game to perform smoothly on directx 12 systems directx 12 system included a new application programming interface which was similar to that used for console versions allowing equivalent optimization and exchange of technological improvements a priority for pc version s graphics was improving bokeh and depth of field to

with in game items and dlc controversy shortly after game was announced mankind divided was criticized online for using word apartheid as part of its marketing criticism stemmed from word s historic association with apartheid a system of racial segregation in south africa for much of 20th century members of game s staff advocated their use of term due to its relevance to story s subject matter additional controversy arose among public and other game developers for mankind divided use of phrase aug lives matter in its promotional concept art slogan is very similar to black lives matter an activist movement according to developers similarity was a coincidence and its choice predated movement s emergence in 2013 an original marketing campaign for mankind divided revolved around a five tier pre order campaign players who had pre ordered game could pick items from each tier each with their own pre order bonuses depending on worldwide pre orders highest tier would have allowed players access to game four days before its release date according to square enix system was intended to offer more freedom to players about pre order content rather than developers choosing pre order content packages for release in each region game journalists and fans were highly critical of campaign due to negative reaction system was canceled and all content was available to those who pre ordered game or purchased a day 1 edition mankind divided was criticized after release for to its use of microtransactions compounded by rumors about internal troubles with game s development post release content

dawning darkness initially pre order exclusive hard line and dawning darkness were released as free downloads reception according to video game review aggregator metacritic deus ex mankind divided received favorable reviews ps4 version of system rift also received positive reviews with a score of 75 out of 100 points based on 11 reviews ps4 version of a criminal past was praised but pc version had mixed or average reviews nick plessas of electronic gaming monthly enjoyed narrative s enclosed nature and how game gave adam personality while keeping him an enigma for players eurogamers edwin evans thirlwell found its story structure among best in game s genre but andrew reiner of game informer felt that mankind divided sacrificed narrative s potential to address its themes nicholas tan writing for game revolution said narrative was successful is in its ability to juggle and weave multiple complex and modern themes together gamespots edmond tran enjoyed game s tone and narrative but thought that some players might find it overly complex phil savage of gamesradar praised conspiracy narrative carried over from human revolution but felt that it left game s main narrative and characters underdeveloped igns vince ingenito called plot well produced but andy kelly of pc gamer found side mission stories more interesting than main narrative polygons arthur gies called environmental storytelling and its side missions game s greatest strengths a number of reviewers criticized brevity of mankind divided campaign and problems with writing of its characters and main narrative game s handling of its themes was criticized particularly in contrast to its pre release controversy reiner was positive about visuals and music but called voice acting hit or miss tan also praised game s graphics and tran enjoyed exploring environments of prague due to their design and combination of realistic and futuristic architecture savage found setting superior to that of human revolution noting some poor facial animations for minor characters ingenito also noted inconsistent facial animations but said that prague was gorgeously realized kelly praised graphics and called level design brilliant and gies enjoyed prague s seamless nature compared to other contemporary games plessas was generally positive about upgrade systems and balance but found ai mentally deficient noting game s emphasis on stealth and hacking evans thirlwell enjoyed freedom for players to approach missions as desired reiner found action based approach less appealing due to ai and dull implementation but enjoyed stealth mechanics and associated augmentations tan praised expanded options for players noting that hacking had been downplayed in comparison with human revolution savage called mankind divided a game that s best enjoyed slowly and deliberately due to its combination of augmentation upgrades and new customization options tran praised variety of approaches to different situations and augmentation systems and removal of boss battles but felt that some of new augmentations had a negligible impact ingenito positively noted improvements to combat and ui compared to human revolution and praised new additions such as gun customization kelly called mankind divided a great immersive sim with some of best level design in series praising gameplay variety and additional augmentation options gies also enjoyed variety of gameplay options but noted its subtle push towards a stealthy non lethal approach contradicting its core concept of choice breach mode was generally praised sales although mankind divided topped gaming sales charts during its week of release in united kingdom game had a weaker debut than human revolution because of a lower install base on consoles than its predecessor mankind divided was third bestselling game of august in north america with console game sales increases for period partially attributed to its release in square enix s
