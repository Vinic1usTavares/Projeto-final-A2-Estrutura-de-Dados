swiss climate is generally temperate but can vary greatly between localities from glacial conditions on mountaintops to often pleasant near mediterranean climate at switzerland s southern tip there are some valley areas in southern part of switzerland where some cold hardy palm trees are found summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing less humid winters in mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks while lower lands tend to suffer from inversion during these periods thus seeing no sun for weeks a weather phenomenon known as with an identical effect to chinook wind can occur at all times of year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind bringing air of very low relative humidity to north of alps during rainfall periods on southern face of alps this works both ways across alps but is more efficient if blowing from south due to steeper step for oncoming wind from south valleys running south to north trigger best effect driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing mountains before reaching these areas large alpine areas such as graubunden remain drier than pre alpine areas and as in main valley of valais wine grapes are grown there wettest conditions persist in high alps and in ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout year with a peak in summer autumn is driest season winter receives less precipitation than summer yet weather patterns in switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods environment switzerland s ecosystems can be particularly fragile because many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing climatic geological and topographical conditions of alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change nevertheless according to 2014 environmental performance index switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding environment due to its high scores on environmental public health its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy hydropower and geothermal energy and its control of greenhouse gas emissions however access to biocapacity in switzerland is far lower than world average in 2016 switzerland had 1 0 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory 40 percent less than world average of 1 6 global hectares per person in contrast in 2016 they used 4 6 global hectares of biocapacity their ecological footprint of consumption this means they used about 4 6 times as much biocapacity as switzerland contains remainder comes from imports and overusing global commons such as atmosphere through greenhouse gas emissions as a result switzerland is running a biocapacity deficit politics thumb swiss

serve as members of parliament part time so called or citizen legislature when both houses are in joint session they are known collectively as federal assembly through referendums citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through initiatives introduce amendments to federal constitution thus making switzerland a direct democracy federal council constitutes federal government

council president of confederation is elected by assembly from among seven members traditionally in rotation and for a one year term president chairs government and assumes representative functions however president is a primus inter with no additional powers and remains head of a department within administration swiss government has been a coalition of four major political parties since 1959

direct democracy and federalism are hallmarks of swiss political system swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions municipality canton and federal levels 1848 and 1999 swiss constitutions define a system of direct democracy sometimes called half direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy instruments of this system at federal level known as popular rights include right to submit a federal initiative and a referendum both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions by calling a federal referendum a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament if they gather 50 000 signatures against law within 100 days if so a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject law any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law similarly federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote if 100 000 voters sign proposed amendment within 18 months since 1999 an initiative can also be in form of a general proposal to be elaborated by parliament but because it is considered less attractive for various reasons this form of initiative has yet to find any use federal council and federal assembly can supplement proposed amendment with a counter proposal and then voters must indicate a preference on ballot in case both proposals are accepted constitutional amendments whether introduced by initiative or in parliament must be accepted by a double majority of national popular vote and cantonal popular votes that is a majority of 23 cantonal votes because result of popular vote in six traditional half cantons each counts as half vote of one of other
