two together sometimes are almost more than scenery can bear aaron barnhart for kansas city star called episode riotous and said that show with its pop culture jokes delivered at blistering speed outsized performances from supporting players sean hayes and megan mullally and a camaraderie between platonic pals eric mccormack and debra massing that would make even plato blush ted cox of daily herald was less positive about episode reporting that this episode looked like more of same recounting show s past story lines and past nbc programs chicago tribune s steve johnson opined that episode starts strong and then goes awry it s funny for a while but then it takes it to a ludicrous level selling out its own internal logic by conspiring to put molly shannon and messing into a catfight at its best this series works a groove of pop culture savvy this visit from three stooges by way of dynasty will have you rolling your eyes in dismay critics praised shannon s performance in episode bark
