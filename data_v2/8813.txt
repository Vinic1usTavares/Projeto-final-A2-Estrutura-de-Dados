closing credits miyamoto produced game and tezuka wrote story and script keiji a screenwriter who worked on anime shows such as dr slump and dragon ball wrote backstory for manual drawing inspiration from conflicts in medieval europe development began in 1984 and game was originally intended to be a launch game for famicom disk system legend of zelda developer interview with shigeru miyamoto legend of zelda sound and drama 1994 development team worked on legend of zelda and super mario bros concurrently and tried to separate their ideas super mario bros was to be linear where action occurred in a strict sequence whereas legend of zelda would be opposite in mario miyamoto downplayed importance of high score in favor of simply completing game this concept was carried over to legend of zelda miyamoto was also in charge of deciding which concepts were zelda ideas or mario ideas contrasting with mario zelda was made non linear and forced players to think about what they should do next according to miyamoto those in japan were confused and had trouble finding their way through multi path dungeons and in initial game designs player would start with sword already in their inventory rather than merely simplifying matters for players miyamoto forced player to listen to old man who gives player their sword and encouraged interaction among people to share their ideas with each other to find various hidden secrets a new form of gaming communication relatedly this concept turned into root of another series to be developed many years in future zelda became inspiration for something very different animal crossing this was a game based solely on communication with legend of zelda miyamoto wanted to flesh out idea of a game world even further giving players a miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer he drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around kyoto where he explored nearby fields woods and caves always trying through zelda games to impart players some sense of that limitless wonder he felt through unknown exploration when i was a child he said i went hiking and found a lake it was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it when i traveled around country without a map trying to find my way stumbling on amazing things as i went i realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this sheff 1993 p 51 memory of being lost amid maze of sliding doors in his family s home in was recreated in zeldas dungeons sheff 1993 p 52 hero link was so named in part to connect players inserted into this world with their interactive role as something of a blank slate represent and not their individuality or methods designed by miyamoto as a coming of age motif to identify with journeying as an ordinary boy strengthened by trials to triumph over great challenges and rise to meet evil name of titular princess came from zelda fitzgerald miyamoto explained zelda was wife of famous novelist f scott fitzgerald she was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts and i liked sound of her name so i took liberty of using it for very first title early zelda concepts involved technological elements with microchips for triforce made of electronic circuits and a time travelling protagonist another factor of their name relating to idea of a computer hyper link while final game follows a more traditional heroic fantasy setting subsequent games in series have incorporated some technology based concepts koji kondo credited as composed game s five music tracks he had planned to use maurice ravel s bolero as title theme but was forced to change it late in development cycle after learning that copyright for orchestral piece had not yet expired as a result kondo wrote a new arrangement of overworld theme within one day which has become an iconic motive echoing throughout continued entries of series in february 1986 nintendo released legend of zelda as launch game for family computer s new disk system peripheral joined by a re release of super mario bros tennis baseball golf soccer and mahjong as part of system s introduction it made full use of disk card media s advantages over traditional rom cartridges with an increased size of 128 kilobytes which would be expensive to produce on cartridge format due to still limited amount of disk space all of text used in game was from only a single syllabary known as katakana which under normal circumstances primarily relates more to foreign words which supplement those of traditional japanese origin as with hiragana and kanji characters rather than passwords disks saved players game progress and extra sound channel provided by system was utilized for certain sound effects most notably link s sword beam at full health roars and growls of dungeon bosses and those of defeated enemies sound effects had to be altered for eventual cartridge release version of zelda which used famicom s pcm channel game also took advantage of that system s controller having a built in microphone a feature nes model did not include it was used to defeat large eared rabbit like monster pols voice by blowing or shouting u s instruction manual still hints that this enemy hates loud noise confusing many into thinking recorder item could be used to attack in actuality it has no effect cartridge version made use of memory management controller chip specifically model which
