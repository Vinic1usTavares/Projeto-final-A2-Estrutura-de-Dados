production development thumb washington square on october 31 2006 area is being set up for an evening shooting in background is house where will smith s character lives science fiction horror genre reemerged in late 1990s in 1995 warner bros began developing film project having owned rights to richard matheson s 1954 novel i am legend since 1970 and having already made 1971 adaptation omega man mark protosevich was hired to write script after studio was impressed with his spec script of cell protosevich s first draft took place in 2000 in san francisco and contained many similarities with finished film though darkseekers called hemocytes were civilized to point of creatures in omega man and anna was a lone morphine addict as well as fact that a character named christopher joined forces with neville warner bros immediately put film on fast track attaching neal h moritz as producer actors tom cruise michael douglas and mel gibson had been considered to star in film using a script by protosevich and with ridley scott as director however by june 1997 studio s preference was for actor arnold schwarzenegger in july scott and schwarzenegger finalized negotiations with production slated to begin coming september using houston as a stand in for film s setting of los angeles scott had protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing john logan with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts scott logan version of i am legend was a mix of sci fi and psychological thriller without dialogue in first hour and with a sombre ending creatures in logan s version were similar to darkseekers of finished film in their animalistic barbaric nature studio fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential began to worry about liberties they had given scott then on a negative streak of box office disappointments and urged production team to reconsider lack of action in screenplay after an esoteric draft by writer neal jimenez warner bros reassigned protosevich to project reluctantly working with scott again in december 1997 project was called into question when projected budget escalated to 108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of studio in financing a big budget film scott rewrote script in an attempt to reduce film s budget by 20 million but in march 1998 studio canceled project due to continued budgetary concerns and quite possibly to box office disappointment of scott s last three films 1492 conquest of paradise white squall and g i jane likewise schwarzenegger s recent films at time eraser and warner bros own batman robin also underperformed and studio s latest experiences with big budget sci fi movies sphere and postman were negative as well in august 1998 director rob bowman was attached to project with protosevich hired to write a third all new draft far more action oriented than his previous versions but director who reportedly wished for nicolas cage to play lead moved on to direct reign of fire and project did not get off ground in march 2002 schwarzenegger became producer of i am legend commencing negotiations with michael bay to direct and will smith to star in film bay and smith were attracted to project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget however project was shelved due to warner bros president alan f horn s dislike of script in 2004 akiva goldsman was asked by head of production jeff robinov to produce film in september 2005 director francis lawrence signed on to helm project with production slated to begin in 2006 guillermo del toro was originally approached to direct by smith but turned it down to direct hellboy ii golden army lawrence whose film constantine was produced by goldsman was fascinated by empty urban environments he said something s always really excited me about that to have experienced that much loss to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long goldsman took on project as he admired second i am legend film adaptation omega man a rewrite was done to distance project from other zombie films inspired by novel as well as from recently released 28 days later although goldsman was inspired by scenes of a deserted london in british horror film to create scenes of a deserted new york city a 40 page scene by scene outline of film was developed by may 2006 when delays occurred on smith s film hancock which was scheduled for 2007 it was proposed to switch actor s films this meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks production was given a green light using goldsman s script and outline elements from protosevich s script were introduced while crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement rewrites continued throughout filming because of smith s improvisational skills and lawrence s preference to keep various scenes silent director had watched jane campion s film piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son and realized that silence could be very effective cinema casting will smith signed on to play robert neville in april 2006 he said he took on i am legend because he felt it could be like gladiator or forrest gump these are movies with wonderful audience pleasing elements but also uncompromised artistic value this always felt like it had those possibilities to me actor found neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying muhammad ali in ali 2001 he said that when you re on your own it is kind of hard to find conflict film s dark tone and exploration of whether neville has gone insane during his isolation meant smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes to prepare for his role smith visited centers for disease control and prevention in georgia he also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war smith compared neville to job who lost his children livelihood and health like book of job i am legend studies questions can he find a reason to continue can he find hope or desire to excel and advance in life or does death of everything around him create imminent death for himself he also cited an influence in tom hanks performance in cast away 2000 abbey and kona both three year old german shepherd dogs played neville s dog sam rest of supporting cast consists of salli richardson as zoe robert s wife and alice braga as a survivor named anna willow smith will smith s daughter makes her film debut as marley neville s daughter emma thompson has an uncredited role as dr alice krippin who appears on television explaining her vaccine for cancer that mutates into virus singer mike patton provided guttural screams of infected hemocytes and dash mihok provided character animation for infected alpha

large suspension bridge over a river connecting to an area covered with tall buildings another bridge and other buildings can be seen in background brooklyn bridge where a 5 million scene was filmed thumb upright marcy avenue armory akiva goldsman decided to move story from los angeles to new york city to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness goldsman explained l a looks empty at three o clock in afternoon but new york is never empty it was a much more interesting way of showing windswept emptiness of world warner bros initially rejected this idea because of logistics but francis lawrence was determined to shoot on location to give film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages lawrence went to city with a camcorder and filmed areas filled with crowds then a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people test had a powerful effect on studio executives michael tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as grand central terminal viaduct several blocks of fifth avenue and washington square park film was shot primarily in anamorphic format with flashback scenes shot in super 35 filming began on september 23 2006 marcy avenue armory in williamsburg was used for interior of neville s home while greenwich village was used for exterior other locations include tribeca section of lower manhattan aircraft carrier intrepid kingsbridge armory in bronx and st patrick s cathedral weeds were imported from florida and were strewn across locations to make city look like it had been overgrown with them closure of major streets was controversial with new yorkers will smith said i don t think anyone s going to be able to do that in new york again anytime soon people were not happy that s most middle fingers i ve ever gotten in my career a bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in january on brooklyn bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which new york s citizens evacuate city shooting scene consumed 5 million of film s reported 150 million budget which was likely most expensive shoot in city to date scene which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies involved 250 crew members and 1 000 extras including 160 national guard members also present were several humvees three a cutter a utility boat and two response boat small craft as well as other vehicles including taxis police cars fire trucks and ambulances filming concluded on march 31 2007 computer generated imagery cgi was used to depict main spans of brooklyn bridge and manhattan bridge collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine manhattan island end of film was shot in lambertville new jersey http com blog film locations know new jersey reshoots were conducted around november 2007 lawrence noted we weren t seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago movie starts to take on a whole other life it s not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go huh maybe we should shoot this little piece in middle or tweak this a little bit it just so happened that our re shoots revolved around end of movie effects a week into filming francis felt infected referred to as darkseekers or hemocytes in script who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics were not convincing his decision to use cgi resulted in an increased budget and extended post production although end results were not always well received concept behind infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of time and lawrence explained they needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can t get out of people in middle of night when they re barefoot and their metabolisms are really spiked so they re constantly hyperventilating which you can t really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out actors remained on set to provide motion capture film s producers and sound people wanted creatures in movie to sound somewhat human but not standard so mike patton lead singer of faith no more was engaged to provide screams and howls of infected in addition cgi was used for lions and deer in film and to erase pedestrians in shots of new york workers visible in windows spectators and moving cars in distance were all removed in his vision of an empty new york lawrence cited john ford as his influence we didn t want to make an apocalyptic movie where landscape felt apocalyptic a lot of movie takes place on a beautiful day there s something magical about empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was ideal that cast and crew wanted release i am legend was originally slated for a november 21 2007 release in united states and canada but was delayed to december 14 film opened on december 26 2007 in united kingdom and ireland having been originally scheduled for january 4 2008 in december 2007 china temporarily suspended release of all american films in country which is believed to have delayed release of i am

film has an average score of 65 out of 100 based on 37 critics indicating generally favorable reviews a o scott wrote that will smith gave a graceful and effortless performance and also noted third act collapse he felt that movie does ponder some pretty deep questions about collapse and persistence of human civilization dana stevens of slate wrote that movie lost its way around hour mark noting that infected just aren t that scary npr critic bob mondello noted film s subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made film fit in perfectly with other more direct cinematic explorations of subject richard roeper gave film a positive review on television program at movies with ebert roeper commending will smith as being in prime form also saying there are some amazing sequences and that there was a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film film has been criticized for diverging from matheson s novel especially in its portrayal of a specifically christian theme much of negative criticism concerned film s third act with some critics favoring alternative ending in dvd release doug walker said alternate ending was powerful thought provoking and challenging and theatrical ending was a betrayal and castration of both film s tone and of what made original story so impactful popular mechanics published an article on december 14 2007 addressing some of scientific issues raised by film rate of deterioration of urban structures infrastructure and survival of fauna and flora plausibility of a retrovirus spreading out of control as depicted in film measles virus depicted in film however is not a retrovirus but is in fact a part of paramyxovirus family mechanics of brooklyn bridge s destruction magazine solicited reactions from alan weisman author of world without us virologist w ian lipkin md and michel bruneau phd comparing their predictions with film s depictions article raised most questions regarding virus mutation and medical results and pointed out that a suspension bridge like brooklyn bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span neville s method of producing power using gasoline powered generators seemed most credible this part of tale is possible if not entirely likely popular mechanics editor roy says philosopher slavoj zizek criticized film politically as being most regressive adaptation from novel he said that while original novel had a progressive multicultural message where neville became a legend to new creatures and is subsequently killed by them much like vampires were legends to humans 2007 film finds a cure for darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through apparent divine intervention according to zizek this misses original message and openly opt s for religious fundamentalism accolades i am legend earned four nominations for visual effects society awards and was also nominated for outstanding performance by a stunt ensemble at screen actors guild awards https film base pl screen actors guilds awards outstanding film and actor at image awards and best sound at satellite awards in june 2008 will smith won a saturn award for best actor will smith also won mtv movie awards for best male performance possible prequel director francis lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that will smith would be reprising his role plot of film would reveal what happened to neville before infected took over new york d b weiss was hired to write script while lawrence was in negotiations to return as director contingent on a sufficiently interesting story smith later discussed premise which would have his character and a team going from new york city to washington d c as they made their last stand against those infected with virus film would again explore premise of being alone lawrence stated tough thing is how do we do that again and in a different way in may 2011 francis lawrence stated that prequel was no longer in development saying i don t think that s ever going to happen in 2012 warner bros announced that negotiations had begun to produce another installment with intention of having will smith reprise his role in april 2014 studio attained a script entitled a garden at end of world described as a post apocalyptic variation of searchers studio executives found so many similarities to i am legend in screenplay they had author gary graham rewrite it so it could serve as a reboot of story hoping to create a franchise with new film will smith who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels has
