photo from 1987 taken by herb ritts it showed madonna in bed clutching a bed sheet to her bosom and sporting a pair of minnie mouse ears photo was a reference to early criticism of madonna s work when reviewers had described her voice as minnie mouse on helium composition according to rikky rooksby author of complete guide to music of madonna dear jessie sounds more like a children s lullaby than a pop song a baroque pop and psychedelic pop song it begins with sound of strings ushering a joyous melody with madonna singing in a full voice verses are sung without any background vocals to accompany madonna s voice however in chorus when she sings lines pink elephants and dear jessie hear laughter raining on your love parade a different set of vocals are interwoven with hers continuously chanting words la la synthesizer and strummed acoustics are added during second verse followed by repetition of chorus when a change in tempo and time signature occurs followed by sound of a child s laughter as madonna finishes singing intermediate lines close your eyes sleepy head it is time for your bed never forget what i said hang on a trumpet starts playing alongside main rhythm breakdown has feel of spanish music with glissando evoking string arrangements this is followed by bridge and chorus being repeated twice dear jessie ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out except orchestra which is equalized to make it sound very thin and as if coming out from a distorted radio lyrics encourage little girl jessie to use her imagination it summons up a psychedelic landscape where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids it references fairy tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other according to sheet music published by warner chappell music dear jessie is written in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute normally written in 4 4 song has a change in time signature after second chorus changing it to 3 4 it is composed in key of d major with madonna s voice ranging from c3 to d5 song s chord progression follows a sequence of bm a bm d a in verses and changes to d bm g a d in chorus critical reception author santiago fouz hernandez commented in his book madonna s drowned worlds that to him song felt like a of madonna s thoughts about what might be termed girlhood and on a on christopher p andersen author of madonna unauthorized described dear jessie as a wistfully psychedelic confection of carousels and pink elephants adding that song harkens back to lullabies your mother must have sang to you robin anne reid author of women in science fiction and fantasy overviews complimented fact that although sort of fantasies that madonna conjures might trend towards kinky and sexual she can also delve into a world of mermaids fountains of youth leprechauns and magic lanterns as is evident by dear jessie thumb alt greyscale image of beatles wearing coats and waving their hands dear jessie has been compared by reviewers to work of beatles lucy o brien author of madonna like an icon characterized song as harkening back to a childlike innocence but felt that madonna overdid elaborate fantasy imagery o brien preferred madonna s later attempts to sing lullaby like songs on her albums bedtime stories 1994 and american life 2003 edna gunderson from usa today called song a sugary lullaby while opining that it would not go down as one of madonna s well remembered songs chicago tribunes ian blair described track as bouncy and praised soothing quality of music s composition richard harrington from washington post deduced that with song madonna was harkening back to her own maternal emotions feelings she could not receive from her own mother due to her untimely death reviewing like a prayer album mike from los angeles daily news was not impressed with dear jessie and commented that madonna s voice possesses neither control power nor emotion to carry neo baroque experiments like dear jessie and oh father sal cinquemani from slant magazine called it a bittersweet reminder of of our innocence and imagination this non u s single is a testament to magic of madonna s collaboration with composer producer patrick leonard a number of reviewers have compared dear jessie to work of beatles allen metz one of authors of madonna companion two decades of commentary described composition of song as pastel pretty and richly orchestrated he felt that song would have fit better on beatles 1969 soundtrack album yellow submarine beatles influence was also noted by stephen holden from new york times who labeled dear jessie a stylish swatch of late beatles style psychedelia joey levy from spin characterized dear jessie as amazing describing his reaction to song as wow this is neat he added that song sounded like prince singing for beatles 1967 album sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band kevin phinney from austin american statesman compared song to solo work that beatles member john lennon did later in his career phinney wondered how madonna was able to come up with song since most of tracks from like a prayer are full of innuendo and double meanings chart performance in united
