elements in episode were based on sixth novel in a song of ice and fire series winds of winter which author george r r martin had hoped to have completed before sixth season began airing it also contains elements from chapter blind girl from a dance with dragons and several chapters of samwell tarly s voyage to citadel from a feast for crows raid on tower of joy was an event portrayed in a dream of ned stark in chapter eddard x of a game of thrones in inside episode feature for oathbreaker showrunner weiss stated of tower of joy flashback that one of best things about being able to go back with bran and look at past is to be able to see discrepancy between received history things that everybody knows about things that happened and what actually happened benioff continued every kid that grows up in westeros they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago and as far as bran knew it was just his father beat this legendary guy weiss also stated honor was so important to ned stark that it was worth losing his own life for but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important it could make a very very strong defense for ned doing what he did and it certainly does puncture mythology of ned stark that s running through this world especially after his death for first scene of episode when jon snow arises from table weiss stated that jon coming back to life was something in first first version we wrote originally had more talking and as we saw it on page written out we realized it was just too much dialogue we decided to just give kind of awe of that moment its due casting right thumb upright actress natalia tena returned to series as osha wildling actors natalia tena osha and art parkinson rickon stark both of whom had recurring roles in series until third season make their first return appearance in episode episode was also final appearance for a recurring character since first season episode lord snow ser alliser thorne portrayed by owen teale for flashback scene at tower of joy actor robert aramayo was cast to play a young eddard stark in an interview with access hollywood aramayo stated that he was a big fan of series and that it was an honor and a gift to be able to be a part of it in regards to portraying character similar to sean bean who played eddard stark in first season aramayo noted i didn t want to get too hung up on sounding like sean because i think that would ve sort of got in my way if i d have just situated all my work in that place i watched a lot of footage of him playing ned in first season again repeatedly especially one particular fight scene that he was in and i think that was biggest help for me when creating this version of ned was watching what sean did with ned in first season and trying to work out what a younger man s version of that is in a separate interview with hollywood reporter aramayo spoke about auditioning for role stating chance to audition to be on show was a dream even to audition it was an absolute dream to me i was very excited to audition and landing role was beyond my wildest dreams then when i found out role was ned it was overwhelming filming thumb left castle of zafra in guadalajara spain stood in for tower of joy in episode oathbreaker was directed by daniel sackheim sackheim is a first time director for game of thrones he also directed subsequent episode book of stranger filming of first exterior scene at castle black and final scene with jon snow executing traitors of night s watch took place over course of several months with execution scene being filmed first out of two as a result of a rock slide that occurred on set of where castle black is staged at magheramorne quarry scheduling for filming of scenes had to be re worked by executive producer bernie caulfield and producer chris newman with showrunner d b weiss saying it actually worked out for best some of stuff we were shooting in that location benefited from additional prep time rock slide gave us castle of zafra in guadalajara spain stood in for tower of joy in flashback scene involving a young ned stark and ser arthur dayne as witnessed by bran stark and three eyed raven during filming of scene it was reported widely among media sources after a fan of series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed a small portion of fighting scenes that occurred robert aramayo young eddard stark spoke about filming of scene in an interview following airing of episode and stated we all went through a bunch of training which continued through our three or four day shoot in spain it was intense it was not easy i did not find it easy to shoot that fight sequence it s not an easy routine at all and luke roberts who plays arthur dayne he s incredible man he continued if your move s getting blocked you obviously can t know that just like when you re playing a scene through dialogue you can t know response your scene partner gives you is going to be response you ll get you hope it is likewise in a fight if you re going to chop somebody s arm off or stab them in gut intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in gut and you have to play that intention fully i didn t expect it but it takes a lot of skill in terms of acting to play reception ratings

reads most solid episode of season six so far oathbreaker boasts no shocking reveals or breathless cliffhangers just strong forward moving storytelling in a review for ign matt fowler wrote with jon s final choice in oathbreaker show seemed to make a huge step forward into endgame one where we might see things that have been set up for a long time start to pay off not everyone s story is firing on all cylinders at moment tyrion was actively bored while waiting for news this week but enough is going on in north and at king s landing to carry series right now likewise emily vanderwerff of vox wrote oathbreaker is a crisp lean nicely paced episode of game of thrones it s one of those episodes where characters are mostly being positioned for future episodes but it s a solidly executed version of that basic template alyssa rosenberg of washington post wrote that she believed this was strongest episode of sixth season of game of thrones to date while erik kain of forbes noted season has been full of revelations but things are still building that s okay i love tension and not knowing exactly what s coming james hunt of what culture wrote another week of table setting and a very entertaining one at that it didn t quite reach high watermark of last week s instalment but there was still a lot of great stuff here steve johnson of baltimore sun noted instead of heavy action of season s first two hours sunday s game of thrones called oathbreaker was more about putting pieces on chess board into place sarah larson of new yorker wrote in her review last week we saw jon snow re enter life this week we may have been in proximity to him entering it first time in usual way tim surette of tv com called episode exhilarating accolades year award category nominee s result 2016
