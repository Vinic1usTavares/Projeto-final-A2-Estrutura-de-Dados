lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low remnant circulation moved slowly to northeast and wind shear conditions abated as a result erica began to gain some signs of organization at this time remnants moved towards southeast as a result of an upper level trough developing over australia thumb cyclones erica left and right on march 11 alt satellite image of two simultaneous tropical cyclones both with similar appearances area of low pressure gained sufficient shower activity and organization to be renamed as a tropical cyclone at 1800 utc on 10 march while located southwest of solomon islands capital of honiara erica gradually intensified attaining equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale sshs originally moving to southeast at a slow pace erica began to accelerate due to influence of weak mid level ridge to its east continuing to intensify cyclone reached its peak intensity on 13 march with a minimum barometric pressure of and peak winds of 260 km h 150 mph 1 minute sustained eye of cyclone began to shrink in diameter and become symmetrical later on 13 march erica began to parallel western coast of new caledonia while maintaining a strong intensity before crossing extreme southern end of island at caledonian island commune of l ile des pins after passing island erica accelerated and began to rapidly weaken in presence of strong wind shear as a result cyclone began a phase of extratropical transition as it quickly paced to southeast on 15 march erica completed this transition remnant low continued to east
