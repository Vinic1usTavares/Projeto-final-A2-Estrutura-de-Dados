staff has two types of long range ammunition in form of power cylinders orange cylinders used for blast damage and blue cylinders used for stunning foes monkey can also remain stationary and charge his staff to use same stun attack in game players encounter numerous mechs as enemies certain mechs can be used as weapons monkey can perform a finishing move on them when they are low on health such as tearing gun off a turret or throwing an explosive foe at other combat mechs monkey s other abilities include his force shield that can block a certain amount of damage before requiring a recharge

actions involving her technical skills like hacking into a computer players can command trip to use her different skills for instance she can scan surrounding area revealing hazards such as land mines or mechs on standby and project a temporary hologram as a decoy to draw enemy s attention away from monkey players can also order trip to hide behind covers or regroup with monkey having no combat ability of her own trip is vulnerable in instances where she is attacked by enemies her only defense is an electromagnetic propulsion blast which she can use to stun enemies threatening her temporarily other than combat gameplay also focuses heavily on platforming where monkey can scale and leap across ruins throughout game some areas and platforms will collapse shortly after use requiring faster scaling before monkey potentially falls to his death trip also plays a part in platforming sections of gameplay making some sections of platforming akin to puzzle like forms of gameplay in other instances where monkey can make jumps climbs trip needs to be thrown to other side or ride on his back in some sections of game monkey and trip are separated so player cannot use her

project game initially titled enslaved was announced in september 2010 for release on xbox 360 and playstation 3 cambridge based developer ninja theory developed game their previous project was playstation 3 exclusive game heavenly sword tameem antoniades acted as game s director actor andy serkis provided motion capture for title film director and producer alex garland served as game s writer and designer and nitin sawhney composed game s score using only two thirds of budget of heavenly sword game s development was completed on 3 september 2010 and game s publisher confirmed it had been declared gold indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release origin thumb 180px right tameem antoniades served as game s creative director after completing heavenly sword ninja theory intended to develop a sequel but contractual terms with sony computer entertainment forced them to halt game s production studio decided to leave title and all technologies built for it to sony and seek external funding from another publisher for their next project this would eventually become enslaved odyssey to west powered by epic games unreal engine initially ninja theory pitched game to several hollywood studios as a cgi film but they were not interested in backing project company dedicated three months to creating promotional materials to convince publishers to sign game a number of publishers were shown a detailed design document and a two minute cgi trailer and team received enthusiastic responses from them initially they signed a deal with green screen but firm dissolved a month later namco bandai games later agreed to publish game mike ball cto of ninja theory revealed that initial idea for game came from heavenly sword in particular relationship between protagonist and her companion kai this relationship resonated with players and team wanted to repeat their success with a set of easily recognisable characters during heavenly swords development antoniades researched wuxia genre and read novel journey to west he found novel epic and compared it favourably to lord of rings however enslaved is only a loose adaptation of novel team decided to shift away from wuxia theme to sci fi as it was a genre many staff on development team wanted to explore as a result mechs replaced demons and technology replaced magic initially game was set in a foreign world animations created by hayao miyazaki whose works often integrate nature with steampunk inspired team however after watching life after people team decided to set game on earth one that was peaceful as nature reclaimed it after humanity s disappearance a lot of colour in particular red was injected into game s world to reflect this writing antoniades wrote game s early drafts serkis was involved in development of enslaved from beginning garland became involved six months later garland wrote game s script and designed cutscenes to ensure transition between cutscene and gameplay was smooth garland agreed to collaborate with ninja theory as he was actively looking for a way to become involved in a video game production script itself was initially developed separately for a time and then gameplay developers joined to mesh both story and gameplay to achieve this a was employed to teach editing camera and film language techniques these techniques and use of music were used to make coherent transitions between cut scenes and gameplay one of more important aspects of script was characterisation and interaction 2001 playstation 2 game ico inspired characters relationships chief of development nina kristensen described protagonists monkey and trip as opposites at first whose relationship evolves as they learn to rely on each other in hostile setting serkis also helped created game s characters trip s design went through several iterations she was designed initially to look like a queen and have a pale appearance so she would look gothic tank girl and kai from heavenly sword inspired second iteration of her character she wore a costume that features face of a character and had tattoos which team felt gave character more personality and attitude they tried to apply blue paint to trip s hair but found it unsuitable as it made her too science fiction and punk initial design was deemed too aggressive so team modified her design to make her look more delicate and fragile monkey also has several design features he wears a face paint a reference to his counterpart in journey to west novel and a reflection of character s tribal nature scars were added to his face to increase his sex appeal while a cloth sash was used to replace monkey s tail according to serkis monkey behaved like a gruff hobo in game as opposed to being mischievous like he is in novel monkey s hair was once designed as white inspired by a picture of an albino gorilla according to antoniades garland s initial script was very simple and dialogue was reductive this was part of garland s intention to reduce use of story exposition in favour of creating more drama in script actors body language and vocal cues delivered much of game s information and plot than direct use of cutscenes initial scripts featured two hours of cutscene but it was drastically cut and reduced to only one hour and 10 minutes to facilitate this style of storytelling garland suggested that camera control be taken away from players during certain moments of game so they will be introduced to and become aware of game s environments which further help to clarify game s story this led to an internal debate within company with other gameplay designers fearing it would break gameplay flow this feature was kept in game antoniades said in hindsight that such techniques helped keep things exciting design ninja theory developed gameplay to include more variety than their last projects with introduction of platforming sessions and puzzles players use different approaches to combat such as stealth to avoid combat altogether and use trip s abilities to their advantage according to antoniades design choice behind this was to make portions of gameplay more tactical being at times a puzzle game in disguise outside actual puzzle portions of gameplay combat itself had fewer combination style attacks than most combat heavy action games it was more accessible and stream lined while including different abilities equipment enemy types and scenarios requiring thought so as not to become too easy trip s involvement could not make her a dead weight to gameplay instead her unique abilities are helpful making her brains while monkey is brute some gameplay features were cut from final game for instance a mechanic which allows players to break circuitry of a mech in first person by pressing buttons like a music game was cut because it was not well implemented thumb 180px right andy serkis portrayed monkey in enslaved odyssey of west serkis considered use of motion capture to be akin to that in a film where it helps craft story in a virtual world studio utilised motion capture in an effort to capture realistic human emotions technology itself was said to be advanced even requiring a mathematician for more complex portions of coding beyond facial animation most of motion capture was utilised prominently during cut scenes as many of actions within gameplay itself were considered physically impossible serkis felt that motion capture also allowed for better dialogue performances since it allows actors to immerse themselves in story become emotionally engaged thus delivering better performances serkis and performance capture team also used a physical theatre to deliver believable performances lindsay shaw was selected from some 60 actresses to provide performance capture for trip at a casting session held in los angeles garland was also involved in game s designs he offered advice on positioning of game s camera to ensure that each battle scenes was more impactful team modified trip s idle pose in accordance with garland s advice garland often challenged game s design team he demanded every object and environment detail featured in game make sense within its world to ensure title is consistent throughout garland questioned placement of random items like forest paths and powered doors for their relevance when team chose to include random encounters with enemies garland insisted on adding story elements to ensure they flowed well with game s narrative and that combat encounter would be a payoff antoniades described garland as intimidating and found his approach to storytelling eye opening his high expectations caused game s producers to fear title would not ship on time because of garland s extensive involvement in game s design he was credited as one of its co designers nitin sawhney who had collaborated with ninja theory on heavenly sword served as game s composer according to sawhney soundtrack s main theme was primarily based on journey transition and resolution which also reflects two protagonists dynamic relationship sawhney s said his second collaboration with ninja theory was more fluid and smooth as he had more materials like an early script and animation to use as references while he composed score release before game s release namco bandai made a playable demo available over xbox live and playstation network on 21 september 2010 demo features first playable chapter of game where monkey escapes crashing slave ship along with standard edition of game various video game and general retailers offered exclusive extra content

windows version on 25 october 2013 this version also known as premium edition bundles base game with pigsy s perfect 10 downloadable content dlc and several character skins it was also available for purchase via playstation network downloadable content pigsy s perfect 10 is a downloadable expansion to enslaved it is a prequel to main story where players take control of character pigsy it is a side story rather than being directly linked so as to not interfere with events in enslaved as well as new chapters dlc also provides option to display and play both main game and add on in stereoscopic 3d it uses trioviz for games technology which allows game to display in three dimensions on 3d hdtv set via hdmi 1 3 or hdmi 1 4 connection as well as on traditional 2d hdtv sets with 3d glasses dlc was first released on both platforms on 23 november 2010 several download codes for pigsy s perfect 10 malfunctioned prompting namco bandai to issue an apology and code replacements since player takes role of pigsy gameplay has also changed because he is a different character and build than monkey while pigsy can still climb over terrain he cannot scale buildings as fast or athletically instead he utilises a mechanical grappling hand attached to his own to reach higher places and swing over obstacles and large gaps in combat without same fighting skills as monkey pigsy wields a long ranged rifle and grenades instead stealth is also a preferable approach to gameplay sometimes requiring avoiding combat altogether reception critical reception according to review aggregator metacritic console version of game received generally positive reviews from critics while windows version received mixed reviews game was nominated at dice awards for adventure game of year it was also nominated at ivor novello award in best original video game score category garland and antoniades won best game at uk writers guild award jim sterling of destructoid praised stunning

mcshea strongly commended game s cutscenes calling them superbly made and praised game s reliance on character movements to tell a story rather than using dialogue matthew keast of gamesradar

as impressive and praising it for further elevating gameplay experiences justin mcelroy of joystiq however noted that game had several technical issues such as low frame rate and occasionally clunky controls igns arthur gies called game s graphics beautiful with unique and distinct character designs however he shared mcelroy s concern saying there were several graphical glitches that slightly

storytelling as mature gies strong praised story for being believable and moving noting that it was one of best stories in any video game game s combat was viewed positively by sterling he felt it is simple and satisfying though he found dodge mechanic for monkey useless and that it created minor annoyances he singled out cloud device as one of his favorite gameplay systems though he lamented that there are not many opportunities to use it mcshea found combat basic requiring players to be constantly mashing buttons though he enjoyed it for being brutal and satisfying he commended developers for adding platforming sessions boss fights and puzzles into game to break up its pacing keast commented that combat is more tactical and methodical though he noted that it was not as complex as other titles like god of war or castlevania lords of shadow gibson called gameplay solid but she was disappointed by its lack of innovation and depth gies commented on noticeable delay between players input and in game action he felt combat was not interesting and varied enough reiner agreed writing that while combat was visceral it was neither deep nor interesting sterling reiner keast and gibson were disappointed by platforming sections lack of challenges both gibson and keast criticised game for players excessively with different guides sales namco bandai hoped they would sell over a million copies of enslaved publisher revealed in november 2010 that game only sold 800 000 copies worldwide but figure was corrected to 460 000 in february 2011 by september 2011 sales of 730 000 had been achieved but this was not considered substantial enough to warrant continuation of franchise so a planned sequel was cancelled namco blamed game s release in a crowded window as key factor it being a commercial failure in 2014 tameem antoniades stated speaking of games poor sales i m not sure if fantasy elements were a turn off gameplay mix or lack of visibility it was probably a mix of all three
