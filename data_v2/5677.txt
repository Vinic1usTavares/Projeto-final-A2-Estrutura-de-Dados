is not a direct descendant of belmont clan he is unable to unlock vampire killer s full power without assistance of a member of lecarde family charlotte is a mage and distant descendant of belnades clan game features same antagonists as previous castlevania titles and introduces three new ones main villain is dracula who serves as game s final boss despite his previous incarnations in timeline such as symphony of night dracula has short black hair and no facial hair new antagonists are three vampires that have taken control of dracula s castle leading them is brauner an elderly vampire based on real life artist victor brauner from same time period brauner recreated dracula s castle using souls of dead from world war ii in order to draw power from castle and plans to use that power to destroy humanity he disdains humanity because his two real daughters had been killed 30 years prior during world war i brauner is able to construct paintings containing pocket dimensions in order to harness castle s power for his own purposes he is joined by twin vampire sisters stella and loretta although two are vampires they are actually eric lecarde s daughters who were turned into vampires by brauner who they believe is their father in bad ending brauner gives up and escapes from castle in order to save lives of his two adopted daughters assisting two main characters are a priest named vincent who acts as a merchant selling weapons potions and magic spells as well as a ghost who introduces himself as wind and provides jonathan and charlotte new skills and equipment that once belonged to him if they perform certain tasks called quests wind s identity is eventually revealed to be eric lecarde stella and loretta s true father who once fought alongside jonathan s father to slay dracula in bloodlines story prior to start of game two sisters stella and loretta travel to dracula s castle in search of their father eric lecarde after traversing through castle two arrive at brauner s lair where they find their father defeated seeing two sisters brauner grabs them and turns them into vampires loretta father eric s stay back stella but you re hurt so badly eric brauner brauner have no fear i shall grant you a world of peace my beloved daughters at beginning of game jonathan and charlotte encounter vincent at gates of castle who serves as a merchant upon entering castle jonathan and charlotte encounter an enigmatic blue figure that they first identify as hostile after figure transforms into a humanoid male he explains that he was killed a short time ago and had cast a magical barrier to keep himself conscious while still within confines of castle jonathan something s here charlotte it s not human johnathan a monster charlotte no wait i sense no evil from him charlotte i find it very odd to find a ghost not controlled by dracula s castle wind a smart girl compared to this foolish boy just before i died i cast a magic barrier on myself binding my soul to this place i m free from castle s control but i m trapped here he introduces himself as wind shortly after meeting wind jonathan and charlotte find one of brauner s magical portraits unable to destroy it from outside two travel into world within charlotte in short think of it as a series of walls that surround magic controlling dracula s castle painting itself is just outermost wall as soon as you break it it ll regenerate it s unbreakable jonathan how convenient so now what charlotte i ll align my magic with painting s so we can enter it that ll be best way to circumvent castle s magic risk is quite high though soon they find brauner s a shortly after its defeat one of vampire sisters appears and disdains their efforts saying their control is lessened in only a minor degree later when entering second portrait they find brauner and two twins brauner laughs at notion of reviving dracula as he has failed too many times to control humanity but concedes his power is too great to ignore both sisters desire to kill two humans but brauner sees dracula s servant death as a greater threat as he could wrest control from him far more easily than them while exploring castle charlotte and jonathan encounter death who acts as if dracula were already revived when informed dracula is still dead and that another vampire is controlling castle he scoffs at idea of a hand other than dracula s to rule castlevania yet he is gravely disturbed when he sees statements are true and promptly leaves to seek a way to destroy brauner and revive dracula jonathan dracula isn t this castle s master anymore why are you here death my what an odd thing to say this castle belongs to lord dracula to him and no one else charlotte i get it you ve joined forces with brauner because you re thinking of resurrecting dracula aren t you death brauner who are you talking about jonathan there s no point in playing dumb we already know current master of this castle is a vampire by name of brauner death vampire brauner even with my power i didn t sense that it seems i have been dormant for far too long jonathan and charlotte encounter stella at base of tower of death and after being promptly defeated she loses her locket as she flees with her sister opening locket charlotte finds a photo of twins with wind and both decide to question him wind confesses his true name eric lecarde and that twins are his children wind ah indeed i do let me tell you my real name it s eric eric lecarde charlotte then what s your relationship with two girls in photo eric they re my daughters later jonathan and charlotte confront death who wants to disassociate himself from brauner and has no desire to fight nevertheless he engages them but is defeated and flees when jonathan and charlotte reach towering spire of master s keep they find dracula s throne room sealed off and conclude that brauner is delaying dracula s revival to siphon his power jonathan what i can see way ahead but i can t move forward charlotte hold on a minute this is way to throne but it s spatially segregated simply put there s something like an invisible wall here brauner said he had separated dracula from castle this is what he was talking about after searching castle jonathan and charlotte obtain sanctuary spell a magical attack that dispels curses and allows dead to rest in peace during battle with twins sisters are cured of their vampirism by charlotte s spell this allows them to regain their sanity and they subsequently offer to perform a ritual that allows jonathan to utilize vampire killer whip s full power jonathan vampire s control seems to be fading it s a success charlotte well of course no problem as you would say loretta we what have we been doing stella heir to vampire killer jonathan morris correct i apologize for all that we have put you through jonathan huh oh sure n no problem stella and miss charlotte thank you so much for setting us free stella one more thing it s about vampire killer loretta we can perform a ritual to unlock power of whip after jonathan passes test and defeats memory of whip an entity bearing likeness of richter belmont he is warned against overusing it as vampire killer drains life force of a non belmont wielding full power eventually killing user as it did jonathan s father after twins are defeated they open a passage leading to a massive storeroom that contains a portrait leading to brauner s studio stella studio painting is sealed by four paintings surrounding it charlotte meaning we need to break seal to enter painting loretta door to inner room can only be opened by either brauner or ourselves two confront brauner and defeat him when confronted about his acts he admits justice wasn t on his side but refuses to acknowledge it was on heroes death suddenly hovers from above and kills brauner with one swing of his scythe this act destroys painting sealing throne room and jonathan and charlotte then go to battle with dracula before they can engage dracula death enters room and sides with his master and together they attack heroes jonathan oh so you re ignoring me turn and face me death you will not touch lord dracula this time let s fight for real dracula enough with this sideshow why don t we show him our combined power during course of battle death and dracula merge into a more powerful form but they are eventually defeated by jonathan and charlotte when destroyed everyone flees castle and sees from distance as walls collapse later twins jonathan and charlotte are visited in fields outside castle by eric s ghost who gives some advice to twins and thanks charlotte and jonathan for destroying curse before his spirit finally fades from existence as four of them leave they end up forgetting about vincent who is comically trying to get their attention as he chases after them development first announced a new castlevania for ds on october 5 2005 details of game were not released until april 21
