spent a few years in venetian dalmatia and possibly hungary maria settled in ottoman greece at court of her aunts mara and kantakouzene her string of conflicts and legal disputes with kantakouzene republic of ragusa and athonite monasteries earned her an ill reputation with monks describing her as an evil woman youth thumb decline of serbian despotate in late 1450s maria was eldest of three children born to lazar brankovic son of despot of serbia durad brankovic and his wife helena palaiologina born probably in 1447 she was christened helena two sisters followed her milica and irene lazar succeeded his father as despot on 24 december 1456 but his reign was cut short by his death on 28 january 1458 despoina helena and lazar s brother stefan seized power and began negotiating a marriage between her eldest daughter and stephen tomasevic elder surviving son of king thomas of bosnia intent was to consolidate an alliance against threat of expanding ottoman empire which had already reduced despotate of serbia to a strip of land governed from smederevo fortress stephen tomasevic arrived to smederevo during holy week of 1459 taking over fortress and government on 21 march marriage was celebrated on 1 april first sunday following easter bride soon afterwards joined catholic church and adopted name maria marriage stephen tomasevic s reign in serbia was short lived ottoman sultan mehmed conqueror regarded arrangement as an offense to his rights as overlord of serbia on 20 june 1459 ottoman forces captured smederevo without a struggle and proceeded to annex remnants of serbian state to their realm stephen and maria fled to bosnia seeking refuge at court of his father in jajce maria carried with her relics of saint luke evangelist her precious family heirloom upon death of king thomas in summer of 1461 maria s husband ascended as king of bosnia maria became new queen consort with her stepmother in law catherine possibly retiring from court as queen dowager maria s queenship did not last long either in 1462 her husband made a fatal decision of refusing to pay tribute to ottomans who started preparing an attack which ended independent kingdom of bosnia following ottoman invasion in may 1463 royal family appears to have decided to split and flee towards neighbouring croatia and dalmatia in different directions to confuse and mislead attackers king stephen who had sent maria to dalmatia along with saint luke s relics was captured and executed two queens maria and catherine were only members of royal family to escape invaders and both eventually reached territories of republic of ragusa 16th century chronicler mavro wrote that queen maria was captured by ban of croatia pavao during her journey to coast but this is unlikely because pavao himself was in turkish captivity around that time years of wandering maria in her haste to avoid falling into ottoman hands mislaid relics of saint luke bosnian franciscan friars retrieved them and headed towards ragusa but were intercepted in by ivanis vlatkovic a local nobleman and friend of queen who refused to let them pass without her permission this angered ragusa which demanded that ivanis surrender relics to them on 9 july republic s authorities issued a decree allowing queen to take refuge on one of their islands decree also made reference to an important issue ragusans wanted to discuss with her most likely sale of relics republic of venice also expressed interest in maria s heirloom but she was gravely offended in august when venetian authorities miserly tried to question authenticity of relics venetians eventually succeeded in concluding a sale through her deputy ivanis vlatkovic she regretted transaction after hungarian king matthias corvinus offered her three or four towns in exchange for relics but her attempt to have ivanis retrieve them in late august failed both ivanis and maria were rewarded by venice with queen being allowed to settle in benedictine monastery of st stephen under pines near spalato while residing in monastery queen maria received visits from bosnians and hungarians that made venetian authorities grow suspicious they soon instructed government of spalato to recommend moving her to sebenico or to an island on grounds of poor living conditions in monastery with intention of permanently removing her from their territory unlike her stepmother in law and even hungarian king 16 year old queen maria refrained from claiming patrimony of bosnian kings during her exile in dalmatia and ragusa possibly having spent some time in hungary after leaving dalmatia queen maria settled in ottoman greece she probably joined her paternal aunts mara mehmed s esteemed and influential stepmother and kantakouzene on their estate near serres a conflict which erupted in 1476 between maria and kantakouzene led to latter s brief imprisonment after queen complained to mehmed strife may have caused queen to move to constantinople ottoman capital where she enjoyed protection of mehmed and his successor bayezid ii she spent years slandering and intriguing against her closest relatives as well as suing everyone from whom she could profit lawsuits and frauds in october 1484 queen maria approached sublime porte to ask for sultan s help in reclaiming a third of her paternal grandfather s deposit in ragusa which she insisted had not been returned to her father bayezid wrote to ragusa and sent an envoy to bring gold but ragusans responded with a letter proving that deposit had been returned to lazar maria however disputed authenticity of her father s seal and bayezid sided with her it is not known whether ragusans obeyed bayezid s command to send gold to queen but there is plenty of evidence against her allegations in letters of her father and uncle upon deaths of her aunts mara and kantakouzene in 1487 and 1490 respectively maria inherited their possessions in accordance with sharia law she immediately launched a claim to icons left by mara to monastery of great lavra on mount athos since her sex precluded her from accessing holy mountain it took bayezid s intervention in 1492 for her to receive icons shortly afterwards she called to sharia court monks of monastery alleging that one of them stole money from her aunt kantakouzene while in her service but could not prove this in 1495 maria became involved in another legal dispute with ragusa this time concerning tribute of ston tribute had been paid by ragusa to serbian rulers since reign of stefan dusan but income was ceded to monastery of saint archangels michael and gabriel in jerusalem mara reclaimed income after monastery was closed and after her death it was managed by kantakouzene maria decided to claim it as her aunts legal heir but athonite monasteries of chilandar and saint paul s cited her aunts non formalized bequest queen maria described straightforwardly by monks as an evil woman died 1500 when chilandar and saint paul s were recorded as having secured income she is believed to have died in and to have been buried in a local church along with her maternal uncle manuel palaiologos it is not clear why maria enjoyed such strong support of sultans in her various conflicts and plain frauds an explanation might be offered by narrative of her relative theodore who lived for some time with her aunts and whose family maintained close relations with brankovic dynasty he wrote that queen maria married a sipahi with whom she had no children but went so far as to claim that she was captured by turks in bosnia and forced into marriage which is evidently untrue family tree references bibliography category 1447 births category 1490s deaths maria of serbia maria of serbia maria of serbia maria
