these acquisitions ran possessed a rather thin and limited fleet during this period which mcnicoll blamed on past naval planning he criticised lack of foresight in earlier decisions that had led to inconsistencies and inadequate estimating in future needs of ran which had consequently left fleet outdated and minimal in addition to ran s materiel issues mcnicoll faced significant problems with morale and recruitment a series of mishaps and accidents over previous decade led to what naval historian tom frame termed as an appreciable erosion of public confidence in navy s professional
