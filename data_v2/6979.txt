primeval is not last episode of season joss whedon felt so strongly about importance of four core characters that he dedicated finale to exploring their development restless opens with buffy willow xander and giles arriving at buffy s mother s house still brimming with energy of spell that bound them together in primeval each of them falls asleep quickly however and their dreams are a pastiche

according to comic book series haunted adam was once a human member of initiative tasked with protecting professor walsh ghost of mayor richard wilkins however took over body of a vampire which was then captured by initiative desperate to escape mayor moved to body of a dead demon and killed adam having been one of her favorite agents professor walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 project espenson passim however due to complex nature of buffyverse this chain of events may not in fact be canonical development creation and casting series writer david fury cited graphic novel author alan moore s promethea a story combining science fiction mysticism and a female superhero as inspiration for storyline and another nod to frankenstein as its original title was frankenstein or modern prometheus in addition series creator joss whedon has long been interested in science fiction he wrote script for film alien resurrection 1997 where an extraterrestrial creature is bred from a human and an alien in a laboratory and went on to develop space western television series firefly buffy uses both science and magic as narrative devices according to author andrew aberdein series employs science in three ways to demonstrate what contemporary science explains to posit what science may be able to accomplish and dominance of supernatural forces over science according to aberdein adam a redundant bio mechanical demonoid is series deepest exploration of scientific potential south pp 79 90 series writer doug petrie states that adam is embodiment of invasion of science in a world where magic is most powerful force series relied on its own form of magic to explain buffy s superpowers and other supernatural occurrences up to fourth season adam is what happens when people who believe in science use demons for military gain according to petrie result is that science gets its ass kicked by magic buffy vampire slayer had been very successful in its first three seasons on television but some of characters left series and storylines ended creating a need for an entire shift in location and mission buffy and core group of friends who fight with her graduate from high school while school itself was blown up in third season finale fourth season therefore presents viewers with buffy her best friends willow alyson hannigan xander nicholas brendon and mentor giles anthony head at a crossroads series creator joss whedon called it a strange sort of schizophrenic season with a weird incoherence but also stated that episodes in fourth season were among series best writers set out to explore characters trials as they discover more about themselves following defining years of high school although they had been a cohesive group of friends in first three seasons situations arise in fourth to separate them writers focused on each of four core characters individually throughout season to increase impact of their finally coming back together in penultimate episode primeval when they merge their essences to form a super buffy in order to defeat adam thumb 200px right actor george hertzberg portrayed adam in series george hertzberg a university of southern california graduate with experience in sitcoms and commercials was chosen based on one of adam s monologues he was given to read for audition hertzberg counted luck and being in right place at right time in helping him get role many recurring characters on buffy start with one or two episodes and when writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors they often make them a regular part of cast hertzberg however understood at his reading that adam was to be a major part of fourth season holder et al pp 305 307 casting director amy britt needed someone physically imposing for part with hertzberg fitting bill britt stated this is a guy we re going to want eventually to have some affinity for we can t just see him as an evil being he is evil to core and should scare us with his actions but there s also innocence like frankenstein monster you realize that they re only doing what they know or what they ve been programmed to do these aren t born creatures these are creations holder et al p 347 make up when he auditioned hertzberg had no idea what adam would look like in full costume and make up buffy used a company named optic nerve to build materials to make hertzberg look like a demonoid almost immediately after hertzberg got part optic nerve sketched and sculpted adam s appearance they had hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face arms chest and legs then he was fitted for contact lenses they also created separate hands and a chest to film for close up shots adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which when used had to be filmed without hertzberg behind it entire construction of adam s appearance took about two weeks holder et al pp 380 384 hertzberg s voice was also modified post production when he saw full adam prosthetic and costume his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex it took hours to get hertzberg into his full costume but even after it was fully applied on set often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of cameras he spoke of need to stay focused during all waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for part hertzberg george interviews with george hertzberg bbc cult buffy news 2005 retrieved on 26 november 2011 themes thumb 200px left adam serves as an allusion to frankenstein s monster buffy studies scholar roz kaveney states that estrangement from self and others is primary theme of fourth season to illustrate absolute search for identity series writers created adam who is more truly alone than is anyone else kaveney pp 23 27 he is a creature assembled from a man vampires demons and cutting edge cybernetic technology adam was not first re animated corpse to be presented in series some assembly required in second season also had a frankenstein monster like creation and beauty and beasts in third includes references to strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde both touch on misuse or abuse of science golden and holder pp 83 et al pp 147 149 adam is a clear reference to frankenstein s monster who in novel frankenstein 1818 tells his creator that he is adam of your labours mary shelley wrote novel to highlight problems progress science and industry create for humanity stevenson p 133 throughout action monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created likewise adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into world and much like frankenstein s monster he finds a little boy and asks boy who and what he adam is then murders and dissects him adam is a curious character seeking truth and pontificating on what he has learned even if he gained knowledge through heartless violence whedon wanted adam to be inquisitive and introspective directing george hertzberg to find stillness in character roz kaveney notes that hertzberg s flawed but impressive performance includes adam s interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider implications of what he is saying kaveney pp 77 78 author nikki stafford connects adam s need to learn about world around him to frankenstein s monster adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions a peculiarity of his creation as dr walsh never encouraged others to question her stafford pp 232 233 one buffy studies writer draws comparisons between dr walsh and victor frankenstein both of whom build monsters out of body parts to compensate for human vulnerability south pp 91 93 moral of shelley s novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should wilcox and lavery pp 133 driver pp 67 pp 47 48 questioning tradition and authority specifically institutional authority is a repeated theme on show buffy was created to subvert media trope of a young petite girl who easily falls prey to a male monster resisting patriarchy is exhibited in buffy s opposing first season s master mark metcalf leader of a cult determined to cause apocalypse and again in third season where exploring issues of power and its abuse is a primary theme buffy opposes sunnydale s secretly evil mayor harry groener who is planning to transform into a giant demon and feed on graduating class of sunnydale high school military industrial complex is at heart of authority question in season four again drawing comparisons to frankenstein where frankenstein s monster had no parental love adam has a design flaw unlike frankenstein s monster who needs his creator to make him a mate adam supplants dr walsh s existence with technology finding her unnecessary and thus he kills her adam is embodiment of lack of moral guidance in pursuing scientific and technological advancement he represents cannibalistic nature of relentless and unchecked power what that power wreaks comes back to devour its source stevenson pp 130 134 buffy however subverts shelley s novel in way adam is defeated both frankenstein and monster must suffer alone frankenstein itself is an inversion of romantic era ideal of a solitary hero who must endure struggles by portraying monster and its creator as isolated and miserable buffy as embodiment of romantic hero further subverts this because source of her success according to anita rose is that she fights with friends only then is she able to defeat adam reception critical reception to adam was largely mixed with critics opinions ranging from negative to positive nikki stafford in her book bite me 10th guide to world of buffy vampire slayer was critical of adam as well as series doing several frankenstein inspired episodes so close together noting that some assembly required was aired just two seasons prior stafford called entire ending sequence of primeval which featured reanimated corpses of several minor characters as well as death of adam stupid and disgusting and wrote that scene was a main reason she was happily bidding adieu to plot involving adam and initiative jenna busch in her book joss whedon complete companion called adam one of buffy s least interesting big bads and argued that his story arc involving initiative was rather unconvincing and somewhat off putting other reviews were more accepting of character noel murray from a v club was slightly more positive towards concept of adam he wrote that he love d idea of adam but was having a hard time understanding coherence of his application to main plot he cited inconsistencies in adam s existence noting adam killed professor walsh weeks ago and yet initiative is still fully operational and no one seems overly bothered by fact that one of their leaders was building a monster murray however did conclude that show s writers and producers did a decent job of bringing plot involving adam to a conclusion despite critiquing larger plot murray was always impressed with adam s costume make up furthermore he was positively surprised that it took him a minute to recognize adam s appearance in restless sans makeup see also list of buffyverse villains and supernatural beings references footnotes bibliography dial driver emily emmons sally ford
