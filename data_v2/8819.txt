destroying large amounts of supplies and demoralizing southern people tactics that he used during this march though effective remain a subject of controversy he accepted surrender of all confederate armies in carolinas georgia and florida in april 1865 after having been present at most major military engagements in west when grant assumed u s presidency in 1869 sherman succeeded him as commanding

militia officers refusing to believe that confederate general albert sidney johnston would leave his base at corinth he took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines and refused to entrench build abatis or push out reconnaissance patrols at shiloh he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape kind of criticism he had received in kentucky he had written to his wife that if he took more precautions they d call me crazy again daniel p 138 despite being caught unprepared by attack sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous union rout finding grant at end of day sitting under an oak tree in darkness and smoking a cigar sherman felt in his words some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat in what would become one of most notable conversations of war sherman said simply well grant we ve had devil s own day haven t we after a puff of his cigar grant replied calmly yes lick em

shortly after union forces occupied corinth on may 30 sherman persuaded grant not to leave his command despite serious difficulties he was having with halleck sherman offered grant an example from his own life before battle of shiloh i was cast down by a mere newspaper assertion of crazy but that single battle gave me new life and i m now in high feather he told grant that if he remained in army

in chief and sherman became military governor of occupied memphis marszalek sherman pp 188 201 vicksburg careers of both officers ascended considerably after that time in sherman s case this was in part because he developed close personal ties to grant during two years they served together in west daniel pp 309 10 during long and complicated campaign against vicksburg one newspaper complained

on arkansas post generally regarded as a politically motivated distraction from effort to capture vicksburg smith p 227 it should be noted however that sherman had targeted arkansas post independently and considered operation there worthwhile see marszalek pp 208 10 sherman memoirs pp 318 25 before vicksburg campaign in spring of 1863 sherman expressed serious reservations about wisdom of grant s unorthodox strategy to wit an invading army may separate from its supply train and subsist by foraging smith pp 235 36 but he went on to perform well in that campaign under grant s supervision

overall command sherman quickly took his assigned target of billy goat hill at north end of missionary ridge only to discover that it was not part of ridge at all but rather a detached spur separated from main spine by a rock strewn ravine when he attempted to attack main spine at tunnel hill his troops were repeatedly repelled by patrick cleburne s heavy division best unit in bragg s army sherman

billy to succeed him as head of military division of mississippi which entailed command of union troops in western theater of war as grant took overall command of armies of united states sherman wrote

attempting a direct assault only at disastrous battle of kennesaw mountain in july cautious johnston was replaced by more aggressive john bell hood who played to sherman s strength by challenging him to direct battles on open ground meanwhile in august sherman learned that i had been commissioned a major general in regular army which was unexpected and not desired until successful in capture of atlanta sherman memoirs p 576 nomination was not submitted to senate until december eicher p 702 sherman s atlanta campaign concluded successfully on september 2 1864 with capture of city which hood had been forced to abandon this success made sherman a household name and helped ensure lincoln s presidential re election in november in august democratic party had nominated as its candidate george b mcclellan popular former union army commander and it had seemed likely that lincoln would lose to mcclellan lincoln s defeat could well have meant victory of confederacy as democratic party platform

in durham north carolina to negotiate a confederate surrender at insistence of johnston and of confederate president jefferson davis sherman conditionally agreed to generous terms that dealt with both political and military issues sherman thought that those terms were consistent with views lincoln had expressed at city point but general had not been given authority by general grant newly installed president andrew johnson or cabinet to offer those terms government in washington d c refused to approve sherman s terms and secretary of war edwin m stanton denounced sherman publicly precipitating a long lasting feud between two men confusion over this issue lasted until april 26 1865 when johnston ignoring instructions from president davis agreed to purely military terms and formally surrendered his army and all confederate forces in carolinas georgia and florida in what was largest single capitulation of war see for instance johnston s surrender at bennett place on hillsboro road sherman proceeded with 60 000 of his troops to washington d c where they marched in grand review of armies on may 24 1865 and were then disbanded having become second most important general in union army he thus had come full circle to city where he started his war time service as colonel of a non existent infantry regiment slavery and emancipation thumb 150px portrait by mathew brady or levin c handy between 1865 and 1880 sherman was not an abolitionist before war and like others of his time and background he did not believe in negro equality before war sherman at times even expressed some sympathy with view of southern whites that black race was benefiting from slavery although he opposed breaking up slave families and advocated teaching slaves to read and write during civil war sherman declined to employ black troops in his armies sherman to halleck sept 4 1864 civil war official records vol 38 part 5 pp 792 793 sherman s military campaigns of 1864 and 1865 freed many slaves who greeted him as a second moses or aaron and joined his marches through georgia and carolinas by tens of thousands fate of these refugees became a pressing military and political issue some abolitionists accused sherman of doing little to alleviate precarious living conditions of freed slaves see for instance sherman memoirs vol ii p 247 to address this issue on january 12 1865 sherman met in savannah with secretary of war stanton and with twenty local black leaders after sherman s departure garrison frazier a baptist minister declared in response to an inquiry about feelings of black community four days later sherman issued his special field orders no 15 orders provided for settlement of 40 000 freed slaves and black refugees on land expropriated from white landowners in south carolina georgia and florida sherman appointed brig gen rufus saxton an abolitionist from massachusetts who had previously directed recruitment of black soldiers to implement that plan special field orders no 15 january 16 1865 see also mcpherson pp 737 739 those orders which became basis of claim that union government had promised freed slaves 40 acres and a mule were revoked later that year by president andrew johnson although context is often overlooked and quotation usually chopped off one of sherman s most famous statements about his hard war views arose in part from racial attitudes summarized above in his memoirs sherman noted political pressures in 1864 1865 to encourage escape of slaves in part to avoid possibility that able bodied slaves will be called into military service of rebels sherman memoirs pp 728 29 quoting a december 30 1864 letter from henry w halleck sherman thought concentration on such policies would have delayed successful end of war and ion of all slaves sherman memoirs p 729 he went on to summarize vividly his hard war philosophy and to add in effect that he really did not want help of liberated slaves in subduing south strategies sherman s record as a tactician was mixed and his military legacy rests primarily on his command of logistics and on his brilliance as a strategist influential 20th century british military historian and theorist b h liddell hart ranked sherman as one of most important strategists in annals of war along with scipio africanus belisarius napoleon bonaparte t e lawrence and erwin rommel liddell hart credited sherman with mastery of maneuver warfare also known as indirect approach as demonstrated by his series of turning movements against johnston during atlanta campaign liddell hart also stated that study of sherman s campaigns had contributed significantly to his own theory of strategy and tactics in mechanized warfare which had in turn influenced heinz guderian s doctrine of blitzkrieg and rommel s use of tanks during second world war liddell hart foreword to indiana university press s edition of sherman s memoirs 1957 quoted in wilson p 179 another world war ii era student of liddell hart s writings about sherman was george s patton who spent a long vacation studying sherman s campaigns on ground in georgia and carolinas with aid of liddell hart s book and later carried out his bold plans in super sherman style hirshson p 393 quoting b h liddell hart notes on two discussions with patton 1944 february 20 1948 gsp papers box 6 usma library sherman s greatest contribution to war strategy of total warfare endorsed by general grant and president lincoln has been subject of controversy sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war often saying that he was simply carrying out orders as best he could in order to fulfill his part of grant s master plan for ending war total warfare like grant sherman was convinced that confederacy s strategic economic and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be definitively crushed if fighting were to end therefore he believed that north had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest and employ scorched earth tactics to break backbone of rebellion he called this strategy hard war sherman s advance through georgia and south carolina was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure although looting was officially forbidden historians disagree on how well this regulation was enforced see for instance grimsley pp 190 204 mcpherson pp 712 714 727 729 union soldiers who foraged from southern homes became known as speed and efficiency of destruction by sherman s army was remarkable practice of heating rails and bending them around trees leaving behind what came to be known as sherman s made repairs difficult accusations that civilians were targeted and war crimes were committed on march have made sherman a controversial figure to this day particularly in american south thumb left upright 350px an 1868 engraving by alexander hay ritchie depicting march to sea damage done by sherman was almost entirely limited to destruction of property though exact figures are not available loss of civilian life appears to have been very small see for instance grimsley p 199 consuming supplies wrecking infrastructure and undermining morale were sherman s stated goals and several of his southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it for instance alabama born major henry hitchcock who served in sherman s staff declared that it is a terrible thing to consume and destroy sustenance of thousands of people but if scorched earth strategy served to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting it is mercy in end hitchcock p 125 severity of destructive acts by union troops was significantly greater in south carolina than in georgia or north carolina this appears to have been a consequence of animosity among both union soldiers and officers to state that they regarded as cockpit of secession see for instance grimsley pp 200 202 one of most serious accusations against sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn city of columbia in 1867 gen o o howard commander of sherman s 15th corps reportedly said it is useless to deny that our troops burnt columbia for i saw them in act see edwin j scott random recollections of a long life page 185 wade hampton burning of columbia charleston sc 1888 page 11 however sherman himself stated that i f i had made up my mind to burn columbia i would have burnt it with no more feeling than i would a common prairie dog village but i did not do it december 11 1872 deposition mixed commission xiv 91 quoted in marion b lucas sherman and burning of columbia university of south carolina press 2000 p 154 sherman s official report on burning placed blame on confederate lt gen wade hampton iii who sherman said had ordered burning of cotton in streets in his memoirs sherman said in my official report of this conflagration i distinctly charged it to general wade hampton and confess i did so pointedly to shake faith of his people in him for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be special champion of south carolina sherman memoirs p 767 historian james m mcpherson has concluded that in this general connection it is also noteworthy that sherman and his subordinates particularly john a logan took steps to protect raleigh north carolina from acts of revenge after assassination of president lincoln sherman memoirs pp 838 39 woodworth nothing but victory p 636 modern assessment thumb 350px map of sherman s advance from atlanta to goldsboro after fall of atlanta in 1864 sherman ordered city s evacuation when city council appealed to him to rescind that order on grounds that it would cause great hardship to women children elderly and others who bore no responsibility for conduct of war sherman sent a written response in which he sought to articulate his conviction that a lasting peace would be possible only if union were restored and that he was therefore prepared to do all he could do to quash rebellion literary critic edmund wilson found in sherman s memoirs a fascinating and disturbing account of an appetite for warfare that grows as it feeds on south wilson p 184 former u s defense secretary robert mcnamara refers equivocally to statement that war is cruelty and you cannot refine it in both book wilson s and blight p 130 and in his interview for film fog of war but when comparing sherman s scorched earth campaigns to actions of british army during second boer war 1899 1902 another war in which civilians were targeted because of their central role in sustaining an armed resistance south african historian hermann giliomee declares that it looks as if sherman struck a better balance than british commanders between severity and restraint in taking actions proportional to legitimate needs giliomee p 253 admiration of scholars such as victor davis hanson b h liddell hart lloyd lewis and john f marszalek for general sherman owes much to what they see as an approach to exigencies of modern armed conflict that was both effective and principled in may 1865 after major confederate armies had surrendered sherman wrote in a personal letter departmental commander and reconstruction in june 1865 two months after robert e lee s surrender at appomattox general sherman received his first postwar command originally called military division of mississippi later military division of missouri which came to comprise territory between mississippi river and rocky mountains sherman s efforts in that position were focused on protecting main wagon roads such as oregon bozeman and santa fe trails athearn 33 44 tasked with guarding a vast territory with a limited force sherman was wary of multitude of requests by territories and settlements for protection athearn one of sherman s main concerns in postwar commands was to protect construction and operation of railroads from attack by hostile indians sherman s views on indian matters were often strongly expressed he regarded railroads as most important element now in progress to facilitate military interests of our frontier hence in 1867 he wrote to grant that we are not going to let a few thieving ragged indians check and stop progress of railroads sherman to rawlins october 23 1865 quoted in athearn 24 sherman to grant may 28 1867 quoted in fellman citizen sherman 264 453 n 5 see also papers of ulysses s grant vol 17 p 262 after 1866 massacre sherman wrote grant that we must act with vindictive earnestness against sioux even to their extermination men women and children sherman to grant december 28 1866 reproduced in wild life on plains and horrors of indian warfare 1891 120 despite this language there was little large scale military action taken against indians during first three years of sherman s tenure as sherman was willing to let process of negotiations play out in order to buy time to procure more troops and allow completion of union pacific and kansas pacific railroads during his time as departmental commander sherman was a member of indian peace commission though commission was responsible for negotiation of medicine lodge treaty and sioux treaty of 1868 sherman was not particularly privy in either due to being called away to washington during negotiations of both athearn 196 197 in one such instance he was called to testify in impeachment trial of andrew johnson however sherman was successful in negotiating other treaties such as removal of navajos from bosque redondo to traditional lands in western new mexico athearn 203 when medicine lodge treaty was broken in 1868 sherman authorized his subordinate in missouri philip sheridan to conduct winter campaign of 1868 69 of which battle of washita river was a part where sheridan used hard war tactics similar to those he and sherman had employed in civil war sherman was also involved with trial of and big tree he ordered that two chiefs should be tried as common criminals for their role in warren wagon train raid a raid that came dangerously close to killing sherman himself general of army thumb right 150px shoulder strap insignia introduced by sherman in 1872 for his use as general of army thumb left 1888 photograph

of general of army for grant and then promoted sherman to lieutenant general when grant became president in 1869 sherman was appointed commanding general of united states army and promoted to general of army after death of john a rawlins sherman also served for one month as interim secretary of war his tenure as commanding general was marred by political difficulties many of which stemmed from disagreements with secretaries of war rawlins and william w belknap whom sherman felt had usurped too much of commanding general s powers reducing him to a sinecure office sherman also clashed with eastern humanitarians who were critical of army s killing of indians and had apparently found an ally in president grant to escape these difficulties from 1874 to 1876 he moved his headquarters to st louis missouri returning to washington only upon appointment of alphonso taft as secretary of war and promise of more authority athearn 268 269 much of sherman s time as commanding general was devoted to making western and plains states safe for settlement through continuation of indian wars which included three significant campaigns modoc war great sioux war of 1876 and nez perce war displacement of indians was facilitated by growth of railroad and eradication of buffalo sherman believed that intentional eradication of buffalo should be encouraged as a means of weakening indian resistance to assimilation he voiced this view in remarks to a joint session of texas legislature in 1875 however he never engaged in any program to actually eradicate buffalo during this time sherman reorganized frontier forts to reflect shifting frontier athearn 291 after george armstrong custer s defeat at battle of little bighorn sherman wrote that hostile savages like sitting bull and his band of outlaw sioux must feel superior power of government seemingly sherman to tappan july 21 1876 quoted in marszalek sherman a soldier s passion 398 he further wrote that during an assault soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female or even discriminate as to age seemingly sherman to herbert a preston april 17 1873 quoted in marszalek sherman a soldier s passion 379 despite his harsh treatment of warring tribes sherman spoke out against unfair way speculators and government agents treated natives within reservations see for instance lewis pp 597 600 in 1875 sherman published his memoirs in two volumes according to critic edmund wilson sherman during election of 1876 southern democrats who supported wade hampton for governor used mob violence to attack and intimidate african american voters in charleston south carolina republican governor daniel chamberlain appealed to president ulysses s grant for military assistance in october 1876 grant after issuing a proclamation

command school now command and general staff college at fort leavenworth in 1881 sherman stepped down as commanding general on november 1 1883 and retired from army on february 8 1884 later years he lived most of rest of his life in new york city he was devoted to theater and to amateur painting and was much in demand as a colorful speaker at dinners and banquets in which he indulged a fondness for quoting shakespeare see for instance woodward during this period he stayed in contact with war veterans and through them accepted honorary membership into phi kappa psi fraternity and irving literary society sherman was proposed as a republican candidate for presidential election of 1884 but declined as emphatically as possible saying i will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected marszalek in encyclopedia of american civil war p 1769 such a categorical rejection of a candidacy is now referred to as a statement in 1888 he joined newly formed boone and crockett club a

sparked complaints from many quarters marszalek p 463 in 1875 henry v boynton published a critical book length review of sherman s memoirs based upon compilations from records of war office this led to publication of a defense of sherman by c w moulton grant serving as president when sherman s memoirs first appeared later remarked that others had told him that sherman treated grant unfairly but when i finished book i found i approved every word that it was a true book an honorable book creditable to sherman just to his companions to myself particularly so just such a book as i expected

that i disclaim character of historian but assume to be a witness on stand before great tribunal of history and any witness who may disagree with me should publish his own version of facts in truthful narration of which he is interested however sherman did add appendices in which he published views of some others 1886 preface in one amusing change to his text sherman dropped assertion that john
