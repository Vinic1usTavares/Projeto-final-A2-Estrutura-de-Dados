album truth lies red tape in 2008 band split soon afterwards and rumble decided to pursue a solo musical career and taught himself to play guitar he began writing material for his album but he found that he could no longer write hip hop hip hop was just wearing really thin for me because it s really quite macho i m wicked because of this i m best because of that it s a lot of talking yourself up rumble said he began to write songs inspired by his own experiences and emotions which allowed him to explore other musical genres he explained that when he wrote songs for album he began by creating a chord progression using his guitar which evolved into tune s basic melody after which he would determine its theme other songs were conceived by rumble humming a tune during everyday activities then recording it onto his iphone so as to not forget it tune would later be refined to a full fledged song according to rumble writing music was hardest component of album s making always be here was first song rumble completed which he sent to record label warner music nz thereby commencing his solo career rumble organised a band of his friends rather than standard practice of contracting out to professional studio musicians scott nicholls played drums ben white played guitar alistair wood played keyboard instruments and rumble s brother josh played bass white and wood had previously played music with fast crew band spent three months recording album s music drums were recorded at york street studio auckland while remainder of recording took place at beaver studios auckland rumble co produced experiment with jonathan campbell who also engineered record rumble said he put a lot of time and effort into album i really wanted to write a world class record i didn t want to come out with some half pie thing composition experiment is a pop rock album featuring guitar and synth riffs and incorporates elements of dance pop pop rap and power pop some parts of album contain auto tuned vocals and record has been described as having an international feel rumble said that this was because he and campbell made sure that album sounded big so that it could compete on world stage thematically experiment is about love heartbreak getting what he wants and knowing he is in charge of his own destiny although let you down is quite dark and weighty many of song s discuss rumble s own life experiences some are reflective while others just try to get other people enthused about what they re doing with their lives always be here discusses maintaining a romantic relationship while constantly travelling and what are you waiting for is about being motivated and assessing your own life which is exactly what happened to rumble release and promotion thumb upright rumble performing a
