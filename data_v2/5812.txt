character has a certain number of health points hp and ether points ep if all hp is depleted a character is defeated turn order is governed by a character s agility statistic each character can take a variety of actions ranging from attacking performing special attacks called arts and using ether abilities that each consume ep using items taking defensive positions that reduce damage and escaping battle both player party and enemies have break gauges which fill up when either side successfully lands an attack when gauge fills that character is stunned and cannot act for two turns in addition becoming more vulnerable to a high damage critical attack break gauge can be reduced by using ether abilities which can also be used along with items to recover hp each player character has a boost gauge that builds up during battle which can be used to either perform two actions in a single turn or deliver character specific special attacks if an enemy is killed with a boost attack an action

others defensive or supportive abilities combat in e s mecha is governed by similar mechanics to normal battle some dungeons in game are only navigable with mechs while others enable player to switch between navigating on foot or in mechs three mechs can be active at any one time with a fourth in reserve to replace one which is knocked out in battle mechs can perform standard and special attacks with type of attacks available determined by that mech s equipped weapon each mech has a finite energy level which their equipped weapon draws upon to perform an action each time a mech strikes an enemy with an attack their anima gauge will fill up when full mech can enter anima mode a temporary state where attack power is raised and energy costs for actions are lowered e s units are customized

development stages of episode ii while xenosaga was initially planned as a six part series changes at developer monolith soft resulted in series creator tetsuya takahashi giving guidance of series to younger developers within company during this period team decided to turn xenosaga series into a trilogy resulting in changes to planned scenario and some elements being turned into side projects such as xenosaga pied piper director was koh arai who had previously directed episode ii takahashi drafted and supervised scenario which was written by episode ii writer norihiko yonesaka one of main goals when developing episode iii was not only to bring a satisfactory end to xenosaga storyline up to that point but to address criticism of short length of episode iis story while also addressing general problems noticed with both episode i and episode ii namco bandai later stated in an interview that game s final form was based on both fan feedback and wishes of internal staff with final game being something very close to what they believed to be original ideal according to original xenosaga writer soraya saga changes to original narrative plan for episode ii resulted in several narrative shifts within episode iii deviating from takahashi and saga s original draft scenario for episode iii includes narrative elements takahashi originally created for episode ii which had been cut from episode ii due to time constraints as with rest of trilogy game made heavy use of biblical mythology game s subtitle was taken from native title of thus spoke zarathustra a novel by german philosopher friedrich nietzsche use of nietzsche s works and concepts was a recurring element in series original character artist for xenosaga kunihiko tanaka was replaced by kouichi mugitani who also acted as production designer as he had for previous xenosaga games character designs were adjusted to balance between designs of episode i and episode ii expressing both realism and an exaggerated cute artstyle while most of designs were adaptions of tanaka s earlier work mugitani also designed a new version of kos mos and multiple new mechs mugitani s mech and armor designs drew from both gundam franchise and 1997 film adaptation of starship troopers xenosaga episode iii was officially announced in 2005 alongside xenosaga i ii a nintendo ds remake of first two xenosaga episodes and baten kaitos origins with its announcement it was widely confirmed that it would be last installment in xenosaga series while episode iii was intended as conclusion of shion s story arc and potentially series team were willing to continue series if game was a commercial success game was announced for a western release in april 2006 for its western release all scenes where blood was visible were censored blood was removed but all other elements remained unchanged resulting in visual and audio inconsistencies game released in japan on july 6 2006 by namco in north america game released on august 29 of that year by namco bandai games game was localized for west by namco bandai and 8 4 xenosaga episode iii was one of 8 4 s earliest projects english dubbing was handled by cup of tea productions who had previously worked on episode ii several original voice actors from episode i including kos mos s original english actress bridget hoffman were brought back after recasting for episode ii unlike episode ii episode iii was not released in europe music music for episode iii was composed by yuki kajiura having previous contributed to score of episode ii by composing tracks kajiura was brought back to compose entire score despite increased work load of handling an entire game s soundtrack kajiura found difficulty similar to work she did on episode ii she drew inspiration from game s artwork and impression of setting when creating score takahashi in addition to his other roles in production acted as coordinator for score a soundtrack album titled xenosaga episode iii also sprach zarathustra original sound best tracks featuring selections from game s score was published by victor entertainment on july 12 2006 album s brevity was due to fact that full soundtrack would have taken up six cds and so kajiura was asked by sound producer keiichi nozaki to create samples for a two disc release nozaki keiichi 12 july 2006 xenosaga episode iii also sprach zarathustra original sound best tracks liner notes victor entertainment vicl 6 retrieved on 14 august 2017 reception during its debut week xenosaga episode iii reached number 2 in charts behind new super mario bros with sales approaching 124 000 units while its sales were stronger than xenosaga i ii it was a lower debut than previous entries in trilogy it sold over 181 000 copies in japan by end of 2006 during q3 of 2006 game sold a total of 343 000 across japan mainland asia and north america simon parkin in an import review for eurogamer felt that sheer number of philosophical and religious elements in story both stifled any relatable narrative and robbed characters of any personality despite this he felt ending successfully tied up remaining narrative threads from previous games famitsu enjoyed narrative s presentation but noted lack of a focused narrative due to number of story threads needing addressing gamepro said story came to an intriguing conclusion but felt that cutscenes were too long gamespot s bethany massimilla enjoyed story and character conclusions but felt that understanding story and terminology required too much referral to in game encyclopedia eduardo vasconcellos of gamespy found story long winded while ign s jeremy dunham found narrative to be one of best aspects of game rpgamer s josh martz called story a triumphant conclusion to shion s arc of series both parkin and massimilla criticized censoring of blood and its negative effects on story s more dramatic moments parkin enjoyed battle system s mechanics but found rest of gameplay extremely straightforward due to a lack of complex environments or side activities gamepro gave high praise to combat system and lack of random encounters in addition to calling mini game practically its own entire game and fun too massimilla praised balanced mechanics of battle system and customization options vasconcellos also enjoyed customization options available to player in addition to battle system dunham enjoyed combat system and its blending of elements from past games but was disappointed that no new elements had been added martz also enjoyed varied systems and strategy within combat despite noting a lack of overall challenge parkin praised middle ground balance in character designs between deformed look of episode i and realism of episode ii famitsu praised shortened loading times and gamepro praised graphics and art design while criticizing voice acting quality massimilla positively noted game s art design cutscene animation and music and sound design both dunham and martz praised both music and voice acting legacy xenosaga episode iii was last property to be released in xenosaga series following release of episode iii and mixed reception received by series as a whole entire development team were in a state of low morale partly to boost team morale and create a game players would enjoy team developed a new rpg for wii originally titled monado beginning of world its title was eventually changed to xenoblade chronicles during its development team moved away from narrative and design techniques used for xenosaga games which were considered old fashioned success of xenoblade chronicles led to development of further xeno titles in a later interview takahashi stated that he would be willing to develop further titles in xenosaga series if funding was
