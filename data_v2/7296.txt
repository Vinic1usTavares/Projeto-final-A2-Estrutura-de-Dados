cantharellus lateritius commonly known as smooth chanterelle is a species of edible fungus in family of mushrooms a ectomycorrhizal species it is found in asia africa and north america species has a complex taxonomic history and has undergone several name changes since its first description by american mycologist lewis david de schweinitz in 1822 fruit bodies of fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange and usually highly conspicuous against soil in which they are found at maturity mushroom resembles a filled funnel with spore bearing surface along sloping outer sides texture of fertile undersurface hymenium of caps is a distinguishing characteristic of species unlike well known golden chanterelle hymenium of c lateritius is much smoother chemical analysis has revealed presence of several carotenoid compounds in fruit bodies taxonomy thumb 180px left berkeley is credited with original authorship of species species was first described in scientific literature as thelephora cantharella by american lewis david de schweinitz in 1822 based on specimens collected in ohio elias magnus fries later transferred it to craterellus in his 1838 epicrisis systematis mycologici in 1856 miles joseph berkeley and moses ashley curtis mentioned fungus in their analysis of schweinitz s specimens but changed epithet calling it craterellus lateritius motivation for name change is unclear ronald h petersen in a 1979 publication suggests that berkeley was apparently reluctant to surrender his own name for organism petersen suggests that berkeley may have foreseen necessity to avoid giving species a tautonym a situation where both generic name and specific epithet are identical however as petersen indicates a future publication renders this explanation dubious in 1873 berkeley again referred to species using his chosen name craterellus lateritius and indicated a type location alabama different than one mentioned by schweinitz petersen considers berkeley s name to be a nomen novum new name not a new species as berkeley clearly indicated that he thought craterellus lateritius was synonymous with schweinitz s thelephora cantharella normally in these circumstances schweinitz s specimen would be considered type but petersen was unable to locate schweinitz s original specimen and thus according to rules of botanical nomenclature berkeley s epithet has precedence as it is earliest published name that has an associated type specimen another synonym is trombetta used by otto kuntze in his 1891 revisio generum plantarum american mycologist rolf singer transferred it to genus cantharellus in 1951 mushroom is commonly known as smooth chanterelle specific name lateritius means and refers to smooth hymenium description thumb left hymenium is initially smooth before developing shallow vein like ridges in maturity caps of c lateritius fruiting bodies typically range between in diameter with a flattened to somewhat funnel shaped top surface and a wavy margin cap surface is dry slightly tomentose covered with a layer of fine hairs and a deep and bright orange yellow color with older specimens fading to more yellow in age distinctive margins of cap are a paler yellow and typically curve downward in young specimens fruiting bodies can reach a height of hymenophore spore bearing surface is initially smooth and without wrinkles but gradually develops channels or ridges and what appear to be very shallow gills that are vein like and less than 1 mm wide color is pale yellow and is continuous with surface of stem stem is rather plump and stout long and thick more or less cylindrical tapering downwards towards base internally stems are either stuffed filled with cotton like mycelia or solid rarely fruiting bodies may be clumped together with stems conjoined at base in these cases there are usually no more than three fused stems flesh is solid to partly hollow sometimes due to insect larvae with a pale yellow color it is thick spores are smooth with a roughly ellipsoid shape and have typical dimensions of 7 7 5 by 4 5 5 um bigelow 1978 reports more a permissive range of spore sizes 7 5 9 5 occasionally up to 12 5 by 4 5 6 6 5 um in deposit such as in a spore print spores are light yellow orange while under microscope they are a very pale yellowish spore bearing cells basidia are 75 80 by 7 9 um 4 5 6 spored bigelow 1978 reports instead 35 72 by 5 7 5 um and four spores slightly club shaped and with a distinctly thickened wall at base clamp connections short branches connecting one cell to previous cell to allow passage of products of nuclear division are present in hyphae of all parts of fruiting body similar species cantharellus lateritius is pinker than golden chanterelle c cibarius and has thicker flesh in addition to smoother hymenial surface c is also similar in appearance and is distinguished by a thinner flesh and a hollow stem poisonous jack o lantern mushroom omphalotus is roughly similar in stature and color but can be differentiated from c lateritius by its true gills with sharply defined edges and growth on decaying wood although wood may be buried in soil usually in large overlapping clusters one author considers cantharellus lateritius to likely represent a species complex including all chanterelles with a completely smooth hymenophore sweet smell and clamped hyphae edibility like all species in genus cantharellus c lateritius is edible and considered choice by some odor resembles apricots and taste is mild or moderately to faintly acrid in opinion of mcfarland and mueller authors of a field guide to edible fungi of illinois compared to well known c cibarius c lateritius is in general somewhat disappointing when compared with their delicious relatives distribution and habitat thumb right not yet fully mature specimens collected from run state park ohio cantharellus lateritius is distributed in north america africa malaysia and himalayas specifically almora hills in uttar pradesh in united states its range extends northward to michigan and new england typically found growing solitary in groups or in clusters under hardwood trees fungus produces fruit bodies in summer and autumn in new england area of united states mycologist howard bigelow has noted it to grow on road shoulders in grass near oaks it also has a predilection for growing on sloping creek banks in malaysia it is found growing on soil in forests mostly under species of shorea rainforest trees in family c lateritius has been reported from western ghats kerala india forming ectomycorrhizal association with endemic tree species like indica parviflora diospyros malabarica malabarica in semi evergreen to evergreen forests bioactive compounds in a 1998 study carotenoid composition of this species was compared to several other cantharellus species including c c cibarius var and c carotenoid content between species was virtually identical comprising g carotene a carotene and b carotene only significant difference was that c lateritius contained a significant quantity of an unidentified carotene that was thought to be a breakdown product of b carotene references external links
