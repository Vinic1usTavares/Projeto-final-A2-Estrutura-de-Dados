khagan of western gokturks and was a member of ashina clan christian 260 tong yabghu s reign is generally regarded as zenith of western gokturk khaganate golden nomads 30 his clan was syncretized buddhist and native folk religion reign left thumb gokturk khaganates at their height c 600 ad tong yabghu maintained close relations with tang dynasty of china and may have married into imperial family golden introduction 135 according to chinese historical sources marriage was never carried out because of interference by eastern gokturk illig qaghan whose territory sat between his territory and tang territory and who felt threatened by proposed marriage zizhi tongjian vol 192 chinese buddhist pilgrim xuanzang visited western gokturk capital in modern kyrgyzstan and left a description of khagan scholars believe khagan described by xuanzang was tong yabghu christian 260 gao and la vaissiere argue that khagan xuanzang met was his son si yabghu rather than tong yabghu gao 113 la vaissiere 2010 if 630 is correct for xuanzang son business must be related to 628 death date xuanzang described khagan as follows khan wore a green satin robe his hair which was ten feet long was free a band of white silk wound round his forehead and hung down behind ministers of presence ta kuan probably tarkhan is intended see christian 260 numbering two hundred in number all wearing embroidered

adapted from watters i 74 77 according to old book of tang tong yabghu s reign was once considered as golden age of western gokturk khaganate tong yehu kaghan is a man of bravery and astuteness he is good at art of war thus he controlled tiele tribes to north confronted persia to west connected with nowadays kashmir to south all countries are subjected to him he controlled ten thousands of men with arrow and bow establishing his power over western region he occupied land of wusun and moved his tent to north of tashkent all of princes of western region assumed turk office of tong yehu kaghan also sent a to monitor them for imposition power of western turks had never reached such a state before ying lin western turks and byzantine gold coins found in china transoxiana campaigns against persia thumb sassanian fortress in derbent built to protect against nomads from north derbent played a vital role in tong yabghu s campaigns against persia alt yabghu s empire fought with sassanids of iran in early 620 s khagan s nephew bori shad led a series of raids across caucasus mountains into persian territory many scholars have identified tong yabghu as ziebel mentioned in byzantine sources as having as khagan of khazars campaigned with emperor heraclius in caucasus against sassanid persian empire in 627 628 campaign is described in detail in chronicle of theophanes confessor identification of ziebel as khagan of khazars rather than of western turks is likely because khazars as gokturk vassals made up largest contingent of gokturk army with whom greeks had contact klyashtorny 96 97 golden introduction 135 christian 260 it has long been maintained by some scholars including chavannes uchida gao and xue that tong yabghu cannot be positively identified with ziebel or any khazar ruler and may actually have died as early as 626 these scholars point to discrepancies in dates between byzantine and chinese sources and argue that definitively conflating ziebel with tong yabghu is an exaggeration of extant evidence e g xue 286 289 latest research on this topic proves that they were right if tong indeed died in 628 ziebel is to be identified with sipi khagan tong yabghu s uncle who murdered him and rose briefly to throne la vaissiere 2013 sipi was by then pronounced zibil and he was a small kaghan in charge of western part of tong yabghu s empire exactly as ziebel was according to byzantine sources ziebel is described as brother of tong in byzantine sources and as his uncle in chinese sources a discrepancy which long precluded identification however uncle and elder brother is same word in ancient turkish aci and chinese sources could not rendered this double meaning with their very precise system of kinship names la vaissiere 20 metre high gates of alexander stretched between caspian seashore and caucasus for forty kilometers they are still in existence governance tong yabghu appointed governors or to manage various tribes and people under his overlordship in all likelihood tong yabghu s nephew bori shad and son of zibil ziebel was commander of khazars westernmost of tribes owing allegiance to western gokturks this branch of family may have provided khazars with their first khagans in mid seventh century christian 283 170 180 death in ca 630 he was murdered by sibir his uncle and a partisan of dulu faction following death of tong
