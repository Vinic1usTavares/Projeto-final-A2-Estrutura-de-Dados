responses ahsan haque of ign praised second half of episode but felt that kathy ireland plot was too long in his review he commented it s definitely meant for people who are open minded to this kind of humor and can make sure they treat subject matter purely as comedy and not any manner of social commentary or prejudice take away slow start and this episode managed to really deliver some memorable shocking comedy tv guide critic alex rocha praised show s league of justice opening sequence and kathy ireland plot but reacted negatively to second half of episode stating that he dozed off during last fifteen minutes tv guide also listed episode on tv hot list of october 4 toronto star noted episode was worth watching emily vanderwerff of a v club gave episode a negative review giving it a c grade and concluding that overall episode was just an excuse to drag out a bunch of tired jewish jokes and also have peter briefly descend into anti semitism though she mostly disliked episode vanderwerff praised stewie s part in episode as well as shakespeare cutaway gag and a cutaway that featured peter getting into fight with a cat jewish journal critic adam willis commented my hope is that series will roast familiar jewish themes introduced in family goy rather than continuing on jews as targets route show has regularly featured some inspiring jewish gags both in good taste and bad and while hebrew community in jokes would be better received by jewish viewers likely reality is holocaust humor will continue to dominate media watchdog group parents television council a frequent critic of show named family goy its worst tv show of week for week ending october 9 2009 criticizing what it saw as an anti semitic plot references external links category 2009 american television
