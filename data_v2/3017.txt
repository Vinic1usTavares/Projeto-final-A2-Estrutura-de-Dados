that after oliver couple had a second child a daughter named leslie development shortly following his departure from abc drama series brothers sisters rob lowe accepted role of chris traeger on parks and recreation he made his first appearance on show in master plan penultimate episode of second season character debuted same episode that adam scott began his role as ben wyatt originally chris traeger was only meant to be a guest role with lowe portraying him in final two episodes of second season and first six episodes of third season before departing series however lowe instead became a regular cast member starting with third season and signed a multi year contract to remain on show idea of chris as a state auditor visiting pawnee and subsequent government shutdown was inspired by news reports at time of a number of states that were considering a shut down of schools parks and other services due to global financial crisis parks and recreation co creator michael schur said chris habit of pointing directly into faces of people he meets and repeating their names was one of first elements of his character that writing staff conceived chris desire to live 150 years was inspired by schur s wife j j philbin who had read an article which stated that scientists believe first human who will live 150 years has already been born and felt it applied to chris traeger character lowe s first day of filming on series was his birthday march 17 2010 which was day his kiss scene with rashida jones in master plan was shot lowe said he loved his character s unrelenting enthusiasm and fact that he is not a romantic lead but rather a big fat nerd parks and recreation star amy poehler said of chris traeger it s a really fun character to play against because what you ll see start to happen is chris doesn t want to deliver any bad news but he s actually like bad news bear like much of rest of cast lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in script writers hoped to use ann perkins breakup with chris and drastic changes in her behavior afterward as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill role of straight man as she had in past schur said ann is a very intelligent and attractive woman and it s hard to knock someone like that off balance and way to knock that person off balance is to get rob lowe in a relationship with you once lowe joined permanent cast chris role changed into more of an authority figure concerned with integrity and efficiency although he continued to maintain his positive attitude and personality schur said of this second role he doesn t like frayed ends or controversies he wants body politic to be as clean running and organic as his own human body part of design of character was to give other characters a true boss an actual authority figure whose rules and regulations meant they had to toe certain lines even while his endlessly cheery disposition made it hard to argue with him as a result chris traeger changed in minor ways once he became a regular character in his earlier episodes chris avoided associating himself with anything negative and constantly made ben report bad news to people as city manager in later episodes as a regular however chris started imposing rules or changes around office that were not popular and seemed less resistant about enforcing them for example chris began to enforce his strict no dating policy around city hall additionally in episode jerry s painting chris forcefully orders leslie to destroy a painting when it proves to be controversial and becomes angry with her when she tries to resist those orders reception chris traeger character has received critical acclaim rick porter of zap2it described him as one of great comedic creations of past couple years and hitfix writer alan sepinwall called it one of funniest performances of rob lowe s career david hinckley of new york daily news said both lowe and adam scott were excellent additions to cast and eric sundermann of hollywood com said chris was exactly what show needed to push itself to another level of silliness some reviewers believed chris over top personality would be funny in short run but that character would not prove three dimensional enough to have long term sustainability new york magazine writer steve kandell initially described him as funny but sorta one note and eric hochberger of tv fanatic first found chris funny but likewise said he was not sure how great he ll be long term matt fowler of ign expressed same sentiments after earlier episodes but by third season said chris proved to be a great addition to show relationship between chris and ann was described by sundermann as one of most interesting parts of show and reason specifically is chris likewise porter said lowe and rashida jones had developed a fantastic dynamic joel keller of tv squad said he found chris a little two dimensional and believed relationship was poorly handled because it made ann too passive lowe received particularly strong praise for his role in flu season in which chris became extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with flu tim goodman of hollywood reporter said lowe s character seemed well integrated into cast by episode flu season and added if you ve never believed lowe can make you laugh out loud pay attention to that episode steve kandell said lowe stole show from usual parks powerhouses of nick offerman and chris pratt and called one scene when lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to himself in mirror stop pooping single greatest self comic moment of his long handsome career parks and recreation has traditionally experienced poor nielsen ratings and nbc officials hoped addition of lowe to cast would help increase viewership his premiere on second season episode master plan was heavily publicized in commercials with hopes of drawing new viewers however ratings continued to be low after he joined show and his appearances only resulted in what hitfix writer daniel fienberg called a statistically irrelevant bump in ratings following actor charlie sheen s departure from cbs comedy series two and a half men in march 2011 rumors began to circulate that rob lowe might leave parks and recreation to take sheen s place on that show people magazine reported that two and a half men creator chuck lorre was seriously discussing possibility of signing lowe and sheen himself said he would be a fabulous successor those rumors proved unfounded however and were flatly denied by michael schur who called it complete gibberish although widely considered a supporting role lowe s performance as chris traeger was submitted for a 2011 primetime emmy award in
