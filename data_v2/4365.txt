from sidelines ten minutes into fourth quarter hamilton s ray bawel intercepted a pass and it appeared he would return ball for a touchdown when humphrey stuck his leg out and tripped bawel as he ran up sideline unsure how to handle situation as there was no rule designed to cover it referee paul invented one on spot he placed ball half distance to winnipeg goal line from point bawel was tripped incident did not affect final score as hamilton won 32 7 league also created a new rule during 1961 grey cup as it was first in history to end regulation time in a tie cfl commissioner sid halter

kicked game winning field goal with just three seconds remaining edmonton s championship run came to an end in 1983 when they lost in west semi final game argonauts defeated bc lions to win championship that year ending team s 31 year grey cup title drought despite toronto s win cfl felt that overall quality of play in east division had deteriorated compared to that of west in 1986 it altered playoff format to allow first non playoff team in one division to take last playoff spot but stay in their division if they had a better record consequences of new rules were felt immediately as league gave a playoff spot to stampeders having a better record than alouettes and decided east division final would be a 2 game total point final between toronto argonauts and hamilton tiger cats who finished first and second respectively crossover if necessary would begin in 1987 in financial difficulty loss of playoff spot was disastrous for montreal which ceased operations one year later

and became first american team eligible to win grey cup league added three additional american teams in 1994 and two in 1995 with one team folding but initiative failed in most markets and by 1996 cfl
