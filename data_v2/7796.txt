thumb title page of first publication of sheffield fc rules 1859 sheffield rules was a code of football devised and played in english city of sheffield between 1858 and 1877 rules were initially created and revised by sheffield football club with responsibility for laws passing to sheffield football association upon that body s creation in 1867 rules spread beyond city boundaries to other clubs and associations in north and midlands of england making them one of most popular forms of football during 1860s and 70s in 1863 newly formed london based football association fa published its own laws of football between 1863 and 1877 fa and sheffield laws co existed with each code at times influencing other several games were played between sheffield and london using both sets of rules after several disputes two codes were unified in 1877 when sheffield football association voted to adopt fa laws following adoption of a compromise throw in law by fa sheffield rules had a major influence on how modern game of football developed among other things they introduced into laws of game concepts of corners and free kicks for fouls games played under rules are also credited with development of heading following abolition of fair catch and origins of goalkeeper and forward positions first competitive football tournament was both played using sheffield rules background oldest recorded football match in sheffield occurred in 1794 when a game of mob football was played between sheffield and norton at time a derbyshire village that took place at bents green game lasted three days which was not unusual for matches at time it was noted that although there were some injuries no one was killed during match road fencing club had been playing football since 1852 city was home to a number of sports clubs and popularity of cricket had led to chairman of sheffield cricket club to suggest construction of bramall lane by 1850s there were several versions of football played in public schools and clubs throughout england their rules were generally inaccessible outside of schools there football tended to be and fairly lawless games known as mob football although there are matches between small equal numbered teams it remained a minority sport until 1860s during winter months in 1855 players of sheffield cricket club organised informal football matches in order to retain fitness until start of new season two of players were nathaniel creswick 1826 1917 and william prest 1832 1885 both of whom were born in yorkshire creswick came from a sheffield family of silver plate manufacturers that dated back several centuries after being educated at city s collegiate school he became a solicitor prest s family had moved from york while he was a child his father bought a wine merchants that william subsequently took over both men were keen sportsmen creswick enjoyed a number of sports including cricket and running prest played cricket for all england xi and also captained yorkshire on several occasions inaugural meeting of sheffield f c took place on 24 october 1857 at parkfield house in suburb of highfield original headquarters would become a greenhouse on east bank road adjacent field was used as their first playing ground history of laws laws of sheffield football club 1858 thumb right 200px first edition of rules as published in 1859 first laws of sheffield football club were approved at a general meeting at adelphi hotel on 28 october 1858 club s minutes book is still available and records changes made during laws development notable features of rules included curry and dunning 2015 p 49 handling was forbidden with exception of pushing or hitting ball with hands and a fair catch defined as a catch from another player without ball touching ground hacking kicking tripping and holding opponents were all forbidden but pushing and charging were allowed a free kick was awarded for a fair catch but a goal could not be scored from such a free kick a goal could be scored only by kicking 1858 laws do not specify dimensions or type of goal in further detail throw in was awarded to first team to touch ball after it went out of play ball had to be thrown in at right angles to touchline when ball went out of play over goal line there was a kick out from 25 yards there was no offside law like many rules of that era sheffield rules did not dictate numbers on each side origin of 1858 sheffield rules has been subject of some academic debate harvey denies any public school influence arguing that rules were derived from ideas generally current in wider society harvey 2005 pp 95 100 in response collins has demonstrated that there is a substantial similarity in wording between many of sheffield rules and older rugby school rules sheffield rules 1858 first draft rugby school rules 1851 1 kick off from middle must be a place kick i kick off from middle must be a place kick 2 kick out must not be from more than twenty five yards out of goal ii kick out must not be from more than 25 yards out of goal nor from more than 10 yards if a place kick 3 fair catch is a catch direct from foot of opposite side and entitles a free kick iii fair catch is a catch direct from foot 4 charging is fair in case of a place kick with exception of a kick off as soon as player offers to kick but he may always draw back unless he has actually touched ball with his foot iv charging is fair in case of a place kick as soon as a ball has touched ground in case of a kick from a catch as soon as player offers to kick but he may always draw back unless he has actually touched ball with his foot 6 knocking or pushing on ball is altogether disallowed side breaking this rule forfeits a free kick to opposite side vii knocking on as distinguished from throwing on is altogether disallowed under any circumstances whatsoever in case of this rule being broken a catch from such a knock on shall be equivalent to a fair catch 7 no player may be held or pulled over xii no player out of a maul may be held or pulled over unless he is himself holding ball 8 it is not lawful to take ball off ground except in touch for any purpose whatever viii it is not lawful to take ball off ground except in touch either for a kick or throw on 10 no goal may be kicked from touch nor by a free kick from a catch xx no goal may be kicked from touch 11 a ball in touch is dead consequently side that touches it down must bring it to edge of touch throw it straight out at least six yards from touch xxi touch a ball in touch is dead consequently first player on his side must in any case touch it down bring it to edge of touch and throw it straight out local influences may also have played a role many of original members of sheffield fc were from local collegiate school which favoured kicking style of game rather than handling ball kicking game was also prevalent in local villages of penistone and club rules also dictated that any disputes on field would be resolved by any committee members present an early reference to position now occupied by referee at club s next annual general meeting in october 1859 a committee was appointed to revise laws and prepare them for publication laws were subsequently published later that year with only minor revisions amendment of 1860 on 31 january 1860 a meeting was held where it was resolved that law 8 should be expunged and replaced with holding ball except in case of a free kick or knocking or pushing it on is altogether disallowed sheffield city archives fcr 2 see also this left fair catch as only form of handling permitted by laws amendments of 1861 at annual general meeting of sheffield fc held in october 1861 following amendments were made to rules kick out roughly equivalent to a goal kick had to be taken from within 10 yards of goal rather than previous 25 yards it was clarified that kick out should take place whenever ball went behind line of goal posts without going into goal two flags were placed in line with goal posts each flag being four yards to side of one of posts throw in had to touch ground before coming into contact with a player it was clarified that throw in had to be taken from place where ball went into touch proposals to ban pushing and to introduce rouges were rejected laws of sheffield fc 1862 on 31 january 1862 sheffield fc held a meeting at which a new set of rules was considered rules were confirmed one week later and published later same year as sheffield fc s second formal set of laws major changes made in 1862 rules were a change of ends at half time was introduced but only if no goal was scored in first half dimensions of goal were specified with two goal sticks 12 feet 4 yards apart and a crossbar 9 feet from ground rouge was introduced as a tiebreaker rouge a contemporary newspaper report of 1862 sheffield fc meeting reported that most important alteration is adoption of rouges which will have effect of preventing matches to result in draws rouge originated in eton field game where it was awarded when a player touched ball down behind opponents goal line in a somewhat similar manner to today s try in rugby sheffield fc encountered rouge in a match of 17 december 1860 when club played against 58th regiment winning by one goal and 10 rouges to one goal and 5 rouges reports of later sheffield fc games during 1860 and 1861 however do not mention rouges e g at club s annual meeting in october 1861 as mentioned above sheffield fc specifically rejected a proposal to add rouges to its own code although sheffield laws defining rouge bore a great deal of similarity to equivalent rules of eton field game sheffield rules 1862 eton field game 1857 11 a rouge is obtained by player who first touches ball after it has been kicked between rouge flags and when a rouge has been obtained one of defending side must stand post two yards in front of goal sticks 5 a rouge is obtained by player who first touches ball after it has been kicked behind or on line of goalsticks of opposite side provided kicker has been bullied by one of more of opposite party in act of kicking 12 no rouge is obtained when a player who first touches ball is on defending side in that case it is a kick out as specified in law 2 7 should ball be first touched by one of defending party no rouge is obtained and ball must be placed on a line with goalsticks and kicked off by one of that party 13 no player who is behind line of goal sticks when ball is kicked behind may touch it in any way either to prevent or obtain a rouge 10 no player who is behind line of goalsticks before ball be kicked behind may touch it in any way either to prevent or obtain a rouge 14 a goal outweighs any number of rouges should no goals or an equal number be obtained match is decided by rouges 25 a goal outweighs any number of rouges should no goals or an equal number be obtained match is decided by rouges there were also significant differences sheffield made use of rouge flags on goal line at a distance of from each goal post as mentioned above these flags had been added to field of play in 1861 a rouge could be scored by touching ball down only after it had been kicked between two rouge flags without going into goal eton did not use rouge flags permitting a rouge to be scored at any distance from goal sheffield also removed eton s requirement that attacking player who kicked ball behind goal line had to be bullied tackled mauled in sheffield 1862 rules as at eton rouge was immediately followed by a set piece in front of goal one of defending side must stand post two yards in front of goal sticks in eton game we know from detailed descriptions that this situation was somewhat similar to a rugby behind is a similar concept in australian rules football new laws were adopted almost immediately with sheffield recorded as beating norton on 22 february 1862 by one goal and one rouge to nothing developments between 1862 and 1867 1862 laws like those of 1858 made no provision for offside in a letter to field in february 1867 sheffield fc secretary harry chambers wrote that sheffield fc had adopted a rule at beginning of 1863 season requiring one opponent to be level or closer to opponent s goal this claim is supported in a letter from secretary william chesterman to fa in 1863 at sheffield fc s 1865 annual general meeting it was resolved that t hat for future we play strict offside rule but if other sheff iel d clubs do not adopt same rule we play our matches with them according to our present rules another resolution stated that a letter should be written to notts secretary saying that we will adopt offside rule if they will give up making mark in case of a free kick also free kick at goal this offside law was abandoned at end of 1865 66 season with sheffield fc reverting to weaker one player rule harvey 2005 pp 118 119 a newspaper article of january 1867 reported that t he stricter fa style off side rule has been played in sheffield but was universally disapproved of it was found to be cause of much discontent and produced a most unsatisfactory state of things it being so difficult in excitement of a close match to distinguish what players were off and what on side it was therefore abandoned and now as formerly only restriction upon position of any player in field is that he must not be nearer to his adversaries goal than nearest of defending side surviving club records indicate that rules could be varied for individual matches e g 9 may 1863 v garrison allowed striking throwing ball 28 october 1865 v mackenzie played offside rules 11 november 1865 vs norton played at east bank to old rules sources for exact laws played during this period are scarce as noted above our best source for offside law during these years is a letter written to field newspaper some years later a letter sent from club secretary william chesterman to football association in february 1866 strongly supported an fa proposal to abolish fair catch suggesting that there was already some appetite within club for its removal from sheffield code fair catch had survived in 1862 laws but would later be abolished in sheffield association laws of 1867 as described below a copy of newly founded sheffield mechanics fc rulebook for 1865 66 is largely identical to sheffield fc 1862 laws but with two variations which may or may not be related to developments at sheffield fc a free kick is awarded for illegal handling as in draft sheffield fc laws of 1858 and future sheffield association laws of 1867 when ball is kicked out at goal sides a throw in is taken from corner flag foreshadowing a similar sheffield association rule introduced in october 1867 as described below laws of sheffield football association 1867 in march 1867 newly formed sheffield football association issued its first set of laws text of laws of london football association which had been amended previous month was used as a starting point with sheffield clubs making changes to reflect distinctive features of their game significant new features of 1867 laws relative to 1862 sheffield fc laws were handling was completely banned and was punished with an indirect free kick from which neither a goal nor a rouge could be scored rouge no longer required a touch down it was scored whenever ball was kicked between rouge flags and under bar rouge was followed by a kick out for defending side rather than previous stand post procedure pushing was forbidden throw in was awarded against side kicking ball out of play rather than to first team to touch ball minimum distance of 6 yards for throw in was removed weak off side law requiring one opponent to be level or closer to opponent s goal was added kick out after ball goes out of play behind goal line was from within 6 yards of goal rather than previous 10 yards ends were changed after each goal october 1867 amendment in october 1867 an amendment was made to laws whereby there was a kick out only after ball was kicked directly over crossbar in all other cases where ball went out of play over goal line game was restarted by a throw from point where ball crossed goal line ten yards towards opposite goal awarded against team who put ball out of play laws of sheffield football association 1868 at its meeting in october 1868 sheffield association made sweeping changes to its rules with almost every aspect of game significantly altered rouge was abolished with rouge flags being removed width of goal was doubled to eight yards thus making sheffield goal same width as fa goal though height of sheffield goal remained greater at nine feet rather than eight feet throw in from touch was replaced with a kick in which could go in any direction corner kick was introduced it applied whenever ball went out of play over goal line to side of goal and was awarded against team who kicked ball out of play when ball went out of play directly over bar regardless of which team kicked it out it was still a kick to defending team from within six yards of goal free kick previously awarded only for handling was extended to cases of tripping hacking and pushing fair catch abolished in 1867 was reintroduced it was rewarded with a free kick all handling other than a fair catch remained forbidden for first time law made reference to match officials each team was entitled to nominate an umpire who would officiate in half of field defended by his own team laws of sheffield football association 1869 further changes were made at sheffield association s meeting of october 1869 handling ball was allowed in case of an attempted catch in addition to a successful fair catch handling was permitted within three yards of a player s own goal distance opponents had to retreat at a free kick was increased from three yards to six yards fair catch while still permitted was no longer rewarded with a free kick laws of sheffield football association 1871 thumb title page of 1871 rules at an adjourned general meeting held in january 1871 association voted to prohibit catching or handling ball with exception of defenders within three yards of their own goal change was initially made on a temporary basis until end of season with a view to its future abolishment during an animated discussion on question defenders of fair catch objected to continual chopping and changing catching having been abandoned on a previous occasion from 1867 to 1868 at annual general meeting held in october of same year sheffield association heard from a representative of south derbyshire football association whose members having trialled both fa and sheffield rules had decided almost to a man in favour of sheffield derbyshire group was determin ed to join sheffield association should that body decide to abolish catching after this a total ban on handling was proposed objectors countered that grounds in sheffield and neighbourhood were unfit for non catching rule on account of their hilly nature but they were voted down with following changes being made fair catch was once again abolished handling was permitted only if hand or arm was not extended from body charging from behind was banned and punished with an indirect free kick it was noted that these changes left sheffield laws very close to those of fa with offside being biggest remaining difference meeting continued by criticizing fa s ridiculous offside law which required three opponents to be closer to opposing goal and its arrogance in refusing to play any rules but its own laws of sheffield football association 1875 following changes were made at sheffield association s meeting of february 1875 height of crossbar was lowered from nine feet to eight feet thus making dimensions of sheffield goal identical to those of fa goal fa law for changing ends was adopted ends were always changed at half time they were no longer changed after each goal goalkeeper not a designated individual as in fa laws but nearest defender to goal was permitted to handle ball umpires were supplied with flags disputes between sheffield association and fa remained over questions of throw ins kick ins and offside fa had repeatedly rejected sheffield s laxer offside rule at its own 1872 1873 and 1874 meetings furthermore fa had that very same month rejected a proposal by sheffield association to introduce kick ins instead of throw ins at sheffield association s meeting a proposal for sheffield to adopt fa s stricter offside law was rejected with a contemporary report stating w e do not doubt that if londoners i e fa had shown a more conciliatory spirit with respect to throw in rule off side rule would have been accepted laws of sheffield football association 1876 another proposal to introduce fa s 3 player offside law was by a large majority with opponents citing rough nature of grounds played on by sheffield teams and claiming that strong defence it fa s offside rule admits of would in many instances prevent any likelihood of a score being made fa s rejection of sheffield s kick in law at its own annual meeting held one week earlier was said to have influenced feeling of sheffield meeting only one change to laws was made with fa s law on handling ball being adopted adoption of fa laws 1877 dispute between sheffield association and fa came to a head in 1877 at regular meeting of fa in february sheffield association again proposed its kick in rule while clydesdale fc proposed a compromise rule which retained throw in but allowed it to go in any direction sheffield association agreed to withdraw its own proposal in favour of clydesdale fc s compromise however even this compromise proposal was rejected to intense regret of those who desired one common code of rules this rejection prompted publication of a pseudonymous letter in sportsman decrying hasty ill judged decision bringing football association into disrepute and denying that it represented general body of football association players even of those in london a subsequent extraordinary general meeting of fa was held on 17th of april at which clydesdale amendment was reconsidered and passed as a result of this change in fa laws sheffield association held a meeting one week later at which it agreed to abandon its own rules and accept fa laws principal changes made by sheffield association in going from its own laws of 1876 to fa laws of 1877 were following adoption of stricter 3 player fa offside law replacement of kick in from touch with throw in which could still be thrown in any direction a goal kick rather than a defensive corner kick was now awarded when an attacking player kicked ball out of play over goal line but not directly over goal an attacking corner kick rather than a goal kick was now awarded when a defender kicked ball out of play directly over goal later developments despite its adoption of fa laws in 1877 sheffield association continued to consider proposed alterations to rules independently at its february 1879 meeting after a long and noisy discussion change was rejected continued importance of sheffield football association was reflected in selection of its treasurer william peirce dix as one of two delegates to represent england at international football conference of december 1882 this meeting resulted in one unified set of rules for association football across britain and ireland it prefigured international football association board which would be final authority on laws of game from 1886 onwards summary of principal changes in laws date size of goal tie breaker handling allowed offside law indirect free kick awarded for throw in kick in goal kick kick out corner kick defensive corner kick attacking 1858

kicked ball into touch may be thrown in any direction whenever no goal scored and ball was last touched by a member of attacking team none whenever no goal scored and ball was last touched by a member of defending team early years thumb team photograph of sheffield f c in 1890 initially code was only played among sheffield f c members games initially teamed players with surnames in first half of alphabet against players with surnames in latter half of alphabet they however discovered that most talented players all had surnames in first half various other permutations were tried with professionals versus merchants and manufacturers becoming one of favourites in december 1858 they played their first outside opposition a team from local 58th army regiment in 1859 club produced its first printed rule book despite this rules were not entirely fixed with changes experimented with throughout season two major events took place in 1860 on 31 january a meeting was held where it was resolved that law 8 should be expunged and replaced with holding ball except in case of a free kick or knocking or pushing it on is altogether disallowed on pitch an early inter club match between sheffield and newly formed hallam f c took place on 26 december 1860 match took place at hallam s ground road it was reported that sheffielders turned in their usual scarlet and white which suggests that club colours were already in use despite playing with inferior numbers sheffield f c beat hallam 2 0 game of time could still be a violent one a match on 29 december between sheffield and hallam became known as battle of bramall lane an incident occurred when nathaniel creswick was being held by shaw and waterfall accounts differ over subsequent events original report stated that creswick was accidentally punched by waterfall this was contested in a letter from hallam players that claimed that it was in retaliation for a blow thrown by nathaniel creswick whatever cause result was a general riot which also involved a number of spectators after which waterfall was sent to guard goal as punishment sheffield and london football association fa was formed at a meeting in freemason s tavern in great queen street london on 26 october 1863 sheffield f c sent four representatives who acted as observers club joined new organisation a month later in a letter sent by william chesterman in it he also enclosed a copy of sheffield rules and expressed club s opposition to hacking and running with ball describing them as directly opposed to football this letter was read out at an fa meeting on 1 december 1863 rules allowing hacking and running with ball were reversed at same meeting new code became known as association football offside rule was introduced to sheffield rules in 1863 their version only required one member of opposition between a player and opposing goal to remain on side despite this rule was only used sporadically in actual play fa version which required a player to remain behind ball at all times was introduced during 1865 66 season but was disliked due to lack of goal scoring opportunities it caused one man offside was finally used on a regular basis from 1867 until adoption of fa rules in 1877 fa had remained largely dormant after creation of its rules but in 1866 sheffield f c suggested a match between it and a fa club this was misunderstood and they ended up playing a combined fa team on 31 march 1866 under fa rules game was first ever to limit match to 90 minutes and sheffield f c adopted it as its preferred length of match rule would make it to fa rule book in 1877 a second match was suggested by london fa in a letter sent in november or same year but never took place reason being disputes of which rules should be used fa introduced an cross bar used by sheffield in same year only for sheffield to then decide to raise it to fair catch was also dropped by sheffield this completed transition to a purely kicking game by 1867 sheffield rules was dominant code in england fa had still not achieved national dominance it enjoys today its membership had shrunk to just 10 clubs and at a meeting of fa it was reported that only three clubs no names club barnes and crystal palace were playing by fa code at same meeting secretary of sheffield club suggested three rule changes at an fa meeting adoption of rouges one man offside and introduction of a free kick for handling ball none of motions were successful later in same year they abolished handling and touchdowns it was stated that this was to bring them closer to non handling games birth of competition in 1867 world s first football tournament youdan cup was played under rules tournament involved 12 local sides and was played during february and march tournament committee decided on use of an off field referee to award free kicks for infringements final took place on 5 march and was only second football match to take place at bramall lane a crowd of 3 000 a world record attendance watched hallam f c claim cup by scoring two rouges in last five minutes to win two rouges to one sheffield football association was founded following tournament 12 teams involved in tournament were joined by sheffield f c to become founding members association adopted sheffield rules without any changes they were first of several regional football associations that sprung up over following decade a second tournament cromwell cup was played a year later this time it was only open to teams under two years old out of four teams that competed wednesday emerged victorious final was a goalless draw after 90 minutes so teams played on until a goal was scored this was first instance where a match involved extra time this would be last tournament to be played in sheffield for nine years until formation of sheffield football association challenge cup in 1876 rouges were abandoned in 1868 to be replaced by goal and corner kicks sheffield fa limited handling to within of goal in 1871 fa however introduced a designated goalkeeper who was allowed to handle ball anywhere on pitch in an effort to prevent sheffield game looking boring in comparison sheffield fa expanded limit to halfway line in 1870 16 teams of sheffield fa were admitted to fa but were allowed to continue to play by sheffield rules against fa clubs a year later sheffield fa itself became affiliated with football association and matches between two associations began between 1871 and 1876 a total of 16 matches were played between sheffield and london associations as well as playing under both sheffield and london rules additional matches were played at bramall lane using a mixture of both sets aspects of sheffield game were also incorporated into fa rules matches being played between sheffield and london led to two sets of rules becoming ever more similar corner kick was proposed by sheffield association and adopted by fa on 17 february 1872 they also followed sheffield s lead in restricting handling of ball by goalkeeper to his own half sheffield game reverted to using an crossbar in line with fa demise fa cup was inaugurated in 1871 but sheffield clubs declined to enter competition as it was being played under fa rules first team to enter was sheffield f c in 1873 74 season this was after an attempt to enter a sheffield fa team was refused by organisers they reached quarter finals before being knocked out by clapham rovers sheffield fa instituted their own challenge cup in 1876 cup was open to all members of sfa that now included many clubs outside local area first final attracted a crowd of 8 000 twice as much as fa cup final in same season it was a record crowd for a cup match that would be held until fa cup of 1883 match was between heeley and wednesday and resulted in a 2 0 win for latter by 1877 it was clear that situation had become impractical after letters were published in field deriding state of affairs it was decided to unite kicking game under one set of laws by this time fa cup had helped fa gain a dominant position within game fa accepted sheffield rule allowing throw ins to be thrown in any direction as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby in return fa s use of a three man offside was adopted by 1880s influence of sheffield fa started to wane internal troubles began to surface with disputes between sfa and a new rival association hallamshire f a former led by charles clegg also fought a losing battle against onset of professionalism by middle of decade several local clubs including sheffield and hallam f c were in financial trouble four national associations of uk met in 1882 with a view to creating a common set of laws they created of international football association board ifab which first met in 1886 ifab s role was further affirmed when federation internationale de football association adopted their laws upon its formation in 1904 they have remained in sole charge of rules ever since innovations right thumb corner kick was first developed under sheffield rules heading corner kicks and awarding free kicks for fouls were conceived in sheffield games one of most enduring rules of sheffield game prevented a goal from being scored directly from a free kick or throw in kick in this was present in every version of sheffield rules and was later adopted within fa rules it was later refined by international football association board into modern day indirect free kick aerial game was also developed within sheffield game while causing much amusement when side visited london in 1866 header would become an important feature of national game this was linked to abolition of fair catch in same year that prevented all use of hands by outfield players 1862 rules also introduced a half time at which teams would swap ends initially this was only if game was scoreless as teams would also swap ends if a goal was scored rule was changed to a swap at half time only in 1876 early games did not use any on field officials but disputes between players would be referred to a committee member umpires were introduced by end of 1862 two umpires were used one from each club off field referee was introduced for youdan cup in 1867 and entered rulebook by 1871 umpires would then appeal to referee on behalf of their team concept was later introduced to fa game and persisted until 1891 when referee moved onto pitch and umpires became linesmen umpire s flag was first suggested by charles clegg at a sheffield fa meeting in 1874 innovative streak within sheffield remained after demise of their own rules on 15 october 1878 a crowd of 20 000 watched first floodlit match at bramall lane exhibition match was set up to test use of lights and was played between specially selected teams captained by brothers william and charles clegg william clegg s team won 2 0 experiment was repeated a month later at oval concept of a penalty goal for fouls within of goal was suggested at a sheffield fa meeting in 1879 penalty would eventually make it into rules by 1892 sheffield players developed screw shot in late 1870s this gave players ability to bend shot into net a technique now common in game legacy many of rules in sheffield game were adopted by and are still featured in today s association game twelve changes were made to fa code between 1863 and 1870 of which eight were taken from sheffield rules during this period sheffield fa had significant influence over fa and encouraged it to continue when it was close to collapse in 1867 corner kick was adopted by fa in 1872 and they restricted handling of ball to goalkeeper s own half in 1873 in final negotiations between sheffield and london latter agreed to allow throw ins in any direction in exchange during 1860s sheffield and london were dominant football cultures in england however while london was fragmented by different codes used by 1862 rules of sheffield f c had become dominant code in sheffield nottingham forest adopted sheffield code in 1867 and birmingham and derbyshire fas became affiliated with sheffield adopting its code in 1876 most clubs in north and midlands were playing by sheffield
