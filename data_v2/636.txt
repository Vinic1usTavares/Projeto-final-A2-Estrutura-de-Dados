century saint and a king of east anglia anglo saxon kingdom which today includes english counties of norfolk and suffolk little is known of his reign which may have begun in 779 according to later sources and very few of coins issued during his reign have been discovered it is known from anglo saxon chronicle that he was killed on orders of offa of mercia in 794 he was subsequently locally canonised and became focus of cults in east anglia and at hereford where shrine of saintly king once existed in absence of historical facts mediaeval chroniclers provided their own details for aethelberht s ancestry life as king and death at hands of offa his feast day is 20 may several norfolk suffolk and west country parish churches are dedicated to saint life and reign thumb left kingdom of east anglia little is known of aethelberht s life or reign as very few east anglian records have survived from this period mediaeval chroniclers have provided dubious accounts of his life in absence of any real details according to richard of cirencester writing in fifteenth century aethelberht s parents were aethelred i of east anglia and of mercia richard narrates in detail a story of aethelberht s piety election as king and wise rule urged to marry against his will he apparently agreed to wed eadburh daughter of offa of mercia and set out to visit her despite his mother s forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events an earthquake a solar eclipse and a vision internet archive catholic encyclopedia ethelbert aethelberht s reign may have begun in 779 date provided for beginning of his reign on uncertain authority of a much later saint s life absence of any east anglian charters prevents it from being known whether he ruled as a king or a sub king under power of ruler of another kingdom thumb a mention of aethelberht in anglo saxon chronicle aethelberht was stopped by offa of mercia from minting his own coins of which only four examples have ever been found one of these coins a light penny said to have been found in 1908 at tivoli near rome is similar in type to coinage of offa on one side is word rex with an image of romulus and remus suckling a wolf obverse names both king and his moneyer who struck coins for both offa and coenwulf of mercia andy hutcheson has suggested that use of runes on coin may signify continuing strong control by local leaders hutcheson origin of east anglian towns p 203 according to marion archibald issuing of flattering coins of this type with intention to win friends in rome probably indicated to offa that as a sub king aethelberht was assuming a greater degree of independence than he was prepared to tolerate archibald coinage of p 34 in 793 vulnerability of english east coast was exposed when monastery at lindisfarne was looted by vikings and a year later jarrow was also attacked events which steven plunkett reasons would ensure that east anglians were governed firmly aethelberht s claim to be a king descended from wuffingas dynasty suggested by use of a roman she wolf and title rex on his coins could be because of a need for strong kingship as a result of viking attacks death and canonisation aethelberht was put to death by offa of mercia under unclear circumstances site of his murder was apparently royal vill at sutton walls according to anglo saxon chronicle he was beheaded swanton anglo saxon chronicle p 55 her offa het aedelbrihte thet from an online version of chronicle mediaeval sources tell how he was taken captive while visiting his future mercian bride aelfthyth and was then murdered and buried in richard of cirencester s account of murder which cannot be substantiated offa s evil queen poisoned her husband s mind until he agreed to have his guest killed aethelberht was then bound and beheaded by a certain and his body was unceremoniously disposed of mediaeval historian john brompton s chronicon describes how king s detached head fell off a cart into a ditch where it was found before it restored a blind man s sight according to chronicon aelfthyth subsequently became a recluse at crowland and her remorseful father founded monasteries gave land to church and travelled on a pilgrimage to rome execution of an anglo saxon king on orders of another ruler was very rare although public hanging and beheading did occur at this time as has been discovered at sutton hoo site aethelberht s death at hands of mercians made possibility of any peaceful union between anglian peoples including mercia less likely than before it led to mercia s domination of east anglia whose kings ruled over kingdom for over three decades after aethelberht s death in 2014 metal detectorist darrin simpson of eastbourne found a coin minted during reign of aethelbert in a sussex field it is believed that coin may have led to aethelbert s beheading by offa as it had been struck as a sign of independence describing coin christopher webb head of coins at auctioneers dix noonan

and at hereford anglo saxon church of episcopal estate at hoxne was one of several dedicated to aethelberht in suffolk church is mentioned in will of bishop of london and hoxne c 938 c 951 a possible indication of existence of a religious cult devoted to saintly king only three dedications for aethelberht are near where he died marden hereford cathedral and littledean other eleven being in norfolk or suffolk lawrence butler has argued that this unusual pattern may be explained by existence of a royal cult in east anglia which represented a revival of christianity after danish settlement by
