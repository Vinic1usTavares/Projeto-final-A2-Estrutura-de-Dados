battle of vizagapatam was a minor naval engagement fought in approaches to vizagapatam harbour in coastal andhra region of british india on bay of bengal on 15 september 1804 during napoleonic wars a french squadron under contre admiral charles alexandre leon durand linois in ship of line marengo attacked british royal navy fourth rate ship hms centurion and two east indiaman merchant ships anchored in harbour roads linois was engaged in an extended raiding campaign which had already involved operations in south china sea in mozambique channel off ceylon and along indian coast of bay of bengal french squadron had fought one notable engagement at battle of pulo aura on 15 february 1804 in which linois had attacked honourable east india company s heic china fleet a large convoy of well armed merchant ships carrying cargo worth ps8 million linois failed to press attack and withdrew with convoy at his mercy invoking anger of napoleon when news reached france since his failure at pulo aura linois had been cruising indian ocean and during august and september 1804 had seized a number of valuable merchant ships as his squadron travelled north from ceylon along indian coast of bay of bengal from a ship captured off masulipatam linois learned of presence of east indiamen at vizagapatam and determined to attack unaware that british rear admiral peter rainier had replaced small frigate hms wilhelmina with larger centurion as convoy s escort arriving off port at 06 00 linois advanced on convoy causing one of east indiamen to drive ashore in panic other merchant vessel failed to support outnumbered centurion and was captured but centurion continued fighting alone initially supported by fire of gun batteries on shore centurion later moved out of their range while engaging french flagship marengo which remained well offshore to avoid coastal shoals after an engagement lasting four hours marengo withdrew badly damaged centurion attempting to pursue but without success linois s squadron was forced to return to ile de france in aftermath of engagement where marengo required six months of repairs background during napoleonic wars british economy depended on movement of trade from british empire particularly trading posts and colonies in british india managed by honourable east india company heic this company transported goods from india to europe using a fleet of large and well armed merchant ships named east indiamen which travelled in convoys for protection and were escorted during wartime by ships provided by royal navy victory of seapower gardiner p 102 main royal navy base in bay of bengal was at city of madras but east indiamen sailed from ports all around bay as a result force in madras was often dispersed to provide escorts to smaller convoys travelling to madras or calcutta to merge with other ships to form large oceanic convoys at outbreak of napoleonic war commander of british forces in indian ocean was rear admiral peter rainier principal threat to british control of region was a squadron sent from france shortly before war broke out led by contre admiral charles alexandre leon durand linois in ship of line marengo woodman p 172 rainier and linois had clashed in june 1803 before news of outbreak of war had reached india linois had anchored at pondicherry a french indian port and rainier had led a powerful squadron to anchor off harbour in anticipation of declaration of war concerned that rainier s numerically superior force would overwhelm his squadron before they could operate against british merchant convoys in region linois slipped away under cover of darkness and eventually reached ile de france where he learned that napoleonic wars had begun on 16 may james vol 3 p 212 sailing to batavia in dutch east indies linois resupplied and then departed for a cruise in south china sea on 28 december seeking large annual convoy of heic merchant ships from canton known as china fleet this convoy was normally escorted from canton by several royal navy ships of line but in 1804 escort had been delayed woodman p 194 linois discovered convoy near island of pulo aura at eastern entrance to strait of malacca at 08 00 on 14 february and advanced convoy commander commodore nathaniel dance had disguised several of east indiamen as ships of line in hope of convincing linois that convoy was well protected rodger p 546 linois hesitated for over a day eventually attacking on morning of 15 february dance resisted and linois withdrew without contesting engagement dance s merchant ships chased linois s squadron away before resuming their course and meeting their escorts several days later linois s failure to engage and defeat china fleet infuriated a number of his officers and provoked an angry letter from napoleon who accused linois of believing that war can be made without running risks clowes p 339 in aftermath of engagement linois returned to batavia and then to ile de france arriving on 2 april there he was criticised by governor general charles decaen who wrote a letter to napoleon complaining of linois s conduct at battle of pulo aura james vol 3 p 277 in mid june 1804 linois departed ile de france with marengo and frigates atalante under captain camille charles alexis and semillante under captain leonard bernard motard cruising off madagascar in stormy weather before sailing to coast of ceylon he enjoyed some success against individual merchant vessels and gradually moved northwards during late summer squadron passed madras off coast to avoid encountering rainier s squadron and raided along coastal andhra region visiting masulipatam and on 14 september 1804 off masulipatam linois captured a country ship and learned from crew that a small convoy was anchored at vizagapatam to north convoy was reported to consist of two east indiamen with 36 gun frigate hms wilhelmina a former dutch vessel captured in 1798 as their escort fleet battle and blockade gardiner p 115 linois immediately sailed for vizagapatam expecting an easy victory over convoy clowes p 349 battle at madras admiral rainier had become increasingly concerned during september by linois s depredations and had decided to strengthen his convoy escorts he replaced wilhelmina with 50 gun hms centurion james vol 3 p 276 centurion was under nominal command of captain john rainier who was seriously ill at madras so captain james lind assumed temporary command lind sailed from madras to vizagapatam earlier in month with indiamen barnaby and princess charlotte and anchored in roads while indiamen loaded cargo ready for return journey to madras ships were still anchored in roads at 06 00 on 15 september when linois s squadron appeared on horizon to south west approximately away only flag visible on strange ships was on board one of frigates which displayed st george s cross lieutenant james robert phillips in command of centurion while lind was ashore was not convinced by this ensign he was aware that a french squadron was in region and positioned his ship so that his broadside faced approaching vessels at 09 45 french came within range and phillips opened fire cautiously at first until he could be sure of identity of strangers ship of line exchanged signals with frigates as centurion began to fire and as signals were different from those used by royal navy phillips was certain he was facing an overwhelming enemy squadron centurion made urgent signals to indiamen warning them of approaching threat crew of barnaby panicked and cut her anchor cables causing her to drift on shore where she was wrecked captain john logan on princess charlotte was calmer and remained at anchor although he ignored requests from phillips for assistance from his ship s gun battery linois s ships spread out atalante closing to within of centurion with semillante close behind marengo remained out of range as linois was unwilling to risk his flagship in shallow coastal waters for which he did not have accurate charts approaches to vizagapatam were protected by a series of sandbars and if marengo grounded during engagement then his flagship could have been wrecked james vol 3 p 279 when french frigates came within phillips opened fire on atalante as semillante attempted to reach other side of british ship to batter from other side french frigates also came under long range fire from three gun battery at vizagapatam under command of lieutenant colonel alexander campbell on detached service from 74th regiment of foot campbell despatched 50 sepoys in small boats to assist crew of princess charlotte whose armament of 24 guns continued to remain silent james vol 3 p 278 by 10 00 all three french ships were within range of centurion and a heavy exchange of fire began within 15 minutes both centurion and marengo had their colours shot away and at 10 45 ship of line turned away for open water followed by frigates her rigging in disarray damage had rendered centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from marengo among coastal shoals campaign of trafalgar gardiner p 28 captain lind rejoined his ship by boat hailing princess charlotte which had still not participated in battle to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured logan refused and at 11 15 surrendered without a fight as whole french squadron moved back towards harbour marengo again remained beyond sandbars that marked entrance boatloads of sepoys who were still en route to princess charlotte turned about and rowed back to shore to avoid capture semillante took possession of merchant ship while marengo and atalante engaged centurion which had moved out of range of support from shore batteries despite her 50 guns centurions armament left her vulnerable as most were carronades short range heavy cannon that were useless in face of long range gunnery from marengo centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13 15 had been holed with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through which caused her to slowly drift away from shore out of control seeing that his opponent was disabled linois decided not to press attack and issued orders for his squadron accompanied by their prize to sail away lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit but french were too far ahead after some final parting shots centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing damage linois remained within sight for rest of day but showed no sign of renewing action he disappeared on north east horizon at dusk aftermath despite destruction of barnaby and capture of princess charlotte british losses were mild centurion having one man killed and nine wounded ship was very badly damaged however with a number of holes shot in her hull and badly torn rigging and masts there were no recorded casualties among troops onshore french suffered slightly heavier losses marengo having two men killed and an officer wounded and atalante with three killed and five wounded semillante which had not been closely engaged in battle suffered no casualties damage to french ships was severe and linois was forced to abandon further operations and slowly make his way back to ile de france arriving in november there marengo underwent a full refit lasting six months james vol 4 p 150 both nations claimed encounter as a victory french for capture of princess charlotte and british for survival of centurion in face of overwhelming french numerical superiority james vol 3 p 280 linois justified his withdrawal in a letter explaining that risking irreparable damage his squadron in a close engagement with centurion would have curtailed his raiding operations privately however napoleon was angered by survival of centurion and wrote in response that france cared for honour not for a few pieces of wood british historians have echoed napoleon s criticism judging that centurion was at linois s mercy and that he had failed to destroy her in words of william laird clowes because of his half hearted and timid action that cannot but provoke censure clowes p 350 notes references
