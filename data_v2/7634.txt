only a northern song is a song by english rock band beatles from their 1969 soundtrack album yellow submarine written by george harrison it was first of four songs band provided for 1968 animated film yellow submarine to meet their contractual obligations to united artists song was recorded mainly in february 1967 during sessions for sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band but beatles chose not to include it on that album group completed recording two months later straight after finishing work on sgt pepper harrison wrote only a northern song out of dissatisfaction with his status as a junior songwriter with beatles publishing company northern songs lyrics and music convey his disenchantment at how company retained copyright for songs it published and at how following its public listing in 1965 major shareholders profited more from his compositions than he did recording features hammond organ played by harrison and an overdubbed montage of assorted sounds including trumpet blasts and spoken voices anticipating john lennon s 1968 sound collage revolution 9 due to difficulty in assembling completed track from two tape sources only a northern song remained a rare song from beatles post 1963 catalogue that was unavailable in true stereo until 1999 that year it was remixed for inclusion on album yellow submarine songtrack song has received a varied response from reviewers while ian macdonald dismisses track as a self indulgent dirge website ultimate classic rock identifies it as one of beatles best works in psychedelic genre a version of song with a different vocal part and omitting sound collage overdubs was issued on beatles 1996 outtakes compilation anthology 2 gravenhurst and yonder mountain string band are among artists who have covered only a northern song background and inspiration george harrison said that subject matter for only a northern song related to both his city of birth liverpool in merseyside and fact that copyright for composition belonged to beatles publishing company northern songs author brian southall describes song as harrison s personal denunciation of beatles music publishing business given his disadvantageous position with northern songs company was floated on london stock exchange in february 1965 as a means of saving john lennon and paul mccartney beatles principal songwriters tax liability generated through international success of their catalogue harrison had formed his own publishing company harrisongs in late 1964 despite financial advantages offered by his 80 per cent stake in that company he agreed to remain with northern songs to aid flotation scheme among four beatles lennon and mccartney were major shareholders in northern songs each owning 15 per cent of public company s shares and pair earned considerable wealth over first year of flotation harrison and ringo starr as contracted songwriters owned 0 8 per cent each this arrangement ensured that in addition to company retaining copyright of all its published songs lennon and mccartney profited more from harrison s compositions than he did when discussing song in two late 1990s interviews with billboard editor in chief timothy white harrison commented that main target of his complaints was dick james managing director of northern songs having been signed by james in 1963 at age of twenty harrison said that publisher had failed to explain that by signing contract he was also signing away ownership of his compositions harrison added that he only understood consequences after 1965 flotation when major shareholders were making all this money out of this catalog with reference to rutles 1978 parody of beatles history all you need is cash he also told white i think message behind only a northern song was put better in make believe tv documentary where it said dick jaws an out of work music publisher of no fixed ability signed them up for rest of their lives in author ian macdonald s estimation only a northern song suggests that harrison had yet to recover his enthusiasm for being a beatle after he had threatened to leave group following their final concert tour in august 1966 before band regrouped in november that year to begin recording their album sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band harrison spent six weeks in india with his sitar teacher ravi shankar a visit that heightened his lack of interest in beatles project available at rock s backpages subscription required macdonald considers that harrison s link with northern england in only a northern song was influenced by beatles working on songs about growing up in liverpool which was concept under consideration at start of sgt pepper sessions composition and musical structure harrison wrote only a northern song on a hammond organ which became his preferred instrument for songwriting during 1967 replacing guitar song is in key of a major although macdonald gives b minor as a secondary key opening organ part ends with a preview of melody over which song title appears in song proper after this short introduction composition is structured into two portions each consisting of two verses and a chorus which are followed by a single verse a final chorus and an outro with some of these sections rendered as instrumental passages thumb 230px right a hammond b3 organ along with within you without you it s all too much and blue jay way only a northern song was one of several compositions that harrison wrote on a keyboard instrument during a period when he was otherwise immersed in studying indian sitar composition is a meta song in that its subject is work itself while commenting on pointlessness of writing for northern songs harrison employs musical dissonance to express his dissatisfaction with company in musicologist walter everett s description this is achieved through use of ill behaved tones and wrong mode chords from verse s opening a major chord melody moves to a ii minor voicing rendered as b minor 7 11 through inclusion of a low register e note in his lyrics harrison acknowledges apparent awkwardness of such a change singing you may think chords are going wrong and in final verse that harmony might be a little dark and out of key musicologist alan pollack considers song s music and lyrical message to be uncannily in tune with one another and that this effect is accentuated by surprising and irregular phrase lengths in verses in contrast to minimal chord changes over verses choruses present a fast progression of chords specifically e major b minor 7 g major c7 and f7 in first chorus harrison comments that given inadequacy of his publishing arrangement it doesn t really matter what chords i play author ian inglis interprets this line as mirroring singer s complaint to beatles biographer hunter davies in late 1960s regarding futility of band s live performances when their screaming fans never listened to music beatles were playing harrison biographer simon leng describes only a northern song as first example of its composer pushing back at beatles as an organization he found wanting a theme harrison returned to in 1968 with not guilty with his comments on group s internal discord production recording thumb left upright 0 75 harrison right with music journalist veljko despot outside emi studios in february 1967 beatles taped basic track for only a northern song at emi studios now abbey road studios on 13 february 1967 during sessions for sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band as was typical with his new compositions harrison had yet to give song a title so it was referred to as not known line up on track comprised harrison on organ lennon on tambourine mccartney on bass and starr on drums band recorded nine takes of song before selecting take 3 for further work following day studio engineers carried out three reduction mixes of this performance onto fresh 4 track tapes on what was now called take 12 third of reduction mixes harrison filled two available tracks with his lead vocals song was disliked by beatles producer george martin who later said it was his least favourite song of harrison s band were similarly unenthusiastic and it was decided to omit song from album as his sole writing contribution to sgt pepper harrison instead offered indian styled within you without you which in martin s recollection was welcomed with a bit of a relief all round only a northern song then became first track group supplied for soundtrack to yellow submarine animated film in line with their contractual obligation to united artists to provide four new songs described by beatles historian mark lewisohn as a myth a story later circulated that harrison had rush written composition for united artists in early 1968 after al brodax film s producer approached band for a final song overdubbing group returned to take 3 of only a northern song on 20 april a day when members of yellow submarine production team visited them in studio band started working on song less than 45 minutes after completing final mixing on sgt pepper demonstrating what lewisohn terms a tremendous appetite to continue recording retaining organ and drum tracks they overdubbed a new bass guitar part and on a separate track trumpet glockenspiel and vocalised sounds a second 4 track tape recorder was used so allowing various instrumental parts and studio effects to be spread across eight available channels on this machine band worked on second reduction mix tape from 14 february known as take 11 from which they wiped all previously recorded tracks except hammond organ part harrison then recorded two tracks of vocal one of which included more trumpet from mccartney and further vocalised sounds while final track was filled with timpani mellotron piano and more organ presence of harrison s original hammond part on both of tapes ensured that instrument had a more substantial sound in mix beatles performed many of overdubs in a haphazard manner tom maginnis of allmusic describes completed track as heavily steeped in psychedelic sounds of period using liberal amounts of loose instrumentation particularly chaotic bursts of trumpet according to pollack these additions constitute a noise track which further heightens theme of discordance and is used to fill song s instrumental sections becoming especially prominent during outro with its inclusion of random sounds and spoken voices inglis cites sound collage effect as a precedent for lennon s 1968 avant garde track revolution 9 and an early example of electronic music mixing on 21 april beatles completed a mono mix of song for its inclusion in yellow submarine due to difficulty in getting two 4 track machines to play at exactly same time attempts at creating a stereo equivalent were abandoned in october 1968 while preparing yellow submarine soundtrack album for release emi s engineers created a duophonic or mock stereo mix of only a northern song from mono mix monaural version of album which was originally available only in uk similarly used a suboptimal version of recording in this case as with three other new songs presented to united artists engineers combined two channels from duophonic mix rather than use true mono mix from april 1967 appearance in yellow submarine film 220px thumb left a still from sequence for only a northern song beatles had minimal involvement in making of yellow submarine leaving production to brodax s company king features syndicate film makers drew heavily on sgt pepper concept beatles association with liverpool and other aspects of their public image while project s art design was carried out by a team led by heinz edelmann sequences such as eleanor rigby and only a northern song were created by outside animators ensuring stylistic variation across film only a northern song plays over a scene when yellow submarine travels through sea of science during beatles quest to free pepperland and imprisoned sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band from music hating blue meanies recording was slowed down by a semitone for inclusion in film referring to psychedelic imagery in animation author stephen glynn says that this segment only makes sense when read as attempting an audio visual recreation of hallucinogenic state jeremiah massengale an academic in field of visual communication highlights sequence as one of many technical innovations introduced by 1968 film saying accompanying multi colored square portrait paintings of beatles during only a northern song there s a creative use of an oscillator picking out sound waves of track glynn cites drug inspired imagery of this and two other song sequences as true reason that rank pulled yellow submarine from its uk cinema run rather than company s official reasoning that film had performed poorly at box office only a northern song segment was among clips shown in a feature about yellow submarine on television show how it is produced by tony palmer and including portions of stage play based on lennon s book in his own write show was broadcast on bbc1 two days after film s world premiere in london on 19 july 1968 by early 21st century only a northern song was only music clip from how it is circulating among collectors release and reception film soundtrack was viewed as a secondary work by beatles who delayed its release to allow for their 1968 self titled double album also known as white album on 13 january 1969 only a northern song was issued as second track on side one of yellow submarine lp with george martin s orchestral score for film occupying whole of side two although harrison s contract with james had expired in march 1968 copyright for only a northern song and his second contribution to film it s all too much remained with northern songs rather than being assigned to harrisongs as his four white album compositions had been song s release coincided with a period of acrimony between dick james and beatles particularly lennon and mccartney about whom lewisohn writes if john and paul still thought they owned their songs following flotation of northern songs they were themselves in march 1969 having become wary of disharmony within band and problems affecting their apple corps business empire james sold his majority shareholding in northern songs to lew grade s atv music thereby selling on ownership of beatles catalogue in a contemporary review of yellow submarine beat instrumental lamented that it offered little new material by band but described only a northern song and it s all too much as superb pieces that redeem side one record mirrors reviewer said that whereas most of songs were simple beatles stuff only a northern song appeared to be a technical experiment in how many off key variations on a solid background tune one can get in while still maintaining a reasonable amount of finesse and it comes off very well available at rock s backpages subscription required recalling release in his 1977 book beatles forever however nicholas schaffner dismissed track as one of trifling baubles beatles provided for film while adhering to brodax s account of song s creation nme critic bob woffinden found considerable merit in only a northern song and said that harrison s divergence from his usual methodical approach to songwriting was one he should pursue more often in january 1996 song was issued as b side to it s all too much on a blue vinyl jukebox single as part of a series of beatles releases by capitol records special markets division by 1999 only a northern song remained one of only two post 1963 beatles songs not to have been made available in true stereo other being you know my name look up number that year a stereo version became available when track was remixed for inclusion on album yellow submarine songtrack which accompanied re release of animated film harrison was most active of former beatles in promoting 1999 reissue which he said was timely given that blue meanies have got a bigger stranglehold on planet right now than they ever had back in 1967 he added that even music industry has turned grey and is dominated by blue meanies retrospective assessment and legacy among more recent reviews of yellow submarine album david gassman of popmatters admires song for its mordant humor and interprets lyrics as a possible dig at lennon and mccartney gassman adds with reference to superior it s all too much as long as songs like this were being relegated to throwaway projects george could be excused for sniping at john and paul in only a northern song discussing same two tracks pitchfork media s mark richardson writes that they offer little of interest aside from their swirling psychedelic effects although he considers that only a northern song at least has a good joke going for it simultaneously alluding to north of england and beatles lennon mccartney dominated publishing company mark kemp of paste dismisses song as a meandering bore as with most of beatles post sgt pepper 1967 recordings their contributions to yellow submarine have traditionally been held in low regard by band s biographers mark lewisohn describes group s 20 april overdubs on only a northern song as a curious session and writes that their work over this period display s a startling lack of cohesion and enthusiasm mark hertsgaard considers that only a northern song was understandably rejected as not good enough for sgt pepper while ian macdonald views it as dismal and a self indulgent dirge more impressed alex young of consequence of sound identifies song as lyrically album s quintessential track as it perfectly defines yellow submarine in two verses alone while coming out sonically like a pink floyd b side from obscured by clouds sessions in a 2003 review in mojo peter doggett said that harrison s two contributions did much to rescue album from oblivion and he described only a northern song as gloriously ironic writing for ultimate classic rock in 2013 dave swanson ranked track third on his list of top 10 beatles psychedelic songs following tomorrow never knows and i am walrus and concluded would sgt pepper have been even greater had this mind melter been included in favor of say when i m sixty four all signs point to a positive affirmation in 2006 only a northern song was ranked 75th in mojos list 101 greatest beatles songs where glenn described it as a wonderfully unexpected tune and suggested that harrison s lovely and sardonic lyric could be inspiration for a thousand rutles songs while commenting on yellow submarines status as beatles only inessential album richie unterberger of allmusic describes only a northern song as an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz mixing and some personal comments referring to revelations offered in song unterberger adds they present harrison s vision of how music and recording sounded from inside out and outside in during psychedelic era song thus provided a rare glimpse inside doors of perception of being a beatle or at least one aspect of being this particular beatle circa 1967 writing for billboard in 2001 bill holland grouped only a northern song with byrds so you want to be a rock n roll star and early 1970s releases by kinks and joni mitchell as songs that constitute first wave of musical statements in which artists accuse or indict their industry s business policies ian inglis views only a northern song as beatles first postmodern song due to deliberate ironic intent evident in subject matter and in use of tape effects and scattered conversation other versions an alternative edit of song was included on beatles anthology 2 out takes compilation in 1996 slightly sped up and mixed in stereo this version comprises basic track without most of april 1967 overdubs and with a vocal take that contains some changes to lyrics according to unterberger aside from lyrics anthology 2 version demonstrates that only a northern song was much more like a standard rock song before fanciful overdubs of trumpet and other strained far coinciding with popularity of it s all too much among acid rock bands of early 1990s sun dial released a cover of only a northern song as b side of their 1991 single fireball in 2009 greg davis and jazz singer songwriter chris weisman named their psychedelic folk partnership northern songs after beatles track pair s 2010 album northern
