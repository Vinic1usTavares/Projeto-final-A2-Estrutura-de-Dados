since she was first to call him orin production development concept of aquaman stemmed from a fifth season episode of smallville aqua episode featured arthur curry alan ritchson coming to smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by luthorcorp aqua became highest rated episode for smallville that season but it was never meant to be a backdoor pilot for an aquaman series however as work progressed on aqua character was recognized to have potential for his own series miles millar and alfred gough creators of smallville also considered a series featuring lois lane but felt more confident about aquaman millar said aquaman was first idea where we really thought we had a franchise where we could see 100 episodes alan ritchson was not considered for role in new series because gough and millar did not consider it a spin off from smallville gough said in november 2005 series is going to be a different version of aquaman legend gough did express idea of a crossover with smallville at some point there was initial speculation that show s title would not be aquaman tempest keys and mercy reef were rumored to be working titles for series show would eventually be listed as aquaman when it was later released on itunes greg beeman who has produced and directed episodes of smallville was hired to direct pilot casting role of arthur curry was originally given to will toale after gough and millar saw over 400 candidates from england australia canada and united states before filming began toale was replaced with justin hartley a cw spokesman said we have made decision to go in a different direction with aquaman role and wish toale best of luck in all of his endeavors graham bentz was cast as a young arthur curry while adrianne palicki was cast as a siren named nadia ving rhames amber mcdonald denise quinones rick peters and lou diamond phillips filled in rest of regular cast members thumb staff sergeant leo castellano teaches two actors how to salute

location at homestead joint air reserve base adjacent to homestead florida fighter wing airmen were used as extras while filming at base along with several of their fighter aircraft production was expected to continue in june of that year had it been given greenlight some of actors received training from staff sergeant leo castellano on proper way to present arms much of filming took place underwater hartley filmed his underwater scenes without a tank breathing from safety divers tanks around him for scenes out on ocean hartley had never been scuba diving and was not a diver but did say that he was a good swimmer entity fx firm which did special effects for smallville since its second season was contracted to work on aquaman pilot arthur s powers hartley explained that arthur would be aware of his powers at beginning of series and would have no problem using them for personal gain hartley felt this played against typical superheroes because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities gough explained a c would be able to swim faster than humans breathe underwater as well as have super strength while underwater he also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers extent of his speed is shown in pilot when arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him extent of a c s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon but he is seen swimming near bottom of ocean near start of pilot when a c is talking to eva about releasing captive dolphins he tells her that he felt as though dolphins were somehow calling to him in comics one of aquaman s powers is ability to communicate with sea life gough likened a c s not having access to water to clark s growing weakness around kryptonite in smallville if a c does not get water he will dehydrate and weaken water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land release pilot was considered to have a good chance of being picked up but ultimately cw passed on show discussing excitement surrounding project lou diamond phillips said funny thing about aquaman project is that there s so much buzz about it already which is amazing i mean you don t usually get that with a pilot because they re sort of sight unseen there were reports of two wb pilots in contention for new cw network one being aquaman which was a frontrunner on may 18 2006 when cw announced its fall lineup aquaman was not on list dawn ostroff cw s president of entertainment stated that it was still a midseason contender gough and miller were so passionate about pilot that they wanted it released in some form so fans could see it gough said in an interview implication when a network doesn t pick up a show is that pilot sucks and that s not case it s not a perfect pilot by any stretch of imagination there are other reasons which are a mystery to us as to why cw didn t pick it up he mentioned a potential release as an extended episode during sixth season of smallville on july 24
