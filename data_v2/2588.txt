blacktip reef shark carcharhinus melanopterus is a species of requiem shark in family carcharhinidae easily identified by prominent black tips on its fins especially on first dorsal fin and its caudal fin among most abundant sharks inhabiting tropical coral reefs of indian and pacific oceans this species prefers shallow inshore waters its exposed first dorsal fin is a common sight in region blacktip reef shark is usually found over reef ledges and sandy flats though it has also been known to enter brackish and freshwater environments it typically attains a length of blacktip reef shark has extremely small home ranges and exhibits strong site fidelity remaining within same local area for up to several years at a time it is an active predator of small bony fishes cephalopods and crustaceans and has also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds accounts of blacktip reef shark s life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory in part reflecting geographical differences within species like other members of its family this shark is viviparous with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial annual or possibly biannual cycle reports of gestation period range from 7 9 through 10 11 to possibly 16 months mating is preceded by male following closely behind female likely attracted by her chemical signals newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide timid and skittish blacktip reef shark is difficult to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food however people wading through shallow water are at risk of having their legs mistakenly bitten this shark is used for its meat fins and liver oil but is not considered to be a commercially significant species international union for conservation of nature has assessed blacktip reef shark as near threatened although species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common overfishing of this slow reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales taxonomy thumb left alt view from above of a brown shark with a rounded snout swimming over algae covered rocks a blacktip reef shark in solomon islands french naturalists jean rene constant quoy and joseph paul gaimard originally described blacktip reef shark during 1817 1820 exploratory voyage of corvette uranie in 1824 their account was published as part of voyage autour du monde sur les corvettes de s m l uranie et la louis de freycinet s 13 volume report on voyage type specimen was a long juvenile male caught off island of waigeo west of new guinea quoy and gaimard chose name carcharias melanopterus from greek melas meaning black and pteron meaning fin or wing in reference to this shark s prominent fin markings subsequent authors moved blacktip reef shark to genus carcharhinus in 1965 international commission on zoological nomenclature designated it as type species for genus in some earlier literature scientific name of this shark was mistakenly given as c spallanzani now recognized as a synonym of spottail shark c sorrah other common names for this species include reef shark black finned shark blacktip shark reef blacktip shark and phylogeny like most other members of its genus phylogenetic position of blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate based on morphology jack garrick proposed in 1982 that closest relative of blacktip reef shark was nervous shark c cautus garrick j a f 1982 sharks of genus carcharhinus noaa technical report nmfs circ 445 leonard compagno s 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and nervous shark but also four other species and could not resolve their relationships further a 1998 allozyme analysis by gavin naylor again yielded ambiguous results finding that blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy irresolvable group with 10 other carcharhinus species distribution and habitat thumb left alt a small shark swimming over a sandy flat with reef rocks in background and water surface above blacktip reef shark prefers shallow inshore waters blacktip reef shark is found throughout nearshore waters of tropical and subtropical indo pacific in indian ocean it occurs from south africa to red sea including madagascar mauritius and seychelles and from there eastward along coast of indian subcontinent to southeast asia including sri lanka andaman islands and maldives in pacific ocean it is found from southern china and philippines to indonesia northern australia and new caledonia and also inhabits numerous oceanic islands including marshall gilbert society and hawaiian islands and tuamotu contrary to what most sources state there is a report suggesting that specimens of this species from japanese waters might be from taiwan however a number of sightings and captures of this species have been reported from inshore waters of ishigaki island of okinawa prefecture in southern japan a lessepsian migrant this shark has colonized eastern mediterranean sea by way of suez canal although it has been reported from a depth of blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed younger sharks prefer shallow sandy flats while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop offs this species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in madagascar and freshwater environments in malaysia though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to same degree as bull shark c leucas at aldabra in indian ocean blacktip reef sharks congregate in channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to mangroves when water rises there is equivocal evidence that sharks from northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory description a robustly built species with a streamlined typical shark form blacktip reef shark has a short wide rounded snout and moderately large oval eyes each nostril has a flap of skin in front that is expanded into a nipple shaped lobe not counting small symphysial central teeth tooth rows

grey reef shark c amblyrhinchos and whitetip reef shark triaenodon obesus blacktip reef shark is one of three most common sharks inhabiting coral reefs in indo pacific this species predominates in shallow habitats while other two are mostly found deeper fast swimming and active blacktip reef shark may be encountered alone or in small groups large social aggregations have also been observed for most part juvenile and adult sharks are not segregated by sex save for movements of pregnant females to give birth individuals exhibit strong fidelity to particular areas where they may remain for several years a tracking study off palmyra atoll in central pacific has found blacktip reef shark has a home range of around among smallest of any shark species size and location of range does not change with time of day within this range 3 17 of area constitute favored hunting patches that are disproportionately occupied by resident shark sharks spend most of their time swimming back and forth along reef ledges making occasional short forays onto sandy flats their average swimming speed decreases when tide rises at night possibly because influx of cooler water reduces their metabolism or accompanying movement of prey fishes makes foraging easier blacktip reef sharks at aldabra tend to be more mobile than those at palmyra with recorded individual movements of up to over 7 hours blacktip reef sharks particularly small individuals fall prey to larger fishes including groupers grey reef sharks tiger sharks galeocerdo cuvier and members of their own species at palmyra atoll adults avoid patrolling tiger sharks by staying out of central deeper lagoon their known parasites include tapeworms anthobothrium otobothrium alexanderi and a in genus and monogenean one of few documented examples of infectious disease in a shark was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a blacktip reef shark caused by bacterium aeromonas salmonicida subsp salmonicida feeding thumb upright 1 2 left alt many black tipped dorsal fins visible above churning water and a small fish mid jump at upper center primary food of blacktip reef shark is small fish such as mullet as often most abundant apex predator within its ecosystem blacktip reef shark plays a major role in structuring inshore ecological communities its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes including mullet groupers jacks mojarras wrasses and smelt whitings groups of blacktip reef sharks in indian ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against shore for easier feeding squid octopus cuttlefish shrimp and mantis shrimp are also taken as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays though this is rare off northern australia this species is known to consume sea snakes including granulatus darwiniensis spp and sharks off palmyra atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into water miscellaneous items that have been found inside stomachs of this species include algae turtle grass coral hydrozoa bryozoa rats and stones researchers working at enewetak atoll in marshall islands have found blacktip reef shark can be readily attracted by splashing or striking metal tools against hard objects underwater as well as by scent of both healthy and injured fish as with most sharks blacktip reef shark does not have any cone cells in its retina limiting its ability to discriminate colors and fine details instead its vision is adapted for sensitivity to movement or contrast under low light conditions which is further enhanced by presence of a reflective tapetum lucidum experiments have shown that this shark is capable of detecting small objects up to away but is unable to clearly discern shape of object electroreception is another means by which this shark can locate prey its ampullae of lorenzini have a sensitivity of approximately 4 nv cm and an effective range of similar to grey reef shark this species becomes more excited and confident in presence of other individuals of its species and in extreme situations can be roused into a feeding frenzy feeding activity may be greater at night than during day life history thumb upright 1 2 alt two sharks swimming in same direction one behind other in front of a massive coral head and a bed of boulders blacktip reef sharks follow each other as a prelude to mating like other members of its family blacktip reef shark is viviparous though details of its life history vary across its range its reproductive cycle is annual off northern australia with mating taking place from january to february as well as off moorea in french polynesia where mating occurs from november to march cycle is biennial off aldabra where intense competition within and between species for food may constrain females to only bearing young every other year earlier accounts from indian ocean by johnson 1978 madagascar by 1961 and red sea by gohar and mazhar 1964 indicated a biannual cycle in these regions with two breeding seasons per year from june to july and december to january if accurate shorter reproductive cycles of these subpopulations may be a consequence of warmer water when receptive to mating a female blacktip reef shark swims slowly in a sinusoidal pattern near bottom with her head pointed down observations in wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them once male finds her he closes to around and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent a courting male may also bite female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins these mating wounds heal completely after 4 6 weeks after a period of synchronous swimming male pushes female on her side and positions her so her head is against bottom and her tail is raised once female is in position male inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca copulation lasts for several minutes after which sharks separate and resume their regular behavior off moorea individual older females mate and give birth at a consistent time every year often to within a week s precision whereas younger females exhibit more variability in their timing younger females are also more likely to fail to become pregnant after mating thumb left alt an expanse of clear water and white sand and several sharks swimming with their black tipped dorsal fins protruding above

reef shark than waders under most circumstances blacktip reef shark has a timid demeanor and is easily frightened away by swimmers however its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous as of early 2009 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total none fatal were listed on international shark attack file that are attributable to blacktip reef shark isaf statistics on attacking species of shark international shark attack file florida museum of natural history university of florida retrieved on may 18 2009 most attacks involve sharks biting legs or feet of waders apparently mistaking them for their natural prey and do not result in serious injury in marshall islands native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow water and a way of discouraging these sharks is to submerge one s body blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive in presence of bait and may pose a threat while attempting to steal catches of spear fishers blacktip reef shark is a normal catch of coastal fisheries such as those operating off thailand and india but is not targeted or considered commercially important meat sold fresh frozen dried and salted or smoked for human consumption liver oil and fins are used international union for conservation of nature has assessed blacktip reef shark as near threatened though it remains widespread and common overall substantial local declines due to overfishing have now been documented in many areas this species has a low reproductive rate limiting its capacity for recovering from depletion blacktip reef sharks are popular subjects of public aquarium exhibits because of their stereotypically shark like appearance ability to breed in captivity and modest size and are also attractions for ecotourism divers references external links carcharhinus melanopterus blacktip reef shark at fishbase carcharhinus
