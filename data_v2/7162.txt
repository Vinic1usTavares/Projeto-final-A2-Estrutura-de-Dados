singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law see also in august 2008 rais said malaysia took view that singapore was not

withdrawal on 2 february 2017 malaysia applied to icj pursuant to article 61 of statute of icj for revision of 2008 judgment on basis of three documents it had obtained from national archives of uk between august 2016 and january 2017 documents were internal correspondence of singapore s colonial government in 1958 an incident report submitted by a british naval officer in same year and a 1960s map of naval operations bearing annotations malaysian government said that these documents indicated that officials at highest levels in british colonial and singaporean administration appreciated that pedra branca pulau batu puteh did not form part of singapore s sovereign territory during relevant period however according to shahriman lockman a senior analyst at malaysia s institute of strategic and international studies there s very little precedent for revisions to icj judgments reports suggest that timing of application coincides with upcoming elections in malaysia as ruling barisan nasional coalition which is currently under pressure over imdb scandal could use renewed legal fight over pedra branca as a means to show it was best placed to display strong leadership in country s foreign policy so as to safeguard malaysia s sovereignty singapore s foreign ministry said that a team including attorney general lucien wong and chan sek keong s jayakumar and tommy koh who had represented singapore at original icj hearing had been appointed to study and respond to claim on 5 february 2017 law and home affairs minister k shanmugam commented that on a cursory examination of documents without detailed legal advice he did not see how documents would make any difference to icj s judgment on 30 jun 2017 malaysia applied to icj to request for an interpretation of icj s 2008 judgment this application is separate and autonomous from 2 feb application for revision of same judgment application invokes article 60 of statute of court and article 98 of rules of court according to malaysian attorney general mohamed apandi ali malaysia and singapore set up a joint technical committee jtc for implementation of 2008 icj judgment according to malaysia jtc reached an impasse in november 2013 as both parties had been unable to agree over meaning of 2008 judgement as it concerns south ledge and waters surrounding pedra branca explaining malaysia s position malaysian attorney general apandi said malaysia considers that it is necessary to request an interpretation of 2008 judgement from icj as it would serve as a basis for maintenance of orderly and peaceful relations between parties in management of their respective maritime zones and airspace in future singapore s ministry of foreign affairs mfa noted in a press statement that icj s judgement was final and without appeal as well as clear and unambiguous as a result mfa said malaysia s request for icj to interpret judgement is puzzling singapore will therefore oppose malaysia s application for interpretation which we consider to be both unnecessary and without merit on 28 may 2018 malaysian government withdrew its application for review a move which was welcomed by singapore s mfa thereby discontinuing case before icj furthermore statute of international court of justice only allows an application for review to be done within 10 years after 23 may 2008 judgement which means further applications for review will no longer be possible on 25 june 2019 malaysia s prime minister mahathir mohamad reiterated malaysia s acceptance of ruling citing it as an example of how asean member
