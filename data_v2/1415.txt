international emergency medicine is a subspecialty of emergency medicine that focuses not only on global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout world term international emergency medicine generally refers to transfer of skills and knowledge including knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital care from developed emergency medical systems emss to those systems which are less developed however this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic given international nature of medicine and number of physicians working internationally from this point of view international emergency medicine is better described as training required for and reality of practicing specialty outside of one s native country emergency medicine has been a recognized medical specialty in united states and other developed countries for nearly forty years although these countries emss did not become fully mature until early 1990s at that point some of its practitioners turned their attention from developing specialty at home to developing it abroad leading to birth of international emergency medicine they began to support growth of emergency medicine worldwide doing so through conferences national and regional emergency medicine organizations relief and development organizations international emergency medicine fellowships physician exchanges information transfer and curriculum development most developing countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty to develop accreditation mechanisms and to promote development of emergency medicine training programs their interest is a result of improved healthcare increasing urbanization aging populations rising number of traffic fatalities and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens in addition emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time sensitive illnesses as well as improving public health through vaccinations interventions training and data collection countries that lack mature emss are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so that they will be able to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine some challenges faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non existent training programs a lack of adequate emergency transport a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend resources they devote to emergency medicine additionally standards and methods used in countries with mature emss are not always suited for use in developing countries due to a lack of infrastructure shortage of funds or local demographics ambulances developed country standard are costly and not practical for road conditions present in many countries instead a variety of modes of transportation are used furthermore in place of expensive medication and equipment developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health evidence based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition background definition most commonly accepted definition of international emergency medicine is that it is area of emergency medicine concerned with development of emergency medicine in other countries in that definition other countries refers to nations that do not have a mature emergency care system exemplified by board certified emergency physicians and academic emergency medicine among other things included in those nations are some that are otherwise quite developed but lack a complete emergency medical system such as armenia china israel nicaragua and philippines work in international emergency medicine can be broken down into two main categories 1 promotion of emergency medicine as a recognized and established specialty in other countries and 2 provision of humanitarian assistance william burdick mark and kenneth have criticized above definition as oxymoronic given international nature of medicine and number of physicians working internationally from that point of view international emergency medicine is not solely about development of emergency medical systems but is instead better described as training required for and reality of practicing specialty outside of one s native country history emergency medicine emergency medicine is a specialty that was first developed in united states in 1960s for united states high number of traffic and other accident fatalities in 1960s spurred a white paper from national academy of sciences it exposed inadequacy of current emergency medical system and led to establishment of modern emergency medical services united kingdom australia canada hong kong and singapore followed shortly thereafter developing their respective emergency medicine systems in 1970s and 1980s beginning of subspecialty by early 1990s emergency medicine systems emss in united states united kingdom australia canada hong kong and singapore were largely mature leading some practitioners to focus on developing specialty in other countries thus international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in 1990s although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals had taken place in late 1980s there were several reasons for heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad one was contrast between emss of their countries and emss of other countries another was revolutions of 1989 overthrowing authoritarian regimes which facilitated spread of new ideas such as emergency medicine two international emergency medicine conferences were launched in 1980s international conference on emergency medicine icem and world association for disaster and emergency medicine conference wadem icem was founded by international federation of emergency medicine while wadem was started by an organization of same name additionally in 1990s various national and regional emergency medicine organizations began supporting development of specialty in other countries including american college of emergency physicians european society for emergency medicine and asian society of emergency medicine thumb loma linda university s medical center in 1994 loma linda university established first international emergency medicine fellowship in world furthermore countries without mature emss began taking more interest in developing them one reason for this interest was overall improvement in healthcare in these countries another was increasing urbanization taking place worldwide and corresponding shift of focus from infectious diseases to trauma and cardiorespiratory diseases which are better managed by emergency medicine than prevention in addition to these developments aging population in many countries has led to an increased need for emergency medical services also american popular culture particularly television shows and demonstrated success of emergency medicine in countries with mature emss both led public in many countries to expect better emergency medical care international emergency medicine organizations whether focused on relief or development have also contributed to growth of subspecialty relief organizations such as doctors without borders or serve countries that do not have mature emss when health catastrophes occur these organizations also serve to enhance specialty s image in international public eye some development organizations such as emergency international or international federation for emergency medicine help establish and develop emergency care systems in other countries by providing ongoing educational and organizational assistance emergency medicine in developing world motor vehicle crashes were a major factor that led to development of emergency medicine in united states united kingdom australia canada hong kong and singapore and they are a major factor leading countries to develop their own emergency medical systems today such crashes represent a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults with majority of deaths occurring in developing world in recent decades while traffic fatalities have declined in industrialized nations they have been on rise in developing ones furthermore developing nations tend to have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of vehicles for various reasons including lower safety standards for vehicles lack of available emergency care in many developing countries only serves to exacerbate this problem this higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite fact that there are fewer cars in asia and africa than in west odero et al argue that this shows a need to improve emergency medical care thumb motor vehicle accidents such as this one are more likely to be fatal in developing countries than in developed ones emergency medical care applies to other acute health problems as well many illnesses with time sensitive elements are common in developing countries including severe infections hypoxia caused by respiratory infections dehydration caused by diarrhoea intentional and unintentional injuries postpartum bleeding and acute myocardial infarction these are potentially life threatening conditions yet effective treatment is often unavailable for much of world s population for instance a 2008 study of medical systems in zambia published by international anesthesia research society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind furthermore only 29 intensive care beds were available in all of hospitals surveyed and these were only found in major hospitals this implies that majority of critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards anderson et al argue that aside from acute care emergency medicine can also play a significant role in public health vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data because of high number of patients emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation initial symptoms and it serves as first line of defense in disaster scenarios models of emergency care there are two primary models of emergency medicine anglo american model which relies on bringing patient to hospital and franco german model which operates through bringing hospital to patient thus in anglo american model patient is rapidly transported by non physician providers to definitive care such as an emergency department in a hospital conversely franco german approach has a physician often an anesthesiologist come to patient and provide stabilizing care in field patient is then directly to appropriate department of a hospital anglo american model is seen in nations such as australia canada ireland new zealand united kingdom and united states while franco german model is found in european countries such as austria france germany poland portugal and russia most developing emergency medical systems including those of china japan philippines south korea and taiwan have been established along anglo american lines but little work exists to establish advantage of either system jeffrey arnold and james holliman have criticized use of these descriptors for emergency medical systems as an oversimplification and a needless source of controversy instead arnold and holliman have proposed that other groupings be used such as classifying emergency medical systems as following a specialty or multidisciplinary model specialty systems would include those with physicians dedicated to emergency medicine whereas multidisciplinary systems would encompass those that rely on physicians from other disciplines to provide emergency care such an approach would seek to categorize pre hospital care separately from in hospital systems within arnold and holliman s understanding of emergency care models there is also an acknowledgement that current western models may be inadequate in context of developing nations for instance a cost benefit analysis found that creating an ems system in kuala lumpur that met u s standards for cardiac arrest response 85 percent of patients receive within 6 minutes would cost us 2 5 million and only save four neurologically intact lives per year primary variable responsible for that result is relatively young demography of kuala lumpur meaning that comparatively few cardiac related deaths occur thumb an ambulance like this one is too expensive and impractical for use in many developing countries an example of a developing nation establishing its own model of emergency medicine may be seen in southern brazil elements of both of major conventional models have been incorporated with ems system following french influences and ambulances being staffed by physicians while an american approach to emergency medical residency training is also present role in overall health system developed countries in developed counties training programs specifically relating to international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies curriculum that should be covered by such programs has been subject of much discussion patient care medical knowledge practice based learning communication skills professionalism and system based practice are basic six competencies required of programs approved by accreditation council for graduate medical education but application of these goals can take many forms breadth of skills needed in international emergency medicine make it unlikely that one standardized program could fulfill training needs for every scenario one australian study found that primary topics covered by u s fellowship programs were emergency medicine systems development humanitarian relief disaster management public health travel and field medicine program administration and academic skills its authors argue that attempting to cover all of those areas may be unrealistic and that a more targeted focus on acquiring necessary skills might be more productive after such training is completed or even without any ems training working in or visiting other nations is one way physicians can participate in international emergency medicine some physicians choose to pursue their careers overseas while others opt for shorter trips for example a team of u s physicians spent seven months helping establish a new emergency department and emergency residency program in hangzhou china such exchanges can be mutually beneficial for instance 23 to 28 percent of all physicians in australia united states united kingdom and canada received their training at medical schools outside of country in which they currently practice developing countries thumb according to alagappan et al africa is continent most in need of developing emergency medical systems experience of international emergency medicine in developing countries is in some ways opposite of that of developed ones as of 2000s developing countries are attempting to establish effective systems of care and recognized specialty programs with assistance from health care providers from developed world in 2005 there were only a few countries with advanced emergency medical systems and a far greater number 50 that were in process of developing those systems process of development usually begins in academia and patient care followed by administrative and economic concerns and finally health policy and agendas given limited resources of many developing nations funding vitally effects how emergency medicine fits into health system preventive care is a crucial part of healthcare in developing countries and it may be difficult to budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources this is a particular problem for poorer nations such as zambia which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 us dollars in 2003 regardless of amount of preventive care available health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur and emergency medical programs could increase access to care kobusingye et al argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive particularly if developing countries focus on low cost but effective treatments administered by first responders kobusingye olive hyder adnan david hicks eduardo mock charles joshipura j 2005 emergency medical systems in low and middle income countries recommendations for action world health organization initiatives to expand emergency medicine curriculum development hobgood et al argue that one key component in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems is to identify aspects of training that are essential for health care providers in their view a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues even if countries have very different needs and resources to address this goal international federation for emergency medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009 this initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to specific needs of various nations implementing training in emergency medicine it is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians regardless of their specialty transferring knowledge countries with decades of experience in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack thus there exists considerable opportunity for transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person for instance international emergency medicine fellowship at university of toronto sent a three person team to cluj napoca romania to promote local development of emergency medicine an assessment of present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow staffing staff education equipment medication and supplies and infection control practices following these designations plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented partially through international exchange trips another conduit for transfer of knowledge is international conference on emergency medicine a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency physicians by international federation for emergency medicine ifem in 2012 conference took place in dublin ireland organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations american college of emergency physicians british association for emergency medicine canadian association of emergency physicians and australasian college for emergency medicine conference rotated between founding members until 2010 when it was held in singapore many new members have been accepted since mid 1990s when ifem decided to open up membership to other nations emergency medicine organizations conference will rotate to them as well for instance in 2014 conference will be hosted in hong kong and in 2016 it will be held in cape town south africa there are other conferences on international emergency medicine as well including one that world association for disaster and emergency medicine wadem has held every two years since 1987 however wadem focuses more on disaster medicine than emergency medicine system development and many of its member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine additionally european society for emergency medicine eusem has hosted an annual conference since 1998 eusem also publishes european journal of emergency medicine develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards for european countries and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in san marino asian society for emergency medicine asian society which was founded in 1998 holds its own biennial conference in addition to that asian society like eusem develops curriculum recommendations for asian countries developing emergency medicine as a specialty one way to advance emergency medical care is to obtain recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it without such recognition it is difficult to set up training programs or recruit potential students as they face uncertainty of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them recognition increases visibility and prestige of profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development botswana may serve as a case study its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by creation of botswana society for emergency care establishment of a resuscitation training centre and a trauma research centre at university of botswana and formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre hospital care an alternate route for developing emergency medicine is to provide additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine this has benefit of being more rapid to implement as physicians already trained in other areas can add necessary emergency skills to their repertoire however after initial expansion it is difficult for emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy as retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine challenges training educational opportunities in emergency medicine are not available in many countries and even when present they are often in their infancy botswana opened its first medical school in 2009 with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011 program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year limitations on in country training mean that program includes six months of training at an international site organization of program is modeled on south africa s program due to similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and eagerness of college of emergency medicine of south africa and emergency medicine society of south africa to support expansion of emergency medicine two years of clinical practice are required before entering residency program as in south african and australian approaches to deal with this shortage of educational opportunities scott weiner et al suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training trainers this he believes is a sustainable approach to promote development of emergency medicine worldwide it works by sending developed country health care workers to equip a small group of trainees with necessary skills to then go on and teach concepts to others as such it may be able to leverage insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable as newly trained trainers continue to spread knowledge tuscan emergency medicine initiative is an example with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists emergency transport limitations on resources available in developing countries are particularly evident in area of emergency transport ambulances developed country standard are costly and not practical for road conditions present in many countries indeed there may be no roads at all one study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats canoes bicycles with trailers tricycles with platforms tractors with trailers reconditioned vehicles and ox carts were used for emergency transport in more advanced developing countries establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible but still requires considerable expertise and planning prior to 2004 pakistan did not have an organized emergency medical system in that year rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre hospital emergency service and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes comparable to that of developed nations some of critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians adopting training materials to local context and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure resources vital nature of coping with lack of resources available in international emergency medicine may be seen in proportion of scientific articles that grapple with topic of top 27 articles identified by a review of international emergency medicine literature from 2010 14 were classified as dealing with practice of emergency medicine in resource constrained environments a new dimension of thought is that of isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in world journal of surgery by mihir shah et al topics covered included use of tape as best estimate for children s weight green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea and as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available lack of research despite thought that increasing availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim even in developed countries between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published implying that much of current standard of care rests upon meager support a similar lack of direct proof exists for effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries although it may seem that such efforts must improve health failure to quantify international emergency medicine s impact renders it more difficult to identify best practices and target areas in which most benefit may be achieved a development in recent years that seeks to address these issues has been termed evidence based medicine as its name suggests this approach strives to rigorously study effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition jeffrey arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries thus advancing current standard of emergency care references category emergency medicine
