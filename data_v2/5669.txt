world war i serbia was defeated during autumn 1915 phase of serbian campaign prompting france and britain to transfer troops from gallipoli campaign to greek macedonia macedonian front was thus established in an effort to support remnants of serbian army to conquer vardar macedonia on 17 august 1916 in struma offensive bulgaria invaded greece easily conquering all greek territory east of struma since greek army was ordered not to resist by pro german king constantine surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in second balkan war of 1913 was last straw for many supporters of liberal party politician eleftherios venizelos with allied assistance they launched a coup which secured thessaloniki and most of greek macedonia causing national schism in june 1917 venizelists gained full control of country immediately declaring war on central powers and joining allied army of orient operating on balkan front greek entry into war along with 24 division reinforcements that army had received in spring of same year had created a strategic advantage for entente on 30 may 1918 allies launched an offensive on heavily fortified skra salient commencing battle of skra di utilizing cover of heavy artillery a franco hellenic force made a rapid push into enemy trenches conquering skra and surrounding system of fortifications greek casualties amounted to 434 440 killed in

number of german engineers and artillery specialists that served in bulgarian units considerable amounts of military equipment also fell into entente hands plan for a bulgarian counterattack against skra remained unfulfilled as bulgarian soldiers refused to take part in operation both greek and french press used opportunity to extol efforts of greek army favorably influencing greek mobilization fall of skra prompted bulgarian prime minister vasil to resign on 21 june 1918 aleksandar who assumed office immediately afterwards pursued secret negotiations with britain offering bulgaria s exit from war with condition that bulgaria fully retain eastern macedonia however british prime minister david lloyd george rejected proposal assuring greek ambassador in london ioannis gennadius that britain would not act against greek interests in late july 1918 bulgarian commander in chief nikola zhekov sent german field marshal paul von hindenburg a message regarding a rumored entente offensive and detailed bulgaria s inability to adequately defend vardar portion of front zhekov requested that germany immediately reinforce balkan front hinting that austria hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in albania on 17 august hindenburg pledged to provide bulgaria with support once situation on other front permits it hindenburg s reluctance to support bulgaria was also manifested by early september redeployment of last german jager battalion stationed in macedonia back into germany bulgarians using information from escaped prisoners of war determined that entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake ohrid in monastir dobro pole or human on 27 august 2nd and 3rd bulgarian divisions stationed at dobro pole were ordered to make emergency preparations as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on dobro pole along with a secondary attack on human by 7 september dobro pole was reinforced by one machine gun company six battalions and ten heavy howitzers head of army group scholtz general friedrich von scholtz then stated that defensive measures made defense of front feasible scholtz had failed to take into account departure of bulgarian chief of staff nikola zhekov and his subsequent replacement by georgi todorov widespread insubordination and desertions also plagued bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works poor rations and fatigue contributed to low morale a day prior to entente offensive general louis franchet d esperey laid out final plan for operation first phase consisted of a combined franco serbian attack on positions of 2nd and 3rd bulgarian divisions which was expected to create a breach of front line in area of dobro pole while also posing a danger to bulgarian supply lines on river vardar dobro pole good field peak dominated region providing excellent observation points for defenders dobro pole was surrounded by a well developed system of trenches which in combination with rough terrain made area impassable for wheeled transport dobro pole was however lower and less steep than mountains on other parts of front that averaged a second anglo franco hellenic force would then attack bulgarian 1st army between vardar river and lake doiran preventing it from forming new defensive positions in area initial advance would allow armee d orient to progress in support of other units first to prilep and in meantime an anglo hellenic force would strike mount belasica occupying rupel pass doiran sector had previously been subject to two major entente offensives known as first battle of doiran august 1916 and second battle of doiran april may 1917 both engagements ended in decisive bulgarian victories forcing allies to limit their operations to small raids and harassing fire between 1916 and july 1918 bulgarian defenses around doiran underwent a period of considerable reorganization under personal supervision of general vladimir vazov sector was divided into two defensive areas protected by mountain division and 9th infantry division respectively bulgaria established combat security outposts at a distance of from enemy trenches while also reinforcing defenses of dominant dub and kala tepe mountains similarly to dobro pole defenses consisted of a series of mutually supporting trenches with built in observation posts machine gun positions and artillery pieces d esperey expected to march allied army of orient through towns of demir hisar rupel gradec stip and finally seizing skopje units stationed at and would prevent a bulgarian flanking maneuver while main body of force would widen breach both in stip and prilep in case of a collapse of front between dobro pole and bulgarian 1st army and german 11th army armies would either be annihilated or in less favorable circumstances perform an organised retreat to a new defensive line on river crna prevention of such a retreat was to be achieved by a rapid
