prudential insurance now vice chairman of lions gate entertainment after showing him script at sundance according to babbit their one sentence pitch was two high school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp burns gave them an initial budget of us 500 000 which was increased to us 1 million when film went into production conception babbit whose mother runs a halfway house called new directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and 12 step program after reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself she decided to combine two ideas with girlfriend andrea sperling she came up with idea for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp they wanted main character to be a cheerleader because it is pinnacle of american dream and american dream of femininity babbit wanted film to represent lesbian experience from femme perspective to contrast with several films of time that represented butch perspective for example go fish and watermelon woman she also wanted to satirize both religious right and gay community not feeling qualified to write script herself babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of usc school of cinematic arts brian wayne peterson peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for sex offenders he has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people but also make people get angry and talk about issues it raised set and costume design thumb alt three young women and three young men stand in a line with an older woman and an older man one young woman stands behind rest with her back to a bright pink van women wear vivid pink

placard throws a rock in front of her true directions campers picket ex ex gays intense colors were intended to show artificiality of gender construction babbit says that her influences for look and feel of film included john waters david lachapelle edward scissorhands and barbie she wanted production and costume design to reflect themes of story there is a progression from organic world of megan s hometown where dominant colors are orange and brown to fake world of true directions dominated by intense blues and pinks which are intended to show artificiality of gender construction according to babbit character of mary brown represents aids paranoia and her clean ordered world is filled with plastic flowers fake sky and pvc outfits external shots of colorful house complete with a bright pink picket fence were filmed in palmdale california casting babbit recruited clea duvall who had starred in her short film sleeping beauties to play role of graham eaton babbit says that she was able to get a lot of cast through duvall including natasha lyonne and melanie lynskey lyonne first saw script in back of duvall s car and subsequently contacted her agent about it she had seen and enjoyed babbit s short sleeping beauties and was eager to work with director she was not first choice for role of megan an unnamed actress wanted to play part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs she did not want her family to see her face on poster babbit briefly considered rosario dawson as megan but her executive producer persuaded her that dawson who is hispanic would not be right for all american character babbit made a conscious effort to cast people of color for minor roles in an effort to combat what she describes as racism at every level of making movies from beginning she intended characters of mike played by rupaul dolph dante basco and andre douglas spain to be african american asian and hispanic respectively she initially considered arsenio hall for character of mike but says that hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay themed role as mike rupaul makes a rare film appearance out of drag themes alt two young women face forwards standing over a

pushes other woman who has long light brown hair and also leans over doll thumb graham and megan attempt to reinforce their gender roles through performing traditional female tasks but i m a cheerleader is not only about sexuality but also gender and social construction of gender roles one of ways in which babbit highlighted what she called artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design chris holmlund in contemporary american independent film notes this feature of film and calls costumes gender tuned ted in out magazine wrote that costumes and colors of film show how false goals of true directions are gender roles are further reinforced by tasks campers have to perform in step 2 rediscovering your gender identity nikki sullivan in a critical introduction to queer theory says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality sullivan says that film not only highlights ways in which gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes norms and truths about heteronormative society and renders them strange or queer holmlund says that babbit makes straight characters less normal and less likable than gay ones sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes but i m a cheerleader an exemplification of queer theory rating and distribution when originally submitted to motion picture association of america rating board but i m a cheerleader received an nc 17 rating in order to get a commercially viable r rating babbit removed a two second shot of graham s hand sweeping megan s clothed body a camera pan up megan s body when she is masturbating and a comment that megan ate graham out slang for cunnilingus babbit was interviewed by kirby dick for his 2006 documentary film this film is not yet rated a critique of mpaa s rating system it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from board than those of male sexuality it compares this movie to american pie

of reviews is that it is a heartfelt film with good intentions but that it is flawed some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with genuine laughs roger ebert rated it three stars of four and wrote it is not a great breakout comedy but more kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on midnight cult circuit others found it obvious leaden and heavy handed writing for new york times

duvall marjorie baumgarten said that they hit right notes alexandra mendenhall writing for afterellen com felt that relationship between graham and megan having great chemistry does not get enough screen time mitchell called their love scenes tender other characters particularly males were described as offputting and nothing but stereotypes several reviewers compared film to those of director john waters but felt that it fell short of mark stephanie zacharek called it a waters knockoff while ebert said that waters might have been ruder and more polished babbit says that although waters is one of her influences she did not want her film to have bite of his she states that whereas john waters does not like romantic comedies she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story production design which was important to overall look and feel of film drew mixed responses lasalle described it as clever and and james berardinelli called it a standout feature others found it to be gaudy dated cartoonish and ghastly stephanie zacharek writing for salon com said that with regard to issues of sexual orientation and homophobia babbit is preaching to converted cynthia fuchs for com agreed stating that no one who is phobic might recognize himself in film and that audience who might benefit most from watching it either won t see film or won t see point david edelstein said that one sidedness of film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda in contrast lasalle said that picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about difficulties of growing up gay and timothy said that film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers chris holmlund said that film shows that queer identity is multi faceted using as an example scene where ex ex gays tell megan that there is no one way to be a lesbian reviews from gay media were more positive and film has undergone a critical reassessment over time as it has been understood
