photos are known to survive it is gibson s penultimate film as she reportedly suffered a mental breakdown after completing it gibson s voyage on titanic 22 year old gibson was a passenger aboard titanics maiden voyage joining ship at cherbourg in france on evening of april 10 she had been on vacation in europe with her mother when her employers eclair film company recalled her to new york city to participate in a new production on evening of sinking she was playing bridge this would have been bridge whist a predecessor to today s game in a first class saloon before retiring to cabin that she shared with her mother game was later credited with saving lives of players who had stayed up late to finish it despite it being as one american writer put it a violation of strict sabbath rules of english vessels collision with iceberg at 11 40 pm sounded to gibson like a long drawn sickening after going to investigate she fetched her mother when she saw titanics deck beginning to lift as water flooded into ship s boiler rooms two of bridge players frederic seward and william sloper accompanied gibson and her mother to lifeboats group boarded lifeboat no 7 first to be launched around 27 other people were on board boat when it was lowered at 12 40 am just over an hour after collision lifeboat s plug could not be found causing water to gush in until as gibson later put it this was remedied by volunteer contributions from lingerie of women and garments of men around 1 500 people were still aboard titanic when she sank throwing them into freezing water where they soon died of hypothermia as they struggled in water gibson heard what she described as a terrible cry that rang out from people who were thrown into sea and others who were afraid for their loved ones sinking deeply affected her according to sloper she became quite hysterical and kept repeating over and over so that people near us could hear her i ll never ride in my little grey car again occupants of lifeboat were finally rescued at 6 15 am by rms carpathia and taken to new york production right thumb film still of alec b francis left as father gibson as herself and john g adolfi as ensign jack only a few days after she returned to new york gibson began work on a film based on disaster impetus may have come from jules brulatour an eclair film company producer with whom she was having an affair according to billboard magazine he sent specially chartered tugboats and an extra relay of cameramen to film arrival of carpathia footage was spliced together with other scenes such as titanics captain edward smith on bridge of rms olympic titanics sister ship images of launch of titanic in 1911 and stock footage of icebergs on april 22 resulting newsreel was released as part of studio s animated weekly series it was an enormous success with sold out showings across america president william howard taft whose friend and military aide archibald butt was among victims of disaster received a personal copy of film success of newsreel appears to have convinced brulatour to capitalize further with a drama based on sinking he had a unique advantage a leading actress who was a survivor and eyewitness to what had happened gibson later described her decision to participate as an opportunity to pay tribute to those who gave their lives on that awful night jeffrey richards suggests that it was more likely that brulatour persuaded her that disaster offered an opportunity to advance her career filming took place at eclair s studio in fort lee new jersey and aboard a derelict transport vessel in new york harbor it was completed in only a week and entire process of filming processing and distribution took only half time normally required for a one reel film a sign of producers eagerness to get film onto screens while news of disaster was still fresh film was only ten minutes long but this was typical of time as feature films had not yet become norm instead a program typically consisted of six to eight short films each between ten and fifteen minutes long and covering a range of genres although newsreels were main vehicle for presenting current events dramas and comedies also picked up on such issues there was very little footage of titanic herself which hindered ability of newsreels to depict sinking however disaster was an obvious subject for a drama gibson was plainly still traumatized a reporter from motion picture news described her as having appearance of one whose nerves had been greatly shocked and she was said to have burst into tears during filming to add to film s air of authenticity she even wore same clothes that she was rescued in nonetheless as well as starring as miss dorothy herself in effect gibson is said to have co written script which was based around a fictionalized version of her own experiences her parents and fictional fiance ensign jack are shown waiting anxiously for her return after hearing news of disaster she arrives safely back home and recounts events of disaster in a long flashback illustrated with newsreel footage of titanic and a mockup of collision itself titanic sinks but dorothy is saved when she concludes her story her mother urges dorothy s fiance to leave navy as it is too dangerous a career jack ultimately rejects mother s advice deciding that he must do his duty for his flag and his country dorothy s father is moved by his patriotism and film ends with him blessing their marriage film s structure aimed to promote its story s authenticity and credibility through integration of newsreel footage and presence of a genuine survivor as narrator audiences had previously seen survivors of disasters only as unspeaking objects shown as part of a story told by someone else gibson by contrast was a survivor given voice as narrator of what was ostensibly her personal story release and reception right thumb in this publicity photograph gibson is attired in actual clothes she was wearing during disaster saved from titanic was released in united states on may 14 1912 and was also released internationally in united kingdom as a survivor of titanic and in germany
