their works to aid various sides of conflict dispute lasted until 1753 and involved many of london s periodicals it eventually resulted in countless essays poems and even a series of mock epic poems starting with smart s hilliad although it is unknown what actually started dispute it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported fielding or supported hill and few in between background fielding started a paper war in first issue of covent garden journal 4 january 1752 by declaring war against hack writers poetical works p 443 in response john hill claimed in london daily advertiser 9 january 1752 fielding had met with him prior to january and proposed what would be a fake paper war that would involve london writers giving blows that would not hurt and sharing advantage in silence bertelsen p 135 such a meeting between fielding and hill to discuss proposed war is believed to have occurred if it occurred on 28 december 1751 bertelsen p 149 it is known that hill met

january p 555 556 regardless of merits of hill s claim a war was soon started by third issue of covent garden journal fielding narrowed his satire upon john hill although hill fielding smart thornton kenrick murphy and smollett were all involved in dispute not all of them used their actual names instead many preferred to use pseudonyms along with attacks under their own name fielding wrote as sir alexander drawcansir hill wrote as inspector thornton wrote as madam roxanna and smart wrote as mrs mary midnight it was under these pseudonyms that various authors soon responded to fielding s attacks and to fielding s plan for a universal register office a planned center of advertisement of jobs goods for sale and other items bertelsen p 137 if this was not enough fielding started a dispute just a few months before with philip d a former employee who established competing public register office in king street covent garden who hired bonnell thorton a friend of smart to attack

column he harshly criticized smart s poems on several occasions fielding eventually left dispute after sixth issue of covent garden journal was published goldgar p 119 event although it is quite possible that first work in war was produced by smart on 29 april 1751 mahony and rizzo item 128 it is also possible that origins of dispute could be traced even further back to hill s publications between february and march 1751 fielding s first paper in war was also first issue of covent garden journal on 4 january 1752 bertelsen p 138 in it fielding attacked all of writers of grub street which brought a quick response hill responded twice and claimed that fielding was planning a fake dispute on 9 january 1752 attacked hill s piece on 15 january 1752 and thornton soon responded against fielding in have at you all or drury lane journal on 16 january 1752 during this time personal works such as fielding s amelia became targets battesin p 534 on 11 january 1752 fielding responded to hill and those who supported his view of amelia in covent garden journal by stating hill was not only one to attack work thornton wrote satires of amelia in drury lane journal thornton s satires were first published on 16 january 1752 and included a fake advertisement for a parody novel called playing off of title of fielding s parody he later parodied amelia again on 13 february 1752 in a piece called a new chapter in amelia tobias smollett joined in and published pamphlet anonymously on 15 january 1752 although there were many attacks against fielding s novel there was some support for work and an anonymous pamphlet was written to attack hill and town while praising amelia battesin p 537 on 25 january 1752 fielding defended his work again by bringing novel before imaginary court of censorial enquiry in which hill and other critics are prosecutors and it is they not amelia that are truly put on trial covent garden journal served fielding well and he used it in his pants upon hill and hill s supporters in journal piece called journal of present paper war between forces under sir alexander pants and army of grub street battesin p 555 work was modelled after jonathan swift s battle of books and fielding pretended to be a military leader that would lead english veterans against those who were compared to characters from greek and roman classics along with those from modern french literature however he changed roles on fourth issue produced on 14 january 1752 and transformed himself into a judge by february kenrick joined in and dramatized paper war in a production called fun and proceeded to defend fielding battesin p 557 charles macklin followed suit by holding a benefit on 8 april 1752 at covent garden with a two act play called covent garden theater or pasquin turn d drawcansir play portrayed fielding attacking hill and his followers town a pamphlet in london daily advertiser published on 29 january 1752 called march of lion pants links various authors involved in war and is first to introduce smart via a reference to his mrs mary midnight pseudonym although smart was not yet a participant bertelsen p 139 however smart did begin directly participating in matter 4 august 1752 with publication in midwife of a parody on hill s inspector persona bertelsen p 143 in piece smart responded to hill s attack on smart s old woman s oratory show and hill s claim that show was dead hill was quick to respond he attacked both fielding and smart in a piece published on 13 august 1752 in only issue of impertinent in work hill claimed that authors either write because they have wit or they are hungry impertinent no 1 13 august 1752 he further claimed that smart with his 25 august 1752 inspector column hill harshly criticised smart s poems on
