volcano drops although it remains active writing thumb kwee was inspired by 1883 eruption of krakatoa drama dari krakatau was written by journalist kwee tek hoay born to an ethnic chinese textile merchant and his native wife kwee had been raised in chinese culture and educated at schools that focuses on preparing students for life in a modern world as opposed to promoting tradition for its own sake by time he wrote novel kwee was an active proponent of buddhist teachings he also wrote extensively on themes relating to archipelago s indigenous population and was a keen social observer he read extensively in dutch english and malay and drew on these influences after becoming a writer his first novel hina victim of a contemptible woman was published in 1924 in 1928 kwee was asked by a friend who was hoping to establish a film company to write a sensational story which could be used as basis for a movie ongoing activity at krakatoa was foremost in author s mind and after reading edward bulwer lytton s 1834 novel last days of pompeii kwee asked himself is it impossible for one to write a drama about krakatoa owing to length of time between 1883 and 1928 eruptions kwee decided to begin his story with separation of two young siblings further elements of story were inspired by mountain dwelling baduy a group which tended to avoid outsiders and claimed to be descended from hindu kings of pajajaran kwee thought himself a realist considering it better to say things as they are than to create events out of nothing which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers are falsehoods and lies going against truth he was highly critical of contemporary writers who relied more on their fantasies than logic and truth hoping to keep his story grounded in reality kwee researched history of baduy geological formation of krakatoa and events of 1883 and 1928 in total he consulted 15 books all in english or dutch writing began on 19 march 1928 and was completed on 28 may of that year drama dari krakatau consists of sixteen chapters which were spread over 125 pages in first printing themes although kwee was a staunch supporter of realism in literature drama dari krakatau includes a degree of mysticism as evidenced by apparent connection between statue in cave and eruption of krakatoa indeed in many of his writings both fiction and non fiction kwee exhibited an interest in occult this includes writing detailed depictions of therese neumann a fasting girl from germany and omar khayyam a persian sufi mystic philosopher and poet indonesian literary critic jakob sumardjo finds mystical elements and fact that no hindu era statues with inscriptions have been found detract from overall value of novel kwee s work is earliest of three chinese malay novels which were inspired by volcanic eruptions second liem hoo s goenoeng eruption of mount kelud was inspired by kelud in east java and was published in monthly magazine roman in 1929 third kwee s drama dari drama of merapi was inspired by central java s mount merapi and was published as a serial in romans from march to september 1931 volcanic eruptions also featured in contemporary chinese malay poetry claudine salmon records one syair ong tjong sian s goenoeng krakatau syair on eruption of mount krakatoa 1929 as dealing with community s fears after krakatoa resumed activity unlike many contemporary works by ethnic chinese authors drama dari krakatau features no chinese characters in major roles only such characters are mentioned in passing shopowners who provide emergency food supplies to regent historically malay language works by ethnic chinese authors centred on chinese characters to point that terms such as tanah air homeland were often understood to mean mainland china rather than malay archipelago or dutch east indies chinese malay works which featured exclusively indigenous characters had only developed in 1920s uncommonly for ethnic chinese writers of this period kwee attempts to centre novel around indigenous people and present it from their perspective impersonating these indigenous cultures through his narrative as with many stories with predominantly indigenous casts drama dari krakatau is set in a rural area far from cities where ethnic chinese populace were concentrated geography plays a major role novel starts on a macro scale depicting origins of archipelago from rising sea levels caused by sinking of then progresses increasingly towards micro scale passing through views of java sumatra and krakatoa before focusing on home of tjakra amidjaja and beginning of plot a later passage details view from mount ciwalirang showing java krakatoa and sumatra indonesian literary scholar budianta argues that this geographic panorama combined with sympathetic depiction of other cultures and religions shows elements of nationalism in novel such a theme has also been found in kwee s drama dari boeven digoel drama of boeven digoel 1938 she writes that panoramic views of archipelago help readers to imagine geography of a nation yet to be united whereas impersonation presents a region of theosophy where religious difference is unified in belief of goodness publication history and reception drama dari krakatau was first published in serial form in kwee s magazine panorama between 7 april and 22 december 1928 this serial was then published as a novel by hoa siang in in 1929 a new printing adopting 1972 spelling reform was included in second volume of melayu dan kebangsaan indonesia an anthology of chinese malay literature this volume also included kwee s novella jang saja schoolhouse of my dreams 1925 and novel boenga roos dari tjikembang rose of 1927 as with kwee s earlier work boenga roos dari tjikembang an adaptation of drama dari krakatau was performed on stage before its completion on 28 march 1928 moon opera performed drama dari krakatau at pasar senen in weltevreden batavia now senen jakarta troupe performed story again on 31 march and 5 april latter at mangga besar batavia kwee prepared story for performances abbreviating and simplifying it for stage one of main difficulties he wrote was presenting krakatoa on stage it was a technical challenge yet could not be abandoned as performing this play without showing eruption of krakatoa would be like performing hamlet without prince of denmark as with all works written in vernacular malay novel has not been considered part of indonesian literary canon in his doctoral thesis j francisco b benitez posits a socio political cause for this dutch colonial government used court malay as a language of administration a language for everyday dealings while indonesian nationalists appropriated language to help build a national culture chinese malay literature written in low malay was steadily marginalised sumardjo however sees a question of classification though vernacular malay was lingua franca of time it was not indonesian and as such he asks whether works in vernacular malay should be classified as local literature indonesian literature or simply chinese malay literature explanatory notes references works cited category
