director and agent astrid farnsworth jasika nicole who assists walter in laboratory research fringe division investigates cases relating to fringe science ranging from transhumanist experiments gone wrong to prospect of a destructive technological singularity to a possible collision of two parallel universes fringe division s work often intersects with advanced biotechnology developed by a company called massive dynamic founded by walter s former partner dr william bell leonard nimoy and run by their common friend nina sharp blair brown team is also watched silently by a group of bald pale white men who are called observers season 1 introduces fringe division as they investigate cases that form pattern geographically centered around reiden lake in new york state many of which are orchestrated by an international network of rogue scientists known as zft zerstorung durch fortschritte der technologie or in english destruction through advancement of technology led by david robert jones jared harris who are preparing for a doomsday event zft threat appears to end when peter kills jones as he attempts travel to a parallel universe olivia comes to learn she was a child test subject for walter years ago then known as olive for a nootropic drug cortexiphan giving her weak psionic abilities walter also struggles with adjusting to normal life in peter s care after living seventeen years in a mental institution while hiding fact that peter is from parallel universe his peter having died as a child in season 2 occurrences are found to be in conjunction with activities of a parallel universe which is plagued by singularities occurring at weakened points of fabric between worlds over there scientists have developed an amber like substance that isolates these singularities as well as any innocent people caught in area on its release fringe team deals with more cases that are leading to a great storm as parallel universe appears to be at war with prime one engineered by human machine hybrid shapeshifters from parallel universe walter is forced to tell peter that he is from parallel universe a replacement for his own peter who died from a genetic disease walter had crossed over on frozen ice of reiden lake in 1985 to administer cure for alternate version of peter but after accidentally destroying a dose of cure upon transport he instead brought boy across on return they fell through ice but were saved by observer september michael cerveris who told walter of importance of boy which walter took to mean peter walter s crossing is what caused singularities in parallel universe with reiden lake at their epicenter walter has been looking for a sign of forgiveness in form of a white tulip season 3 presents episodes that alternate between two universes walternate walter s doppelganger in parallel universe is u s secretary of defense and has set events in motion to assemble machine a doomsday device that reacts only to peter s biology he also sent his olivia fauxlivia to prime universe in olivia s place to engage fringe division and assemble prime universe s version of device while he studies olivia s cortexiphan induced powers by happenstance fauxlivia becomes pregnant with peter s child henry before being outed and extracted to parallel universe walternate orchestrated acceleration of pregnancy to gain a sample of baby s blood which he uses to activate machine peter with olivia s help enters prime version of machine and experiences a vision of future where parallel universe has been destroyed and same fate threatens prime one and learns machine is really a device created by walter and his associates from this future sent back in time purposely to relay this vision of future to peter recovering in present peter alters his plan and uses machine to merge two rooms creating a bridge where inhabitants of both universes can solve their dilemma before time is re written so september observer doesn t save him and is forgotten by both walter and olivia season 4 begins in an alternate timeline one in which september had failed to save alternate version of peter in 1985 according to observers this creates a butterfly effect influencing main characters pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due to creation of bridge peter is pulled into this new timeline due to actions of alternate timeline s fringe team which includes lincoln lee seth gabel peter initially works to return to his own timeline fueled by fears that his memories are altering cortexiphan dosed olivia s of this timeline but after encountering a wounded september peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home and both he and olivia come to accept change rekindling their affair september also reveals to peter that observers needed to erase peter s son henry to assure their future will be created though noting that peter s future child with olivia will be important meanwhile in present william bell has instructed david robert jones alive in this timeline to work with parallel universe s version of nina sharp to synchronize two universes aiming to collapse them both and pave way for a third universe under bell s control using olivia s cortexiphan powers to enable collapse fringe division is forced to close dimensional bridge but this fails to stop bell s plan walter is left with one choice to shoot and kill olivia her death disrupting process and saving world olivia s death is only temporary as cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair bullet wound leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities as olivia and peter begin their lives together september appears to walter and warns that observers are coming fifth and final season begins in 2036 following from flash forward fourth season episode letters of transit as september warned observers bald white males from far future having ruined earth for themselves time traveled to 2015 and instituted purge wiped out much of humanity subjected survivors to their control and began modifying planet s environment to be more suitable for themselves fringe team was able to seal themselves in amber to avoid capture shortly after purge and are reunited through henrietta etta georgina haig peter and olivia s now adult daughter who disappeared shortly after observer arrival in 2015 walter reveals he and september developed a plan to defeat observers revealed through a series of pre recorded videotapes in lab tapes lead to several components of a device including a young observer child named michael spencer list in season 1 and rowan longworth in season 5 but further allude to a man named donald that had helped walter prepare plan etta is killed during these events driving olivia and peter to complete plan for her sake through michael they discover donald is september having been stripped of his observer powers for helping fringe team and that michael is his genetic son having been purposely grown as an anomaly in far future september explains plan is to send michael to year where human genetic experiments to sacrifice emotion for intelligence would be started and leading to creation of observers by showing them michael who possesses both emotion and intelligence experiments would be stopped and observers never created september is prepared to take michael to future as plan is set in motion but he is shot and killed at last moment walter already made aware that he will have to make a sacrifice takes michael through to future to assure plan s completion as predicted time is reset from invasion onwards in 2015 observers never invade and peter olivia and etta live their lives peacefully though peter receives one final letter from his father a drawing of a white tulip parallel universe thumb one of fringes location titles in this example from olivia episode takes place in alternate universe s version of manhattan whose name is spelled with only one t one notable difference in alternate universe is that while september 11 attacks occurred world trade center towers were not destroyed much of story arc for fringe involves an alternate universe that mostly mirrors prime universe but with numerous historical idiosyncrasies a significant example element used is effect of september 11 attacks though this event also occurred in alternate universe world trade center was untouched by attacks leaving buildings as predominant landmarks in alternate world s skyline of manhatan south tower was used as office of william bell in several episodes producers were strongly interested in world building and alternate universe allowed them to create a very similar world with a large amount of detail to fill in texture of world an alternate universe also allowed them to show how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down line according to co director jeff pinkner however producers also realized concept of alternate universe could be confusing to viewers to avoid this elements of world were introduced in small pieces over course of first two seasons before larger revelation in second season finale and third season j h wyman stated that he would often pass story ideas for alternate universe by his father to see if it made sense and would rework script if his father found it confusing such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from alternate universe with nearly no ties to main characters as stated by wyman they would be able to make two shows about one show a concept that network executives embraced glyph code thumb left upright marketing posters used to promote series often featured one of glyphs used in show s interstitial each being a twist on a common image pictured here is a leaf with an embedded greek capital letter delta prior to commercial breaks a brief image of a glyph is shown abrams revealed in an interview that glyphs had a hidden meaning it s something that we re doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it but it s not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch show abrams also revealed that seemingly unrelated frogs which have greek letter phi ph imprinted on their back appeared in promos for show have significance within context of series saying it s part of code of show glyph code was cracked by an editor at technology site ars technica who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode for example pilot episode s eight glyphs spell out word observer additionally glyphs are representative of some of means by which walter solves a case such as moth butterfly from window seahorse strain of dna from bishop revival in jacksonville behind walter as he speaks to olivia about her treatment where nootropic cortexiphan was first studied as a trial each of glyphs is clearly visible on daycare wall an episode by episode key to various glyphs was made available on fringepedia opening sequence show s standard opening sequence images of glyph symbols alongside words representing fringe science topics such as teleportation and dark matter within third season with episodes that took place primarily in parallel universe a new set of titles was used following a similar format though tinted red instead of blue and using alternate fringe science concepts like hypnosis and neuroscience difference in color has led some fans to call prime universe blue one in contrast to parallel red one in third season episode entrada titles used a mix of both blue and red tinted versions given that episode took place equally in each universe in two flashback episodes peter and subject 13 a variation on sequence using retro graphics akin to 1980s technology and phrases like personal computing and genetic engineering was used for dystopian future third season episode day we died a black toned theme with more dire phrases like hope and water was used fourth season premiere neither here nor there introduced an amber toned title sequence with additional new terms that is used for nearly all fourth season episodes fourth season episode letters of transit which returned to future dystopian universe and subsequent fifth season episodes feature a cold toned title sequence with phrases such as joy private thought free will and freedom ideas which have been lost in this future there is one frame in opening sequence in which words observers are here flash very quickly and opening sequence must be paused

primary antagonist of resistance development conception co created by j j abrams roberto orci and alex kurtzman fringe is produced by bad robot in association with warner bros television as part of a commitment that abrams previously made with studio at time abrams was working with orci and kurtzman on star trek film and met at one of comic cons during star treks production to brainstorm ideas for show abrams later brought bryan burk a producer on several of his films to help with developing series abrams s inspiration for fringe came from a range of sources including writings of michael crichton film altered states films by david cronenberg and television series x files and twilight zone orci stated that fringe is a new kind of storytelling combining procedural shows such as law order and an extremely serialized and very series like lost procedural aspect was chosen because at time of its premiere six of ten top shows were procedural in nature orci stated that you have to be a fool not to go study what it is that they re doing abrams had originally considered naming series lab as they had envisioned walter s laboratory to be epicenter of conversation and where anything is possible though team saw this as a way of presenting mystery of week type episodes they wanted to focus more on how these stories were told in unpredictable ways rather than actual mystery recognizing that most of their target audience has seen such mysteries before through previous shows and films instead they wanted their storytelling to be original and unexpected and as claimed by kurtzman one of most challenging aspects of developing individual episodes serialization of show was important to tell their overall story with larger plot elements but abrams recognized difficulties that his earlier serialized shows such as lost and alias had in attracting and maintaining viewers that had not seen these shows from start or who missed episodes sporadically for fringe abrams instead sought to create as stated by david itzkoff of new york times a show that suggested complexity but was comprehensible in any given episode writers aimed to balance a line between stand alone episodes a factor requested by fox and a heavily serialized show they balanced these by moving serialization aspect to growth and development of their characters this gave them ability to write self contained episodes that still contained elements related to overall mythos however as production continued creative staff found show itself took on a more serialized nature and opted towards this approach in later seasons while still balancing self contained episodes one method was by introducing overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to such as pattern in season 1 providing information repeatedly about larger plot over course of several episodes or seasons abrams also created characters whose alliances to larger narrative were clear avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during first and second seasons of alias a final step taken was to script out all of major long running plot elements including show s finale prior to full time production abrams contrasted this to process used in lost where ideas like character flashbacks and hatch from second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to viewers instead with fringe they were able to create clearly defined goalposts in itzkoff s words that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for overarching plot these approaches also allowed team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered show s fate if known at start abrams stated that there are certain details that are hugely important that i believe if shared will destroy any chance of actually getting on air abrams noted that they are able to benefit from how open fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing weirdness and long term stories that we want to tell during third season executive producer jeff pinkner noted that we have six to eight seasons worth of material we see it as having certain chapters that would enrich overall story but aren t necessary to tell overall story god willing network allows us time to tell our complete story as part of larger story writers have placed elements in earlier episodes that are referenced in episodes seasons later for example in first season episode ghost network fringe team encounters an amber like substance which is later shown to be a critical means to combat breakdown of parallel universe and eventually for same in prime universe with third season episode 6b pinkner compared this aspect to planting seeds some which they know how they plan to use later in show s story while others they can find ways of incorporating into these later episodes he further attributed these elements as part of world building to flesh out show beyond episodic content producers have stated that when show s mythology is introduced it is not simply there to tie episodes together but to provide answers that generate consequences certain elements of show s mythology were established from start parallel universe was always part of original concept though aspects of when and how to introduce it were tackled as show proceeded idea of peter being from parallel universe came early into show s production but this came to lead team to jokingly refer to peter as their hatch one of early mysteries in lost as with hatch in lost they initially had no idea how to introduce this within show fox s reilly was also initially concerned about parallel universe aspect but as show progressed into first season and found its groove concept was readily accepted most poignant introduction of parallel universe was in conclusion of first season finale there s more than one of everything where they showed twin towers of world trade center were still standing in parallel universe a concept introduced by writer andrew kreisberg as an iconic image to leave viewers with jackson stated i don t know that we ve ever had a better visual or a better cliff hanger other mythos elements were devised as series progressed writers had originally envisioned only spending small portions of episodes within parallel universe but as they wrote these episodes within season 3 they brought out idea of setting entire episodes within parallel universe this necessitated development of alternate versions of main characters which pinkner considered a great playground just for imagination actors themselves found this concept exciting as it allowed them to play different characters but with same background and considered it a creative challenge similarly having peter erased from timeline as part of finale for season 3 was an idea that grew over course of that season writers were aware this would be a risky move but felt idea was very appropriate for fringe and opted to write towards this after considering all consequences pinkner noted that this gave them an opportunity to reset character relationships and determine key aspects that would remain without peter as well as making audience uncomfortable at times cast was not initially sold with idea but came around as fourth season progressed production list of showrunners throughout series run season 1 jeff pinkner season 2 4 jeff pinkner j h wyman season 5 j h wyman after developing core concepts of show abrams began to seek studios to develop show abrams past successes led to warner bros television and fox television network to quickly jump on board project peter roth chief executive of warner bros television had been actively seeking to bring any abrams project to his studio and heard abrams pitch for fringe at a dinner meeting in august 2007 similarly kevin reilly entertainment chairman at fox knew that it was critical for him to bring next abrams project to his network and worked with roth to assure this would happen jeff pinkner was selected to act as head showrunner and executive producer abrams noted that he trusts pinkner after working together with him on alias and lost pinkner became interested in show during a visit to set of star trek during which abrams was discussing concept of fringe with orci and kurtzman knowing that they would not be involved in direct production of work abrams pitched idea to pinkner who was intrigued by importance of characters in a science fiction drama in season two j h wyman was brought on as executive producer and showrunner with pinkner wyman had been a science fiction enthusiast but had worried that he had not written anything in that genre but after learning about concept of show felt his role as an executive producer was a match made in heaven michael giacchino abrams frequent collaborator composed music for pilot of fringe before handing over duties to his assistants chad seiter and chris tilton tilton took over scoring duties from season 2 onward while giacchino retains an on screen credit abrams himself wrote series theme music two hour pilot episode filmed in toronto ontario canada cost a total of 10 million to create a basement of an old church was used for walter s lab set in pilot and this set was replicated at other film sites in new york and vancouver when show moved lab set was designed by carol spier production designer for several of cronenberg s films john noble called his character s lab heart and soul of fringe so consequently that has to remain constant a cow used in pilot episode had to be recast when production of season 1 was moved to new york due to livestock restrictions preventing it from being brought from canada to united states other locations used in first season included other universities to stage for harvard university campus where walter s lab is located these included pratt institute and yale university including its old campus particularly phelps hall and durfee hall branford college and exterior of yale law school university of toronto s university college brooklyn college thumb 220px filming of fringe episode 6b in december 2010 at vancouver film school building at hastings and streets in vancouver staged as new york city on february 21 2009 it was reported that in event that fringe would be renewed for a second season show would move production to vancouver from new york city as a cost cutting measure executive producer jeff pinkner explained we want to stay in new york new york has been incredibly good to us it feels like we re being kicked out of city i know we re not but they re making it impossible for us to afford doing show our new york crew is spectacular they ve worked their butts off to make show look great but it looks like new york is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in new york so it looks like out of necessity we ll have to leave new york which is not anything we are welcoming as plans were being made to move production to canada new york state legislature passed continuation of film and tax credits as planned upon productions moving to vancouver british columbia canada for season 2 university of british columbia now stands in for harvard area around new westminster often serves as filming locations for fringe stories that take place in parallel universe prior to start of production for fifth season pinkner announced that he was leaving production of show to pursue other projects wyman would remain as sole showrunner for show casting show s main characters olivia peter and walter were core of concept for fringe creators recognized early that idea that telling a father son story and a relationship story was a really compelling one and a very accessible one according to kurtzman they were able to provide characters with backstories that like with other long term plot elements could be alluded to over several episodes and seasons characters would also contrast with typical procedural genre show rather than having clearly defined roles episode to episode they instead have an emotional memory and an emotional investment as stated by orci this also allowed for as necessary characters to be removed or introduced to show and have a larger impact on other characters first actors cast were kirk acevedo and mark valley who portrayed fbi agents charlie francis and john scott respectively john noble and lance reddick who play dr walter bishop and homeland security agent phillip broyles joined cast later on casting of anna torv blair brown and jasika nicole who play olivia dunham massive dynamic employee nina sharp and astrid farnsworth a federal agent and assistant to olivia dunham respectively followed while joshua jackson who plays peter bishop was last main character to be cast jackson auditioned for james t kirk in abrams star trek and believed this is what impressed producer to cast him in his television project though abrams later clarified that it was recalling his previous experience with working with jackson on his television series felicity for principal and recurring actors they were all intrigued by script for pilot comparing it to a two hour long movie as well as abrams reputation on april 8 2009 it was announced that leonard nimoy would appear as walter bishop s former lab partner dr william bell in first season s finale which explores existence of an ominous parallel universe this choice led one reviewer to question if fringes plot might be a homage to star trek episode mirror mirror which explored concept of an alternate reality referred to as a mirror universe and an evil version of spock distinguished by a goatee nimoy returned as dr bell for an extended arc and according to orci bell is beginning of answers to even bigger questions nimoy reprised his role in second season finale where his character and walter met for a showdown nimoy s character is apparently dead after season finale having used himself to help walter peter and alternate olivia back to prime universe as he had retired from acting it was thought unlikely that his character would return in february 2011 however he announced his definite plan to return to fringe and reprise his role as william bell he returned to voice character in animated segments of third season episode lysergic acid diethylamide and appeared as a computer generated character in fourth season episode letters of transit in two part finale of fourth season nimoy returned to play ultimate antagonist of alternate timeline story arc reception early reception through first season was generally lukewarm with many noting its lackluster start and dullness of characters however changes in approach and storytelling of show in second and subsequent seasons led to more positive critical reception and made it a media favorite as a whole series was well received by critics and has developed a cult following first season pilot episode was watched by 9 13 million viewers garnering 3 2 9 nielsen ratings among adults 18 49 with ratings improving over course of episode ratings improved greatly for second episode same old story which 13 27 million people watched making it fifth most watched show of week as of october 2008 show had achieved first place in 18 49 demographic among new shows barry garron at hollywood reporter found it promising and reminiscent of battle of sexes charm robert bianco of usa today said what abrams brings to fringe is a director s eye for plot and pace a fan s love of sci fi excitement and a story teller s gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters travis fickett of ign gave it 7 6 out of 10 calling it a lackluster pilot that promises to be a pretty good series while tim goodman of san francisco chronicle remarked that it was ambitious chicago sun timess misha davenport called it an update of x files with addition of terrorism and office of homeland security in a 2016 retrospective of series a v club writer joshua alston noted that similarities to x files including monster of week approach and tepid romance between two of series lead characters as well as relatively recent release of x files i want to believe had turned audiences off show since it was retreading what x files had already done in its 2008 year in review television without pity declared fringe one of year s biggest tv disappointments commenting that show is entertaining and cast is largely strong but character development is insufficient and describing main character olivia dunham as wooden and distant meanwhile in other articles recounting best and worst of 2008 new york times stated that fringe is best of a rash of new series that toy with paranormal author goes on to praise cast saying that much credit belongs to anna torv who stars as an f b i agent investigating bizarre murders that all appear to be linked to a powerful and mysterious multinational corporation and ms torv is backed up ably by john noble as a crazy but brilliant fringe scientist and his level headed but skeptical son played by joshua jackson subsequent seasons seasons of fringe after first season were seen as vast improvements on first entertainment weekly stated best new show of year took a few weeks to grow on me but now it s a full blown addiction los angeles times called walter bishop one of best characters of 2008 noting role of modern day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster but fringe writers and masterful john noble have conspired to create a character that seems as trite as it sounds more shakespearean than sci fi chicago tribune stated that some episodes are distressingly predictable and formulaic but adds that there have also been some excellent episodes new york times named fringe one of top 10 television shows in 2010 while television without pity previously dismissive of show listed it amongst their 2010 most memorable tv moments stating there were so many great fringe moments this year and we were treated to some of best sci fi on television this past fall a v club named fringe 15th best show of 2010 stated that episode peter gave series overarching storyline a devastating emotional core making series a rare blend of inventive ideas wild ambition and unexpected soulfulness ign named fringe 18th best science fiction show of all time in a 2011 listing stating that since middle of first season it s been nothing but a series of satisfyingly jaw dropping holy eff moments layered with wonderful nuanced performances from anna torv joshua jackson and john noble in 2012 entertainment weekly listed show at 17 in 25 best cult tv shows from past 25 years saying fringe was conceived as a mass appeal genre procedural with a background mythology that wouldn t detract from monster of week episodes but mythology overtook monsters following revelation of a parallel universe by its third season fringe was overpopulated by multiple versions of every character unfortunately that increasing narrative complexity has steadily pigeonholed it as a niche show 25 best cult tv shows from past 25 years entertainment weekly august 3 2012 p 41 in 2015 bustle declared white tulip as one of greatest hours in television history he wrote white tulip is an hour of television that shouldn t work

recording through digital video receivers and does not expect viewership numbers to change significantly with change to friday reilly further postulated that if it does anywhere near what it did on thursdays we can glue that show to schedule because it can be a big win for us further promoted by critical reaction to rescheduling fox network created a self deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging reputation of time slot including quotes from other media outlets concerned about move but asserted that move would re animate show network also created a music video set to echoes by band klaxons as a means of summarizing third season to date prior to first friday broadcast joshua jackson who plays peter bishop on show cautioned that time shifted viewership may not be enough to save show it s not that not enough people are watching fringe it s that not enough people are watching fringe during hour that it s on air which is key for network producers pinkner and wyman also were excited about move to fridays considering slot as open territory that can be conquered and that they can actually deliver like x files did series creator abrams was less optimistic of move to friday nights aware that show s likelihood to be renewed for a fourth season would be highly dependent on number of niche viewers that continue to watch show abrams did affirm that moving to friday nights allows them to take more creative freedoms to maintain viewership in new timeslot but feels that if show was not renewed for another season they would be hard pressed to resolve story by end of third season show s first episode at friday 9 00 p m timeslot firefly scored a 1 9 in key 18 49 demographic which was an increase of 12 over its last thursday aired episode marionette which scored a 1 7 and maintained similar numbers in second week for reciprocity though viewership slipped in further weeks show was renewed for a fourth season in march 2011 move was unexpected based on these ratings given past performance of shows with similar viewership numbers in friday night slot but several critics attribute it to strong fanbase that show has garnered which contributes in part to consistently higher time shifted viewership fox s reilly stated that reilly further added that renewal was also prompted by high risk of trying to replace fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics he commented that they have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that they think they can grow prior to onset of fourth season reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in fringes viewership within that season it s a pretty complex show if fringe can do exactly what fringe did last year we re going to be very happy they re right in pocket creatively once again wyman stated in an interview with hollywood reporter that fox network had been supportive throughout this process and though show s viewership wasn t exactly what they would ve hoped for aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take show forward for another season pinkner commented that there were no creative conditions on show s renewal nor any cuts in show s budget though was unsure if show will be moved to a different time slot noble at 2011 comic con fringe panel reiterated that fans were responsible for livelihood of show stated seriously without your efforts your rabid support we wouldn t be here right now you are best fans that ever existed fourth season premiered on september 23 2011 before renewal of fifth season abrams stated some skepticism for a renewal opportunity but hoped that if it was cancelled that it may be picked up by another network on other hand abrams considered that if fox did pick up show for a fifth season next year would be great ending for show similarly fox s reilly remained cautious about a renewal noting that while show is one of top shows in friday night slot it s an expensive show we lose a lot of money on show reilly further reiterated dedication of fans of show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success when asked about whether writers would have enough notice to write fourth season finale as a series finale if necessary reilly stated that s a peter roth issue chief executive of warner bros television to which roth responded we have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect series to continue in late january 2012 fox and warner bros television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for show to allow a fifth season to occur this would not only help fox reduce its losses on show but would also bring total number of episodes above 100 giving warner bros a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of show before announcement of fifth season wyman and pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for end of fourth season should show be cancelled wyman stated we want to take care of fans we want them to see where it would have gone but we also know show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it show was officially renewed for a fifth and final season for 2012 2013 television season consisting of a shortened set of 13 episodes on april 26 2012 with its premiere on september 28 2012 reilly in announcing renewal stated that fringe is a remarkably creative series that has set bar as one of television s most imaginative dramas bringing it back for a final 13 allows us to provide climactic conclusion that its passionate and loyal fans deserve writing team crafted an idea for a cohesive story driven set of thirteen episodes as a means to complete series and to honor audience that had served us so well was to say a proper farewell according to roth noble called it season for
