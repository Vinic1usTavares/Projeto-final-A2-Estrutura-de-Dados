yucatan channel and became tropical storm becky initially thought to have attained minimal hurricane status becky reached peak winds of 65 mph 100 km h but storm began to deteriorate shortly thereafter storm made landfall on florida panhandle on july 22 and rapidly weakened over land overall damage was related to heavy rainfall that caused flooding in tallahassee florida 104 families suffered flood related losses about 500 000 1970 usd in damage was attributed to storm further north heavy rainfall swelled rivers becky may have been partially responsible for spawning tornadoes that destroyed or damaged several houses meteorological history on july 16 1970 a large disturbance separated from intertropical convergence zone near panama broad area of convection dominated region between swan island and western cuba by july 18 some sources state that area of convection was joined by a low level vortex that entered area eventually forming a depression others believe that origins of becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that moved off coast of africa on july 9 a tropical depression formed on july 19 1970 as depression moved through yucatan channel convective cloud system became better organized on july 20 in light of data from a reconnaissance aircraft flight depression was upgraded to tropical storm becky storm moved roughly northward under influence of bermuda high to east and a low pressure area over mexico reports from a reconnaissance flight indicated that becky was disorganized with a minimum barometric pressure of although a fairly strong low level circulation developed there was insufficient warming of center to produce a significant drop in barometric pressure at surface late on july 20 a ship reported a minimum pressure of about and another ship reported sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h which would be becky s peak intensity a reconnaissance flight and weather radars suggested development of an eye feature and initially it was believed that storm attained minimal hurricane status later it was later confirmed that becky remained a tropical storm and previously forming eye failed to persist on july 21 storm deteriorated in organization as it continued northward lack of banding features indicated that by early on july 22 becky was barely a tropical storm storm made landfall near port st joe florida shortly thereafter and
