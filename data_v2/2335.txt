office of inspector general of united states army otig is agency tasked with investigating united states army its stated mission is to provide impartial objective and unbiased advice and oversight to army through relevant timely and thorough inspection assistance investigations and training position of inspector general ig has existed since 1777 when thomas conway was appointed and office has been reorganized many times varied in size dramatically and abolished on several occasions before being reinstated in its early days inspectorate was frequently merged with or proposed to be part of adjutant general s department office expanded greatly in late 19th century after american civil war undertaking increasing numbers of inspections upon outbreak of spanish american war war department was ill prepared and much of blame fell upon inspectorate nevertheless it continued to expand in early 20th century peaking during world war i with caseload of department rising 360 percent from 1916 to 1917 scope of department rose further between world wars work undertaken fell during 1920s and rose again during 1930s during world war ii department increased in size to point that it had around 3 000 officers in 1945 inspectorate decreased in size to about 2 000 officers in 1986 background first modern military inspectors were french army first appointed in 1668 frederick great of prussia had appointed inspectors by 1770s as had british army historian david clary argues that by mid eighteenth century military inspection had become essential to modern armies french army had a system of independent inspectors who reported directly to king they had geographical assignments and during times of war ranked equal to generals brigadiers or colonels there was also an inspector of construction fredrick great similarly appointed men to directly inspect his army reporting directly to him and inspecting specific units this system was adopted by much of europe in british system of inspection officers were detailed to inspect various parts of army and there was a separate inspector general of recruits and of cavalry commanding officers were also responsible for inspecting their troops detailing of officers meant that there was no formal bureaucracy dealing with inspection when continental army was formed it was largely modeled on british army none of european systems of inspecting worked well for continental army british was inadequate as it relied on an experienced highly trained and well disciplined army french because it interfered with chain of command and prussian as it relied on uniform units and practices massachusetts bay colony and colony of virginia both had militias with muster masters and muster master generals respectively serving as inspectors elements from all five systems were eventually incorporated continental army was very disorganized from start of american revolutionary war in 1775 after george washington arrived at boston to lead army in a siege of city on july 4 1775 it had taken him a week to produce an accurate count of soldiers in army which was 16 600 far fewer than 24 500 he had expected poorly trained and organized by 1777 army was in washington s opinion in need of an inspector general members of continental congress noted absence of a regular inspector and on april 18 1777 congress requested establishment of a position to inspect magazines of provisions under care of commissary wharton early history 1777 1865 augustin de la balme arrived in united states in 1777 and on july 8 continental congress resolved that lieutenant colonel de la balme be appointed inspector general of cavalry of united states of america with rank and pay of colonel he resigned after casimir pulaski was promoted to chief of cavalry ahead of him viewing pulaski as an inferior cavalry leader philippe charles jean baptiste du coudray was similarly appointed to inspector general of ordnance and military stores on august 11 1777 at time position was mere flattery that meant nothing in military terms coudray drowned in schuylkill river on september 16 thumb upright 1 baron von steuben alt left on october 29 1777 washington recommended permanent establishment of an inspector general post to continental congress on december 13 congress established such a position naming thomas conway as first inspector general washington objected to continental congress s choice instead favoring prussian henry leonard d arendt who had been first to propose position he had a personal dislike of conway and had come into conflict with him during what is known as conway cabal when washington felt there was a conspiracy against him aiming to remove him from his position as commander in chief on april 28 1778 conway resigned baron friedrich wilhelm von steuben a prussian was then selected by washington as next inspector general as first inspector general to serve a significant term he played a large part in defining role of position his book regulations for order and discipline of troops of united states served as official guide to military training and maneuvers in united states army until war of 1812 on february 18 1779 continental congress formally created a charter for office of inspector general it gave holder of position rank of major general and specified role of position as creating regulations for maneuvers and discipline periodically inspecting and reporting on condition of troops and introducing new maneuvers washington could appoint as many sub inspectors as he felt necessary on june 22 1779 continental congress temporarily directed adjutant general of united states army to serve as assistant inspector general by 1780 inspector general served as de facto chief of staff of united states army on january 12 1780 congress resolved that inspector general would also manage mustering of troops in continental army congress further clarified role of office on september 25 1780 making it responsible for regulations of army and again in 1782 this time shrinking department steuben and his aide later successor william north were heavily involved in demobilization of continental army north was made inspector general in april 1784 and is known to have done little in role following north s departure in late october 1787 office was vacant until june 25 1788 when congress resolved that that office of inspector of troops in service of united states immediately cease and be discontinued and that secretary of war report what mode may be most eligible for having troops inspected in future united states department of war was created by an act of congress on august 7 1789 and john stagg and francis mentges latter serving as inspector of contracts performed most of inspector general s duties until 1792 army functioned much like a militia thumb upright 1 alexander hamilton as a result of escalation of northwest indian war in 1790 congress began expanding army mentges served as de facto inspector general as did winthrop sargent for arthur st clair s army on march 5 1792 after st clair s defeat army was reorganized again when anthony wayne took over st clair s role a few days later henry de butts was appointed acting inspector general he was then followed by edward butler michael rudolph jonathan haskell and john mills army was reorganized on november 1 1796 with new legislation providing for an inspector general who would also perform duties of adjutant general thomas humphrey cushing was next appointed as an acting inspector general and would remain until 1798 when he was replaced by alexander hamilton who acted as de facto head of army during quasi war position was abolished by legislation passed on may 14 1800 hamilton resigned on june 15 1800 and was followed by cushing who served as acting inspector general in 1807 cushing was replaced by abimael youngs nicoll as an acting inspector general position was reestablished upon outbreak of war of 1812 with rank of brigadier general and alexander smyth was appointed smyth performed poorly in role to point that on march 3 1813 it was abolished by congress and replaced by an inspector

department eight inspectors and adjutants and 16 assistant inspectors and 16 assistant adjutants zebulon pike was appointed adjutant and inspector general in 1813 before being killed in an explosion on april 27 1813 after pike s death duties of inspector general were performed by abimael y nicoll then most senior inspector later john r bell and various assistant adjutant generals acted as inspector general in 1814 position was filled by william h winder and daniel parker after several reorganizations by 1816 united states army was divided into north and south divisions with arthur p hayne inspector general in south and john e wool in north with parker remaining adjutant and inspector general hayne resigned in 1820 and was replaced by james gadsden in 1821 army was reorganized with two inspectors general having rank pay and emoluments of colonels of cavalry parker s position was eliminated from 1821 to 1861 position had little change during mexican american war inspector general served as second in command of army upon outbreak of american civil war all inspectors had retired or defected to confederate states of america and as a result new inspectors were appointed in 1861 largely doing what their superiors requested there were many informally appointed inspectors and by late 1862 nearly 1 400 other officers were on orders at one time or another to perform various types of inspection duties in january 1863 delos bennett sackett was assigned as de facto head of office of inspector general which until then had not existed in total two major generals seven brigadier generals 18 colonels 118 lieutenant colonels and 149 majors of regular army served official inspector duty during civil war reorganization 1866 1903 on january 22 1866 a war department order re defined duties of inspector general to be to inspect in july 1866 number of inspectors general with rank of colonel was fixed at four assistant inspectors general with rank of lieutenant colonel at three and number with rank of major at two in 1866 edmund schriver was named inspector general of united states military academy and senior inspector general he led movement to give position authority equivalent to other offices of army that same year he published first annual report of inspector general s department on march 3 1869 when army was dramatically reduced in size unofficial inspector general s department was retained and any new appointments or promotions being prohibited randolph b marcy took over from schriver in 1869 left thumb upright 1 randolph b marcy by 1871 inspectorate was being criticized by many particularly for its useless reports an anonymous letter written to army and navy journal criticized that parasite of army called inspector general s department on october 5 1872 inspectorate was formally attached to war department and given an independent office in 1874 it was reduced in size by a law spearheaded by senator john a logan that same year inspector general s department was formally recognized as existing with adoption by united states congress of revised statutes which treated department as existing though it had never formally been established on december 12 1878 congress declared that rank of senior inspector general of united states army would be brigadier general placing it on an equal footing with other army departments on february 5 1885 department was expanded from then it remained largely same size and structure until joseph cabell breckinridge sr became senior inspector general on january 30 1889 breckinridge working with secretary of war redfield proctor sponsored release of a series of general orders altering scope of inspectorate culminating in amendment of paragraph 955 army regulations by general order no 38 of 1890 which dictated that entire military establishment was to be inspected annually during late 19th century inspectorate engaged in many special inspections several at behest of congress and did much to safeguard public property in 1894 department undertook 928 disbursement accounts involving over 68 million and inspections of 90 posts 50 staff facilities prisons and ungarrisoned posts 82 military colleges 51 national cemeteries 27 recruiting stations and 28 special investigations for a total of 1 256 inspections on march 30 1895 united states was divided by secretary of war daniel s lamont into six inspections districts and department was made independent reporting directly to secretary of war and commanding general of united states army instead of department commanders then commanding general nelson a miles disliked inspectorate and in 1898 he nearly succeeded in removing inspection districts and independence of department thumb upright 1 joseph c breckinridge upon outbreak of spanish american war war department was shown to be ill prepared and much of blame fell on inspector general s department for not noticing problems in army during war department was increased in size with 36 temporary inspectors being appointed and three permanently appointed later there was little oversight as breckinridge was fighting in war and department has been described by historian david clary as mostly existing on paper after war inspectorate was increased in size and was revitalized by 1901 it had one brigadier general three colonels four lieutenant colonels and nine majors in 1902 an act to increase efficiency of army was passed which originally contained a clause to abolish inspector general s department continued growth 1903 1939 general staff bill passed in 1903 had as originally drafted abolished office of inspector general but provision was removed in 1906 ernest albert garlington replaced george h burton and became senior inspector general under them office came to be seen as an extension of secretary of war and chief of staff inspector general collaborating closely with them and often sharing their opinions scope of inspectorate increased significantly to point that anything affecting army s efficiency was within its scope inspector general similarly became a more respected role thomas henry barry commander of army of cuban pacification considered his inspector to be one of his most important staff officers in 1911 secretary of war jacob m dickinson submitted a plan to merge adjutant and inspector general s departments another was presented by general staff in 1914 and again in 1915 in what led to national defense act of 1916 through those years inspectorate under garlington was one of most vocal advocates of motorizing army with passage of national defense act size of inspectorate was increased to a maximum of thirty three officers and army itself was dramatically increased in size inspectorate became responsible for oversight of education and training of both officers and men and its reports largely shaped changes in education of officers left thumb upright 1 andre w brewster army was poorly prepared upon entrance of united states into world war i in 1917 and was restructured with overman act giving president greater authority over army by july 1917 caseload of inspectorate had increased 360 percent from previous year and by 65 percent in three months after declaration of war to meet increased caseload inspectorate was dramatically expanded to point that it struggled to find suitable inspectors to add and began requesting that former inspectors come out of retirement in september there were 89 officers 30 regulars 10 recalled regulars and 49 reservists in november department was again increased to 164 officers and 125 enlisted men it rose to 216 officers on november 12 1918 andre w brewster was selected as inspector general of american expeditionary forces in period after world war i inspectorate dealt with many problems including complaints over misdirected mail misconduct by soldiers and damage to civilian property inspectors were active in france until 1919 russia until 1920 and germany until 1923 inspectorate peaked at 248 officers in 1919 same year a plan to severely limit department s responsibilities was proposed by 1920 33 officers were in office of inspector general while 54 remained at camps or in geographical departments in 1915 office had handled about 9 500 actions while by 1921 it processed nearly 17 700 in national defense act of 1920 inspectorate was reorganized with an inspector general and 61 inspectors secretary of war could shrink or increase office by 15 without congress passing a new law and department shrunk from 62 to 56 officers in june 1922 and after several further rounds of downsizing ended at 40 in 1923 in 1925 inspectorate allocated additional responsibility of inspecting ten monuments and twelve parks to obtain better training for inspectors general they would often receive training at civilian businesses and schools including sears roebuck department inspected finances and troops number of inspections increasing dramatically at beginning of 1930s under hugh aloysius drum and his successors by mid 1930s war department inspectorate was averaging about sixty major investigations annually department became responsible for inspecting civilian conservation corps in 1933 later history 1940 by 1940 all subordinate commanders from division level were given an inspector general under their control to conduct inspections and investigations as needed army grew during world war ii and by 1945 there were about 3 000 inspectors general serving in army rapid reduction in size of army from about 9 million in 1945 to a few hundred thousand in 1946 caused inspector general to receive thousands of requests for help from soldiers being released from army largely because they were not being released quickly enough thumb
