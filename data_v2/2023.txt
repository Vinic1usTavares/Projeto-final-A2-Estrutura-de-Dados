hurricane lili was one of only four atlantic tropical cyclones on record to reach hurricane status in month of december final of thirteen tropical storms in 1984 atlantic hurricane season lili developed as a subtropical cyclone which originated from a frontal trough to south of bermuda on december 12 it tracked southeastward then northward slowly attaining tropical characteristics and becoming a hurricane on december 20 lili turned to south and southwest briefly threatening northern caribbean islands before weakening and dissipating near coast of dominican republic storm produced light rainfall but no damage meteorological history in second week of december a frontal trough stalled south of bermuda an upper level disturbance moved over area on december 9 and produced widespread convection along frontal wave system moved to northeast and based on a developing circulation within convection national hurricane center classified system as a subtropical storm on december 12 while located 275 miles 440 km northeast of bermuda with winds of 60 mph 95 km h and strengthening subtropical storm initially drifted northeastward on december 13 a ridge of high pressure to its north forced storm southeastward and following day storm turned to south after an upper level cold core low developed over system a break in ridge resulted in storm turning to northeast with its forward motion accelerating to nearly 40 mph 65 km h after turning to northwest on december 17 high pressure system again halted its northward movement leaving storm drifting south southeastward conditions favored further strengthening and subtropical storm reached 70 mph 115 km h winds on december 18 satellite imagery estimated storm attained hurricane status on december 19 and a day later ship near center reported winds of 75 mph 120 km h based on wind report as well as a minimum central pressure of 980 mbar and a well defined eye storm was classified as hurricane lili while located 730 miles 1 180 km east of bermuda lili continued generally southward reaching its peak intensity of 80 mph 130 km h higher pressures developed to its northeast resulting in hurricane to accelerate to southwest on december 22 lili finished executing its large cyclonic loop by passing over same location it passed one week prior combination of its increased forward speed as well as increased levels of vertical wind shear created an unfavorable environment which caused steady weakening on december 23 lili weakened to a tropical storm while located 430 miles 690 km northeast of antigua it rapidly lost organization as it approached leeward islands and dissipated just off coast of dominican republic on december 24 impact and records when lili reached hurricane status on december 20 it became one of only four atlantic tropical cyclones to reach hurricane strength in month of december other three were an unnamed hurricane in 1887 season hurricane alice in 1954 and hurricane epsilon in 2005 in addition hurricane nicole lasted as a hurricane from late november to early december 1998 because of its rapid movement a hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico and virgin islands on december 22 as storm weakened watches were discontinued in response to threat of hurricane officials posted a small craft advisory along coastline of northern puerto rico there weakening tropical cyclone produced light rainfall though there was no reported damage lili moved through hispaniola as an area of squally weather but damage if any is unknown accounts sailor brian hancock encountered hurricane lili during route of discovery yacht race from spain to santo domingo in dominican republic tropical storm lili was traveling at around 18 knots along same path as race fleet and was starting to pick off slower boats astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds ripped sails and some damage all while lili gained in strength by our calculation we would get to bahamas before storm did but problem was that bahamas were not our final destination we had to round san salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward east well southeast to be exact we rounded san salvador and sailed slap bang into teeth of a ferocious storm hurricane lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we have to ride it out i remember feeling exhilarated by it all it helps to be a little naive and dumb but that s how you are when you are in your 20 s see also list of off season atlantic hurricanes other storms of same name references external links nhc lili report 1984 monthly weather review lili lili 1984 lili 1984 category 1984 meteorology
