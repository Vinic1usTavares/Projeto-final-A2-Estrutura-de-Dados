german aircraft carrier i was a planned conversion of transport ship europa during world war ii loss of battleship bismarck and near torpedoing of her sistership tirpitz in may 1941 and march 1942 respectively spurred kriegsmarine to acquire aircraft carriers europa was one of several vessels selected for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers as designed ship would have had an air complement of 24 bf 109t fighters and 18 ju stuka dive bombers conversion planning began in may 1942 and had conversion been finished she would have been largest german aircraft carrier longer even than purpose built s work was canceled in november 1942 however after design problems including serious instability and structural weaknesses proved to be irreconcilable no work was done on ship which was eventually seized by us army and used as a troop transport following end of war design thumb left ship in her original guise as europa carrier i was a conversion proposal for transport ship europa ship was launched on 16 august 1928 and entered service on 19 march 1930 for german norddeutscher lloyd shipping company starting in 1939 ship was used as a floating barracks ship was requisitioned by kriegsmarine for use in planned operation sea lion but operation was abandoned when luftwaffe failed to achieve air superiority in battle of britain groner p 74 following loss of battleship bismarck in may 1941 and near torpedoing of her sistership tirpitz in march 1942 kriegsmarine was convinced of need to acquire aircraft carriers several vessels were selected for conversion including incomplete heavy cruiser seydlitz and several passenger liners garzke dulin p 296 planning for conversion of europa into an auxiliary aircraft carrier was started in may 1942 ship would have been faster and larger than any of other ships germany intended to convert into auxiliary carriers however a number of design problems emerged as drawing up of conversion plan progressed her speed and capacity advantages were offset by several serious practical problems these included structural weakness caused by need to recess hangar deck into primary structural deck instability normally resolved by adding bulges and high fuel consumption another significant obstacle was unwillingness of hermann goring commander in chief of luftwaffe to provide kriegsmarine with sufficient aircraft and pilots miller p 33 by time design was completed in november 1942 these problems had proved impossible to rectify and so project was abandoned as a result no construction work began worth p 44 after end of war europa was seized by us army and commissioned as a troop transport under name ap 177 before being transferred to france where she resumed her commercial duties general characteristics and machinery i was long at waterline and long overall groner p 73 which was approximately longer than s ship initially had a beam of but bulges added during design process to help stability increased beam to ship had a draft of as designed but conversion would have increased it to i displaced at designed weight and up to at maximum displacement ship s hull was divided into 16 watertight compartments and was equipped with a double bottom percentage of length of hull double bottom extended is unknown ship s flight deck was long and wide there was a single hangar that was long wide forward and wide aft no armor was to have been added to ship during conversion process ship was propelled by four sets of blohm voss geared turbines that drove four shafts each with a four bladed screw that was in diameter turbines were powered by 24 double ended narrow water tube boilers that produced up to 21 atmospheres of pressure engines were rated for and provided a top speed of at maximum speed ship could steam for at a cruising speed of cruising range doubled to ship was designed to store up to of fuel oil but total fuel bunkerage was i had only one rudder electrical power plant comprised four diesel generators that provided 520 kilowatts and two emergency generators that provided 100 kw each total power output was 2 280 kw at 230 volts armament thumb a bf 109t 1 type i would have carried ship was to have been armed with twelve l 65 anti aircraft guns in six twin mounts three forward and three aft of island and funnel these guns had a total of 4 800 rounds or 400 rounds per gun 10 5 cm guns fired two types of projectiles a high explosive shell and a incendiary round both types of ammunition used a single propellant charge rpc 32 charge guns could elevate to 80 degrees and could hit targets flying at when guns were used to engage surface targets they could hit targets away at an elevation of 45 degrees there were also to have been twenty anti aircraft guns also in double mounts these guns were placed along both sides of flight deck and had a total of 40 000 shells 3 7 cm guns fired high explosive shells at a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute and a muzzle velocity of 1 000 m s 3 281 ft s guns could elevate to 85 degrees and hit targets flying at although tracers were limited to anti aircraft battery was rounded out by twenty eight to thirty six guns in usual flakvierling quadruple mounts supplied by a store of up to 72 000 rounds groner pp 73 74 these guns fired at a rate of 480 shells per minute cyclic but were limited in practice to around 200 rounds per minute shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of between 800 835 m s 2 625 2 740 ft s depending on type of shell fired effective ceiling of guns was at 85 degrees elevation ship was designed to carry 18 ju 87 stuka dive bombers and 24 bf 109 ju 87s were to have been e variant which was a navalized version of ju and were modified for catapult launches and were equipped with arresting gear kay couper p 157 bf 109 fighters were a navalized version of e model designated as bf 109t their wings were longer than land based model to allow for shorter take off
