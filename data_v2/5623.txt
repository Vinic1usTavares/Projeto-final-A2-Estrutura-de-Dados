three seasons you can figure who i ve gone to and who might be coming back he also said that tenth season would be about reuniting fan favorite actors to come back production conception creators murphy and falchuk began working on american horror story before their fox series glee began production murphy wanted to do opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on series he stated i went from nip tuck to glee so it made sense that i wanted to do something challenging and dark and i always had loved as brad had horror genre so it just was a natural for me falchuk was intrigued by idea of putting a different angle on horror genre stating that their main goal in creating series was to scare viewers you want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards he said in february 2011 fx officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from ryan murphy and brad falchuk with both murphy and falchuk writing and murphy directing dante di loreto was announced as executive producer production on series began in april 2011 in july 2011 fx officially announced project had been picked up to become a full series from beginning murphy and falchuk

actors who starred in first season would be returning people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters creatures monsters etc harmons stories are done people who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters he announced in november 2012 fx chief executive john landgraf described unique format of series stating t he notion of doing an anthological series of miniseries with a repertory cast has proven groundbreaking wildly successful and will prove to be trendsetting at 2013 paleyfest falchuk compared series to horror films it does demand a little bit of compassion at end because you fall in love with these characters in a different way than you would in a movie he said if you want to kill everybody in a movie except one person you can kind of get away with that but if you re looking to do a horror tv show you have a different responsibility to characters because audience has a different affection for them murphy then explained process of planning a series season takes about a year we come up with story first and then we come up with characters he said it is a repertory company so we ll move people around and sometimes there won t yet be a role for somebody like when we started second season i really had no idea that dylan mcdermott would be person to play sarah s son but deeper we got i thought that would work great in an august 2015 article for entertainment weekly murphy revealed that show is producing two seasons a year first being broadcast late in year and second early in next year he explained we re doing something that
