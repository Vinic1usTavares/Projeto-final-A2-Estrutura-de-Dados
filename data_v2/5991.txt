smalltooth sand tiger or ragged tooth odontaspis ferox is a species of mackerel shark in family with a patchy but worldwide distribution in tropical and warm temperate waters they usually inhabit deepwater rocky habitats though they are occasionally encountered in shallow water and have been known to return to same location year after year this rare species is often mistaken for much more common grey nurse shark carcharias taurus from which it can be distinguished by its first dorsal fin which is larger than second and placed further forward it grows to at least 4 1 m 13 5 ft in length very little is known of biology and behavior of smalltooth sand tiger it is an active predator of benthic bony fishes invertebrates and cartilaginous fishes this species is thought to be ovoviviparous with oophagous embryos like other mackerel sharks in contrast to its formidable size and appearance this shark is harmless having never been known to behave aggressively towards humans concern exists that its numbers are declining due to human activities in mediterranean and elsewhere though existing data are inadequate for a full assessment of its conservation status taxonomy and phylogeny smalltooth sand tiger was originally described as squalus ferox by italian french naturalist antoine risso in 1810 based on a specimen from nice france in 1950 gilbert percy whitley described o herbsti from australian specimens separating them from o ferox on basis of dentition and absence of spots leonard compagno synonymized two species in 1984 as subsequently discovered pacific specimens had blurred whitley s distinguishing characters specific epithet ferox is latin for fierce other common names for this shark include blue nurse shark fierce shark herbst s nurse shark and sand tiger shark a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial dna performed by naylor et al in 1997 suggests that smalltooth sand tiger and its relative bigeye sand tiger o are more closely related to thresher sharks than to grey nurse shark to which it bears a strong resemblance if true this would indicate that similarities between this species and grey nurse shark arose as result of convergent evolution fossil teeth belonging to smalltooth sand tiger have been found from lower pliocene from 5 3 to 3 6 million years ago mya in deposits in italy and venezuela description smalltooth sand tiger has a bulky body with a long bulbous slightly flattened snout eyes are medium sized with large round pupils as opposed to slit like in grey nurse shark and lack nictitating membranes mouth is large and filled with projecting teeth each tooth has a narrow tall central cusp flanked by two or three pairs of lateral cusplets some 48 56 tooth rows are in upper jaw and 36 46 tooth rows are in lower jaw front large teeth in upper jaw are separated from lateral teeth by two to five intermediate teeth fins are broad based and angular in shape first dorsal fin is larger than second and placed closer to pectoral fins than pelvic fins caudal fin is strongly asymmetrical with upper lobe much longer than lower coloration is gray to gray brown above and lighter below juveniles are uniform in color with darker fin margins while adults often exhibit dark spots or blotches that vary widely in pattern size and density coloration also appears to vary by region with some individuals from mediterranean displaying a patchy piebald pattern smalltooth sand tiger attains a maximum length of 4 1 m 13 5 ft and a maximum weight of 289 kg 637 lbs there are unconfirmed reports of much larger individuals from island off colombia distribution and habitat thumb smalltooth sand tiger in flower garden banks national marine sanctuary florida smalltooth sand tigers have been caught at widely scattered locations throughout world indicating a possibly distribution in eastern atlantic ocean it is known from bay of biscay south to morocco including mediterranean sea azores and canary islands in western atlantic it has been reported from off north carolina and florida usa yucatan peninsula mexico and fernando de noronha brazil it occurs throughout indian ocean from south africa madagascar and tanzania in west to maldives and southwest indian ridge in east in northern pacific it is known from off japan hawaii california and colombia and in southern pacific it is known from new caledonia eastern australia and new zealand in new zealand this species can be found off coasts of bay of plenty new plymouth and hawkes bay it has also been filmed near raoul island typically regarded as a deepwater species smalltooth sand tigers have been caught down to 880 m 2 900 ft they are usually found near bottom in rocky boulder strewn regions on continental shelves and upper continental slope as well as around submarine ridges and mountains species has been reported near drop offs of rocky or coral reefs and in upper layers of open ocean in mediterranean smalltooth sand tigers occur at depths less than 250 m 820 ft including at depths accessible to divers they have been seen swimming over sandy flats at cocos island and fernando de noronha temperature range favored by this species is 6 20 degc 43 63 degf in hot climates they are found below thermocline in cooler water biology and ecology thumb upright 0 8 left smalltooth sand tiger at northampton seamount in open ocean this species is strongly associated with submarine ridges and seamounts smalltooth sand tiger is a strong swimming shark that may be encountered singly or in aggregations of up to five individuals catch records suggest this species may cover long distances in oceanic waters along underwater ridges or hopping between seamounts it has a very large oily liver which allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in water column with minimal effort at a location called shark point off beirut lebanon small groups of smalltooth sand tigers appear every summer on rocky reefs at a depth of 30 45 m 100 150 ft same individuals have been documented returning to this site year after year their purpose there is unknown being speculated to relate to mating when confronted these sharks have been observed to stall gape their mouths turn around and shake their tails towards perceived threat adult smalltooth sand tigers have no known predators though they are bitten by cookiecutter sharks isistius brasiliensis a known parasite is tapeworm gracile which infests shark s spiral valve intestine carcass of a 3 7 m long 12 1 ft female found off fuerteventura in canary islands contained a number of eels parasitica inside her heart body cavity and back muscles whether eels contributed to shark s death is unknown feeding thumb a smalltooth sand tiger at a hydrothermal vent on kasuga 2 submarine volcano smaller individuals such as this tend to remain in deeper water compared to grey nurse shark dentition of smalltooth sand tiger is less robust and lacks specialized cutting and crushing teeth suggesting that it tends to tackle smaller prey diet of smalltooth sand tiger consists of bottom dwelling bony fishes such as rockfish spp invertebrates such as squid shrimp and possibly marine isopods and cartilaginous fishes including rays and chimaeras largest known prey item taken by this species was a 1 3 m long 4 3 ft kitefin shark dalatias licha found inside stomach of a 2 9 m long 9 5 ft male from new caledonia life history no pregnant smalltooth sand tigers have ever been found this species is presumed to be ovoviviparous as in other mackerel sharks 1996 described a 3 6 m 11 8 ft female from gulf of california that contained hundreds of ova in her right ovary which would support embryos being oophagous whether embryos also cannibalize each other as in grey nurse shark is unknown size at birth is estimated to be 1 0 1 1 m 3 3 3 6 ft with a few recorded exceptions juveniles are found in deep water and only adults are present above a depth of 200 m 660 ft this may serve to reduce predation on young individuals by large shallow water predators such as great white shark carcharodon carcharias males mature at a length of 2 0 2 5 m 6 6 8 2 ft and females at a length of 3 0 3 5 m 9 4 11 5 ft faint scars seen on some individuals may be related to courtship human interactions encounters with divers have shown that despite their size smalltooth sand tigers are docile and do not react aggressively even when closely approached this species is taken as bycatch in gillnets and bottom trawls and on longlines most captures occur in mediterranean and off japan it is usually discarded when caught except in japan where meat is consumed though considered very inferior to grey nurse shark and liver oil is used fins jaws and cartilage are also of value discoveries beginning in 1970s of smalltooth sand tigers in shallow water have raised urgent conservation concerns as this species is apparently more vulnerable to human activity than previously believed at present data are insufficient for international union for conservation of nature to assess worldwide conservation status of this species it has been assessed as vulnerable in australian waters due to a decline over 50 in catches off new south wales since 1970s in june 2018 new zealand department of conservation classified smalltooth sand tiger as at risk naturally uncommon with qualifier threatened overseas under new zealand threat classification system populations of this species in mediterranean are also believed to have declined due to a combination of habitat degradation overfishing pollution and human disturbance smalltooth sand tiger has been protected by australian government since 1984 this came about concurrently with protection for grey nurse shark which had been decimated in australian waters so as to prevent any claims of confusing one species for other however these regulations have proven difficult to enforce references external links shark references com species description of odontaspis ferox
