byzantine bulgarian war of 894 896 also called trade war was fought between bulgarian empire and byzantine empire as a result of decision of byzantine emperor leo vi to move bulgarian market from constantinople to thessaloniki which would greatly increase expenses of bulgarian merchants following defeat of byzantine army in initial stages of war in 894 leo vi sought aid from magyars who at time inhabited steppes to north east of bulgaria aided by byzantine navy in 895 magyars invaded dobrudzha and defeated bulgarian troops simeon i called for truce and deliberately protracted negotiations with byzantines until securing assistance of pechenegs cornered between bulgarians and magyars suffered a crushing defeat at hands of bulgarian army and had to migrate westwards settling in pannonia with magyar threat eliminated simeon led his hosts south and routed byzantine army in battle of boulgarophygon in summer of 896 which forced byzantium to agree to bulgarian terms war ended with a peace treaty which restored bulgarian market in constantinople and confirmed bulgarian domination in balkans byzantine empire was obliged to pay bulgaria an annual tribute in exchange for return of captured byzantine soldiers and civilians under treaty byzantines also ceded an area between black sea and strandzha mountains to bulgaria despite several violations treaty formally lasted

underwent major changes christianization of country and admission of disciples of saints cyril and methodius which marked beginning of creation and consolidation of medieval bulgarian literature and alphabet following intense negotiations with papacy in rome and ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople bulgaria converted to eastern orthodox christianity which caused discontent among part of nobility who directly associated new religion with byzantine empire and feared that country would fall under byzantine influence during council of preslav in 893 assembled after unsuccessful attempt of boris i s eldest son vladimir rasate r 889 893 to restore traditional bulgar religion it was decided that old bulgarian would replace greek as language of church and byzantine clergy would be banished and replaced with bulgarians council sealed boris i s ambitions to secure cultural and religious independence from byzantine empire and calmed down concerns among nobility it was also decided that his third son simeon born after christianization and called child of peace would become next prince of bulgaria these events brought an end to byzantine hopes to exert influence over newly christianized country prelude right thumb 300px alt a page from a medieval manuscript a bulgarian delegation and leo vi madrid skylitzes in 894 stylianos zaoutzes and leading minister of leo vi wise r 886 912 convinced emperor to move bulgarian market from constantinople to thessaloniki that move affected not only private interests but also international commercial importance of bulgaria and principle of byzantine bulgarian trade regulated with treaty of 716 and later agreements on most favoured nation basis bulgarian merchants were allowed to live in constantinople resided in their own colony and paid favourable taxes city was a major destination of trade routes from all over europe and asia and transfer of bulgarian market to thessaloniki cut short direct access to goods from east which under new circumstances bulgarians would have to buy through middlemen who were close associates of stylianos zaoutzes in thessaloniki bulgarians were also forced to pay higher tariffs to sell their goods enriching zaoutzes cronies byzantine chronicler theophanes continuatus described reasons for conflict as follows ousting of merchants from constantinople was a heavy blow for bulgarian economic interests merchants complained to simeon i who in turn raised issue to leo vi but appeal was left unanswered simeon who according to byzantine chroniclers was seeking a pretext to declare war and to implement his plans to seize byzantine throne attacked provoking what has sometimes been called inappropriately first commercial war in europe however many historians including vasil zlatarski and john fine consider those claims unlikely arguing that in beginning of his reign simeon needed to consolidate his power and imperial ambitions had not yet been crystallised therefore his military intervention was a defensive act to protect bulgarian commercial interests initial campaigns and magyar intervention in autumn of 894 simeon i launched an invasion of byzantine thrace taking advantage of byzantium s engagements with arabs to east which had left balkan provinces vulnerable leo vi hastily assembled an army under generals and and many archons which included imperial guard that consisted of khazar mercenaries in ensuing battle in theme of macedonia modern eastern thrace probably around adrianople byzantines were defeated and their commanders perished most of khazars were captured and simeon had their noses cut and sent them in capital constantinople for shame of romans i e byzantines bulgarians looted region and retired to north taking many captives this failure urged byzantines to seek aid from magyars who at time inhabited steppes between dnieper and danube leo vi sent his envoy nicetas to magyar leaders arpad and kurszan in 894 or 895 to give presents and incite them against bulgarians at same time in autumn of 894 leo vi sent one in regensburg to arnulf of carinthia king of east francia while no records have survived of that mission s purpose it was most likely a pre emptive move to discourage a german bulgarian alliance which existed between arnulf and simeon i s predecessor vladimir rasate in beginning of 895 talented general nikephoros phokas elder was summoned to constantinople and sent against bulgarians at head of a large army while simeon concentrated his forces along southern border to confront phokas byzantine navy under admiral eustathios argyros sailed to danube delta to assist magyars believing that simeon i would back off leo vi sent an envoy constantinacios to propose peace simeon i who had studied in university of constantinople and was familiar with byzantine diplomacy was suspicious of byzantine rapprochement charged constantinacios with espionage and put him into custody danube was barred with an iron chain to impede movement of byzantine navy and bulk of army was dislocated northwards byzantines however managed to break chain and transported magyar hordes south of river magyars led by arpad s son liuntika ravaged dobrudzha and dealt a heavy defeat on bulgarian army led personally by simeon i simeon sought refuge in strong fortress of drastar while magyars pillaged and looted unopposed reaching outskirts of capital preslav before retreating north magyars sold thousands of captives to byzantines truce negotiations left thumb 200px alt a medieval seal a seal of simeon i facing a difficult situation with war on two fronts simeon sent a peace proposal through admiral eustathios to buy time to deal with magyar menace promising to return byzantine captives leo vi gladly complied ordered eustathios and nikephoros phokas to retreat and sent diplomat leo choirosphaktes to bulgaria to negotiate terms that was exactly what simeon i had aimed leo choirosphaktes was detained in one fortress and was repeatedly refused an audience instead simeon i exchanged letters with him protracting negotiations showing suspicions over wording of byzantine proposals constantly seeking clarifications and adding new demands main issue was exchange of captives byzantine priority was to free prisoners captured during bulgarian campaign of 894 in one of his letters to choirosphaktes simeon i demonstrated his diplomatic skills deriding emperor choirosphaktes replied with an ambiguous answer which was used by simeon to claim that leo could not prophesy future and to refuse return of captives further prolonging negotiations defeat of magyars and battle of boulgarophygon while exchanging correspondence with leo choirosphaktes simeon sent envoys to forge an alliance with pechenegs eastern neighbours of magyars and in beginning of 896 bulgarians and pechenegs attacked magyar homeland on two fronts in decisive battle bulgarian army dealt a crushing defeat on magyars in steppes along southern bug river struggle was so bloody that it is said that victorious bulgarians lost 20 000 riders at same time pechenegs advanced westwards and prevented magyars from returning to their homeland blow on magyars was so heavy that they were forced to migrate further west in search of new pastures eventually settling in pannonian basin where they established powerful kingdom of hungary thumb right 300px

was either disgraced as a result of intrigues of stylianos zaoutzes or died in early 896 had to comply leo choirosphaktes and a bulgarian envoy called theodore a trusted man of simeon s were sent to constantinople to arrange transfer which was successfully implemented interpreting that as a sign of weakness simeon claimed that not all bulgarians had been released and in summer of 896 invaded thrace byzantines secured an uneasy truce with arabs and transferred to europe all themes and tagmata i e all forces of empire troops were commanded by domestic of schools leo katakalon who lacked ability of phokas two armies clashed in battle of boulgarophygon and byzantines were thoroughly routed most of soldiers perished including second in command theodosius katakalon managed to escape with a few survivors defeat was so grave that one byzantine soldier retired from society and became an ascetic under name of luke stylite byzantine sources have not recorded aftermath of battle but according to accounts of contemporary arab historian muhammad ibn jarir al tabari bulgarians marched towards constantinople leo vi was in such a panic that he considered arming arab prisoners of war and sending them against bulgarians in return for their freedom but eventually abandoned idea further negotiations followed until byzantines agreed to bulgarian demands aftermath thumb right 300px alt

simeon i did violate it following sack of thessaloniki in 904 extracting further territorial concessions in macedonia bulgarian monarch was satisfied with results and considered that he had superiority over byzantine empire to achieve his political ambitions to assume throne in constantinople despite success however simeon i realized that there was still a lot to do in order to prevail over empire for good he needed his own political and ideological base and launched an ambitious construction programme in preslav so that it could rival constantinople in addition simeon i took precautions to reduce byzantine influence over western balkans by imposing his authority over principality of serbia in return for recognizing petar gojnikovic as its ruler devastation in dobrudzha at hands of magyars indicated how vulnerable bulgaria was to attacks from north under influence of byzantine diplomacy that experience paid off well in 917 when simeon managed to counter byzantine efforts to ally with serbs or pechenegs and forced them to fight alone in battle of achelous where byzantines were soundly defeated in one of biggest disasters in byzantine history see also byzantine
