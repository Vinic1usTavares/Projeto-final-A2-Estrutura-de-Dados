august 6 2013 if it means a lot to you was released to radio on september 29 2014 critical reception and legacy thomas nassiff of absolutepunk called homesick a record that is honest and entertaining despite how repetitive and dense it may be nassiff went on to say that album wouldn t appeal to public but it would be welcomed with open arms by band s fans when referring to album s lyrics nassiff called album a concept one with a theme of glory of being a musician which encompasses having to be away from home for a period of time downfall of us all as nassiff put it gets listener psyched for rest of album rock on request reviewer anthony avina furthered this comment by naming songs welcome to family and title track as examples of band showing off their wide range of talent while producing a harmonious album that band s fans will instantly fall in love with avina noted album had a unique sound that has elements from other bands such as chiodos petteri for rockfreaks net appreciate s way these guys fuse metalcore and pop punk seamlessly together adding that many songs are plagued by an overtly formulaic approach but when it works homesick is one of catchiest listens you ll experience this year punknews org reviewer elliot said album had an undeniable quality that is melodic competence he viewed a cappella intro to downfall of us all as being a little gimmicky while have faith in me was called a tribute to blink 182 despite noting that three of songs stray from a format that other songs on album share he referred to them as being not very impressive allmusic reviewer james christopher monger said downfall of us all would gain an extra life in countless montages on mtv reality shows and 30 second cola commercials monger said that album consisted of perfectly executed and fairly standard clean vocal post hardcore emo pop which shows limitations of genre monger called backing vocals exciting at first but felt that they eventually dissolve into waves of distortion mid album becoming an audio equivalent of an energy drink crash final track if it means a lot to you as monger noted was different from preceding tracks as they were deafening ultimately forgettable over compressed slabs of twentysomething angst sputnikmusic s john hanson said album was an incredibly derivative and plodding record that was filled with laughable moments he also noted band haven t seemed to progress that basic combination of ideas in combining pop punk and metalcore and that intro to downfall of us all is just one example of embarrassing decisions accolades homesick was voted
