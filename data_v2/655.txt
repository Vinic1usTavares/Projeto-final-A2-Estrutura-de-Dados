norris edwin bradbury 30 may 1909 20 august 1997 was an american physicist who served as director of los alamos national laboratory for 25 years from 1945 to 1970 he succeeded robert oppenheimer who personally chose bradbury for position of director after working closely with him on manhattan project during world war ii bradbury was in charge of final assembly of gadget detonated in july 1945 for trinity test bradbury took charge at los alamos at a difficult time staff were leaving in droves living conditions were poor and there was a possibility that laboratory would close he managed to persuade enough staff to stay and got university of california to renew contract to manage laboratory he pushed continued development of nuclear weapons transforming them from laboratory devices to production models numerous improvements made them safer more reliable and easier to store and handle and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel in 1950s bradbury oversaw development of thermonuclear weapons although a falling out with edward teller over priority given to their development led to creation of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory lawrence livermore laboratory in later years he branched out constructing los alamos meson physics facility to develop laboratory s role in nuclear science and during space race of 1960s laboratory developed nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application nerva bradbury science museum is named in his honor early life norris bradbury was born in santa barbara california on 30 may 1909 one of four children of edwin pearly and his wife elvira nee clausen one sister died as an infant and family adopted twins bobby and betty both of whom served in united states marine corps during world war ii bradbury was educated at hollywood high school and chaffey high school in ontario california graduating at age of 16 he then attended pomona college in claremont california from which he graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor of arts ba in chemistry in 1929 this earned him membership of phi beta kappa society at pomona he met lois platt an english literature major who was sister of his college roommate they were married in 1933 and had three sons james john and david bradbury became interested in physics and did graduate work at university of california berkeley where he was a teaching fellow from 1929 to 1931 and then a whiting foundation fellow from 1931 to 1932 he submitted a phd thesis on studies on mobility of gaseous ions under supervision of leonard b loeb and was awarded a national research council fellowship as well as supervising bradbury s thesis loeb who had served as a naval reservist during world war i encouraged bradbury to apply for a commission as a naval reservist bradbury s commission as an ensign was signed by lieutenant commander chester w nimitz who was head of naval reserve officer training corps at berkeley at time after two years at massachusetts institute of technology bradbury became an assistant professor of physics at stanford university in 1935 rising to become an associate professor in 1938 and a full professor in 1943 he became an expert on electrical conductivity of gases properties of ions and behavior of atmospheric electricity publishing in journals including physical review journal of applied physics journal of chemical physics and journal of atmospheric electricity and terrestrial magnetism he invented bradbury nielsen shutter a type of electrical ion gate widely used in mass spectrometry in both time of flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers world war ii bradbury was called up for service in world war ii in early 1941 although navy allowed him to stay at stanford until end of academic year he was then sent to naval proving ground at dahlgren virginia to work on external ballistics already working at dahlgren were loeb and commander deak parsons thumb right trinity test july 1945 bradbury stands next to partially assembled gadget atop test tower in june 1944 bradbury received orders from parsons who was now deputy director of manhattan project s los alamos laboratory to report to albuquerque new mexico parsons explained that he needed bradbury to work on explosive lenses required by an implosion type nuclear weapon bradbury was less than enthusiastic about prospect but he was a naval officer and ultimately agreed to go at los alamos bradbury became head of e 5 implosion experimentation group which put him in charge of implosion field test program in august laboratory s director robert oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganisation e 5 became part of george kistiakowsky s new explosives division x division and was renumbered x 1 at this point bradbury was leading some of most critical work at laboratory as it struggled with jets that spoiled perfect spherical shape desired for implosion process these were examined with a combination of magnetic x ray and rala techniques in march 1945 oppenheimer created project alberta under parsons to carry out manhattan project s ultimate mission preparation and delivery of nuclear weapons in combat bradbury was transferred to project alberta to head fat man assembly group in july 1945 bradbury supervised preparation of gadget as bomb was known at trinity nuclear test for me to say bradbury later recalled i had any deep emotional thoughts about trinity i didn t i was just damned pleased that it went off director of los alamos thumb right bradbury left sits at a table with leslie groves of armed forces special weapons project center and eric jette oppenheimer submitted his resignation as director of los alamos laboratory but remained until a successor could be found director of manhattan project major general leslie r groves jr wanted someone with both a solid academic background and a high standing within project oppenheimer recommended bradbury this was agreeable to groves who liked fact that as a naval officer bradbury was both a military man and a scientist bradbury accepted offer on a six month trial basis parsons arranged for bradbury to be quickly discharged from navy which awarded him legion of merit for his wartime services he remained in naval reserve though ultimately retiring in 1961 with rank of captain on 16 october 1945 there was a ceremony at los alamos at which groves presented laboratory with army navy e award and presented oppenheimer with a certificate of appreciation bradbury became laboratory s second director following day first months of bradbury s directorship were particularly difficult he had hoped that atomic energy act of 1946 would be quickly passed by congress and wartime manhattan project would be superseded by a new permanent organization it soon became clear that this would take more than six months president harry s truman did not sign act creating atomic energy commission into law until 1 august 1946 and it did not become active until 1 january 1947 in meantime groves legal authority to act was limited most of scientists at los alamos were eager to return to their laboratories and universities and by february 1946 all of wartime division heads had left but a talented core remained darol froman became head of robert bacher s g division now renamed m division eric jette became responsible for chemistry and metallurgy john h manley for physics george placzek for theory max roy for explosives and roger wagner for ordnance number of personnel at los alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3 000 to around 1 000 but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation to make matters worse water pipe to los alamos froze and water had to be supplied by tanker trucks despite reduced staff bradbury still had to provide support for operation crossroads nuclear tests in pacific thumb left bradbury left in front of kiwi b4 a reactor used to power a nuclear rocket bradbury pushed continued development of nuclear weapons to take them from laboratory devices to production models there were numerous improvements that could make them more safe reliable and easy to store and handle and make more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel while bradbury gave priority to improved fission weapons research still continued on alarm clock a boosted nuclear weapon and super a thermonuclear weapons design new fission designs were tested during operation sandstone in 1948 mark 4 nuclear bomb became first nuclear weapon to be mass produced on an assembly line as future became more certain bradbury began looking for a new site for laboratory away from crowded town center in 1948 bradbury submitted a proposal to atomic energy commission for a new 107 million facility on south mesa linked to town by a new bridge over canyon all this time bradbury remained nominally a professor in absentia at stanford los alamos laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with university of california but a clause in contract allowed university to terminate contract three months after end of war university duly served notice but bradbury managed to get it rescinded and in 1948 contract was renewed in 1951 he became a professor at university of california by 1951 laboratory had come up with teller ulam design and thermonuclear tests were conducted during operation greenhouse tensions between bradbury and edward teller over degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development led to creation of a second nuclear weapons laboratory lawrence livermore laboratory in later years bradbury branched out constructing los alamos meson physics facility to develop laboratory s role in nuclear science during space race of 1960s laboratory worked on project rover developing nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application nerva laboratory demonstrated feasibility and value of nuclear rocket propulsion for many years bradbury was responsible for much of administration of town of los alamos town established impressive health and education facilities eventually new technical area was built outside town and on 18 february 1957 security gates were taken down finally town became an incorporated community and director s civic responsibilities ended in 1966 bradbury was awarded department of defense medal for distinguished public service for exceptionally meritorious civilian service to armed forces and united states of america in a position of great responsibility as director los alamos scientific laboratory his citation went on to say that outstanding international reputation of los alamos laboratory is directly attributable to his exceptional leadership united states is indebted to dr bradbury and his laboratory to a very large degree for our present nuclear capability he also received enrico fermi award in 1970 later life thumb right bradbury with his predecessor robert oppenheimer at los alamos national laboratory in 1964 bradbury retired as director of los alamos laboratory in 1970 his successor harold agnew invited him to become a senior consultant but bradbury declined offer although he did serve as a consultant for other government agencies including national academy of sciences and as a member of boards of los alamos medical center first national bank of santa fe los alamos ymca and santa fe neurological society in 1969 governor of new mexico david cargo appointed bradbury as a regent of university of new mexico but this was a turbulent time for university in response to kent state shootings in may 1970 students and antiwar activist jane fonda marched on home of ferrel heady president of university of new mexico when he refused to meet with them students called a strike classes were cancelled rallies were held and students occupied student union building cargo called in new mexico national guard to remove them and eleven people were bayoneted cargo s successor bruce king replaced bradbury and another regent in mid 1990s bradbury accidentally hit his leg while chopping firewood gangrene set in and his right leg was amputated below knee it spread to his left leg and part of his left foot was amputated leaving him in a wheelchair disease eventually proved fatal and he died on 20 august 1997 he was survived by his wife lois who died in january 1998 and his three sons a funeral service was held in los alamos and he was buried at pines cemetery in los alamos notes references external links 1985 audio interview with norris bradbury by martin sherwin voices of manhattan project category 1909 births category 1997
