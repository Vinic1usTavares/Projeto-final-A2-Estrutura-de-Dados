upon restoring staff of demnos shadax seeks out and frees eleanor from imprisonment and destroys morbius with staff development conception development of solstice was initiated by programmer mike webb of software creations solstice instruction manual p 20 who desired to create a knight lore style isometric title for nes solstice is first original game to be developed within company which had previously only developed converted titles between 8 bit consoles mark wilson having previously worked as a programmer and a graphics artist for company saw webb s proposal as an opportunity to attempt role of a video game designer in spite of his personal dislike of isometric games up to that point wilson thought it sensible to create an isometric title as company s first original work as no such format had previously been attempted on nes over course of four weeks wilson designed entire game as sketches and notes on paper often within a mcdonald s on oxford road all game s item positions and events were placed on a master map hand drawn on a very large sheet of graph paper and were based on wilson s understanding of what player might think or need at any particular point this detailed approach put wilson at odds with webb who failed to see why such an amount of time would be taken to design a game as opposed to expediently inserting rooms into a map at random at one point webb presented wilson with an alternate map created by his girlfriend previous night which consisted of 255 randomly connected empty rooms out of guilt for their furious arguments and pleasure with final product wilson would ultimately give webb a co designer credit in game s attract mode screens wilson would later regret this action during a subsequent interview with wilson at microprose one of interviewers falsely identified webb as game s sole designer art during game s early stages of development player character shadax appeared as a nondescript purple rectangle shadax sprite was eventually designed by wilson csg imagesoft inc 1990 making of solstice in creating game s setting and aesthetic wilson acknowledged slim capacity for storytelling on nintendo s cheapest available cartridge and thus focused on game s atmosphere which he says traded on simplest and most basic of fantasy ideas on stylistic influences wilson stated that all of usual suspects at that time probably should be included as sources from lord of rings to excalibur music thumb right a sample of opening theme of solstice composed by tim follin game s music was composed by tim follin primary background music was made to be atmospheric and dark while opening theme was made to be powerful on his approach to score follin commented that folk melody style he had previously used for ghouls n ghosts was particularly suited for solstice due to game s fantasy oriented title and setting title theme s changing moods and phases were an attempt by follin to keep track interesting follin felt that constant evolution required to keep music in general interesting was imperative in video game music due to its lack of vocals and performance at time during development a colleague of follin played for him several works of game composer rob hubbard which convinced follin that technical boundaries of contemporary generation of hardware have been reached and refocused his attention from score s technique to composition while follin retrospectively identified title theme to be his favourite among his own compositions he felt that his work on in game music could have been improved to be a lot more spacious and interesting as it looped too short and became irritating quite quickly publishing game s development spanned course of 20 months while solstice was given an early demonstration to nintendo software creations owner richard kay grew impatient and quickly sold game s north american publishing rights to csg imagesoft after a response from nintendo stating their desire to publish title nintendo was given publishing rights for all other regions and resulting contract with nintendo would lead to other high profile nes and snes games upon receiving game s publishing rights csg demanded that shadax be changed from a wizard to a bodybuilder in a loincloth when wilson refused to make change csg then made request that shadax s beard in cutscenes be shortened and alteration was made against wilson s protest package art designed by carol roy was lambasted by wilson as having nothing to do with game that was written and he deemed it inferior to a proposed cover created by neal sutton that had already been supplied to csg he also derided instruction booklet written by csg as a mass of illiterate and asinine drivel wilson spent game s development time attempting to obtain a contract from software creations covering his work on solstice only to be given verbal promises about percentage of profits he would receive following game s completion these promises were casually broken and wilson would not receive any monetary gain from title s sales wilson left software creations following this development and struggled to obtain work for next two years release and promotion solstice was announced in april 1990 and was released in july 1990 in north america and europe csg s advertisement campaign for solstice in north america consisted of a photograph of what wilson described as an oiled up bodybuilder with long hair wearing pink posing trunks which he called embarrassingly bad first 5 000 customers to order solstice from csg imagesoft received a free player s pak consisting of an 8 mm video tape on making of solstice a player s score card trading cards and colored stickers solstice was featured in 1990 nintendo world championships with first press coverage of game in march 1990 by dallas morning news as part of championships reception solstice was met with a positive critical reception upon release richard leadbetter of computer and video games described gameplay as excellent with some brain bending puzzles and nice power ups for shadax s abilities paul glancey also of computer and video games described solstice as a big game with an awful lot of secrets to discover and compared game s puzzles to those of knight lore julian rignall of mean machines also made a positive comparison to knight lore and noted that some of puzzles were very devious however matt regan also of mean machines stated that while solstice is a challenging game that puzzle fans should find interesting excitement fades as shifting blocks to stand on or to prevent attacks of a nasty becomes boring while marc and ed semrad of electronic gaming monthly respectively considered game to be unique and a refreshing change of pace from all of me too type puzzle games publication s four reviewers collectively found controls difficult and awkward robin wyles of raze compared game s visuals and gameplay to those of cadaver and saw solstice as an admirable attempt to relive knight lore days that was quite refreshing in face of nes s lack of isometric perspective titles however he argued that game s quantity of puzzles negatively impacted their variety and felt that puzzles were a bit too easy to solve which reduces its long term appeal leadbetter described graphics as excellent throughout with some of best backdrops and sprites ever seen in this type of game and glancey also felt game s graphics were really lovely rignall regan and semrad described graphics as great and steve harris and ken sushi x williams of egm said game was beautiful while wyles appreciated game s isometric perspective he saw colour schemes as unimaginative game s score was singled out for praise leadbetter proclaimed that renowned tim follin comes up trumps yet again with some brilliant atmospheric scores and both he and glancey along with rignall considered soundtrack to be some of best they had heard on nes regan described game s soundtrack as moody and atmospheric and semrad called music fantastic wyles however described sound effects as ropey and in game background music as mediocre title theme in particular became one of follin s best known tracks in retrospect brett elston of gamesradar proclaimed that if any 8 bit song could take you on a journey this is it from its modest almost hobbit like opening to its soaring jig halfway through title screen music over all other nes music he additionally described game s primary background track as considerably more mellow but no less proficient and listenable and preferred its presence as in game music because there s no way i could play anything with that title screen going nuts nate andrews of nintendo world report said that regality of opening track provides a fantastic build up for ensuing blast which nearly forces you to take a knee under its spectacle before dropping into extended kicking jig then moving into rest of prog y soundtrack layton shumway of venturebeat remarked that theme sounds like a lost track from a yes album and that it psyches you out with its single note fanfare intro instantly kicks into high gear with cascading synth lines then settles into a propulsive 6 8 rock beat sequel a sequel to solstice titled equinox was announced on january 1992 initially for a summer release that year and was released for super nes on november 1993 game s plot centers on shadax s son who must rescue shadax from his treacherous apprentice sonia equinox instruction booklet pp 4 5 game consists of 450 rooms split between eight dungeons and also features an isometric perspective but includes a rotatable camera that incorporates mode 7 effects tim follin reprised his role as composer and was joined in this duty by his brother geoff equinox was released to generally
