brimstone or harmonic convergence wong spoke about how character of catherine black changed saying there s a different relationship between frank and his family this season because of separation i think that will not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it wong also stated we don t want to have audience expect to see a serial killer every week we would like to make it so that it s a surprise to them just like it is a surprise when you watch x files producer john peter kousakis has noted that first and second seasons and third season after those were markedly different

producer ken horton felt that change in focus for season two arose as first season s focus on serial killers had overpowered its storytelling making it necessary to focus attention elsewhere instead focus switched from external forces and villains to internal workings of millennium group turn of tide 04 10 05 20 series musical supervisor mark snow found that morgan and wong brought another new element to series music of bobby darin which has been a hallmark of duo s work darin s music accompanied snow s scores in a number of episodes often as diegetic music being listened to by lance

an inspired choice that led to arguably finest episodic run ever produced under series creator chris carter s ten thirteen productions banner uhlich found that season was torn between episodes remaining true to carter led first season s serial killer of week format and make it up as you go along approach to storytelling and morgan and wong s attempt to introduce a continuous story arc which lent a sealed off feel to season finding that latter approach lead to a compulsively watchable but largely dated end result dvd talk s bill gibron rated season overall four and a half stars out of five finding that new thematic direction was right on money gibron felt that season was truly ahead of its time it predates and predicts such fashionable fads as da vinci code omens of terrorist evil

blade of grass hand of st sebastian roosters in arcadia ego and anamnesis being seen as particularly poor in all shearman singled out season s climactic two part episodes fourth horseman and time is now as highlight of season finding that morgan and wong took a considerable risk with storyline as they believed series would be cancelled at end of season but believing that episodes gained from this
