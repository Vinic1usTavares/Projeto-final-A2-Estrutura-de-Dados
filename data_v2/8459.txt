andersen was born in odense denmark on 2 april 1805 to hans andersen a shoemaker and anne marie an only child andersen shared a love of literature with his father who read him arabian nights and fables of jean de la fontaine together they constructed panoramas pop up pictures and toy theatres and took long jaunts into countryside upright left thumb andersen in 1836 andersen s father died in 1816 and from then on andersen was left on his own in order to escape his poor illiterate mother he promoted his artistic inclinations and courted cultured middle class of odense singing and reciting in their drawing rooms on 4 september 1819 fourteen year old andersen left odense for copenhagen with few savings he had acquired from his performances a letter of reference to ballerina madame schall and youthful dreams and intentions of becoming a poet or an actor after three years of rejections and disappointments he finally found a patron in jonas collin director of royal theatre who believing in boy s potential secured funds from king to send andersen to a grammar school in slagelse a provincial town in west zealand with expectation that boy would continue his education at copenhagen university at appropriate time at slagelse andersen fell under tutelage of simon meisling a short stout balding thirty five year old classicist and translator of virgil s aeneid andersen was not quickest student in class and was given generous doses of meisling s contempt you re a stupid boy who will never make it meisling told him meisling is believed to be model for learned mole in thumbelina fairy tale and folklorists iona and peter opie have proposed tale as a distant tribute to andersen s confidante henriette wulff small frail hunchbacked daughter of danish translator of shakespeare who loved andersen as thumbelina loves swallow however no written evidence exists to support theory sources and inspiration thumbelina is essentially andersen s invention but takes inspiration from traditional tale of tom thumb both tales begin with a childless woman consulting a supernatural being about acquiring a child other inspirations were six inch in jonathan swift s gulliver s travels voltaire s short story with its cast of huge and miniature peoples and e t a hoffmann s hallucinatory erotic tale meister in which a tiny lady a span in height torments hero a tiny girl figures in andersen s prose fantasy a journey on foot from holmen s canal to east point of 1828 and a literary image similar to andersen s tiny being inside a flower is found in e t a hoffmann s princess brambilla 1821 publication and critical reception andersen published two installments of his first collection of fairy tales told for children in 1835 first in may and second in december thumbelina was first published in december installment by c a reitzel on 16 december 1835 in copenhagen thumbelina was first tale in booklet which included two other tales naughty boy and traveling companion story was republished in collected editions of andersen s works in 1850 and 1862 first reviews of seven tales of 1835 did not appear until 1836 and danish critics were not enthusiastic informal chatty style of tales and their lack of morals were considered inappropriate in children s literature one critic however acknowledged thumbelina to be most delightful fairy tale you could wish for critics offered andersen no further encouragement one literary journal never mentioned tales at all while another advised andersen not to waste his time writing fairy tales one critic stated that andersen lacked usual form of that kind of poetry and would not study models andersen felt he was working against their preconceived notions of what a fairy tale should be and returned to novel writing believing it was his true calling critical reaction to 1835 tales was so harsh that he waited an entire year before publishing little mermaid and emperor s new clothes in third and final installment of fairy tales told for children english translations thumb upright mary howitt c 1888 in 1861 alfred translated tale into english in andersen s tales for children under title little thumb mary howitt published story as tommelise in wonderful stories for children in 1846 however she did not approve of opening scene with witch and instead had childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman who then rewarded her hostess with a barleycorn charles boner also translated tale in 1846 as little ellie while madame de chatelain dubbed child little totty in her 1852 translation editor of child s own book 1853 called child throughout little maja h w was probably translator responsible for name thumbelina his widely published volumes of andersen s tales appeared in 1864 and 1866 mrs h b translated name as little tiny in late nineteenth century in twentieth century erik christian haugaard translated name as in 1974 and jeffrey and diane crone frank translated name as in 2005 modern english translations of thumbelina are found in six volume complete edition of andersen s tales from 1940s by jean hersholt and erik christian haugaard s translation of complete tales in 1974 commentaries for fairy tale researchers and folklorists iona and peter opie thumbelina is an adventure story from feminine point of view with its moral being people are happiest with their own kind they point out that thumbelina is a passive character victim of circumstances whereas her male counterpart tom thumb one of tale s inspirations is an active character makes himself felt and exerts himself folklorist maria tatar sees thumbelina as a runaway bride story and notes that it has been viewed as an allegory about arranged marriages and a fable about being true to one s heart that upholds traditional notion that love of a prince is to be valued above all else she points out that in hindu belief a thumb sized being known as innermost self or soul dwells in heart of all beings human or animal and that concept may have migrated to european folklore and taken form as tom thumb and thumbelina both of whom seek transfiguration and redemption she detects parallels between andersen s tale and greek myth of demeter and her daughter persephone and notwithstanding pagan associations and allusions in tale notes that thumbelina repeatedly refers to christ s suffering and resurrection and christian concept of salvation andersen biographer jackie wullschlager indicates that thumbelina was first of andersen s tales to dramatize sufferings of one who is different and as a result of being different becomes object of mockery it was also first of andersen s tales to incorporate swallow as symbol of poetic soul and andersen s identification with swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble roger sale believes andersen expressed his feelings of social and sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their little mermaid for example has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright in thumbelina andersen suggests toad beetle and mole are thumbelina s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior sale indicates they are not inferior to thumbelina but simply different he suggests that andersen may have done some damage to animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority jacqueline banerjee views tale as a failure story not surprisingly she writes thumbelina is now often read as a story of specifically female empowerment susie stephens believes thumbelina herself is a grotesque and observes that grotesque in children s literature is a necessary and beneficial component that enhances psychological welfare of young reader children are attracted to cathartic qualities of grotesque she suggests sidney rosenblatt in his essay thumbelina and development of female sexuality believes tale may be analyzed from perspective of freudian psychoanalysis as story of female masturbation thumbelina herself he posits could symbolize clitoris her rose petal labia white butterfly budding genitals and mole and prince anal and vaginal openings respectively adaptations animation earliest animated version of tale is a silent black and white release by director herbert m dawley in 1924 lotte released a
