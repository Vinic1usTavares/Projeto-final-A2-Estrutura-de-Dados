piano and guitar rob sheffield of rolling stone described song s synth hook as sly stone meets eurythmics according to chris payne of billboard tedder and zancanella s influence is all over song and inches through verses before bubbling over just before chorus kicks in adam markovitz of entertainment weekly in a review of album wrote that song together with daylight have thickly produced choruses lyrically love somebody equates love and physical intimacy with levine singing i really wanna love somebody i really wanna touch somebody nate chinen of new york times described lyrical theme of song as a plea for salvation on dance floor or some other horizontal surface critical reception thumbnail right critics linked love somebody to works by british alternative rock band coldplay suzanne byrne of rte ie wrote that love somebody alongside daylight man who never lied and lucky strike are potential single releases brittany frederick of starpulse called song earnest while cameron adams of herald sun described it as coldplay trying to be katy perry similarly as adams popmatters evan sawdey wrote that love somebody is group s sky scraping coldplay moment jeremy thomas of 411 mania labeled song as one of more emotional tracks on overexposed and a rare moment where overhanging production tricks ease up just enough to make for an honest to god song with emotion and not just a laser scope aimed at billboard charts in a review of album fraser mcalpine of bbc music wrote that band had left strutting cockerel heat of their 2004 single this love for saturated rave bliss of love somebody or man who never lied according to him that s an effect of market they have chosen to contribute on billboards chris payne thought that song fades into background of other stronger tracks on overexposed adam markovitz of entertainment weekly was more critical towards levine s vocals on love somebody and wrote that singer s voice is processed in a high disaffected whine like a male rihanna or an android castrato which according to him it s ideal for tracing contours of a pop hook chart performance upon release of overexposed due to strong digital downloads love somebody debuted on south
