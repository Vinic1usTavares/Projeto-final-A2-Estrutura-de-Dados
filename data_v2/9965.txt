saying new edition doesn t quite catch that inspired spark stephen whitty of star ledger gave film three out four stars saying not only a fun cartoon but that rare thing a sequel which actually improves on original elizabeth weitzman of new york daily news gave film two out of five stars saying armed with masses of minions and an excess of despicable me 2 is guaranteed to charm anyone who s out of school and already bored soren anderson of seattle times gave film two and a half stars out of four saying it s fun it s cheerful it s lollipop colorful best of all it features lots of minion mischief which guarantees plenty of laughs but what it doesn t have is an edge peter howell of toronto star gave film two and a half stars out of four saying it feels at times as if despicable me 2 actually is minions movie coffin and renaud and returning screenwriters cinco paul and ken daurio haven t managed to come up with a dastardly plot to rival shrinking and stealing of moon from previous film stephen holden of new york times gave film two and a half stars out of five saying it is consistently diverting and so cute you ll want to pet it yet it is also weightless and lacks a center

despicable me 2 keith uhlich of time out gave film three out of five stars saying a film than its predecessor despicable me 2 delights more often than it disappoints alonso duralde of wrap gave film a negative review saying minions are still wacky scene stealers and once again we don t get nearly enough of them but gru and his daughters have been down to bad sitcom level claudia puig of usa today gave film two out of four stars saying with its predecessor having made a whopping 540 million globally it s no wonder that universal saw fit to order a sequel but it s not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly gave film a c grade saying by end every child in audience will want his or her own monster minion toy adults will just regret way that despicable me 2 betrays original film s devotion to bad guy gaiety sara stewart of new york post

reelviews gave film three out of four stars saying despicable me 2 feels like an opportunity to get together with some old friends hang out and discover what they ve been up to tom russo of boston globe gave film a positive review saying scope of toon espionage adventure goings on is surprisingly limited but filmmakers so clearly love working on these characters their creative joy is infectious stephanie merry of washington post gave film three out of four stars saying animation is beguiling particularly when lucy drives her car into ocean transforming it into a submarine that scoots around sharks and fish peter debruge of variety gave film a positive review saying while not quite as charming or unique as original despicable me 2 comes awfully close extending co directors chris renaud and pierre coffin s delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe peter hartlaub of san francisco chronicle gave film three out of four stars saying it s a credit that writing can be so funny in moment that it takes time to realize there s no cohesive story zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either characters in film or people watching in theater james rocchi of msn movies gave film four out of five stars saying heartfelt and hilarious smart and silly action packed but never violent despicable me 2 is that rare sequel that outshines its beginnings colin covert of star tribune gave film three out of four stars saying for an adult predictability could turn you blase for kids revisiting these jokes is a howl pinkie promise mary f pols of time gave film

nice and insufficiently naughty of film com gave film a 6 3 out of 10 saying despicable me 2 is fun especially near culmination structural issues aside it s impossible not to like these characters all
