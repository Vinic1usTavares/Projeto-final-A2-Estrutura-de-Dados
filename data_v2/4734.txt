2006 p 94 sources for information about hebrides and indeed much of northern scotland from 8th to 11th century are thus almost exclusively irish english or norse main norse text is which should be treated with care as it was based on oral traditions and not written down by an icelandic scribe until early 13th century english and irish sources are more contemporary but may have led to a southern bias in story especially as much of hebridean archipelago became norse speaking during period under consideration woolf 2007 p 275 archaeological record for this period is relatively scant barrett 2008 p 420 particularly in comparison to numerous neolithic and iron age finds in area scholarly interpretations of period have led to widely divergent reconstructions of viking age scotland barrett 2008 p 412 and barrett 2008 has identified four competing theories none of which he regards as proven barrett 2008 pp 419 422 it is clear that word king as used by and of rulers of norwegian descent in isles was not intended to convey sovereign rule that is that of a high king this is different from way word was used in emerging kingdom of scotland at time gregory 1881 pp 17 18 it should also be borne in mind that different kings may have ruled over very different areas and that few of them can be seen as exerting any kind of close control over this far flung sea kingdom woolf 2006 p 96 precise dates are sometimes a matter of debate amongst historians see for example woolf 2007 pp 108 09 early viking incursions in hebrides thumb folio of book of kells which may have been produced by monks of iona and taken to ireland for safekeeping after repeated viking raids of hebrides prior to viking incursions southern hebrides formed part of gaelic kingdom of or dalriada north of inner and outer hebrides were nominally under pictish control although historical record is sparse according to o corrain 1998 when and how vikings conquered and occupied isles is unknown perhaps unknowable o corrain 1998 p 25 although from 793 onwards repeated raids by vikings on british isles are recorded all islands of britain were devastated in 2008 p 24 27 with iona being sacked in 802 and 806 woolf 2007 p 57 various named viking leaders who were probably based in scotland appear in irish annals in 837 in 845 and in 847 o corrain 1998 p 5 another early reference to norse presence in irish records is that there was a king of viking scotland whose heir took an army to ireland in 848 o corrain 1998 p 24 in 9th century first references to i e foreign gaels appear this term was variously used in succeeding centuries to refer to individuals of mixed scandinavian celtic descent and or culture who became dominant in southwest scotland parts of northern england and isles woolf 2007 pp 253 296 97 according to in about 872 harald fairhair became king of a united norway and many of his opponents fled to islands of scotland including hebrides of west coast and northern isles harald pursued his enemies and incorporated northern isles into his kingdom in 875 and then perhaps a little over a decade later hebrides as well following year local viking chieftains of hebrides rebelled harald then sent ketill flatnose to subdue them which he did quickly but then he declared himself an independent king of isles a title he retained for rest of his life is also sometimes equated with a reported leader of fighting in ireland in 857 although this connection is far from definite left no successors and there is little record of succeeding four decades however woolf 2007 suggests that his appearance in sagas looks very much like a story created in later days to legitimise norwegian claims to sovereignty in region woolf 2007 p 296 there are similar problems with provenance of supposed 9th century ruler of hebrides and ancestor of clan donald it has been suggested that his appearance looks very much like product of fourteenth century propagandists from clann donald woolf 2007 p 299 house of in 870 dumbarton was besieged by and two kings of northmen who returned to dublin from britain following year with numerous captives woolf 2007 p 109 it is therefore likely that scandinavian hegemony was already significant on western coasts of scotland by then woolf 2007 p 115 is described as son of king of in fragmentary annals of ireland and o corrain 1998 argues that is viking scotland and probably includes man at this time suggesting an early date for an organised kingdom of isles o corrain 1998 pp 6 10 in same source is also recorded as having gone to aid of his father who was under assault from vikings in in about 872 o corrain 1998 p 34 died in 873 and may have been succeeded briefly by who also died that year probably died in 874 o corrain 1998 pp 35 37 a lament for a pictish king who died in 878 suggests kintyre may have been lost to his kingdom at that time woolf 2007 pp 116 17 norse may have taken isle of man in 877 and they certainly held it by 900 woolf 2007 p 141 in 902 vikings were expelled from dublin for up to a dozen years and a year later grandson of was killed in battle with forces of constantine ii in mainland scotland woolf 2007 pp 130 31

woolf 2007 pp 140 41 thumb left modern dumbarton castle site of 9th century siege by first four decades of 10th century are an obscure period so far as hebrides are concerned it is possible that who probably ruled mann during this period may have had some influence however is next king of isles on record after death of in 941 became king of northumbria and probably succeeded his cousin as king of mann woolf 2007 p 181 former is recorded as being suggesting he may have been first king of both mann and western isles of scotland who died some four decades later in 980 or 981 whilst in religious retirement on iona o corrain 1998 p 11 was succeeded by who was probably his nephew s brother then succeeded him during their lifetimes these two sons of harald are known to have launched at least two major expeditions against ireland and latter is recorded as having won battle of man in 987 iona was sacked twice in 986 and 987 s later piety notwithstanding this battle of man recorded by annals of ulster is said to have been won by and danes possibly forces directly from scandinavia under command of olaf tryggvason woolf 2007 pp 212 216 18 annals of ulster record gofraid s death in dalriada in 989 describing him as king of although it is not clear if this was a completely new term or had originally been used earlier perhaps to refer to s island kingdom woolf 2007 pp 218 19 complex geography of western scotland and lack of written records makes certainty about extent and nature of these kingdoms hard to fathom downham 2007 p 179 for example chronicle of kings of alba indicates that almost all these kings who reigned from mid 10th to late 11th century were buried on iona this may mean that iona and mull lay either within or close to emerging kingdom of scotland woolf 2007 p 198 furthermore two records in annals of innisfallen hint that western isles may not have been organised into a kingdom or earldom at this time but rather that they were ruled by assemblies of freeholders who regularly elected lawmen to preside over their public affairs woolf 2007 p 213 earls of orkney and kings of dublin thumb a posthumous sihtric coin from british museum minted at dublin at this

places on his death in 1034 these included isle of man many of other islands of denmark galloway rhinns and anglesey olaf was an dynast and it is difficult to reconcile his rule with that of norwegians who apparently came before and after him according to sagas etchingham 2001 pp 157 158 there is also an obscure reference in prophecy of berchan hinting that king of scotland may have been active in islay and arran at about this time woolf 2007 p 253 emphasising potentially fluid nature of scandinavian norse gael and scots influence during this period next recorded ruler is sigurd stout s son thorfinn mighty who took control circa 1035 until his own death some two decades later gregory 1881 p 5 continuing close alliance of isles with norway is suggested by a record from annals of tigernach for year 1058 a fleet was led by son of king of norway with of orkney hebrides and dublin to seize kingdom of england but god consented not to this woolf 2007 pp 264 266 this monarch of norway was magnus haraldsson who may have used death of thorfinn as an excuse to exert direct rule of orkney and hebrides woolf 2007 p 2004 p 68 however in mid 11th century dynast is said to be ruler of mann he was also king of dublin from 1036 1038 and 1046 1052 as well as possibly being king of rhinns in galloway woolf 2007 p 245 suggesting that overlordship of isle of man and hebrides were once

stamford bridge in 1881 p 6 and fled from there to man little is then heard of him until he succeeded in taking island from fingal in 1079 possibly with help of troops from western isles ancestor of many of succeeding rulers of mann and isles he also became king of dublin but no contemporary source refers either to him or any of his predecessors as king of mann and isles as such he was eventually ousted from dublin by and fled to islay where he died in plague of 1095 duffy 1992 p 2005 p 13 it is not clear extent to which dominance was now asserted in islands north of man but growing irish

that he had married daughter of olave red and godred s half sister it is possible that somerled first found favour with olave by helping him wrest control of northern hebrides from earls of orkney whose influence had once more spread into sudreys somerled s popularity led to his son with being heralded throughout isles save man itself as a future king of isles by thorfinn son of ottar when godred heard of this he engaged somerled s forces in naval battle of epiphany in 1156 there was no clear victor but it was subsequently agreed that godred would remain ruler of man northern inner hebrides and outer hebrides whilst somerled s young sons would nominally control southern inner hebrides kintyre and islands of clyde under their father s supervision two years later somerled s invasion of isle of man caused godred to flee to norway leaving former as undisputed ruler of entire realm gregory 1881 pp 9 2006 p 103 hebrides had been difficult to control from a distance since days of ketill flatnose and even in time of magnus barelegs it is likely that de facto control was that of local rulers rather than nominal governance from over seas somerled took this to its ultimate conclusion declaring himself an independent ruler of isles from his power base in southern hebrides and kintyre and he had in effect recreated dalriada hunter 2000 pp 104 there has been some debate
