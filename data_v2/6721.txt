eurasian bittern or great bittern botaurus stellaris is a wading bird in bittern subfamily botaurinae of heron family ardeidae there are two subspecies northern race b s stellaris breeding in parts of europe and asia as well as on northern coast of africa while southern race b s capensis is endemic to parts of southern africa it is a secretive bird seldom seen in open as it prefers to skulk in reed beds and thick vegetation near water bodies its presence is apparent in spring when booming call of male during breeding season can be heard it feeds on fish small mammals fledgling birds amphibians crustaceans and insects nest is usually built among reeds at edge of bodies of water female incubates clutch of eggs and feeds young chicks which leave nest when about two weeks old she continues to care for them until they are fully fledged some six weeks later with its specific habitat requirements and general reduction in wetlands across its range population is thought to be in decline globally however decline is slow and international union for conservation of nature has assessed its overall conservation status as being of least concern nevertheless some local populations are at risk and population of southern race has declined more dramatically and is cause for concern in united kingdom it is one of most threatened of all bird species taxonomy and etymology this species was first described as ardea stellaris botaurus as early as 1660 s by ornithologist thomas browne miscellaneous writings of sir thomas browne edited by geoffrey keynes pub cambridge university press 1931 where browne writes ardea stellaris botaurus or bitour is also common esteemed better dish in belly of one i found a frog in a hard frost at christmas another i kept in a garden 2 feeding it with fish mice in defect of whereof making a scrape for small birds bitour made shift to herself upon them and as ardea stellaris by swedish naturalist carl linnaeus in his systema naturae of 1758 it is placed in subfamily botaurinae and its closest relatives are american bittern botaurus bittern botaurus and australasian bittern botaurus two races of eurasian bittern are recognised nominate subspecies b s stellaris has a palearctic distribution and occurs across a broad swathe of europe north africa and asia while other subspecies b s capensis occurs only in southern africa name capensis was used for species found in for which no exact range was known generic name botaurus was given by english naturalist james francis stephens and is derived from medieval latin bittern itself constructed from middle english name for bird pliny gave a fanciful derivation from bos ox and taurus bull because bittern s call resembles bellowing of a bull species name stellaris is latin for starred from stella star and refers to speckled plumage its folk names often local include many variations on themes of barrel maker bog bull bog hen bog trotter bog bumper mire drum ble butter bump bitter bum bog blutter bog drum boom bird bottle bump bull of bog bull of mire bumpy cors and heather blutter most of these were onomatopoeic colloquial names for bird call was described as bumping or booming mire and bog denote bird s habitat description thumb left upright 1 2 a eurasian bittern skull bitterns are herons with bright pale buffy brown plumage covered with dark streaks and bars as its alternate name suggests this species is largest of bitterns with males being rather larger than females eurasian or great bittern is in length with a wingspan and a body mass of crown and nape are black with individual feathers rather long and loosely arranged tipped with buff narrowly barred with black sides of head and neck are a more uniform tawny buff irregularly barred with black mantle scapulars and back are of a similar colour but are more heavily barred individual feathers having black centres and barring head has a yellowish buff superciliary stripe and a brownish black stripe sides of neck are a rusty brown with faint barring chin and throat are buff central feathers on throat having longitudinal stripes of rusty brown breast and belly are yellowish buff with broad stripes of brown at side and narrow stripes in centre tail is rusty buff with black streaks in centre and black mottling near edge wings are pale rusty brown irregularly barred streaked and mottled with black plumage has a loose texture and elongated feathers on crown neck and breast can be erected powerful bill is greenish yellow with a darker tip to upper mandible eye has a yellow iris and is surrounded by a ring of greenish or bluish bare skin legs and feet are greenish with some yellow on tarsal joint and yellow soles to feet juveniles have similar plumage to adults but are somewhat paler with less distinct markings distribution and habitat breeding range of b s stellaris extends across temperate parts of europe and asia from british isles sweden and finland eastwards to sakhalin island in eastern siberia and hokkaido island in japan bird s northern extent of occurrence is around in ural mountains and in eastern siberia its southern limit is mediterranean sea black sea iran afghanistan kazakhstan mongolia and hebei province in northern china small resident populations also breed in morocco algeria and tunisia it typically inhabits reed beds phragmites and swamps as well as lakes lagoons and sluggish rivers fringed by rank vegetation it sometimes nests by ponds in agricultural areas and even quite near habitations where suitable habitat exists but for preference chooses large reed beds of at least in which to breed thumb upright a bittern well camouflaged in typical reed bed habitat some populations are sedentary and stay in same areas throughout year more northerly populations usually migrate to warmer regions but some birds often remain birds in northern europe tend to move south and west to southern europe northern and central africa and northern asian birds migrate to parts of arabian peninsula indian sub continent and provinces of heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia in eastern china outside breeding season it has less restrictive habitat requirements and as well as living in reed beds it visits rice fields watercress beds fish farms gravel pits sewage works ditches flooded areas and marshes subspecies b s capensis is endemic to southern africa where it is found sparingly in marshes near east coast okavango delta and upland foothills of drakensberg mountains this population is sedentary behaviour thumb upright left in defensive pose with elongated feathers spread usually solitary eurasian bittern forages in reed beds walking stealthily or remaining still above a body of water where prey may occur it is a shy bird and if disturbed often points its bill directly upwards and freezes in that position causing its cryptic plumage to blend into surrounding reeds an action known as while in this position shield of elongated feathers on throat and breast droop downwards and hide neck so that outline of head and body is obscured sometimes it resorts to applying powder down produced by patches of specialist down feathers at side of its breast this white dusty material seems to help it to rid its head and neck of slime after feeding on eels it then removes excess powder by scratching vigorously before applying preen oil from gland at base of its tail bird has a secretive nature keeping largely hidden in reeds and coarse vegetation occasionally especially in hard winter weather it stands in open beside water s edge although usually close to cover to facilitate a hasty retreat in flight its wings can be seen to be broad and rounded and its legs trail behind it in typical heron fashion its neck is extended when it takes off but is retracted when it has picked up speed it seldom flies however except when feeding young preferring to move through vegetation stealthily on foot its gait is slow and deliberate and it can clamber over reeds by gripping several at a time with its toes it is most active at dawn and dusk but also sometimes forages by day thumb right fishing thumb eggs collection museum wiesbaden eurasian bitterns feed on fish small mammals amphibians and invertebrates hunting along reed margins in shallow water british records include eels up to and other fish mice and voles small birds and fledglings frogs newts crabs shrimps molluscs spiders and insects in continental europe members of over twenty families of beetle are eaten as well as dragonflies bees grasshoppers and earwigs some vegetable matter such as aquatic plants is also consumed males are polygamous mating with up to five females nest is built in previous year s standing reeds and consists of an untidy platform some across it may be on a tussock surrounded by water or on matted roots close to water and is built by female using bits of reed sedges and grass stalks with a lining of finer fragments eggs average and are non glossy olive brown with some darker speckling at broader end four to six eggs are laid in late march and april and incubated by female for about twenty six days after hatching chicks spend about two weeks in nest before leaving to swim amongst reeds female rears them without help from male regurgitating food into nest from her crop young seizing her bill and pulling it down they become fully fledged at about eight weeks voice thumb right male booming mating call or contact call of male is a deep sighing fog horn or bull like boom with a quick rise and an only slightly longer fall easily audible from a distance of on a calm night call is mainly given between january and april during mating season surveys of eurasian bitterns are carried out by noting number of distinct male booms in a given area prior to modern science it was unknown how such a small bird produced a call so low pitched common explanations included that bird made its call into a straw or that it blew directly into water it is now known that sound is produced by expelling air from oesophagus with aid of powerful muscles surrounding it status thumb left foraging in shallow water eurasian bittern has a very wide range and a large total population estimated to be 110 000 to 340 000 individuals international union for conservation of nature has assessed its overall conservation status as being of least concern because although population trend is downward rate of decline is insufficient to justify rating it in a more threatened category chief threat bird faces is destruction of reed beds and drainage and disturbance of its wetland habitats it is one of species to which agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa applies southern race has suffered catastrophic decline during 20th century due to wetland degradation and unlike northern race is of high conservation concern in united kingdom main areas in which eurasian bittern breeds have been lancashire and east anglia with an estimated 44 breeding pairs in total in 2007 however lancashire population at leighton moss rspb reserve has declined in recent decades while bitterns have been attracted to new reed beds in west country in ireland it died out as a breeding species in mid 19th century but in 2011 a single bird was spotted in county wexford and there have been a number of subsequent sightings in 21st century bitterns are regular winter visitors to london wetland centre enabling city dwellers to view these scarce birds in literature thumb wood engraving bittern bog bumper bitter bum or mire drum from a history of british birds volume 2 water birds by thomas bewick 1804 thomas bewick records that bittern was formerly held in much estimation at tables of great booming eurasian bittern is proposed as one of rational explanations behind drekavac a creature of graveyard and darkness originating in south slavic mythology it is mentioned in short story brave mita and drekavac from pond by branko 18th century scottish poet james thomson refers to bittern s boom in his poem spring written 1728 published as part of his seasons 1735 species is mentioned in george crabbe s 1810 narrative poem borough to emphasise ostracised solitary life of poem s villain peter grimes irish poet thomas macdonagh translated gaelic poem yellow bittern an bui in irish by cathal bui mac giolla his friend poet francis wrote a lament for thomas macdonagh with opening line he shall not hear bittern cry in sherlock holmes novel hound of baskervilles by sir arthur conan doyle naturalist stapleton proposes boom of a bittern as an explanation for howl attributed to mystical hound because of its secretive and skulking nature it was for long unclear exactly how bittern produced its distinctive booming call a mediaeval theory held that bittern thrust its beak into boggy ground of marsh in which it lived making its vocalization which was amplified and deepened as it reverberated through water a reference to this theory appears in 1476 in chaucer s wife of bath s tale lines 972 73 english 17th century physician sir thomas browne disputed this claim stating in his pseudodoxia epidemica book iii ch 27 that a maketh that noise or as we term it bumping by putting its bill into a reed as most believe or as and conceive by putting same in water or mud and after a while retaining air by suddenly excluding it again is not so easily made out for my own part though after diligent enquiry i could never behold them in this motion browne even kept a captive bittern to discover how its boom was
