previously worked with hillenburg on rocko s modern life and when hillenburg created spongebob squarepants he approached kenny to voice character hillenburg utilized kenny s and other people s personalities to help create personality of spongebob voice of spongebob was originally used by kenny for a minor background character in rocko s modern life kenny forgot voice initially as he created it only for that single use hillenburg however remembered it when he was coming up with spongebob and used a video clip of episode to remind kenny of voice when hillenburg heard kenny do voice he said that s it i don t want to hear anybody else do voice we ve got spongebob he said that to nickelodeon however network said well let s just listen to 100 more people kenny said but one of advantages of having a strong creator is that creator can say no i like that i don t care about celebrities kenny says that spongebob s high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in tradition of popeye and woody woodpecker spongebob s voice evolved from low key to high pitched kenny said i hear change i hear it it s mostly a question of pitch he said that it s unconscious on my part because i don t wake up and think hmm i m going to change spongebob s voice today just for hell of it he described it that it s like erosion a very slow process as time goes on you need to bring him to different places and more places more stories and scripts you do contrasting first season episodes to those of seventh season kenny said that there s a bit of a change in voice but i don t think it s that extreme at all when spongebob squarepants is broadcast in languages other than english voice actors dubbing spongebob s voice use tom kenny s rendition of
