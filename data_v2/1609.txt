2012 remastered background and recording originally songwriters george merrill and shannon rubicam had written song s demo in 1984 for american singer janet jackson employed by a m records executive john mcclain however after hearing song jackson s management passed on song feeling it was too weak in comparison to her other material in an interview with fred bronson merrill expressed his feelings after learning of jackson s decision we were pretty upset because we thought it was perfect for her at time we had written it with her completely in mind during this period brenda andrews at almo irving music merrill and rubicam s publisher played song for gerry griffith director for r b music at a m and arista records griffith who was compiling material for houston s debut album at time felt song perfectly matched her sound he soon contacted andrews and song s two writers and implored that they should relinquish song to him for houston s debut album griffith described his discovery of song and what he and clive davis thought of it we had a lot of r b based tunes we had a few ballads but we didn t have a pop crossover song so when i heard how will i know i said this is absolutely perfect i played it for clive and he fell in love with it i wasn t very familiar with her family background i didn t realize that even at that time there was a pretty big industry buzz about her future after getting permission to use song from merrill griffith quickly turned to narada michael walden who was producing for aretha franklin material for her album who s zoomin who at time after getting in touch with walden griffith frantically implored him to produce song describing how important song would be for houston s future album after hearing song s demo walden agreed to fly down to san rafael california to arrange it he was not much impressed with demo and requested permission to change some of song s lyrics and chord progression flustered by his request merrill and rubicam denied him right to their song after a lot of back and forth with griffith they compromised and allowed walden to de construct song and change key and tempo after completing song houston came into studio to record her vocals in late 1984 cissy houston whitney s mother joined her daughter to perform song s background vocals griffith explained i asked whitney to sing on background session she was reluctant because she wanted to enjoy hearing her mother sing i said no get out there and sing so she did background sounded incredible clive davis heard mix and immediately gave it a 10 which is outrageous for him because he doesn t like anything tenor saxophone is played by russell tubbs composition how will i know is composed in a 1980s dance beat rolling stone described song as perky synth funk according to kyle anderson of mtv song found houston hitting an incredible groove it is written in key of g flat major beat is set time signature of common time and moves at a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute song also has sequence of g bm7 g c d em d as its chord progression houston s vocals in song span from note of d4 to high note of g5 lyrically song speaks about protagonist trying to discern whether a boy she likes will ever like her back she is also hesitant because her friends tell her love can be deceiving and she is so shy that she cannot phone him later she feels that it might be a dream but realizes that there s no mistaking and that what she feels is really love critical reception how will i know mainly garnered positive reviews from music critics with some noting

com gave song a positive review writing houston s peppy numbers tend to suffer from a particularly dated sound compared to her ballads but this song still works remarkably well because of its lush melody throughout verse bridge and chorus t his track helps houston prove that she knows how to interpret with great skill tunes that display solid craftsmanship he added while reviewing deluxe
