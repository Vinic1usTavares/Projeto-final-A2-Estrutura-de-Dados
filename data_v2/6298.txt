sciannamea of tv squad wrote that episode was ok nothing great sciannamea went on to explain that subject was funny but i thought writers were trying too hard to push envelope making episode uneven miss alli of television without pity gave episode a b grade erik adams of a v club awarded episode a b and called it a slightly above average episode but that its greatest success was an ability to reach some of its greatest heights on a moment by moment basis similar in style to vignettes adams was slightly critical of main plot noting that show had difficulty maintaining comedic momentum but he reasoned that this was probably largely due to michael on defense being a difficult character to write because there aren t many good ways of displaying his humanity while he s also fighting for right to be an asshole tv fanatic reviewed several quotes from sexual harassment and rated several of todd packer s lewd jokes as well as michael s you wouldn t arrest a guy who was just passing drugs
