better conditions for factory workers opposed capital punishment and supported temperance movement his friend longfellow was especially concerned about his fanaticism for temperance worrying that

reading massachusetts addison wesley publishing company 1987 294 duyckinck thought lowell was too similar to other poets like william shakespeare and john milton duberman 55 ralph waldo emerson noted that though lowell had significant technical skill his poetry rather expresses his wish his ambition than uncontrollable interior impulse which is authentic mark of a new poem and which is felt in pervading tone rather than in brilliant parts or lines sullivan 220 even his friend richard henry dana jr questioned lowell s abilities calling him very clever entertaining good humored but he is rather a trifler after all sullivan 219 220 in twentieth century poet richard armour dismissed lowell writing as a harvard graduate and an editor for atlantic monthly it must have been difficult for
