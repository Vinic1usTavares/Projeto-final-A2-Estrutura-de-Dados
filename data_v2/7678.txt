and alliance this had been agreed in two plus four treaty earlier in year to secure soviet approval of a united germany remaining in nato it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in former east germany and topic of further nato expansion east was raised there is no mention of nato enlargement in september october 1990 agreements on german reunification so there was no formal commitment not to expand whether or not west informally committed to not enlarge nato to east is a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars harvard university historian mark kramer rejects that an informal agreement existed whereas texas a m university political scientist joshua r argues that an informal agreement existed in december 2017 svetlana and tom blanton of national security archive at george washington university argued that newly declassified documents showed that an informal agreement existed jack matlock us ambassador to soviet union during its final years said that west gave a clear commitment not to expand and declassified documents indicate that soviet negotiators were given oral impression by diplomats like hans dietrich and james baker that nato membership was off table for countries such as czechoslovakia hungary or poland in 1996 gorbachev wrote in his memoirs that during negotiations on unification of germany they gave assurances that nato would not extend its zone of operation to east and repeated this view in an interview in 2008 however in 2014 gorbachev said topic of nato expansion was not discussed at all in 1990 and it wasn t brought up in those years i say this with full responsibility western leaders didn t bring it up either eduard shevardnadze foreign minister of soviet union

nato reaction to these former warsaw pact countries was initially negative but by 1991 rome summit in november members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession such as market and democratic liberalization and that nato should be a partner in these efforts in subsequent years wider forums for regional cooperation between nato and its eastern neighbors were set up including north atlantic cooperation council later euro atlantic partnership council and partnership for peace while other visegrad members were invited to join nato at its 1997 madrid summit slovakia was excluded based on what several members considered undemocratic actions by nationalist prime minister vladimir romania and slovenia were both considered for invitation in 1997 and each had backing of a prominent nato member france and italy respectively but support for enlargement was not unanimous particularly in us congress in an open letter to us president bill clinton more than forty foreign policy experts including bill bradley sam nunn gary hart paul nitze and robert mcnamara expressed their concerns about nato expansion as both expensive and unnecessary given lack of an external threat from russia at that time a 2006 study in journal security studies argued that nato enlargements in 1999 and 2004 contributed to democratic consolidation in central and eastern europe vilnius group

administration some preferred a relatively swift conferral of full membership to a narrow range of countries whereas others wanted a slower phased conferral of limited membership to a wide range of states ultimately proponents of former won debate within administration this coupled with pleas from central and eastern european leaders missteps by russian president boris yeltsin and victory by pro expansion republican party in 1994 u s congressional election all helped advocates of full membership enlargement to win domestic politics in eastern european countries continued to push for more

put some criteria forward that have to be attained in practice nato formulates a common set of criteria but for instance greece blocked republic of macedonia s accession to nato for many years due to
