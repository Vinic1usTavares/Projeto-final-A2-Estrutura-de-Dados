was clad in a coat of mail which no steel could bite between them they had thirty ships and were described by gormflaith as men of such hardihood that nothing can withstand them from isle of man to ireland hun ad lagu uti mon og og svo ad ekki vid annar ospakur en annar brodir thu fara til mots vid tha og lat ekki ad skorta ad koma i med ther hvad sem their til she said there were two vikings lying off west of man and that they had thirty ships and she went on thou shalt fare to find them and spare nothing to get them into thy quarrel whatever price they ask njal s saga 13th century some time in 1010s brian boru divorced his second wife thrice married hiberno norse queen gormflaith and she began engineering opposition to high king macmanus p 278 279 around 1012 relations between brian and leinster had become so strained that revolt broke out among leinstermen gormflaith sent her son king of dublin sigtrygg silkbeard to win first support of earl sigurd of orkney and then of brodir and ospak at any price macmanus pp 279 280 sigtrygg went to man where he persuaded brodir to come to dublin by palm sunday sigtrygg promised both sigurd and brodir separately that if successful they would be allowed marry gormflaith and become high king of ireland terms of this agreement however were to be kept secret ospak was dissatisfied with arrangement macmanus p 280 and refused to fight against so good a king events leading up to battle of clontarf became part of a heroic tale in subsequent tradition both irish and norse and evil portents were recorded throughout norse world o corrain pp 130 131 according to njal s saga one night a great din passed over brodir and his men on isle of man so that they all sprang up from sleep and dressed themselves until dawn this din was accompanied by a shower of boiling blood which scalded many of them even though they covered themselves with their shields as a result a man had died on board every ship on second night they awoke to a ghostly assault on their ships by flying swords axes and spears again this lasted till dawn and a man died on every ship on third night they were attacked by ravens with iron beaks and claws once again causing a death in every ship brodir consulted his brother ospak who believed that signs indicated that much blood would be shed on both sides that brodir s would all die speedily that there would be a battle and all his men would be dragged down to pains of hell brodir was so angered by this that he planned to slay ospak s men next day seeing this plan ospak deserted his brother during night with ten ships he sailed around ireland to connaught and up river shannon to join brian boru as an ally he told king brian all that he had learned took baptism and gathered his men to come to dublin with brian s forces a week before palm sunday battle of clontarf according to njal s saga brodir tried by sorcery to predict outcome of battle against brian he augured that if battle were on good friday king brian would fall but win battle but if they fought on any day before all who opposed brian would be killed brian was unwilling to fight on good friday as he would not fight on a fast day but danes forced battle to friday which fell that year on 23 april thus two brothers brodir and ospak met again at battle of clontarf on diagonally opposite wings brodir had brought with him 1000 mail clad norsemen and led murderous foreign danes alongside earl sigurd of orkney on wing directly opposite brodir was wolf quarrelsome one of brian s followers brodir drove deep into opposite wing and felled all foremost that stood there as his mail protected him from when wolf turned to meet him however he thrust at him thrice so hard that brodir fell before him at each thrust and brodir fled away into wood at once two sides were very evenly matched o corrain p 230 and battle raged all day from high tide at sunrise to sunset however brodir s absence reduced morale of his men and manx vikings began to flee back to their ships after they were broken by personal bodyguard of son of brian ending in an eventual victory for brian s allies meanwhile brian now in his seventies had been advised to await outcome of battle in a tent not far from field and it is said that a traitor in irish camp possibly tadhg o king of ui maine had pointed out brian s position to brodir at some point during battle macmanus pp 281 282 accounts differ over whether brodir was killer of brian boru according to one irish account brodir overcame brian s guard only to be killed by high king who then killed himself njal s saga records that brodir killed brian and cried out now let man tell man that brodir felled brian two of brian s followers wolf and returned to king and captured brodir and remainder of his men according to saga wolf quarrelsome cut open his belly and led him round and round trunk of a tree and so wound all his entrails out of him while brodir s men were slain to a man modern irish medievalist historian donnchadh o corrain however merely states that brodir was killed on day of battle and that brian was killed in his tent by norsemen fleeing from scene o corrain p 130 according to njal s saga ospak was on wing opposite king sigtrygg silkbeard ospak went through entire battle on this wing and was sorely wounded and lost both his sons before sigtrygg fled however that ospak engaged sigtrygg contradicts historical opinion that sigtrygg did not actually take part in battle but was instead holding garrison in reserve in dublin macmanus p 281 historicity and legacy oxford dictionary of national biography notes that irish surname o frequently anglicised as broder or broderick o laughlin p 22 may be an amalgamation of irish element o grandson of and norse name brodir however although norse origins are often claimed for surname it has been on record in ireland for centuries before anglo norman invasion name occurs most commonly in munster and south east leinster an article on historicity of icelandic sagas notes that brodir is not a norse proper name at all and is itself derived from irish name variously written as bruattar or according to article name first appears in annals of ulster in year 853 when a of south east ireland named bruattar mac aeda was involved in murder of a rival before being slain himself name only appears in norse context twice at battle of clontarf and in 1160 for king of dublin mac and had a longer circulation in irish literature same article also suggests that while there is no doubt about historical truth of battle of clontarf name ospakr along with other names in njal s saga account of clontarf episode may have been borrowed from landnamabok footnotes references external links a history of vikings in scotland
