petr velikiy peter great was an ironclad turret ship built for imperial russian navy during 1870s her engines and boilers were defective but were not replaced until 1881 ship made a cruise to mediterranean after they were installed and before returning to baltic fleet where she remained for rest of her career she did not like rest of baltic fleet participate in russo turkish war of 1877 1878 petr veliky was deemed obsolete by late 1890s but she was not ordered to be converted into a gunnery training ship until 1903 russo japanese war of 1904 05 slowed her reconstruction and ship was not completed until 1908 she spent most of world war i as a training ship although she became a depot ship for submarines in 1917 petr veliky was in helsinki in march 1918 when treaty of brest litovsk required soviets to evacuate their naval base at helsinki or have their ships interned by newly independent finland even though gulf of finland was still frozen over ship reached kronstadt in april 1918 and was hulked on 21 may 1921 she remained in service with soviets in various secondary roles until she was finally stricken from navy list in 1959 and subsequently scrapped design and description petr veliky had its genesis in visit of american twin turret monitor to kronstadt in august 1866 that inspired rear admiral a a popov to submit a preliminary design for a low freeboard breastwork monitor with a full suite of sails and masts he intended ship to act as a hybrid monitor cruiser able to attack enemy shipping and threaten his ports design was approved by naval technical committee and a detailed design was prepared by september 1867 this was reviewed on 20 february 1868 and coal supply was ordered to be raised from four to five days steaming which forced design to be revised to accommodate extra coal this modified design was approved on 26 january 1869 by committee but more changes were made even after that in may popov proposed to add a small superstructure forward of breastwork to improve seakeeping and overhanging side armor as used on monitors during american civil war both changes were approved on 19 june 1869 although displacement of ship had constantly increased from of 1867 design to of june 1869 design mclaughlin pp 2 4 construction of ship now named kreiser cruiser began even before design was approved but changes to design continued to be made masts and rigging were deleted presumably shortly after loss of british masted turret ship in a storm on 7 september 1870 although exact date is not known decision between a ram and telescoping spar torpedoes in ship s bow was not made until november 1870 visit of british naval architect edward reed in june 1871 prompted changes in design of breastwork it was increased in thickness from to and extended to sides of ship in accordance with suggestions by reed mclaughlin pp 4 5 kreiser was renamed petr veliky on 11 june 1872 in honor of bicentennial of peter great s birth petr veliky was long at waterline and long overall with a beam of and a designed draft of her displacement as completed was almost more than her designed displacement of mclaughlin p 1 ship s hull was subdivided by one centerline longitudinal nine transverse and two wing watertight bulkheads and it had a complete double bottom petr veliky had a high metacentric height of although a lively roller she was considered a passable sea boat even though water flooded in between gap between gun turrets and deck whenever sea swept over her forecastle mclaughlin pp 5 6 propulsion petr veliky had two three cylinder horizontal return connecting rod steam engines each driving a single propeller steam was provided by 12 rectangular boilers with a working pressure of engines were designed to produce a total of to give ship a maximum speed of around ship carried a maximum of of coal which gave her an economical range of at machinery was built by baird works for price of 1 019 000 rubles but proved to be defective inferior metal was used in boilers and multiple cracks and breaks were found in piping cracks were also found in engine cylinders that baird had attempted to patch and then over baird was forced to replace almost all of piping by may 1877 but during a new series of sea trials in following month ship only reached funnel was raised by about in an attempt to improve draft to boiler and 24 stokers were also added to ship s crew during winter of 1877 78 but neither had much effect mclaughlin pp 8 9 armament four muzzle loading smoothbore guns based on american rodman design were originally intended as petr velikys main armament but russians were impressed by a demonstration of a new krupp rifled gun they bought a few guns directly as well as a production license and an enlarged 12 inch 20 caliber gun was selected to replace 20 inch guns in order to keep gun ports as small as possible hydraulic turret machinery raised and lowered guns trunnions rather than their muzzles they had a maximum elevation of 12 5deg and a maximum depression of 2 5deg this gave guns a range of about at maximum elevation gun turrets were of coles type and weighed each powered by steam engines they could make a complete 360deg rotation in one minute although they had a firing arc of only guns recoiled into turrets after firing which meant that a great deal of powder smoke was released into turret to counter this problem ventilation fans were mounted in turret roofs ship s machinery filled almost entire breastwork which forced main gun magazines away from turrets towards ends of ship and that complicated ammunition resupply arrangements for those guns while some shells were stored in breastwork most were not and likely would have slowed ship s sustained rate of fire in a lengthy engagement mclaughlin p 6 a number of sources including gardiner claim that ship suffered a number of cracks while firing guns while ice bound during winter of 1877 78 but this incident cannot be confirmed by russian language sources gardiner p 177 mclaughlin believes that any such incident would have been mentioned if it occurred as such sources are otherwise quite candid about ship s drawbacks mclaughlin pp 6 7 anti torpedo boat armament of petr veliky consisted of six four pounder guns four mounted on bridge and two at stern and two palmcrantz one pounder gatling type machine guns two telescoping spar torpedoes were mounted in bow one set at below waterline and other at they did not retract all way into hull excess length was hinged upwards and fastened to bow one spar torpedo was hinged on each side of ship on a boom that was extended until it was angled at 90deg to ship s side furthermore two towed harvey torpedoes were mounted at rear of ship while petr veliky was not really maneuverable enough to make full use of these weapons they were a formidable deterrent to other ships trying to ram mclaughlin pp 7 8 armor thumb left russian ironclad petr veliky stamp of ussr 1972 petr veliky had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron imported from charles cammell co of sheffield england that was intended to extend below waterline at designed displacement belt was 14 inches thick for middle of ship but reduced in steps to at bow and at stern it was backed by multiple layers of teak and iron thought to be equivalent of another of armor breastwork was also 14 inches thick although curved portions at end of breastwork were hughes compound armor because very thick plates could not be bent easily compound armor consisted of two plates separated by a layer of teak this type of armor was also used to protect gun turrets outside breastwork ship s deck was armored with three 1 inch mild steel plates deck protection over redoubt was either or three inches thick sources vary mclaughlin pp 1 8 service petr veliky was built by state owned galernii island shipyard in saint petersburg construction began on 1 june 1869 although her keel was not laid down until 23 july 1870 ship was launched on 27 august 1872 and entered service with baltic fleet on 14 october 1876 she cost a then staggering sum of over five and a half million rubles two 9 inch mortars were fitted on her quarterdeck during war scare with britain during russo turkish war of 1877 78 but they were removed in 1880 without ever having been used in combat two frames for launching whitehead torpedoes were added to ship s sides in that same year but they proved ineffective mclaughlin pp 1 6 10 her original machinery proved unsatisfactory and baird works forfeited a payment of 254 000 rubles as penalty navy began to investigate replacing ship s machinery in 1878 and a contract was finally signed with john elder co in glasgow scotland in october 1880 based on navy s favorable experience with company s construction of imperial yacht ship did not reach scottish shipyard until 14 july 1881 and was refitting until february 1882 new vertical compound steam engines and twelve cylindrical boilers with a working pressure of replaced original defective machinery spar torpedoes in bow were replaced by underwater torpedo tubes for whitehead torpedoes and ship s propellers and rudder were also replaced her funnel was also reduced back to its original height on 4 february 1882 petr veliky ran her sea trials with her new machinery and reached a speed of with an engine output of new engine and boilers were slightly lighter than their predecessors and ship now displaced mclaughlin p 10 immediately after her sea trials ship departed scotland for a mediterranean cruise petr veliky made port visits at algiers athens corfu naples la spezia and toulon on her before being recalled she visited cadiz lisbon brest and cherbourg before reaching kronstadt on 12 september ship remained in baltic sea for rest of her career and had her light armament modified several times during 1880s her rear 4 pounder guns were replaced by two engstrem guns and two other on her bridge were moved to roof of forward turret petr velikys boilers replaced in 1892 and by mid 1890s ship mounted two 4 pounder guns on each turret six 5 barrel revolving hotchkiss guns on bridge and four hotchkiss guns left thumb petr velikiy after reconstruction as a gunnery training ship petr veliky was considered obsolete by late 1890s and a number of proposals were made to reconstruct her most elaborate scheme to raise turrets and build a new armored casemate between turrets and deck with six guns existing 14 and 12 inch wrought iron armor plates would be replaced by krupp steel plates and thick respectively despite saving by substituting lighter steel armor for wrought iron ship would have gained in displacement and her draft would have increased by about 12 inches this plan was approved albeit with a very low priority and her turrets were removed in october 1898 but nothing more was done on 11 june 1903 admiral f k director of naval ministry ordered that she be converted into a gunnery training ship mclaughlin pp 153 54 a new design was approved on 2 february 1904 although baltic works in saint petersburg had already begun cutting ship down to berth deck side armor was removed and an entirely new superstructure was built boilers were replaced by twelve fire tube boilers ten refurbished ones from imperial yacht and two new ones new boilers only supplied enough steam to give engines although a second funnel had to be added to accommodate their exhaust two masts were added with fighting tops only ship s conning tower was now protected with of armor plate armament was almost entirely replaced with four 50 caliber 8 inch guns mounted in barbettes on upper deck sponsoned out over sides of ship and six 45 caliber 6 inch guns were fitted in unarmored casemates on each side of ship ship s anti torpedo boat armament now consisted of twelve four eight 47 millimeter and two 37 millimeter guns mclaughlin pp 154 55 outbreak of russo japanese war almost as soon as her design was approved meant that work on her slowed to a crawl and did not resume until early 1907 ship was completed following year as a result of reconstruction petr veliky was now long overall with a beam of and a maximum draft of her displacement was now almost lighter than her modified displacement of 10 105 long tons her maximum speed was now and she carried of coal this gave a range of after her completion petr veliky was assigned to gunnery training detachment through 1917 a number of sources report that she was renamed by soviets as republican or barricade watts p p 381 but this is not confirmed by post cold war sources used by mclaughlin that year she was assigned as a depot ship for submarines at kronstadt and later helsinki treaty of brest litovsk required soviets to evacuate their naval base at helsinki in march 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent finland even though gulf of finland was still frozen over petr veliky reached kronstadt in april in what became known as ice voyage ship was hulked on 21 may 1921 and used to store mines she was renamed blokshiv nr 1 on 4 december 1923 and forced aground in shallow water by autumn floods in september 1923 she was not refloated and repaired until 5 october 1927 on 1 january 1932 she was renamed to blokshiv nr 4 and to bsh 3 on 16 may 1949 by which time she was being used as a barracks ship at kronstadt ship was stricken on 18 april 1959 and subsequently scrapped mclaughlin pp 10 11 notes footnotes references external links article in russian english article category victorian era
