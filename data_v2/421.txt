immoral behaviour and failing to follow monastic rules in 1202 norreis became embroiled in a dispute with his monks and his episcopal superior bishop of worcester litigation and argumentation lasted until his deposition in 1213 he then was appointed prior of a subsidiary monastic house of evesham but was deposed within months then re appointed to office five years later norreis has been described by modern historians as being unsuited for religious positions to which he was appointed and by one of being completely unsuitable to hold any kind of spiritual role nevertheless even his most severe contemporary critic thomas of marlborough one of his own monks at evesham conceded that norreis was energetic entertaining and enterprising during his time as abbot of evesham abbey he managed to complete crossing tower of monastic church roger norreis died between 1223 and 1225 background and early career norreis was a native of northern england and his family was probably of norse origin he was a monk at christ church priory cathedral chapter of canterbury cathedral knowles et al heads of religious houses p 48 when he became a monk is unknown in 1187 he was appointed treasurer of priory knowles monastic order p 332 and in that role was sent by cathedral chapter to king henry ii of england to plead their case against baldwin of forde archbishop of canterbury archbishop and his monks were in dispute over baldwin s plan to found a collegiate church at hackington in honour of thomas becket which most of monks opposed because they feared it would diminish prestige of their priory once norreis reached king he was converted to baldwin s side perhaps because of latter s appointment of norreis as cellarer of christ church while pair were at king s court monks resisted this appointment and in september they appealed to papacy arguing that appointment was against benedictine rule they also captured and held norreis in custody telling anyone who enquired after him that he was sick norreis escaped in early 1188 by travelling through sewer and fled to safety of archbishop who was then at otford in a mocking reference to his escape route norreis was occasionally known as roger or roger drain cleaner baldwin then tried to have norreis installed as prior at christ church s dependent priory of st martin s dover but appointment was never confirmed knowles et al heads of

out baldwin appointed norreis as prior of christ church in october 1189 as another move in quarrel over hackington project in november cathedral chapter secured a compromise that included abandonment of scheme and norreis s dismissal from office knowles monastic order pp 319 322 agreement came at a council held by richard in late november 1189 at which monks agreed to let king settle dispute over hackington project if archbishop would withdraw norreis s appointment turner and heiser reign of richard lionheart p 94 norreis s fellow monks considered him a traitor to their cause and his reputation was that of someone with few morals he was also known for ingratiating himself with those in power including justiciar geoffrey many of details concerning norreis s career at christ church come from works of gervase of canterbury as well as collection of letters known as epistolae norreis was appointed to abbacy of evesham abbey in 1190 and was blessed as abbot on 13 january 1190 he owed his appointment to king richard and to baldwin s attempts to make dismissal from christ church look less like a defeat for archbishop norreis also claimed that he received office in return for unspecified services he rendered to richard there was no attempt at an election by monks a lack which went against canon law during his tenure of office his monks accused him of fornication excessive drinking gluttony setting up favourites starving monks and appropriating monastic property for his own use knowles monastic order pp 333 334 a further offence was his habit of wearing secular clothing rather than monastic habit prescribed by benedictine rule all these charges come from one of his monks historian thomas of marlborough boureau how law came to monks past present p 43 who wrote much of history of evesham known as chronicon abbatiae de evesham boureau how law came to monks past present p 29 thomas s account of norreis s rule is biased against abbot and is a self aggrandising account of how thomas single handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey s foes norreis did manage some good for abbey as it was while he was abbot that crossing tower of monastic church was completed cox evesham abbey journal of british archaeological association p 24 early in his tenure norreis appears to have been somewhat circumspect and did not greatly annoy his monks change appears to have happened around 1195 when monks are first recorded as appealing to higher authority because evesham had traditionally claimed to be exempt from episcopal oversight by see of worcester in which it was located monks could only appeal to papacy or to a papal legate hubert walter archbishop of canterbury after baldwin held a legateship for england until july 1195 and so monks appealed to him walter forced norreis to make some compromises with his subordinates but truce did not last long and monks once again complained of their treatment they were visited by new bishop of worcester john of coutances some time between 1196 and 1198 but norreis succeeded in avoiding any severe sanctions by offering gifts to bishop monks again appealed to walter in about 1200 but between archbishop s preoccupation with political affairs and norreis s promises to reform no solid changes occurred dispute with mauger and his monks in 1202 new bishop of worcester mauger attempted to investigate norreis s conduct but under leadership of thomas of marlborough monastic community refused to allow bishop to visit claiming that evesham was exempt from episcopal visitation and oversight according to thomas norreis offered to renounce abbey s claim to exemption in return for money but bishop refused norreis then fled monastery while monks continued to refuse bishop and were excommunicated a sentence that norreis was spared boureau how law came to monks past present pp 45 46 between early september and mid october dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals mauger was supported by eustace bishop of ely and giles de braose bishop of hereford monks and norreis then made common cause each vowing to stand by other in resisting mauger as well as these two cases there was a dispute between monks and bishop over ownership of some properties boureau how law came to monks past present pp 34 35 monks and norreis then obtained right for their case to be heard by papal judge delegates but mauger objected to fact that appointed judges were all benedictine monks and travelled to rome to appeal in 1203 norreis secure in his alliance with his own monks once again began to exploit monastery for his own profit and that of his family and friends his monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent thomas along with other monks to appropriate harvest from some lands that had been given by norreis to a non member of community norreis protested to king john and to hubert walter both king and walter summoned thomas to appear before them separately and explain actions of monks thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about norreis s exactions and abuse of his monks boureau how law came to monks past present pp 53 54 norreis went to rome in company of thomas of marlborough shortly before 1205 to lay abbey s case before papacy thomas remained in italy but norreis returned to england in middle of 1205 while in rome norreis and thomas borrowed 400 marks to finance litigation at papal curia norreis could not repay this sum and for a while was in danger of being imprisoned but he managed to leave rome without suffering fate of one of his companions who was detained for debt and died while imprisoned when norreis made it back to england mauger excommunicated abbot in april 1205 monks won a victory on question of abbey s exemption from episcopal visitation in 1206 but other elements of quarrel remained unresolved including that of disputed churches later that year monks became so annoyed by norreis s abuse that they abandoned abbey and did not return until they secured abbot s confirmation of their rights gransden separation of portions english historical review p 389 with question of episcopal exemption decided in evesham

opponents by expelling thomas of marlborough and his allies from monastery thirty monks followed thomas into exile and norreis pursued them with soldiers who were defeated by monks a compromise was eventually reached norreis agreeing that revenues of abbey would be split with monks that officials of abbey would be appointed by abbot but with advice and consent of monks and that abbot would not admit or expel monks without taking counsel of his monks nor dispose of monastic property without consent of his subordinates although issue of monks support was temporarily solved issue of disputed properties between mauger and monastery continued norreis appears to have been willing to compromise with bishop but monks refused dispute between norreis and his monks dragged on for years interdict of 1207 1213 caused further delays but when it was lifted in 1213 case against norreis was finally heard a papal legate visited abbey and found that monks were lacking in food clothes and other
