willie or willy wagtail rhipidura leucophrys is a passerine bird native to australia new guinea solomon islands bismarck archipelago and eastern indonesia it is a common and familiar bird throughout much of its range living in most habitats apart from thick forest measuring in length willie wagtail is contrastingly coloured with almost entirely black upperparts and white underparts male and female have similar plumage three subspecies are recognised rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys from central and southern australia smaller r l picata from northern australia and larger r l melaleuca from new guinea and islands in its vicinity it is unrelated to true wagtails of genus motacilla it is a member of fantail genus rhipidura and is a part of a core corvine group that includes true crows and ravens drongos and birds of paradise within this group fantails are placed either in family dicruridae alongside drongos or in their own small family rhipiduridae willie wagtail is insectivorous and spends much time chasing prey in open habitat its common name is derived from its habit of wagging its tail horizontally when foraging on ground aggressive and territorial willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as laughing kookaburra and wedge tailed eagle it has responded well to human alteration of landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns parks and gardens it was widely featured in aboriginal folklore around country as either a bringer of bad news or a stealer of secrets taxonomy and etymology willie wagtail was first described by english ornithologist john latham in 1801 as turdus leucophrys its specific epithet is derived from ancient greek words leukos white and ophrys eyebrow other early scientific names include muscicapa tricolor by vieillot and rhipidura by naturalists nicholas aylward vigors and thomas horsfield in 1827 who erected genus rhipidura generic term is derived from ancient greek fan and oura tail john gould and other early writers referred to species as black and white fantail although did note current name however willie wagtail rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916 wagtail is derived from its active behaviour while origins of willie are obscure boles p 381 name had been in use colloquially for pied subspecies of white wagtail motacilla alba on isle of man and northern ireland other vernacular names applied include shepherd s companion because it accompanied livestock morning bird and australian nightingale boles p 387 many aboriginal names are onomatopoeic based on sound of its scolding call boles p 382 is a name from kimberley and is used by kunwinjku of western arnhem land in central australia southwest of alice springs pitjantjatjara word is among it is in bougainville island it is called in language from west coast hadden p 270 and in of kieta district it is hadden p 268 in solomon islands it is sometimes called police or priest bird because of its black and white colouring willie wagtail is unrelated to eurasian wagtails of family motacillidae it is one of 47 members of fantail genus rhipidura some authorities classify this group of birds as a subfamily within drongo family dicruridae together with monarch flycatchers while others consider them distinct enough to warrant their own family rhipiduridae early molecular research in late 1980s and early 1990s revealed that fantails belong to a large group of mainly australasian birds known as parvorder comprising many tropical and australian passerines more recently grouping has been refined somewhat and fantails have been classified in a core corvine group with crows and ravens shrikes birds of paradise monarch flycatchers drongos and builders subspecies following three subspecies are widely recognised r leucophrys leucophrys nominate subspecies is most widely distributed form found in australia description below refers to it there is negligible variation within this form and little between three all have very similar plumage r leucophrys picata was described by john gould in 1848 gould j 1848 introduction to birds of australia london j gould viii 134 p xxxix it is found across northern australia from northern western australia to queensland it has shorter wings and it has a gradient in wing length between latitudes 18 across australian continent where this subspecies intergrades with leucophrys higgins et al pp 244 45 subspecific epithet is latin picata smeared with pitch r leucophrys melaleuca was described by french naturalists jean rene constant quoy and joseph paul gaimard in 1830 quoy gaimard jp in dumont d urville j 1830 voyage de de l astrolabe execute par ordre du roi pendant les annees 1826 1827 1828 1829 sous le de m j dumont d urville zoologie paris j vol 1 i p 180 it occurs in eastern indonesia new guinea solomon islands and bismarck archipelago it is significantly larger with longer bristles and larger bill higgins et al p 245 its subspecific name is derived from ancient greek melas black and leukos white description right thumb closeup showing white eyebrows flared an adult willie wagtail is between in length and weighs 17 24 g 0 6 0 85 oz with a tail 10 11 cm approx 4 in long short slender bill measures 1 64 1 93 cm around 0 75 in and is tipped with a small hook higgins et al p 244 this species has longer legs than other fantails which may be an adaptation to foraging on ground male and female have similar plumage head throat upper breast wings upperparts and tail are all black with a white eyebrow whiskers and underparts bill and legs are black and iris dark brown immature birds in their first year after moulting from juvenile plumage may have pale tips in their wings while juvenile birds themselves have duller plumage their upperparts brown tinged with some pale brown scallops on head and breast higgins et al p 226 vocalisation wagtail is very chatty and has a number of distinct vocalisations its most recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid chit chit chit chit although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire alarm call is sounded to warn off potential rivals and threats from its territory and also seems to serve as a signal to its mate when a potential threat is in area john gould reported that it sounded like a child s rattle or small cog wheels of a steam mill in his book what bird is that 1935 neville cayley writes that it has a pleasant call resembling sweet pretty little creature frequently uttered during day or night especially on moonlight nights distribution and habitat thumb right rhipidura leucophrys clip widespread and abundant willie wagtail is found across most of australia and new guinea solomon islands bismarck archipelago and eastern indonesia it is sedentary across most of australia though some areas have recorded seasonal movements it is an autumn and winter visitor to northeastern new south wales and southeast queensland as well as gulf country and parts of cape york peninsula in far north it is a vagrant to tasmania higgins et al p 229 and on occasion reaches lord howe island higgins et al p 228 there is one record from island in chatham islands archipelago east of new zealand in 2002 willie wagtail was released in hawaii around 1922 to control insects on livestock but introduction was unsuccessful and last sighting was at koko head in 1937 willie wagtail is at home in a wide variety of habitats but avoids densely forested areas such as rainforest it prefers semi open woodland or grassland with scattered trees often near wetlands or bodies of water in new guinea it inhabits man made clearings and grasslands as well as open forest and mangroves on guadalcanal it was reported from open areas and coconut groves it has responded well to human alteration of landscape and can often be seen hunting in open grassed areas such as lawns gardens parkland and sporting grounds species spread into western australian wheatbelt after original vegetation had been cleared for agriculture behaviour thumb left in flight willie wagtail is almost always on move and rarely still for more than a few moments during daylight hours even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side twisting about looking for prey birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs although they may gather in small flocks unlike other fantails much of its time is spent on ground coates p 140 it beats its wings deeply in flight interspersed with a swift flying dip it characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight willie wagtail is highly territorial and can be quite fearless in defence of its territory it will harry not only small birds but also much larger species such as australian magpie gymnorhina tibicen raven corvus laughing kookaburra dacelo novaeguineae or wedge tailed eagle aquila audax it may even attack domestic dogs cats and humans which approach its nest too closely it has also been observed harassing snake neck turtles and tiger snakes in western australia when harassing an opponent willie wagtail avoids head and aims for rear both male and female may engage in this behaviour and generally more intensely in breeding season territories range from in area higgins et al p 234 a pair of birds will declare and defend their territory against other pairs in a diving display one bird remains still while other loops and dives repeatedly before roles are reversed both sing all while willie wagtail has more than responded well to human alteration it has been seen to seek out company of individual humans following and chatting calling out to a human who is inside a house following and chatting at quite some distance from nest is not aggressive or protective bird s white eyebrows become flared and more prominent in an aggressive display and settled and more hidden when in a submissive or appeasement display boles p 384 breeding thumb left a well guarded nest thumb willie wagtail incubating its eggs willie wagtails usually pair for life breeding season lasts from july to december more often occurring after rain in drier regions anywhere up to four broods may be raised during this time it builds a cup like nest on a tree branch away from leaves or cover less than above ground rafters and eaves may also be used it has been observed to build its nest in vicinity of those of magpie lark possibly taking advantage of latter bird s territoriality and aggression toward intruders similarly it is not afraid to build near human habitation nest consists of grass stems strips of bark and other fibrous material which is bound and woven together with spider web even hair from pet dogs and cats may be used it has also been observed attempting to take hair from a pet goat an alpaca breeder in district of new south wales has observed alpaca fleece in nests of willy wagtails results of scraps of fleece not picked up at shearing time female lays two to four small cream white eggs with brownish markings measuring and incubates them for 14 days like all passerines chicks are altricial and nidicolous they are born naked and helpless with closed eyes and remain in nest higgins et al p 241 both parents take part in feeding young and may continue to do so while embarking on another brood coates p 141 nestlings remain in nest for around 14 days before fledging upon leaving fledglings will remain hidden in cover nearby for one or two days before venturing further afield up to away by third day parents will stop feeding their fledglings near end of second week as young birds increasingly forage for themselves and soon afterwards drive them out of territory higgins et al p 242 female pallid cuckoo pallidus will lay eggs in a willie wagtail nest although hosts often recognise and eject foreign eggs so successful brood parasitism is rare parasitism by fan tailed cacomantis brush c horsfield s bronze basalis and shining bronze cuckoo c lucidus has also been reported although willie wagtail is an aggressive defender of its nest predators do account for many eggs and young about two thirds of eggs hatch successfully and a third leave nest as fledglings nestlings may be preyed upon by both pied butcherbirds cracticus black butcherbirds c spangled drongo dicrurus and pied currawong strepera graculina as well as feral cat felis catus and rat species proximity of nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children feeding thumb right juvenile successfully foraging willie wagtail perches on low branches fences posts and like watching for insects and other small invertebrates in air or on ground it usually hunts by hawking flying insects such as gnats flies and small moths but will occasionally glean from ground it will often hop along ground and flit behind people and animals such as cattle sheep or horses as they walk over grassed areas to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing it wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch willie wagtail takes ticks from skin of grazing animals such as cattle or pigs even from lions asleep in a zoo higgins et al p 230 it kills its prey by bashing it against a hard surface or holding it and pulling off wings before extracting edible insides higgins et al p 232 adaptability and opportunistic diet of willie wagtail have probably assisted it in adapting to human habitation it eats a wide variety of arthropods including butterflies moths flies beetles dragonflies bugs spiders centipedes and millipedes and has been recorded killing small lizards such as skinks and geckos in a study in madang on papua new guinea s north coast tailbones of these lizards have been found in their faeces although it is unclear whether whole animal was eaten or merely tail either way lizards are only a very occasional prey item forming between 1 and 3 of total diet evidence from study in madang suggested that willie wagtail selectively fed nestlings larger prey cultural depictions willie wagtail was a feature in australian aboriginal folklore aboriginal tribes in parts of southeastern australia such as ngarrindjeri of lower murray river and people of yorke peninsula regard willie wagtail as bearer of bad news it was thought that willie wagtail could steal a person s secrets while lingering around camps eavesdropping so women would be tight lipped in presence of bird people of kimberley held a similar belief that it would inform spirit of recently departed if living relatives spoke badly of them they also venerated willie wagtail as most intelligent of all animals its cleverness is also seen in a tale of bougainville island where willie wagtail wins a contest among all birds to see who can fly highest by riding on back of eagle hadden pp 261 62 however kunwinjku in western arnhem land took a dimmer view and regarded it as a liar and a willie wagtail was held to have stolen fire and tried to extinguish it in sea in a dreaming story of people of central and western pilbara and was able to send a strong wind if frightened in noongar language dialects willie wagtail is known as djiti djiti pronounced chitti chitti and in perth region kalam people of new guinea highlands called it and deemed it a good bird if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled then there would be good crops it is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them it may also be manifestation of ghost of paternal relatives to kalam called bird in new guinea s eastern highlands its appearance was significant in mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband she would offer him banana flowers presence of bird singing nearby would confirm that dead man s soul had taken offering a tale from kieta district of bougainville island relates that a maneka willie wagtail darting along a river bank echoes a legendary daughter looking for her mother who drowned trying to cross a flooding river in a storm hadden pp 248 48 bird has been depicted on postage stamps in palau and solomon islands and has also appeared as a character in australian children s literature such as dot and kangaroo 1899 blinky bill grows up 1935 and willie wagtail and
