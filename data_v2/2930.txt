thumb right a marquee in january 2014 advertising an assortment of films typical for that time of year alt a tall white rectangular sign with short phrases on it topped by a red sign reading showtime cinemas in background is a gray sky there is a light dusting of snow on ground dump months are what film community calls two periods of year when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases from american filmmakers and distributors domestic audiences during these periods are smaller than rest of year so no tentpole movies are released january and february are usually most commonly described this way with august and september sometimes included releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings films with less prominent stars genre films particularly horror movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience which has fewer entertainment options outside home several factors combine to create dump months most of them circumstances particular to united states and canada primary market for most major hollywood releases both periods immediately follow times of year in which distributors concentrate films they expect to be biggest critical and or commercial successes periods of increased spending on entertainment generally while this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterward economics alone does not explain dump months weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment especially professional sports also play a part winter dump months are further affected by academy awards eligibility rules dump months evolved over course of 20th century although during studio era most major releases followed annual patterns similar to today s several classics like kid shadow of a doubt and treasure of sierra madre were released during january since decline of studios however memorable films from dump months have become rare exceptions notable examples of these for films released in january and february include silence of lambs a well reviewed box office smash released in late january 1991 that went on to win that year s academy award for best picture and get out several years before that dirty dancing and fatal attraction became hits following releases in august and september respectively films released during dump months have not always been consigned to cinematic oblivion some like tremors and office space have become cult classics starting with cloverfield some 21st century dump months releases have managed to exceed 100 million on box office receipts similar success of low budget horror films like devil inside and mama in early 2010s has prompted studios to release films in that genre at times of year other than halloween and dump months etymology term dump months comes from belief that studios use time periods in question as a dumping ground for movies they are contractually obligated to release but believe to have limited commercial prospects at best big studios would never in a million years use this phrase dade hayes coauthor of open wide how hollywood box office became a national obsession told newsday in august 2017 b ut they do view these times of year as a dumping ground critics and journalists have no such reservations first months of year are known as dump months in hollywood wrote vegas seven critic una lamarche in early 2013 a period characterized by movies that studios dislike and want to release with little fanfare likewise paul shirey at joblo com dismisses september as one of most worthless months at box office earliest use of term to turn up in a google search is a 2007 article in british newspaper guardian in us january is dump month at movies critic jonathan bernstein wrote films no studios believe in or care about suddenly become sole choice available to regular filmgoers hungry for fresh fare use of term became more common in early 2010s causes while both dump month periods immediately follow periods of greater movie attendance when event movies expected to be critical and or commercial successes are released and periods of greater consumer spending generally there are also reasons specific to both periods that further dampen movie attendance to limit expected box office returns to extent that movies with strong potential will be scheduled for other times of year january february main impediment to release of highly anticipated or high quality films in january and february is calendar of two major film awards golden globe awards january and academy awards or oscars late february or early march which overlap with those months winter weather also adds uncertainty to estimates of potential box office two holidays during time provide some slight relief however they are offset by distraction of super bowl weekend which depresses spending on movies combined gross for all january releases 2002 2012 has averaged 387 million for february it is 615 million by comparison december with its holiday releases averages 1 2 billion spending is low to begin with since many consumers are

are expected to be highly successful and oscar bait movies that are seen as likely to earn critical praise and more importantly nominations for major awards such as golden globes and oscars industry s most prestigious those nominations are then used to promote film but while former nominations are announced in december with awards themselves given in early january academy award nominations are announced after golden globes and actual awards are not given until late february leaving most of first two months of year as oscar season a period during which any golden globes received as well as oscar nominations can be used to promote film to audiences while studios lobby academy members to vote for their nominees to be eligible for award consideration academy of motion picture arts and sciences requires that a film be shown in a theater in los angeles county california for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement then ease them into wide release from then until nominations and or awards ceremony flexibility this marketing strategy requires means that screens be available and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end as critic ty burr explained in a 2013 new york times magazine article on mediocrity of new releases in first month of year t he studios know our attention is elsewhere new films shown publicly anywhere for first time after january 1 themselves are ineligible for oscars until following year by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics audiences and voters silence of lambs winner of 1991 academy award for best picture is a rare exception as only film in post studio era released in first two months of its year to go on to win that oscar burr calls it grand exception to january movies will never amount to anything rule and finds that only one other classic of late 20th century dr strangelove was a january release 2017 satirical horror film get out is another example of a movie released in months of january and february that went on to be nominated for various academy awards

analysts feared that storm could seriously impact box office prospects of two films opening that weekend identity thief and side effects both of which were seen as having potential to do better than most winter movies while it afterwards appeared that two films were not seriously affected and did better than expected with identity thief even winning weekend despite generally poor reviews and word

television accompanied with food and beverages purchased with money that might otherwise be spent on movie tickets does super bowl affect ticket sales asks scott gwin at cinemablend answer of course is yes in fact there s a decent chance budweiser spends more on advertising that sunday than america does in theaters most successful film to open during super bowl weekend is 2008 concert film hannah

perceived inferior he compared site s aggregate scores based on critical and audience consensus for films released in january february and march from 2000 to 2009 january averaged fewest releases of three and lowest average scores of 88 films released in first month of year during that decade only six earned above a 61 average on site s scale of 0 to 100 lowest of any of three winter months even accounting for increase in releases as spring becomes closer it did not seem to dietz as if there was any relationship between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for january films best rated

averaged ratings for all films released in a particular january with best and worst scores noted by this method best and worst januarys were both in earliest years for which site kept scores t his could be more a result of fact that far fewer movies used to be released then so it took less to sway average raymond noted best january was also first 1987 whose 79 average was led by woody allen s acclaimed radio days at 95 it was also best rated january film during survey period that month s lowest rated new release outrageous fortune still managed a 50 rating better than average for all but one of other years at other end was january 1989 where 26 achieved by gleaming cube and 0 awarded to deepstar six bracketed a 16 average five other january films joined it at bottom of scale it was recognized as a nadir among januarys even at time in a contemporary essay in new york times after month had concluded an exasperated janet maslin presciently noted that january that has just ended

months at end of july 2008 vulture again greeted coming month with two posts on drop in movie quality historically associated with month and its theories for what might explain that one was a history of previous 15 augusts with movies released in each month subjectively rated as halfway decent or lousy it concluded that over that time there had been 169 lousy movies and 26 halfway decent ones that s 11 2 movies per august that make you want to claw your eyes out most of augusts in time period in question had one or two halfway decent movies with other 9 11 movies discarded as lousy exceptions were consecutive years 1998 99 former was regarded as worst august with no halfway decent movies and all its releases avengers how stella got her groove back and halloween h20 among others considered lousy but in august 1999 there were five halfway decent films sixth sense thomas crown affair iron giant dick and history according to burr from earliest days of studio system major releases had largely followed same calendar modern audiences would recognize clustered during spring summer and end of year holidays yet january was still in mix he observes silent era charlie chaplin hits like

january movies burr writes may well have been 1940s it began with what he suggests was best january in cinema history grapes of wrath his girl friday and shop around corner all considered classics were released in january 1940 later in decade other classic films would first reach screens during january such as sullivan s travels shadow of a doubt and treasure of sierra madre a few months after treasures release u s supreme court handed down its decision in united states v paramount pictures inc holding that it was a violation of antitrust law for studios to own theater chains as well this has historically been seen as beginning of end of studio system burr found that after it with movies having less of a guaranteed box office since an adequate theatrical run was no longer a certainty release patterns began to clump more formally around big weekends warmer weather and national holidays in mid 1970s studios discovered summer blockbuster via success of jaws and star wars in following decade rise of independent producers dedicated to quality such as merchant ivory and harvey weinstein made october december year s other highlight but those two concentrations left post holiday winter and late summer as lows that followed highs by 2010s burr said august is death by ennui and january is suicide similarly a v club had noted at same time over past few decades american movie schedule has calcified january and february are when studios dump their discards movies they have low hopes for and want to disavow producer daniel melnick whose altered states was moved up a month into 1980 christmas season by studio over his objections complained about this in an interview at time i would rather go at a time when there are fewer people attending movies and offer them pictures they want to see rather than to divide a larger audience with ten other desirable films a s an industry we have very often shown instinct of lemmings we re all convinced that people go to movies primarily at christmas time so we release our big pictures then by end of that decade critics had taken notice as well after january 1989 month that vulture would 24 years later find to be movies worst january ever new york times critic janet maslin had had enough her idea of movie hell she said included among other indignities having to watch only january releases it s well known that january films have a character that is let us say distinctive what is it that leads film distributors to regard january as just right resting place for so many flukes black sheep wild cards and also rans she allowed that recent years had allowed some good films such as radio days and el norte to get attention they might not have in other months of year however that january had had as one its major releases january man a thriller she characterized as aptly titled despite not even being worst month had to offer that dubious honor she suggested went to deepstar six despite critical and commercial success of silence of lambs in 1991 burr qualified it as an exception that proved rule first it had been released at very end of january and second it had only gone into wide release two weeks later such a strategy is typical of january burr writes it s a studio s way of gritting its teeth and ripping off band aid criticism some observers have suggested that studios and distributors insistence on seasonal patterns of release is counterproductive in a 2015 new yorker article james surowiecki suggested that lack of interest during dump months may result from audiences lowered expectations rather than any external factors i f you release blockbusters in july and dogs in january no wonder people go to movies more often in july surowiecki cited a 2002 study by stanford economist einav who analyzed 15 years of ticket sales and found that while there is indeed a seasonal fluctuation in demand it is not significant enough to validate prevalent patterns of release instead it seemed to him that distributors are responding to observed pattern of sales and not estimated underlying demand cyclical variations in revenue he found result primarily from clustering of highly anticipated releases during winter holiday season and summertime a 2010 economic study of north american film release date patterns by two french economists manuel cartier and sebastien liarte agreed with einav that temporal agglomeration of potential blockbuster movies was not driven by realistic understanding of annual demand patterns instead authors came to believe that it was more socially driven normative mimicry whose end is to respect beliefs habits and norms of industry exposing movies released at those times to films that could compete most effectively with them they concluded resulted in less overall profit for studios than they might earn otherwise industry insiders do not disagree with this assessment in 2013 viacom s then chief executive officer philippe dauman said publicly that clustering of tentpole releases was keeping those films from making all money they could if they were not in such close competition ten years earlier tom ortenberg then head of distribution for lionsgate films told new york times magazine that there is never a bad time to release a good film and there is never a good time to release a bad film but surowiecki noted that cartier and liarte s conclusions that social factors within industry played a part i continuation of release cycles that result in dump months due to many uncertainties involved in producing and distributing a major motion picture and studio executives desire to avoid blame for a big budget film s commercial failure if you open a blockbuster on memorial day and it fails no one is going to blame you for your release strategy einav who in his paper likened this phenomenon to maxim on wall street that no one ever gets fired for recommending investors buy shares of ibm einav told him if you open a potential blockbuster in february and it fails you re going to be on hook in 2013 john fithian president of national association of theater owners nato criticized dump months among several other studio practices at cinemacon annual gathering of film exhibitors hosted by nato theaters had come off a first quarter where receipts had been down 12 from first quarter of 2012 he faulted studios for their insufficiently diverse offerings in 2013 as compared to first quarter of year before which he connected to dump months phenomenon any month can produce a 100 million movie he said in his speech in 2012 distributors spread their movies over calendar and we had a record year responding later in an indiewire panel discussion hosted by anne thompson universal studios chairman adam fogelson agreed in principle with fithian saying there are very few reasons other than historical behavior why almost any film can t work on almost any weekend he said he pointed to 2005 success of white noise on first weekend of january as having opened that time up to similar low budget horror films however he called belief among some exhibitors that theaters slump was attributable to a plethora of r rated films saved for january a criticism repeated by fithian simplistic problem was movies in question not their ratings django unchained he insisted would have been a hit regardless of month it opened it happens to be about movies fogelson said people tend to if not forget minimize how complicated this is surowiecki credits another universal executive former distribution chief nikki rocco for up dump months she he wrote believed that people would go see a movie at any time of year if it was good enough and that that could make lesser movies hits if they came out at less competitive times of year not only did rocco move apparent summer releases like 1999 s mummy to beginning of may she also found success for studio in august with bourne ultimatum and scheduled ride along identity thief and safe house for what wound up being successful runs following january release dates surowiecki compared her to billy beane former general manager of major league baseball s oakland athletics who likewise found a way for a smaller less wealthy team to compete at highest levels by using analytics to identify undervalued assets releasing strategies critics and movie fans have observed that studios and other distributors have leaned on particular types of movies or particular genres to get them through dump months some of them overlap mediocre comedies as scott meslow of atlantic puts it referring to films like tooth fairy bride wars and hotel for dogs all of which had tepid critical receptions but did better than they might have at other times of year in 2010s these films have been doing even better with paul blart mall cop and identity thief both vaulting past unimpressed critics to gross over 100 million in consecutive years former is all time top grossing january release mediocre action movies meslow points to book of eli and underworld evolution as films that like their comic counterparts succeeded commercially due to their january release in 2011 he adds rescheduling green hornet to january from its originally intended release previous summer proved to be a very lucrative decision a decade earlier in a piece about his general complaints with august slate editor david plotz included egregious action movies dominating movie screens during month low cost rereleases in 2011 meslow recounts disney rereleased lion king in 3 d to test whether its core audience would be amenable to format experiment wound up becoming highest grossing september release ever it followed it up with beauty and beast in 3 d released following january george lucas primed audiences for star wars prequel trilogy by releasing enhanced special edition of original trilogy during winter dump months meslow recalled low budgets generally taken and paul blart s stars liam neeson and kevin james respectively are not considered a listers bankable enough to open a major movie on strength of their names alone therefore meslow writes they work for lower salaries which helps keep budgets low enough for film to be profitable with a smaller potential audience amid minimal competition teen oriented movies since teenagers demographic with an excess of idle time in january are less interested in movies touted as potential oscar winners than adults meslow reasons studios make effort to release films targeted to them so romantic films like she s all that save last dance and a walk to remember have successfully opened in january low budget parody films of jason friedberg and aaron seltzer such as date movie and meet spartans also did well with teen market in dump months despite strongly negative reception from critics and audiences not all films released in dump months were originally intended for that period however movies that failed to live up to studios hopes for a competitive summer release often come out in winter vegas sevens una lamarche pointed at beginning of 2013 to then upcoming hansel gretel witch hunters as such a film if it were any good she wrote it would be coming out in june it indeed fared poorly in u s but better abroad she also suspected that broken city another upcoming release that starred russell crowe catherine zeta jones and mark wahlberg had been consigned to a january release due to adverse reactions from test audiences and correctly anticipated failure of ensemble comedy movie 43 for same reason for his part meslow points to season of witch a 40 million horror film starring nicolas cage which failed to recoup even that amount and untraceable as emblematic of that kind of big budget bust buried during dump months marketing plan for a film like this is often just a formal wake last stop before a film s reincarnation as generic product for on demand dvd streaming after markets says burr in his times magazine piece others that were not originally intended for dump months get shifted there anyway not because they are bad but because studios cannot figure out how to market them or are not sure they will succeed c robert cargill a former critic for ain t it cool news who scripted successful 2012 horror film sinister points to chronicle which had a surprisingly strong opening on super bowl weekend earlier that year an example similarly lamarche points to two other types of movies difficult to market to large audiences winter can be a boon to little movies with niche audiences she writes pointing to dustin hoffman s directorial debut quartet which received a limited u s release in january 2013 and struck by lightning released at same time movies that also blend genres or defy such categorization such as zombie human romeo and juliet retelling warm bodies or limited release charlie sheen comedy a glimpse inside mind of charles swan iii are also ideal for their dump months release time frame of galaxy had most successful august opening weekend ever until 2016 s suicide squad it went on to become highest grossing august release ever as well as 2014 s top grossing film domestically these accomplishments led industry observers to reconsider whether they should be so dismissive of august a trend that had been building even before that year cary carling noted afterwards in fort worth star telegram that recent augusts had seen a number of critical and commercial successes not only franchise movies such as bourne ultimatum and rise of planet of apes but films that appealed to adult audiences such as blue jasmine help and james brown biopic get on up whose 14 million opening weekend against guardians met expectations is summer movie season expanding out from its traditional boundaries jordan smith asked before month began on hollywood com he noted that some big budget movies released in late spring and early summer of recent years like after earth white house down r i p d and lone ranger had struggled at box office against similar competition he believed a point of saturation had been reached with too many of those movies being released in early summer but audiences are proving that they ll line up at any time of year to watch captain america save day dave of fandango com believes moviegoers are already adapting when a film like guardians of galaxy comes out at time of summer it does it feels like an event regardless of month he sees it as similar to what has happened to tv schedule where both broadcast and cable networks have begun airing new scripted shows during summer which was once relegated to reruns due to small audiences hopes for more success in late august are dependent however on new releases during month in 2017 with only two new studio films in wide release that
