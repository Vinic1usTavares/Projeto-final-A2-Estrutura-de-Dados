snake and smooth snake are non venomous sufficient habitat complexity is a crucial requirement for presence of this species in order to support its various behaviours basking foraging and hibernation as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment it is found in a variety of habitats including chalky downs rocky hillsides moors sandy heaths meadows rough commons edges of woods sunny glades and clearings bushy slopes and hedgerows dumps coastal dunes and stone quarries it will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on banks of

decline though it acknowledges population to be decreasing reduction in habitat for a variety of reasons fragmentation of populations in europe due to intense agriculture practices and collection for pet trade or for venom extraction have been recorded as major contributing factors for its decline behaviour thumb left alt a slender adder lies in a half circle on bare soil which has a few dried

rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed people are generally bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up they will usually disappear into undergrowth at a hint of any danger but will return once all is quiet often to same spot occasionally individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing hoping to warn off potential aggressors

britain males and females hibernate for about 150 and 180 days respectively in northern sweden hibernation lasts 8 9 months on mild winter days they may emerge to bask where snow has melted and will often travel across snow about 15 of adults and 30 40 of juveniles die during hibernation feeding thumb common european adder viper berus thumb v berus female head detail diet consists mainly of small mammals such as mice rats voles and shrews as well as lizards sometimes slow worms are taken and even weasels and moles they feed on amphibians such as frogs newts and salamanders birds are also reported to be consumed especially nestlings and even eggs for which they will climb into shrubbery and bushes generally diet varies depending on locality juveniles will eat nestling mammals small lizards and frogs as well as worms and spiders once they reach about in length their diet begins to resemble that of adults reproduction in hungary mating takes place in last week of april whilst in

thick coils are clearly seen as having prominent keels v berus showing strongly keeled scales on dorsal area males find females by following their scent trails sometimes tracking them for hundreds of metres a day if a female is found and then flees male follows courtship involves side by side parallel flowing behaviour tongue flicking along back and excited lashing of tail pairs stay together for one or two days after mating males chase away their rivals and engage in combat often this also starts with aforementioned flowing behaviour before culminating in dramatic adder dance in this act males confront each other raise up front part of body vertically make swaying movements and attempt to push each other to ground this is repeated until one of two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate appleby 1971 notes that he has never seen an intruder win one of these contests as if frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate

threatening particularly in small children while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after bite length of recovery varies but may take up to a year local symptoms include immediate and intense pain followed after a few minutes but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes by swelling and a tingling sensation blisters containing blood are not common pain may spread within a few hours along with tenderness and inflammation reddish lines and bruising may appear and whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours swelling may also spread to trunk and with children throughout entire body necrosis and syndromes are very rare systemic symptoms resulting from anaphylaxis can be dramatic these may appear within 5 minutes post bite or can be delayed for many hours
