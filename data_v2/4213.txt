oceanic whitetip shark carcharhinus longimanus also known as brown milbert s sand bar shark brown shark lesser white shark nigano shark oceanic white tipped whaler and silvertip shark is a large pelagic requiem shark inhabiting tropical and warm temperate seas its stocky body is most notable for its long white tipped rounded fins though slow moving they are opportunistic and aggressive and are a danger to shipwreck survivors recent studies show steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued as chief ingredient of shark fin soup and as with other shark species whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range taxonomy oceanic whitetip shark or lesser white shark was described in 1831 by naturalist rene primevere lesson who named shark carcharhinus maou it was next described by cuban felipe in 1861 as squalus longimanus name longimanus has also been used species epithet refers to size of its pectoral fins translates from latin as long hands oceanic whitetip shark has many common names in english brown milbert s sand bar shark brown shark nigano shark oceanic white tipped whaler and whitetip shark rules of international commission on zoological nomenclature are that in general first published description has priority therefore valid scientific name for oceanic whitetip shark should be carcharhinus maou however lesson s name remained forgotten for so long that carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted distribution and habitat oceanic whitetip is found globally in deep open oceans with a temperature greater than although exceptionally it occurs in water as cold as it prefers waters between and tends to withdraw from areas when temperatures fall outside of these limits it was once extremely common and widely distributed and still inhabits a wide band around globe however recent studies suggest that its numbers have drastically declined an analysis of us pelagic longline logbook data between 1992 and 2000 covering northwest and western central atlantic estimated a decline of 70 over that period it is found worldwide between 45degn and latitude in september 2004 a vagrant oceanic whitetip shark was seen in brackish waters of in sweden it died shortly after this is only north european record and far north of its usual range limit shark spends most of its time in upper layer of ocean to a depth of and prefers off shore deep ocean areas according to longline capture data increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks occasionally it is found close to land in waters as shallow as mainly around islands such as hawaii or in areas where continental shelf is narrow with access to nearby deep water it is typically solitary though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful unlike many animals it does not have a diurnal cycle and is active both day and night its swimming style is slow with widely spread pectoral fins despite its habitual isolation from members of its own species pilot fish dolphinfish and may accompany it in 1988 jeremy stafford reported seeing an individual accompanied by a shortfin pilot whale description thumb left upper teeth thumb left lower teeth c longimanus most distinguishing characteristics are its long wing like pectoral and dorsal fins fins are significantly larger than most other shark species and are conspicuously rounded shark s nose is rounded and its eyes are circular with nictitating membranes c longimanus has a typical although somewhat flattened requiem shark body often with a mildly humpbacked aspect it is bronze brown bluish or grey dorsally colour varies by region and white ventrally although it may occasionally have a yellow tint oceanic whitetip shark is a medium sized requiem shark largest specimen ever caught measured an exceptionally large size considering few specimens are known to exceed a length of maximum reported weight is female is typically larger than male by males attain sexual maturity at and females about in gulf of mexico in 1950s mean weight of oceanic whitetip sharks was in 1990s sharks of species from same area averaged only most of its fins dorsal pectoral pelvic and caudal have white tips juvenile specimens and some adults may lack these along with white tips fins may be mottled and young specimens can have black marks a saddle like marking may be apparent between first and second dorsal fins shark has several kinds of teeth those in mandible lower jaw have a thin serrated tip and are relatively small and triangular somewhat fang like between 13 and 15 teeth are on either side of symphysis teeth in upper jaw are triangular but much larger and broader with entirely serrated edges 14 or 15 occur along each side of symphysis denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges diet c longimanus feeds mainly on pelagic cephalopods and bony fish however its diet can be far more varied and less selective it is known to eat stingrays sea turtles birds gastropods crustaceans and mammalian carrion bony fish it feeds on include barracuda jacks dolphinfish marlin tuna and mackerel its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth when feeding with other species it becomes aggressive peter benchley author of jaws observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces behaviour thumb oceanic whitetip photographed at elphinstone reef red sea egypt accompanied by pilot fish alt shark accompanied by group of fish with black and white vertical stripes and split tail fin oceanic whitetip is usually solitary and slow moving and tends to cruise near top of water column covering vast stretches of empty water scanning for possible food sources until 16th century sharks were known to mariners as sea dogs and oceanic whitetip most common ship following shark exhibits dog like behaviour when its interest is piqued when attracted to something that appears to be food its movements become more avid and it approaches cautiously but stubbornly retreating and maintaining a safe distance if driven off but ready to rush in if opportunity presents itself oceanic whitetips are not fast swimmers but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed whitetips commonly compete for food with silky sharks making up for its comparatively leisurely swimming style with aggressive displays groups often form when individuals converge on a food source segregation by sex and size does not seem to occur whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid and trail groups of cetaceans such as dolphins and pilot whales scavenging their prey their instinct is to follow migrations that accompany ocean going ships when whaling took place in warm waters oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of damage to floating carcasses reproduction mating season is in early summer in northwest atlantic ocean and southwest indian ocean although females captured in pacific have been found with embryos year round suggesting a longer mating season there shark is viviparous embryos develop in utero and are fed by a placental sac its gestation period is one year litter sizes vary from one to 15 with young born at a length around sexual maturity is reached around for males and for females relationship with humans thumb oceanic

important species for its fins meat and oil it is eaten fresh smoked dried and salted and its hide is used for leather it is subject to fishing pressure throughout virtually its whole range although it is more often taken as bycatch than by design since it is drawn to longline bait that is intended for other species oceanographic researcher jacques cousteau described oceanic whitetip as most dangerous of all sharks despite greater notoriety of great white shark and other sharks habitually found nearer shore oceanic whitetip is suspected to be responsible for many fatal shark bites on humans as a result of predation on survivors of shipwrecks or downed aircraft such incidents are not included in common shark bite indices for 20th and 21st centuries and as a result oceanic whitetip does not have highest number of recorded incidents only five bites had been recorded as of 2009 after uss indianapolis was torpedoed on 30 july 1945 most sailors who survived sinking reportedly died from exposure to elements rather than from shark bites some sailors however are believed to have died from shark bites and oceanic whitetips are believed to have been responsible in those cases also during world war ii rms nova scotia a steamship carrying about 1 000 people near south africa was sunk by a german submarine 192 people survived many deaths were attributed to whitetip in egypt in 2010 one oceanic whitetip was implicated in several bites on tourists in red sea near sharm el sheikh shark was recognized individually by bite mark taken out of its upper tail lobe accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed upon associating divers with an easy supply of food it bit divers and snorkelers on areas of body where it had seen fish being kept namely in fanny packs divers carried this caused shark to target divers buttock and thigh regions in hope of obtaining a meal 2010 sharm el sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans attacks might have been instigated by overfishing in that area of red sea effectively forcing shark closer to shore where bites took place egypt german tourist killed in fourth sharm el sheikh shark attack in a week telegraph co uk 5 december 2010 us experts head to egypt to probe shark attacks cbs news 7 december 2010 dr christopher neff a policy analyst at university of sydney argues that terms like attack are laden with cultural stigmatization instead of word attack he proposes labeling human shark interactions on a scale of extremity as encounters minor bites moderate bites and fatal bites term attack is only appropriate in specific instances where specialists can confirm predatory nature of shark human encounter which is extremely difficult to do while many encounters with oceanic whitetip sharks appear predatory in nature without verification of a scientific community in each instance neff argues that it is best to assume accidental or intent of encounters captivity oceanic whitetip has fared better in captivity than other large sharks of open ocean such as mako and blue shark among five recorded captive oceanic whitetips three with time records all lived for more than a year in captivity one of these a female in monterey bay aquarium s outer bay exhibit lived for more than three years during which it grew two remaining lack a time record but grew about during their time in captivity conservation status in 1969 and backus wrote of oceanic whitetip it is extraordinarily abundant perhaps most abundant large animal large being over 100 pounds 45 kg on face of earth little further population study occurred until 2003 when numbers were estimated to have dropped by as much as 70 in northwest and western central atlantic between 1992 and 2000 another study focusing on gulf of mexico using a mix of data from us pelagic longline surveys from mid 1950s and observations from late 1990s estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99 3 over this period however changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates as a result of these findings its status on iucn red list was moved to vulnerable globally from lower risk near threatened and critically endangered in northwest and western central atlantic areas under 1995 un agreement on conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks coastal and fishing states are specifically required to adopt measures to conserve listed species but little progress is visible on oceanic whitetip from 3 january 2013 shark was fully protected in new zealand territorial waters under wildlife act 1953 new zealand department of conservation has classified oceanic whitetip shark as migrant with qualifier secure overseas under new zealand threat classification system in march 2013 three endangered commercially valuable sharks hammerheads oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to appendix ii of cites bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation on january 30 2018 noaa fisheries published a final rule to list oceanic whitetip shark as a threatened species under united states
