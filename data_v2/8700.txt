gromoboi meaning thunderer was an armoured cruiser built for imperial russian navy in late 1890s she was designed as a long range commerce raider and served as such during russo japanese war of 1904 05 when war broke out she was based in vladivostok and made several sorties in search of japanese shipping in conflict s early months without much success gromoboi with other armoured cruisers of vladivostok cruiser squadron attempted to rendezvous in strait of tsushima with main portion of russian pacific fleet sailing from port arthur in august 1904 fleet was delayed and squadron returned to port alone on return squadron encountered a japanese squadron of four armoured cruisers blocking their passage to base japanese sank oldest russian ship and damaged gromoboi and during subsequent battle off ulsan both russian ships were repaired within two months gromoboi ran aground immediately after completing her repairs and was out of action for four months three months after damage from grounding incident was repaired she struck a mine but successfully returned to port her armament was reinforced while under repair but she saw no further action during war gromoboi was transferred to russian baltic fleet after end of war and began a lengthy refit that was completed in 1911 she was mostly inactive during world war i but had her armament and protection upgraded during war she was placed into reserve in 1918 and sold to a german company in 1922 for scrapping she was forced aground near liepaja during a storm en route to germany and was scrapped in place design and description gromoboi was originally intended to be a repeat of but a design modification for thicker armour and improved engines made that unfeasible use of rossias hull design meant that ships looked alike mclaughlin p 55 gromoboi was long overall she had a maximum beam of and a draught of ship displaced only more than designed she was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce biofouling mclaughlin pp 55 74 as completed gromoboi trimmed badly by bow which reduced her speed and made her very wet forward loads had to be shifted aft and ballast added to rear of ship to correct her trim but she was regarded as a good sea boat afterward with an easy although rapid roll mclaughlin p 60 propulsion gromoboi dispensed with rossias cruising engine on centre shaft three equally powerful vertical triple expansion steam engines were used with a designed total of but they developed on trials and drove ship to a maximum speed of thirty two belleville water tube boilers provided steam for engines she could carry a maximum of of coal this gave her a radius of action of at armament gromobois main armament consisted of four 45 calibre pattern 1892 guns forward pair was mounted in casemates above forward main deck gun s casemate two rear guns were situated in sponsons abreast mizzenmast protected by gun shields watts p 93 guns could be depressed to 5deg and elevated to 18deg they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of which gave a range of at 13deg elevation her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 45 pattern 1892 guns one gun was mounted under forecastle and another in stern neither gun could fire to side most of remaining guns were mounted in casemates forward pair in front of eight inch guns on upper deck and rest on main deck one pair was mounted on upper deck protected by gun shields brook p 38 in their pivot mounts guns could depress to 6deg and elevate to 20deg they fired pattern 1907 high explosive projectiles at a muzzle velocity of this gave a range of at maximum elevation 240 rounds per gun were carried by gromoboi defence against torpedo boats was provided by a variety of light calibre weapons gromoboi had 24 canet pattern 1892 50 caliber guns mounted in sponsons on upper deck protected by gun shields gun fired shells to a range of about at its maximum elevation of with a muzzle velocity of rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute ship carried twelve hotchkiss guns they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of ship also carried 18 hotchkiss guns these fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of gromoboi also had four submerged torpedo tubes with two mounted on each broadside armour naval ministry had hoped to increase gromobois armour thickness and increase armour protection of armament but still use rossia hull design ministry also hoped to use new more resistant krupp armour but russian plants had proven unable to manufacture it when it was ordered and harvey armour was used instead sources differ on type of armour actually used brook gardiner and grey and watts all state that krupp cemented armour was used in fact for gromoboi waterline belt was reduced in thickness by from older ship to six inches to better protect her guns belt was shortened by in length to only it was reduced in height by as well to a total of it extended above waterline and below waterline belt was closed off by six inch bulkheads fore and aft gardiner p 190 gromobois casemates were thick with two inch backs and roofs two inch thick transverse bulkhead fore and aft protected them from raking fire armour deck was 1 5 inches thick on flat and thick where it sloped down to meet belt protective deck extended fore and aft of armour deck and ranged from in thickness change in machinery allowed gromoboi to dispense with rossias glacis armour that had been necessary to protect tops of engine cylinders conning tower had walls thick made of krupp armour funnel uptakes and ammunition hoists were protected by 1 5 inches of armour between lower and middle decks service gromoboi was built by baltic works in saint petersburg construction began on 14 june 1897 although she was not formally laid down until 7 may 1898 and ship was launched on 8 may 1899 she was transferred to kronstadt on 24 november 1899 to finish fitting out but was forced aground by sea ice she was freed three days later but needed repairs to her sheathing she left liepaja on 10 december 1900 en route to far east and stopped briefly at kiel where she was inspected by prince henry of prussia and at plymouth where officers visited devonport naval base she represented russia at granting of constitution to australia visiting sydney and melbourne in april may 1901 before visiting nagasaki in july gromoboi finally reached port arthur on 29 july 1901 she remained in pacific until beginning of russo japanese war in 1904 mclaughlin p 77 during this voyage she was commanded by karl petrovich jessen russo japanese war 300px thumb left gromoboi left and rossia in vladivostok by this time gromoboi was assigned of vladivostok cruiser squadron under command of rear admiral karl jessen other ships were armoured cruisers rossia and as well as protected cruiser squadron made a number of sorties against japanese shipping early in war only one was reasonably successful in june 1904 squadron sank hitachi maru which was carrying eighteen siege howitzers and over 1000 troops intended for siege of port arthur brook p 34 battle off ulsan during war bulk of russian pacific fleet was located in port arthur where it was blockaded by japanese on 10 august ships at port arthur attempted breakout to vladivostok but were turned back in battle of yellow sea admiral jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them but order was delayed his ships had to raise steam so he did not sortie until evening of 13 august bogatyr had been damaged earlier when she grounded and did not sail with squadron by dawn he had reached island of tsushima in tsushima strait between korea and japan he turned back for vladivostok when he failed to see any ships from port arthur squadron north of island he encountered japanese squadron commanded by vice admiral kamimura tasked to patrol tsushima strait japanese force had four modern armoured cruisers and two squadrons had passed during night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light this put japanese ships astride russian route to vladivostok brook pp 34 37 jessen turned to northeast when he spotted japanese at 05 00 and they followed suit albeit on a slightly converging course both sides opened fire around 05 23 at a range of japanese ships concentrated their fire on rurik rear ship of russian formation she was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of other two ships jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open range but this blinded russian gunners with rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on japanese about 06 00 jessen turned 180deg to starboard in an attempt to reach korean coast and to allow rurik to rejoin squadron kamimura followed suit around 06 10 but turned to port which opened range between squadrons azuma then developed engine problems and japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed firing recommenced at 06 24 and rurik was hit three times in stern flooding her steering compartment she had to be steered with her engines her speed continued to decrease further exposing her to japanese fire and her steering jammed to port around 06 40 brook pp 39 43 thumb right gromobois starboard side after battle off ulsan note holes in ship jessen made another 180deg turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between japanese and rurik but latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between jessen s ships and japanese kamimura turned 180deg as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses but jessen quickly made another 180deg turn so that they headed on opposing courses iwate was hit around this time which knocked out three 6 inch and one 12 pounder guns killing 32 and wounding 43 japanese squadron opened range again when it made a 180deg another turn to port russians reversed course for third time around 07 45 in another attempt to support rurik although rossia was on fire herself her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later kamimura circled rurik to south at 08 00 and allowed other two russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to vladivostok despite this jessen turned back once more at 08 15 and ordered rurik to make her own way back to vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed about brook p 43 about this time kamimura s two elderly protected cruisers and were approaching from south their arrival allowed kamimura to pursue jessen with all of his armoured cruisers while two new arrivals dealt with rurik they fought a running battle with russians for next hour and a half scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to engines again broke down during this chase and she was replaced in line by tokiwa japanese closed to a minimum of about but kamimura then opened range up to thumb left a close up of gromobois stern after battle about 10 00 kamimura s gunnery officer erroneously informed him that izumo had expended three quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five minute rapid fire barrage he did not wish to leave tsushima strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on rurik by this time she had been sunk by and takachiho which had closed to of rurik in order to finish her off they had radioed kamimura that she was sunk but he did not receive message shortly after japanese turned back gromoboi and rossia were forced to heave to to make repairs brook pp 43 45 gromoboi suffered 87 dead and 170 wounded far more than rossias 44 dead and 156 wounded this was attributable to rossias captain s policy of ordering gun crews for his quick firing guns on engaged side to lie down and those on unengaged side to go below in contrast to gromoboi keeping her light guns manned at all times brook p 45 gromoboi was hit fifteen times on starboard side of her hull and seven times on her port side plus other hits in her funnels boats and decks she also suffered a fire caused by ignition of excess propellant charges despite this number of hits she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated she was repaired within two months by rudimentary facilities available at vladivostok brook pp 45 47 immediately following her repairs she ran aground outside vladivostok on 13 october and was not ready for sea until february 1905 mclaughlin pp 77 78 russians took this opportunity to reinforce her armament with six more 6 inch guns mounted on her upper deck protected by lightly armoured casemates her armament was rearranged as well with her foremost six inch guns moved from their casemates to forecastle and rearmost six inch guns moved forward room for these changes was made by removing many of her lighter guns she retained only nineteen 75 mm and two 37 mm guns she also received several barr and stroud rangefinders at this time while testing her new telefunken radio equipment on 24 may she struck a mine near her forward boiler room she was able to return to vladivostok for repairs but took no further part in war interwar period gromoboi returned to baltic fleet after war there she was given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1911 her engines and boilers were reconditioned and her rear torpedo tubes were removed forward 15 inch torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes her foremast was removed and replaced by her mizzenmast her mainmast was moved aft in place of mizzenmast and searchlights were installed on a platform on each mast a casemate with 3 inch sides and a 1 inch roof was built around rear eight inch guns and rear six inch guns were moved aft and protected by a casemate with two inch sides and a roof thickness of upper deck casemates was increased to two inches armoured towers fore and aft were built for her rangefinders her light armament was reduced to four 75 mm and four 47 mm guns engine trials were conducted in late 1910 and were unsatisfactory as they were overheating while delivering only trials were run again on 27 july 1911 and were more satisfactory as they developed while gromoboi reached world war i thumb right gromoboi aground near liepaja gromoboi served in 2nd cruiser brigade of baltic fleet during world war i she was modified to serve as a fast minelayer with a capacity of two hundred mines she engaged german battlecruiser at entrance to gulf of finland on august 10 1915 her armament was changed in 1916 and gray p 295 as well she exchanged six inch guns on bow and stern for eight inch guns these additions increased her broadside to four eight inch and eleven six inch guns all of her remaining light guns were removed and she received two 2 5 inch and two 47 mm anti aircraft guns all of these additions raised her displacement to about gromoboi came under control of soviet red fleet in september 1917 treaty of brest litovsk required soviets to evacuate their base at helsinki in march 1918 or have them interned by newly independent finland even though gulf of finland was still frozen over gromoboi sailed to kronstadt in what became known as ice voyage and was placed into reserve shortly after her arrival mclaughlin p 78 post world war i in late october 1920 gromobois crew mutinied and took control of ship off kronstadt they killed gromobois commisars and officers and scuttled ship gromoboi was refloated and was sold to a german company for scrapping on 1 july 1922 she ran aground in a storm near liepaja while under tow to germany in october 1922
