le visage nuptial one could speak of successive distinct versions each one presenting a particular state of musical material without successor invalidating previous one or vice versa although he notes

cantatas based on poetry of rene char of le visage nuptial paul griffiths observes that char s five poems speak in hard edged surrealist imagery of an ecstatic sexual passion which boulez reflected in music on borders of fevered hysteria in its original version 1946 47 piece was scored for small forces soprano contralto two ondes martenot piano and percussion forty years later boulez arrived at definitive version for soprano mezzo soprano chorus and orchestra 1985 1989 le soleil des eaux 1948 originated in incidental music for a radio drama by char it went through three further versions before reaching its final form in 1965 as a piece for soprano mixed chorus and orchestra samuel 2002 422 first movement complainte du lezard amoureux is a love song addressed by a lizard to a goldfinch in heat of a summer day jameux 23 40 257 second la sorgue is described by griffiths as a violent and incantatory protest against pollution of river sorgue griffiths 1978 18 19 second piano sonata 1947 48 is a half hour work which according to goldman requires formidable technical prowess from performer goldman 7 its four movements follow standard pattern of a classical sonata but in each of them boulez subverts traditional model of two middle movements boulez said i tried to disintegrate slow movement form by use of trope and repetitive scherzo form by use of variation form boulez 1975 41 42 for griffiths violent character of much of music is not just superficial it is expressive of a whole aesthetic of annihilation and in particular of a need to obliterate what had gone before griffiths 1978 16 boulez played work for aaron copland who asked but must we start a revolution all over again yes mercilessly boulez replied ross 378 total serialism that revolution entered its most extreme phase in 1950 1952 when boulez developed a technique in which not only pitch but other musical parameters duration dynamics timbre and attack were organised according to serial principles an approach known as total serialism or messiaen had already made an experiment in this direction in his mode de et d for piano 1949 boulez s first sketches towards total serialism appeared in parts of livre pour quatuor book for quartet 1948 49 revised 2011 12 a collection of movements for string quartet from which players may choose at any one performance foreshadowing boulez s later interest in variable form hopkins and griffiths in early 1950s boulez began to apply technique rigorously ordering each parameter into sets of twelve and prescribing no repetition until all twelve had sounded according to music critic alex ross resulting surfeit of ever changing musical data has effect of erasing at any given point previous impressions listener may have formed present moment is all there is ross 363 364 boulez linked this development to a desire by his generation to create a tabula rasa after war his works in this idiom are polyphonie x withdrawn for 18 instruments two musique concrete etudes 1951 52 withdrawn and structures book i for two pianos 1951 52 speaking of structures book i in 2011 boulez described it as a piece in which responsibility of composer is practically absent had computers existed at that time i would have put data through them and made piece that way but i did it by hand it was a demonstration through absurd asked whether it should still be listened to as music boulez replied i am not terribly eager to listen to it but for me it was an experiment that was absolutely necessary le marteau sans maitre and pli selon pli structures book i was a turning point for boulez recognising a lack of expressive flexibility in language described in his essay at limit of fertile land boulez 1991 162 boulez loosened strictness of total serialism into a more supple and strongly gestural music i am trying to rid myself of my thumbprints and taboos he wrote to cage campbell 13 most significant result of this new freedom was le marteau sans maitre 1953 1955 described by griffiths and bill hopkins as a keystone of twentieth century music three short poems by char form starting point for three interlocking cycles four movements are vocal settings of poems one is set twice other five are instrumental commentaries according to hopkins and griffiths music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute vibraphone percussion guitar and viola boulez said that choice of these instruments showed influence of non european cultures to which he had always been attracted boulez 1976 67 thumb upright alt head and shoulders photograph of middle aged white man with neat beard full head of greying hair stephane mallarme for text of his next major work pli selon pli 1957 1989 boulez turned to symbolist poetry of stephane mallarme attracted by its extreme density and radical syntax boulez 1976 93 at seventy minutes it is his longest composition three improvisations of increasing complexity on individual sonnets are framed by two orchestral movements into which fragments of other poems are embedded guldbrandsen boulez s word setting which in first improvisation is straightforwardly syllabic becomes ever more melismatic to point where words cannot be distinguished boulez s stated aim was to make sonnets become music at a deeper structural level bradshaw 186 piece is scored for soprano and large orchestra often deployed in chamber groups boulez described its sound world rich in percussion as not so much frozen as extraordinarily vitrified boulez 1976 94 work had a complex genesis reaching its definitive form in 1989 samuel 2002 424 25 controlled chance from 1950s boulez experimented with what he called controlled chance and he developed his views on aleatoric music in articles alea boulez 1991 26 38 and que me tu in which he wrote of investigation of a relative world a permanent discovering rather like state of permanent revolution boulez 1986 143 peyser observes that boulez s use of chance is very different from that in works of john cage while in cage s music performers are often given freedom to create completely unforeseen sounds with object of removing composer s intention from music in boulez s music they may only choose between possibilities that have been written out in detail by composer peyser 1976 126 129 this method when applied to successional order of sections is often described as mobile form a technique innovated by composer earle brown and inspired by mobile sculptures of alexander calder to whom brown and cage introduced boulez when he was visiting new york in 1952 barbedette 143 borchardt hume 70 71 boulez employed variants of technique in a number of works over next two decades in third piano sonata 1955 1957 revised 1963 pianist may choose different routes through score and in one movement trope has option of omitting certain passages altogether gardner and o hagan 179 in eclat 1965 conductor triggers order in which each player joins ensemble in domaines 1961 1968 it is soloist who dictates order in which sections are played by his movement around stage in later works such as cummings ist der dichter 1970 revised 1986 a chamber cantata for 16 solo voices and small orchestra using a poem by e e cummings conductor is given choice as to order of certain events but there is no freedom for individual player in its original version pli selon pli also contained elements of choice for instrumentalists but much of this was eliminated in later revisions by contrast figures doubles prismes 1957 1968 is a fixed work with no chance element piencikowski describes it as a great cycle of variations whose components each other instead of remaining isolated in traditional manner piencikowski it is notable for unusual layout of orchestra in which various families of instruments woodwind brass etc are scattered across stage rather than being grouped together boulez 2003 101 middle period works jonathan goldman identifies a major aesthetic shift in boulez s work from mid 1970s onwards characterised variously by presence of thematic writing a return to vertical harmony and to clarity and legibility of form goldman xv xvi boulez himself said envelope is simpler contents are not i think in my recent work it is true that first approach is more direct and gesture is more obvious let s say ford 23 works from this period are amongst his most frequently performed for goldman rituel in memoriam bruno maderna 1974 75 marks beginning of this development boulez wrote this twenty five minute work as an epitaph for his friend and colleague italian composer and conductor who died in 1973 at age of 53 piece is divided into fifteen sections orchestra into eight groups while odd numbered sections are conducted in even sections conductor merely sets each group in motion and its progress is regulated by a percussionist beating time in his dedication boulez described work as a ritual of disappearance and survival griffiths refers to work s awesome grandeur griffiths 1978 58 59 notations i iv 1980 are first four transformations of piano miniatures from 1945 into pieces for very large orchestra in his review of new york premiere andrew porter wrote that single idea of each original piece has as it were been passed through a many faceted bright prism and broken into a thousand linked lapped sparkling fragments finale a terse modern rite which sets pulses racing porter 88 derive 1 1984 dedicated to william glock on his retirement from bath festival is a short quintet in which piano takes lead material is derived from six chords and according to ivan hewett piece shuffles and decorates these chords bursting outwards in spirals and eddies before returning to its starting point at end music shivers into silence works with electronics boulez likened experience of listening to pre recorded electronic music in concert hall to a crematorium ceremony his real interest lay in instantaneous transformation of live instrumental sounds but technology did not become available until late 1970s and founding of ircam before then he had produced deux etudes 1951 for magnetic tape for pierre schaeffer s groupe recherche de la francaise peyser 1976 67 as well as a large scale piece for live orchestra with tape poesie pour pouvoir 1958 he was dissatisfied with both pieces and withdrew them rocco 67 an interview with dominique jameux in boulez 1981 201 02 jameux 114 16 first piece completed at ircam was repons 1980 1984 in this forty minute work an instrumental ensemble is placed in middle of hall while six soloists encircle audience two pianos harp cimbalom vibraphone and glockenspiel xylophone it is their music which is transformed electronically and projected through space peter heyworth described moment at which they enter some ten minutes into piece it is as though a great window were thrown open through which a new sound world enters and with it a new world of imagination even more impressive is fact that there is no longer a schism between worlds of natural and electronic sounds but rather a continuous spectrum heyworth 1982 dialogue de l ombre double 1982 1985 for clarinet and electronics grew out of a fragment of domaines and was a gift for luciano berio on his 60th birthday lasting around eighteen minutes it is a dialogue between a solo clarinet played live though sometimes reverberated through an offstage piano and its double in passages pre recorded by same musician and projected around hall boulez approved transcriptions of piece for bassoon in 1995 and for recorder in 2011 in early 1970s he had worked on an extended chamber piece called explosante fixe for eight solo instruments electronically transformed by a machine called a but technology was still primitive and he eventually withdrew it vermeil 207 209 and 210 jameux 176 77 he re used some of its material in other works including a later piece with same name campbell and o hagan 297 this definitive version recorded commercially was composed at ircam between 1991 and 1993 for midi flute and two accompanying flutes with ensemble and live electronics by this time technology was such that computer could follow score and respond to triggers from players rocco 68 according to griffiths principal flute is caught as if in a hall of mirrors its line imitated in what other flutes play and then in contributions of larger ensemble griffiths 1995b hopkins and griffiths describe it as music characteristically caught between thrill and desperation anthemes ii for violin and electronics 1997 grew out of a piece for solo violin anthemes i 1991 which boulez wrote for yehudi menuhin violin competition in paris and which in turn derived from material in original explosante fixe virtuoso writing for instrument is captured by electronic system transformed in real time and propelled around space to create what jonathan goldman calls a hyper violin although this gives rise to effects of speed and complexity which no violinist could achieve boulez restricts palette of electronic sounds so that their source violin is always recognisable goldman 169 172 last works in his subsequent works boulez relinquished electronics although griffiths suggests that in sur incises 1996 1998 choice of like but distinct instruments widely spread across platform allowed boulez to create effects of harmonic timbral and spatial echo for which he had previously needed electronic means piece is scored for three pianos three harps and three percussionists including steel drums and grew out of incises 1993 2001 a short piece written for use in a piano competition griffiths 2005 105 in an interview in 2013 he described it as his most important work because it is freest boulez 2017 249 notation vii 1999 marked hieratic in score is longest of completed orchestral notations according to griffiths what was abrupt in 1945 is now languorous what was crude is now done with a lifetime s experience and expertise what was simple is fantastically embellished even submerged griffiths 2005 102 derive 2 began life in 1988 as a five minute piece dedicated to elliott carter on his 80th birthday by 2006 it was a 45 minute work for eleven instruments and boulez s last major composition according to claude samuel boulez wanted to delve into field of rhythmic shifts tempo changes and of different speeds inspired in part by his contact with music of gyorgy ligeti boulez described it as a sort of narrative mosaic samuel 2013 unfinished works a distinction may be made between works which boulez was actively progressing and those which he put to one side despite their potential for further development in latter category archives contain three unpublished movements of third piano 4 and further sections of eclat multiples which if performed would practically double its length as for works boulez was known to be working on in his later years premieres of two more orchestral notations v and vi were announced by chicago symphony orchestra for may 2006 but postponed he was in process of developing anthemes 2 into a large scale work for violin and orchestra for anne sophie nick october 2005 anne sophie mutter interview by nick shave gramophone retrieved 1 april 2018 and spoke of writing an opera based on beckett s waiting for godot ross alex 25 january 2016 magus new yorker retrieved 26 march 2016 none of these projects came to fruition character and personal life as a young man boulez was an explosive often confrontational figure jean louis barrault who knew him in his twenties caught contradictions in his personality his powerful aggressiveness was a sign of creative passion a particular blend of intransigence and humour way his moods of affection and insolence succeeded one another all these had drawn us near to him barrault 205 messiaen said later he was in revolt against everything samuel 1976 111 indeed at one point boulez turned against messiaen describing his trois petites liturgies de la presence divine as brothel music and saying that turangalila symphonie made him vomit it was five years before relations were restored in a 2000 article in new yorker alex ross described him as a bully boulez did not disagree certainly i was a bully i m not ashamed of it at all hostility of establishment to what you were able to do in forties and fifties was very strong sometimes you have to fight against your society most notorious instance of this is boulez s declaration in 1952 that any musician who has not experienced i do not say understood but truly experienced necessity of dodecaphonic music is useless for his whole work is irrelevant to needs of his epoch boulez 1991 113 on other hand those who knew him well often referred to his loyalty both to individuals and to organisations barbedette 15 when his mentor conductor roger desormiere was paralysed by a stroke in 1952 boulez sent scripts to french radio in desormiere s name so that older man could collect fee peyser 1976 116 writer jean vermeil who observed boulez in 1990s in company of jean founder of percussions de strasbourg discovered a boulez asking about health of a musician in strasbourg orchestra about another player s children a boulez who knew everyone by name and who reacted to each person s news with sadness or with joy vermeil 18 in later life he was known for his charm and personal warmth of his humour gerard mcburney wrote that it depended on his twinkling eyes his perfect timing his infectious schoolboy giggle and his reckless compulsion always to say what other person would not expect thumb senecio head of a man 1922 by paul klee boulez read widely and identified proust joyce and kafka as particular influences archimbaud 152 153 he had a lifelong interest in visual arts he wrote extensively about painter paul klee and collected contemporary art including works by joan miro francis bacon nicholas de stael and maria helena vieira da silva all of whom he knew personally barbedette 149 151 34 35 117 153 222 he also had close links with three of leading philosophers of time gilles deleuze michel foucault and roland barbedette 54 55 he was a keen walker and when he was at home in baden baden spent late afternoons and much of weekends walking in black forest peyser 1976 171 he owned an old farmhouse in alpes de hautes provence department of france and built another modern home on same land in late 1970s in its obituary new york times reported that about his private life he remained tightly guarded boulez acknowledged to joan peyser that there was a passionate affair in 1946 described as intense and tormented and which peyser suggested was trigger for wild courageous works of that period peyser 1976 33 34 and 113 after boulez s death his sister jeanne told biographer merlin that affair was with actress maria casares but merlin concludes that there is little evidence to support this merlin 42 44 author and blogger norman lebrecht who knew boulez speculated that he was gay citing fact that for many years he shared his home in baden baden with hans messner whom he sometimes referred to as his valet lebrecht 183 in his portrait for new yorker published shortly after boulez s death under title magus alex ross described him as affable implacable unknowable conducting boulez was one of leading conductors of second half of twentieth century in a career lasting more than sixty years he directed most of world s major orchestras he was entirely self taught although he said that he learnt a great deal from attending desormiere s and hans rosbaud s rehearsals boulez 2003 137 boulez 2017 37 he also cited george szell as an influential mentor rosenberg 383 84 398 thumb pierre boulez conducting at blossom music center in 1969 photo by peter hastings courtesy of cleveland orchestra archives boulez gave various reasons for conducting as much as he did he gave his first concerts for domaine musical because its financial resources were limited i told myself that being much less expensive i would have a go myself boulez 2003 4 he also said that best possible training for a composer was to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments glock 133 writer and pianist susan bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by stockhausen who from late 1950s was increasingly prolific french litterateur and musicologist pierre disagreed boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it peyser 1976 147 not everyone agreed about greatness of that gift for conductor otto klemperer he was without doubt only man of his generation who is an outstanding conductor and musician heyworth 1973 120 for critic hans keller he was incapable of phrasing it s as simple as that that s why he conducts bach beethoven or webern in exactly same way vermeil 169 joan peyser considered that in general boulez conducts what he loves magnificently conducts what he likes very well and with rare exceptions gives stiff performances of classic and romantic repertoire peyser 1976 210 he worked with many leading soloists and had particularly long term collaborations with daniel barenboim and jessye norman vermeil 179 244 according to peter heyworth boulez produced a lean athletic sound which underpinned by his rhythmic exactitude could generate an electric sense of excitement ability to reveal structure of a score and to clarify dense orchestral textures were hallmarks of his conducting he conducted without a baton and as heyworth observed there is no trace of theatre not even rather theatrical sort of economy that was practised by richard strauss heyworth 1986 25 26 according to boulez outward excitement uses up inner excitement glock 137 boulez s ear for sound was legendary there are countless stories of him detecting for example faulty intonation from third oboe in a complex orchestral texture paul griffiths wrote in new york times oliver knussen himself a well known composer conductor observed that his rehearsals are models of clear headedness and professional courtesy he effortlessly commands respect opera thumb 1976 centenary production of der ring des nibelungen at bayreuth festival conducted by boulez boulez also conducted in opera house his chosen repertoire was small and included no italian opera apart from wagner he conducted only twentieth century works things might have been different had his collaboration with wieland wagner not ended prematurely of their work on wozzeck and parsifal boulez said i would willingly have hitched if not my entire fate then at least a part of it to someone like him for our discussions about music and productions were thrilling they planned other productions together including salome and elektra boris godunov and don giovanni but by time rehearsals for their bayreuth parsifal began wieland was already gravely ill and he died in october 1966 boulez 2003 8 boulez 2017 41 when frankfurt wozzeck was revived after wieland s death boulez was deeply disillusioned by working conditions there was no rehearsal no care taken over anything cynicism of way an opera house like that was run disgusted me it still disgusts me he later said that it was this experience which prompted his notorious remarks in an interview following year in der spiegel in which he claimed that no opera worth mentioning had been composed since 1935 that a beatles record is certainly cleverer and shorter than a henze opera and that most elegant solution to opera s moribund condition would be to blow opera houses up in 1967 boulez theatre director jean vilar and choreographer maurice bejart were asked to devise a scheme for reform of paris opera with a view to boulez becoming its music director their plan was derailed by political fallout from 1968 student protests heyworth 1986 31 32 later in mid 1980s boulez became vice president of planned opera bastille in paris working with daniel barenboim who was to be its music director in 1988 a newly appointed director pierre berge dismissed barenboim boulez withdrew in solidarity in event boulez conducted only specific projects in productions by leading stage directors when he could be satisfied that conditions were right thanks to his years with barrault company theatrical dimension was as important to him as musical and he always attended staging rehearsals jampol 10 thumb left patrice chereau for centenary ring in bayreuth boulez originally asked ingmar bergman then peter brook to direct both of whom refused peter stein initially agreed but withdrew in 1974 boulez chereau peduzzi and schmidt 15 16 patrice chereau who was primarily a theatre director accepted and went on to create one of defining opera productions of modern times according to allan kozinn production helped open floodgates of directorial reinterpretation of opera sometimes known as chereau treated story in part as an allegory of capitalism drawing on ideas that george bernard shaw explored in perfect wagnerite in 1898 he updated action to nineteenth and twentieth centuries using imagery of industrial age and he achieved an unprecedented degree of naturalism in singers performances boulez s conducting was no less controversial emphasising continuity flexibility and transparency over mythic grandeur and weight boulez chereau peduzzi and schmidt 22 23 in its first year production was greeted with hostility by largely conservative audience and a core of around thirty orchestral musicians refused to work with boulez in subsequent seasons wagner 167 both production and musical realisation grew in stature over following four years and after final performance in 1980 there was a 90 minute ovation barbedette 183 boulez worked with chereau again on berg s lulu in paris 1979 and janacek s from house of dead in vienna 2007 his other preferred director was peter stein of debussy s pelleas et melisande boulez had written i don t like french tradition of sweetness and gentleness work is not gentle at all but cruel and mysterious heyworth 1986 30 stein realised that vision in his staging for welsh national opera in 1992 john rockwell describing it as an abstract angry pelleas one perhaps over intent on emphasizing score s links to modernity david stevens described their 1995 production of schoenberg s moses und aron in amsterdam as theatrically and musically thrilling from mid 1960s boulez spoke of composing an opera himself his attempts to find a librettist were unsuccessful both times writer has died on me so i m a bit superstitious about looking for a third candidate from late 1960s he exchanged ideas with radical french playwright and novelist jean genet and a subject treason was agreed on heyworth 1986 29 parts of a draft libretto were found among genet s papers after his death in 1986 boulez later turned to german playwright heiner muller who was working on a reduction of aeschylus s oresteia when he died in 1995 again without leaving anything usable in 1980s he discussed with patrice chereau an adaptation of genet s 1961 play les screens which was planned for 1989 opening of opera bastille in paris but this too came to nothing barulich 52 boulez 1981 26 in a 1996 interview boulez said that he was thinking of edward bond s war plays or lear but only thinking when news emerged in 2010 that he was working on an opera based on samuel beckett s waiting for godot few believed such an ambitious undertaking could be realised so late in day recording boulez s first recordings date from his time with domaine musical in late 1950s and early 1960s and were made for french vega label they document his first thoughts on works which he would subsequently re record such as varese s integrales and schoenberg s chamber symphony no 1 as well as pieces to which he did not return in studio such as stravinsky s renard and stockhausen s they also include first of his five recordings of le marteau sans maitre with contralto marie therese cahn in 2015 universal music brought together recordings from this period in a 10 cd

to webern edition which boulez supervised consisting of all works with opus numbers when he took up his posts with new york philharmonic and bbc symphony orchestras and later ensemble intercontemporain he made most of his recordings with them a particular focus of columbia years was a wide ranging survey of music of schoenberg including gurrelieder and moses und aron but also less well known works such as unaccompanied choral music as for boulez s own music in 1969 there was a first recording of pli selon pli with halina as soprano soloist and recordings of rituel and eclat multiples in 2014 sony classical issued pierre boulez complete columbia album collection on 67 cds three operatic projects from this period were picked up by other labels bayreuth ring was released on

cleveland in united states and vienna and berlin in europe he re recorded much of his core repertoire orchestral music of debussy ravel stravinsky and bartok and oversaw a second webern edition extending this time to unpublished works his own late music featured prominently including repons explosante fixe and sur incises there was also a recording of pli selon pli with christine schafer in

released 2008 in addition many hundreds of concerts conducted by boulez are held in archives of radio stations and orchestras occasional releases provide a glimpse of wealth of material they contain in 2005 for example chicago symphony orchestra released a 2 cd set of broadcasts by boulez focusing in particular on works which he had not otherwise recorded including janacek s glagolitic mass suite from debussy s le martyre de saint sebastien and messiaen s l ascension performing from time to time in early part of his career boulez performed publicly as a pianist usually as part of a mixed programme in which he also conducted orchestral or instrumental music in 1955 he accompanied tenor jean giraudeau in a recording of songs by stravinsky and mussorgsky stravinsky mussorgsky melodies en francais decca re released online in 2017 through bnf restoration project between 1957 and 1959 he gave several performances of his own third piano 180 81 a performance he gave in darmstadt on 30

1966 and christa ludwig in songs by berg at a new york philharmonic orchestra concert in february 1972 vermeil 190 and 204 a rare example of his pianism in later life was a short film made by austrian television in 1992 in which boulez played his early notations writing and teaching according to jean jacques nattiez boulez was one of two twentieth century composers who wrote most prolifically about music other being schoenberg boulez 1981 12 13 ironically it was with a 1952 article with inflammatory title schoenberg is dead published in british journal score shortly after older composer s death that boulez first attracted international attention as a writer boulez 1991 209 14 this highly polemical piece in which he attacked schoenberg for his conservatism contrasting it with webern s radicalism caused widespread controversy glock 1991 89 90 jonathan goldman points out that over decades boulez s writings addressed very different readerships in 1950s cultured parisian attendees of domaine musical in 1960s specialised avant garde composers and performers of darmstadt and basel courses and between 1976 and 1995 highly literate but non specialist audience of lectures he gave as professor of college de france goldman 4 much of boulez s writing was linked to specific occasions whether a first performance of a new piece notes for a recording or a eulogy for a lost colleague generally he avoided publishing detailed analyses other than one of rite of spring as nattiez points out as a writer boulez is a communicator of ideas rather than of technical information this may sometimes prove disappointing to composition students but it is no doubt a peculiarity of his writing that explains its popularity with non musicians boulez 1981 14 boulez s writings have appeared in english as stocktakings from an apprenticeship boulez on music today and orientations collected writings his college de france lectures were published in english for first time in 2018 by faber faber under title pierre boulez music lessons complete college de france lectures throughout his career he also expressed himself through long form interviews of which perhaps most substantial are those
