thumb aerial photo of where us digital forensics standards were developed in 1980s and 90s digital forensics sometimes known as digital forensic science is a branch of forensic science encompassing recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices often in relation to computer crime term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data with roots in personal computing revolution of late 1970s and early 1980s discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during 1990s and it was not until early 21st century that national policies emerged digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts criminal cases involve alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by police and prosecuted by state such as murder theft and assault against person civil cases on other hand deal with protecting rights and property of individuals often associated with family disputes but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery ediscovery may be involved forensics may also feature in private sector such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation a specialist probe into nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub branches relating to type of digital devices involved computer forensics network forensics forensic data analysis and mobile device forensics typical forensic process encompasses seizure forensic imaging acquisition and analysis of digital media and production of a report into collected evidence as well as identifying direct evidence of a crime digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects confirm alibis or statements determine intent identify sources for example in copyright cases or authenticate documents investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis where usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions often involving complex time lines or hypotheses history prior to 1970s crimes involving computers were dealt with using existing laws first computer crimes were recognized in 1978 florida computer crimes act which included legislation against unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system over next few years range of computer crimes being committed increased and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright privacy harassment e g cyber bullying cyber stalking and online predators and child pornography it was not until 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences canada was first country to pass legislation in 1983 this was followed by us federal computer fraud and abuse act in 1986 australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and british computer misuse act in 1990 1980s 1990s growth of field growth in computer crime during 1980s and 1990s caused law enforcement agencies to begin establishing specialized groups usually at national level to handle technical aspects of investigations for example in 1984 fbi launched a computer analysis and response team and following year a computer crime department was set up within british metropolitan police fraud squad as well as being law enforcement professionals many of early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for field s initial research and direction one of first practical or at least publicized examples of digital forensics was cliff stoll s pursuit of hacker markus hess in 1986 stoll whose investigation made use of computer and network forensic techniques was not a specialized examiner many of earliest forensic examinations followed same profile throughout 1990s there was high demand for these new and basic investigative resources strain on central units lead to creation of regional and even local level groups to help handle load for example british national hi tech crime unit was set up in 2001 to provide a national infrastructure for computer crime with personnel located both centrally in london and with various regional police forces unit was folded into serious organised crime agency soca in 2006 during this period science of digital forensics grew from ad hoc tools and techniques developed by these hobbyist practitioners this is in contrast to other forensics disciplines which developed from work by scientific community it was not until 1992 that term computer forensics was used in academic literature although prior to this it had been in informal use a paper by collier and attempted to justify this new discipline to forensic science world this swift development resulted in a lack of standardization and training in his 1995 book high technology crime investigating cases involving computers k rosenblatt wrote 2000s developing standards since 2000 in response to need for standardization various bodies and agencies have published guidelines for digital forensics scientific working group on digital evidence produced a 2002 paper best practices for computer forensics this was followed in 2005 by publication of an iso standard iso general requirements for competence of testing and calibration laboratories a european lead international treaty convention on cybercrime came into force in 2004 with aim of reconciling national computer crime laws investigative techniques and international co operation treaty has been signed by 43 nations including us canada japan south africa uk and other european nations and ratified by 16 issue of training also received attention commercial companies often forensic software developers began to offer certification programs and digital forensic analysis was included as a topic at uk specialist investigator training facility since late 1990s mobile devices have become more widely available advancing beyond simple communication devices and have been found to be rich forms of information even for crime not traditionally associated with digital forensics despite this digital analysis of phones has lagged behind traditional computer media largely due to problems over proprietary nature of devices focus has also shifted onto internet crime particularly risk of cyber warfare and a february 2010 report by united states joint forces command concluded field of digital forensics still faces unresolved issues a 2009 paper digital forensic research good bad and unaddressed by peterson and identified a bias towards windows operating systems in digital forensics research in 2010 simson identified issues facing digital investigations in future including increasing size of digital media wide availability of encryption to consumers a growing variety of operating systems and file formats an increasing number of individuals owning multiple devices and legal limitations on investigators paper also identified continued training issues as well as prohibitively high cost of entering field development of forensic tools during 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media examining computers from within operating system using existing tools to extract evidence this practice carried risk of modifying data on disk either inadvertently or otherwise which led to claims of evidence tampering a number of tools were created during early 1990s to address problem need for such software was first recognized in 1989 at federal law enforcement training center resulting in creation of by michael white and in 1990 developed by similar software was developed in other countries a hardware and software solution was released commercially in uk in 1991 and rob released fixed disk image free to australian law enforcement these tools allowed examiners to create an exact copy of a piece of digital media to work on leaving original disk intact for verification by end of 1990s as demand for digital evidence grew more advanced commercial tools such as encase and were developed allowing analysts to examine copies of media without using any live forensics more recently a trend towards live memory forensics has grown resulting in availability of tools such as more recently same progression of tool development has occurred for mobile devices initially investigators accessed data directly on device but soon specialist tools such as or radio tactics appeared forensic process thumb right 220px a portable tableau write blocker attached to a hard drive a digital forensic investigation commonly consists of 3 stages acquisition or imaging of exhibits analysis and reporting ideally acquisition involves capturing an image of computer s volatile memory ram and creating an exact sector level duplicate or forensic duplicate of media often using a write blocking device to prevent modification of original however growth in size of storage media and developments such as cloud computing have led to more use of live acquisitions whereby a logical copy of data is acquired rather than a complete image of physical storage device both acquired image or logical copy and original media data are using an algorithm such as sha 1 or and values compared to verify copy is accurate an alternative and patented approach that has been dubbed hybrid forensics or distributed forensics combines digital forensics and ediscovery processes this approach has been embodied in a commercial tool called that was presented together with test results at a conference in 2017 during analysis phase an investigator recovers evidence material using a number of different methodologies and tools in 2002 an article in international journal of digital evidence referred to this step as an in depth systematic search of evidence related to suspected crime in 2006 forensics researcher brian carrier described an intuitive procedure in which obvious evidence is first identified and then exhaustive searches are conducted to start filling in holes actual process of analysis can vary between investigations but common methodologies include conducting keyword searches across digital media within files as well as unallocated and slack space recovering deleted files and extraction of registry information for example to list user accounts or attached usb devices evidence recovered is analysed to reconstruct events or actions and to reach conclusions work that can often be performed by less specialised staff when an investigation is complete data is presented usually in form of a written report in lay persons terms application thumb right an example of an image s metadata that might be used to prove its origin digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation traditionally it has been associated with criminal law where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before courts as with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines in some cases collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering used for other purposes than court proceedings for example to locate identify or halt other crimes as a result intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard in civil litigation or corporate matters digital forensics forms part of electronic discovery or ediscovery process forensic procedures are similar to those used in criminal investigations often with different legal requirements and limitations outside of courts digital forensics can form a part of internal corporate investigations a common example might be following unauthorized network intrusion a specialist forensic examination into nature and extent of attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise both to establish extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify attacker such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during 1980s but in modern era are usually propagated over internet main focus of digital forensics investigations is to recover objective evidence of a criminal activity termed actus reus in legal parlance however diverse range of data held in digital devices can help with other areas of inquiry attribution meta data and other logs can be used to attribute actions to an individual for example personal documents on a computer drive might identify its owner alibis and statements information provided by those involved can be cross checked with digital evidence for example during investigation into soham murders offender s alibi was disproved when mobile phone records of person he claimed to be with showed she was out of town at time intent as well as finding objective evidence of a crime being committed investigations can also be used to prove intent known by legal term mens rea for example internet history of convicted killer neil entwistle included references to a site discussing how to kill people evaluation of source file artifacts and meta data can be used to identify origin of a particular piece of data for example older versions of microsoft word embedded a global unique identifier into files which identified computer it had been created on proving whether a file was produced on digital device being examined or obtained from elsewhere e g internet can be very important document authentication related to evaluation of source meta data associated with digital documents can be easily modified for example by changing computer clock you can affect creation date of a file document authentication relates to detecting and identifying falsification of such details limitations one major limitation to a forensic investigation is use of encryption this disrupts initial examination where pertinent evidence might be located using keywords laws to compel individuals to disclose encryption keys are still relatively new and controversial legal considerations examination of digital media is covered by national and international legislation for civil investigations in particular laws may restrict abilities of analysts to undertake examinations restrictions against network monitoring or reading of personal communications often exist during criminal investigation national laws restrict how much information can be seized for example in united kingdom seizure of evidence by law enforcement is governed by pace act during its existence early in field international organization on computer evidence was one agency that worked to establish compatible international standards for seizure of evidence in uk same laws covering computer crime can also affect forensic investigators 1990 computer misuse act legislates against unauthorised access to computer material this is a particular concern for civil investigators who have more limitations than law enforcement an individual s right to privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts us electronic communications privacy act places limitations on ability of law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence act makes a distinction between stored communication e g email archives and transmitted communication such as voip latter being considered more of a privacy invasion is harder to obtain a warrant for ecpa also affects ability of companies to investigate computers and communications of their employees an aspect that is still under debate as to extent to which a company can perform such monitoring article 5 of european convention on human rights asserts similar privacy limitations to ecpa and limits processing and sharing of personal data both within eu and with external countries ability of uk law enforcement to conduct digital forensics investigations is legislated by regulation of investigatory powers act digital evidence thumb right digital evidence can come in a number of forms when used in a court of law digital evidence falls under same legal guidelines as other forms of evidence courts do not usually require more stringent guidelines in united states federal rules of evidence are used to evaluate admissibility of digital evidence united kingdom pace and civil evidence acts have similar guidelines and many other countries have their own laws us federal laws restrict seizures to items with only obvious evidential value this is acknowledged as not always being possible to establish with digital media prior to an examination laws dealing with digital evidence are concerned with two issues integrity and authenticity integrity is ensuring that act of seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify evidence either original or copy authenticity refers to ability to confirm integrity of information for example that imaged media matches original evidence ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting chain of custody from crime scene through analysis and ultimately to court a form of audit trail is important to establish authenticity of evidence attorneys have argued that because digital evidence can theoretically be altered it undermines reliability of evidence us judges are beginning to reject this theory in case us v court ruled that fact that it is possible to alter data contained in a computer is plainly insufficient to establish untrustworthiness in united kingdom guidelines such as those issued by acpo are followed to help document authenticity and integrity of evidence digital investigators particularly in criminal investigations have to ensure that conclusions are based upon factual evidence and their own expert knowledge in us for example federal rules of evidence state that a qualified expert may testify in form of an opinion or otherwise so long as sub branches of digital forensics may each have their own specific guidelines for conduct of investigations and handling of evidence for example mobile phones may be required to be placed in a faraday shield during seizure or acquisition to prevent further radio traffic to device in uk forensic examination of computers in criminal matters is subject to acpo guidelines there are also international approaches to providing guidance on how to handle electronic evidence electronic evidence guide by council of europe offers a framework for law enforcement and judicial authorities in countries who seek to set up or enhance their own guidelines for identification and handling of electronic evidence investigative tools admissibility of digital evidence relies on tools used to extract it in us forensic tools are subjected to daubert standard where judge is responsible for ensuring that processes and software used were acceptable in a 2003 paper brian carrier argued that daubert guidelines required code of forensic tools to be published and peer reviewed he concluded that open source tools may more clearly and comprehensively meet guideline requirements than would closed source tools in 2011 josh stated that scientific validation of technology and software associated with performing a digital forensic examination is critical to any laboratory process he argued that science of digital forensics is founded on principles of repeatable processes and quality evidence therefore knowing how to design and properly maintain a good validation process is a key requirement for any digital forensic examiner to defend their methods in court branches digital forensics investigation is not restricted to retrieve data merely from computer as laws are breached by criminals and small digital devices e g tablets smartphones flash drives are now extensively used some of these devices have volatile memory while some have non volatile memory sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory however there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non volatile memory sources depending on type of devices media or artifacts digital forensics investigation is branched into various types computer forensics goal of computer forensics is to explain current state of a digital artifact such as a computer system storage medium or electronic document discipline usually covers computers embedded systems digital devices with rudimentary computing power and onboard memory and static memory such as usb pen drives computer forensics can deal with a broad range of information from logs such as internet history through to actual files on drive in 2007 prosecutors used a spreadsheet recovered from computer of joseph e duncan iii to show premeditation and secure death penalty sharon s killer was identified in 2006 after email messages from him detailing torture and death fantasies were found on her computer thumb right 220px mobile phones in a uk evidence bag thumb private investigator certified digital forensics examiner imaging a hard drive in field for forensic examination mobile device forensics mobile device forensics is a sub branch of digital forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or data from a mobile device it differs from computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system e g gsm and usually proprietary storage mechanisms investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications sms email rather than in depth recovery of deleted data sms data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate patrick lumumba in murder of meredith kercher mobile devices are also useful for providing location information either from inbuilt gps location tracking or via cell site logs which track devices within their range such information was used to track down kidnappers of thomas in 2006 network forensics network forensics is concerned with monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic both local and wan internet for purposes of information gathering evidence collection or intrusion detection gary palmer a road map for digital forensic research report from 2001 first digital forensic research workshop utica new york 7 8 august 2001 page s 27 30 traffic is usually intercepted at packet level and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real time unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile and rarely logged making discipline often reactionary in 2000 fbi lured computer hackers aleksey ivanov and gorshkov to united states for a fake job interview by monitoring network traffic from pair s computers fbi identified
