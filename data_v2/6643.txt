walters release and reception single reel drama approximately 1 000 feet long was released on november 4 1910 film was released outside of planned order due to a scheduling conflict originally american and queen was planned to be released on this date but it was instead pushed back to november 11 film received mixed reviews from critics h jeanval of moving picture news stated that costuming and lace curtains on windows of home betrayed supposed poverty of morgan family walton also of moving picture news stated this title would be completely misunderstood by majority of moving picture show attendants some sporadic reformer who does not know original and who has never seen film will fill space on iniquity of moving pictures founded on this title if he did see film it has not necessary power to grapple with terrible reality of a too common incident in daily life new york dramatic mirror was more picky in its wording and praise stating it was to be supposed that some company would finally present this familiar drama in pictorial form and a reviewer must feel glad that it is over for film doesn t materially exalt level of film output review found acting to be good but found fault in shadows of actors fell towards a lamp instead of away from it new york dramatic mirror was not a neutral party for reviews and took a shot at thanhouser company by running an article that stated selig company announces production of ten nights in a bar room will not be confined to one reel but will be given all film that it requires for proper production this departure from restrictive limit of 1 000 feet gives promise that drama will have adequate treatment bowers states that paper was acting role of a spoiler for selig version was not released until a half year later in june 1911 and except for spite there was no reason to mention it now thomas s hischak author of american literature on stage and screen 525 works and their adaptations claims that thanhouser production is earliest known film adaptation of novel this is an error because lubin would produce an adaptation 700 feet in length by october 1903 see also list of american films of 1910 references
