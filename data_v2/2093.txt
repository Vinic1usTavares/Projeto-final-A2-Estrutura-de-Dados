vrs on other from 20 october to 3 november 1994 it marks first tangible evidence of bosniak croat alliance set out in washington agreement of march 1994 brokered by united states to end croat bosniak war fought between arbih and hvo in bosnia and herzegovina arbih and hvo were not coordinated at first rather they launched separate operations aimed at capture of kupres arbih offensive codenamed autumn 94 jesen 94 started on 20 october with primary aim of advancing from bugojno towards vrs held donji vakuf supported by a secondary attack towards kupres aimed at disruption of vrs defences and threatening a supply route to donji vakuf primary attacking force soon ground to a halt shifting focus of operation to kupres where substantial reinforcements were deployed to ensure a gradual advance of arbih on 29 october hvo decided to attack as it considered arbih had directly threatened strategic kupres plateau hvo launched its offensive codenamed operation cincar cincar on 1 november following a brief lull in arbih advance thought to be brought on by a variety of causes and a direct request by president of bosnia and herzegovina alija izetbegovic to arbih to cooperate with hvo commanding officers of two forces met to coordinate their operations for first time since washington agreement kupres itself was captured by hvo on 3 november 1994 besides political significance of battle for future developments of war in bosnia battle was militarily significant for planning and execution of operation winter 94 by croatian army hv and hvo aimed at relieving siege of bihac in late november and december 1994 territorial gains made by hvo and arbih in battle of kupres safeguarded right flank of operation winter 94 background 1990 revolt of croatian serbs was centered on predominantly serb populated areas of dalmatian hinterland around city of knin parts of lika kordun banovina regions and in eastern croatian settlements with significant serb populations these areas were subsequently named republic of serbian krajina rsk rsk declared its intention of political integration with serbia and was viewed by government of croatia as a rebellion by march 1991 conflict escalated to war croatian war of independence in june 1991 croatia declared its independence as yugoslavia disintegrated followed by a three month moratorium on decision thus decision came into effect on 8 october a campaign of ethnic cleansing was then initiated by rsk against croatian civilians and most non serbs were expelled by early 1993 by november 1993 less than 400 and 1 500 2 000 ethnic croats remained in un protected areas sector south and sector north respectively as yugoslav people s army jna increasingly supported rsk and croatian police was unable to cope with situation croatian national guard zng was formed in may 1991 zng was renamed croatian army hv in november establishment of military of croatia was hampered by a united nations un arms embargo introduced in september final months of 1991 saw fiercest fighting of war culminating in battle of barracks siege of dubrovnik and battle of vukovar in january 1992 sarajevo agreement was signed by representatives of croatia jna and un and fighting between two sides paused ending series of unsuccessful ceasefires united nations protection force unprofor was deployed to croatia to supervise and maintain agreement conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions and jna soon retreated from croatia into bosnia and herzegovina where a new conflict was anticipated but serbia continued to support rsk hv advances restored small areas to croatian control as siege of dubrovnik was lifted and in operation maslenica croatian towns and villages were intermittently attacked by artillery or missiles as jna disengaged in croatia its personnel prepared to set up a new bosnian serb army as bosnian serbs declared serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina on 9 january 1992 ahead of 29 february 1 march 1992 referendum on independence of bosnia and herzegovina which would later be cited as a pretext for bosnian war bosnian serbs set up barricades in capital sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 march and next day first fatalities of war were recorded in sarajevo and doboj in final days of march bosnian serb army started artillery attacks on bosanski brod and hv 108th brigade crossed border adjacent to town in reply on 4 april serb artillery began shelling sarajevo even though war originally pitted bosnian serbs against non serbs in country it evolved into a three sided conflict by end of year as croat bosniak war started by that time bosnian serb army renamed army of republika srpska vrs after republika srpska state proclaimed in bosnian serb held territory controlled about 70 of bosnia and herzegovina that proportion would not change significantly over next two years republika srpska was involved in croatian war of independence in a limited capacity through military and other aid to rsk occasional air raids launched from banja luka and most significantly through artillery attacks against urban centres prelude right thumb kupres objective of operation cincar and autumn 94 following a new military strategy of united states endorsed by bill clinton since february 1993 washington agreement was signed by croatia and bosnia and herzegovina in march 1994 agreement ended croat bosniak war and established federation of bosnia and herzegovina political settlement allowed arbih and hvo to deploy additional troops against vrs in a series of small scale attacks designed to wear down bosnian serb military but attacks claimed no territorial gains before october arbih adopted an attrition warfare strategy relying on its numerical superiority compared to vrs which suffered from manpower shortages this strategy aimed for limited advances without support of heavy weapons and means of transport unavailable to arbih at time in march november 1994 arbih conducted a series of attacks with relatively limited objectives attacking vrs at mountain stolice peak of majevica mountain and donji vakuf as well as in area between and teslic near brcko sarajevo on and mountain gracanica konjic and doboj further efforts were made together with hvo against vrs near nevesinje in september november but most of offensives made little or no gains at same time vrs attacks north of sarajevo were successfully repulsed it was hoped by arbih general staff that vrs could not muster sufficient reserves to hold off simultaneous relatively limited attacks little territory changed hands as a result of arbih offensive by end of october but vrs shortage of troops worsened kupres was of interest to arbih and hvo albeit for different reasons hvo wanted to reverse april 1992 loss of town home to a significant croat community before war and to control tomislavgrad bugojno sipovo road arbih advance towards kupres was planned as a secondary axis of its offensive towards donji vakuf to northwest codenamed autumn 94 arbih wanted to deny vrs a supply route passing through kupres in order to weaken vrs defence around donji vakuf it is not clear how arbih and hvo coordinated before their advance to kupres most probably two forces commands agreed on a simultaneous offensive against kupres without revealing actual battle plans to their counterparts hvo s contribution in offensive codenamed operation cincar was planned jointly by hvo and hv order of battle initially arbih committed 3 130 troops to its secondary axis thrust towards kupres they were organized with 370th mountain infantry brigade on right flank of front manned by arbih 7th corps southwest of bugojno and 307th mountain infantry brigade on left flank of arbih effort in primary attack axis zone arbih grouped about 5 600 additional troops facing an estimated 4 800 vrs soldiers around donji vakuf kupres itself and surrounding plateau were defended by approximately 2 600 vrs troops assigned to 7th motorized infantry brigade of 2nd krajina corps supported by corps level artillery and armour around 1 000 troops were nominally facing arbih units whereas rest guarded heights towards hvo on eve of attack some 450 600

ludvig pavlovic although participation of hv in battle was denied by croatia it is thought to have likely occurred specifically 1st croatian guards brigade is thought to have taken part in battle and bosnian croat reports pertaining to battle specify zrinski battalion of brigade as taking part in operation arbih 7th corps was commanded by brigadier general mehmed alagic while hvo tomislavgrad

after primary attacking force started moving against donji vakuf as primary effort of arbih offensive bogged down same day kupres became main objective 317th mountain infantry brigade was added to augment arbih force that made initial advances towards kupres next day as arbih gradually advanced elements of 305th mountain brigade were also sent as reinforcements to attacking force by 23 october arbih moved close enough to kupres to direct heavy mortar fire against town on 25 october arbih 7th corps requested a meeting with hvo tomislavgrad corps representatives to coordinate further advances in area however hvo postponed meeting until after 28 october due to replacement of tomislavgrad corps commanding officer on 27 october arbih 37th light infantry brigade was added to attack slowly progressing from one mountain ridge to next in addition elements of 27th mountain infantry brigade and a battalion of 7th conscripted mountain infantry brigade joined arbih push on 28 november arbih general staff committed a guards brigade attached to general staff to battle since beginning of arbih offensive hvo had been assembling three of its four guards brigades under command of general ante roso as well as other supporting units including 60th guards airborne battalion on 29 october ministry of defence of croatian republic of herzeg bosnia and hvo general staff met and decided to launch operation cincar to capture town of kupres decision was reportedly motivated by a desire to consolidate territory controlled by hvo around kupres and by strategic importance of kupres plateau which commanded northern approaches to hvo held livanjsko field operation was originally scheduled for 31 october at 4 30 am only to be postponed by 24 hours as hvo needed more time to prepare delayed arrival of reconnaissance teams further postponed hvo offensive until 8 am on 1 november 1994 november hvo advanced north along two main axes of attack western axis advanced from along main road towards kupres capturing village of donji malovan on 1 november eastern axis of hvo offensive moved from ravno towards rilic just as hvo began to move north arbih suspended its westward advance various explanations for pause were put forward including fog rain need to secure territorial gains wear of equipment and fatigue of personnel regardless that day president of bosnia and herzegovina alija izetbegovic telephoned alagic requesting an adequate level of cooperation and avoidance of any conflicts with hvo finally alagic made a public call to hvo to participate in offensive against vrs in kupres same day vrs targeted bugojno using two 9k52 luna m missiles on 2 november hvo captured gornji malovan and rilic while serb civilian population started to evacuate from kupres alagic visited hvo tomislavgrad corps headquarters to discuss cooperation but refused to discuss matter citing inadequate officers present there and proposed a new meeting at 11 pm that day at arbih 317th brigade headquarters in gornji vakuf chief of hvo general staff major general tihomir blaskic made a written apology on behalf of hvo claiming hvo officers had to be elsewhere at time a new meeting took place as proposed by alagic meeting concluded at 3 am with an agreement between alagic and cerni to withdraw some of arbih troops on right flank of hvo thrust to allow hvo to strike kupres from that direction and coordinate their further advances beyond kupres although cooperation was established there was no joint command of arbih and hvo arbih pullback was completed by 11 am on 3 november while right flank of arbih force pressed forward to capture vrata pass away from kupres bosnian croat special police and 60th guards airborne battalion entered kupres shortly after noon and hvo completed capture of town by 1 30 pm hvo proceeded to capture nearly entire kupres plateau bringing 1st 79th and 80th home guards regiments of hvo to hold defensive positions on plateau vrs was unable to counter attack in a timely manner because it had no reserves in place for task aftermath arbih significantly shortened its positions held opposite vrs and captured of territory while hvo captured nearly of area around kupres battle losses of arbih amounted to 41 killed in action and 162 wounded troops by 3 november 4 hvo troops were killed and 15 wounded and further 3 soldiers died and 5 were wounded in a vrs counter attack near at 11 am on 4 november battle of kupres was first concrete result of renewed bosniak croat alliance in bosnian war and advance to kupres was first military effort coordinated between arbih and hvo since washington agreement following victory morale of arbih and hvo soared further advantages for them were recapture of initiative from vrs and full control of split livno kupres bugojno road allowing improved logistics of arbih and hvo in area as well as greater volume of transport of arms and ammunition especially after united states unilaterally ended arms embargo against bosnia and herzegovina in november 1994 move in effect allowed hv to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through croatia finally outcome of battle of kupres secured right flank of livanjsko field which became especially significant later that month when operation winter 94 was launched by hv and hvo northwest of livno in order to draw off a part of force besieging bihac and prevent capture of bihac by vrs battle is considered to be a significant contribution to subsequent success of hv in croatian war of independence and bosnian war footnotes references books news
