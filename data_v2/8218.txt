bela iii april 1196 was king of hungary and croatia between 1172 and 1196 he was second son of king geza ii and geza s wife euphrosyne of kiev around 1161 euphrosyne granted bela a duchy which included croatia central dalmatia and possibly sirmium in accordance with a peace treaty between his elder brother stephen iii who succeeded their father in 1162 and byzantine emperor manuel i komnenos bela moved to constantinople in 1163 he was renamed to alexios and emperor granted him newly created senior court title of despotes he was betrothed to emperor s daughter maria bela s patrimony caused armed conflicts between byzantine empire and kingdom of hungary between 1164 and 1167 because stephen iii attempted to hinder byzantines from taking control of croatia dalmatia and sirmium bela alexios who was designated as emperor manuel s heir in 1165 took part in three byzantine campaigns against hungary his betrothal to emperor s daughter was dissolved after her brother alexios was born in 1169 emperor deprived bela of his high title granting him inferior rank of kaisar stephen iii died on 4 march 1172 and bela decided to return to hungary before his departure he pledged that he would never make war against byzantine empire although hungarian prelates and lords unanimously proclaimed bela king lucas archbishop of esztergom opposed his coronation because of bela s alleged simony finally archbishop of kalocsa crowned him king on 18 january 1173 with pope alexander iii s approval bela fought with his younger brother geza whom he held in captivity for more than a decade taking advantage of internal conflicts in byzantine empire after emperor manuel s death bela reoccupied croatia dalmatia and sirmium between 1180 and 1181 he occupied principality of halych in 1188 but it was lost within two years bela promoted use of written records during his reign hungarian chronicles from 14th century even state that he was responsible for establishment of royal chancery royal palace built in esztergom during his reign was first example of gothic architecture in central europe he was wealthiest european monarch of his time according to a list of his

geza ii of hungary bela was second son of geza ii of hungary and geza s wife euphrosyne of kiev date of his birth was not recorded studies of his bones show that bela died in 1196 at around 49 years old so he must have been born around 1148 his dna was demonstrated to belong to y haplogroup contemporaneous john kinnamos s reference to territory which his father while still alive had apportioned deeds of john and manuel comnenus by john kinnamos 5 5 p 163 to bela shows that geza ii granted a distinct territory as an appanage to his younger son bela s patrimony certainly included central parts of dalmatia which included sibenik split and trogir which had accepted suzerainty of kings of hungary for decades because kinnamos mentioned province as bela s heritage deeds of john and manuel comnenus by john kinnamos 5 17 p 187 historians ferenc makk and gyula moravcsik agree that bela also received croatia from his father whether syrmium was also part of bela s patrimony or if he only acquired it after his father s death is subject to scholarly debates according to historian warren treadgold bela s patrimony also included bosnia exact date of geza ii s grant cannot be determined but according to makk bela seems to have received his duchy around 1161 geza ii who died on 31 may 1162 was succeeded by his first born son stephen iii stephen iii seems to have confirmed bela s possession of duchy because kinnamos referred to land which was long before granted deeds of john and manuel comnenus by john kinnamos 5 6 p 165 to bela by geza and stephen shortly after his ascension to throne stephen iii was expelled by his uncles ladislaus ii and stephen iv byzantine emperor manuel i komnenos supported uncles takeover but stephen iii returned to hungary and regained his crown by force in middle of 1163 bela probably remained neutral during his brother s conflict with their uncles because there is no report of bela s activities in 1162 and 1163 in 1163 emperor manuel signed a peace treaty with stephen iii in which he renounced his support of stephen s opponents in exchange stephen iii agreed to send bela to constantinople and to allow byzantines to take possession of bela

1164 emperor manuel led his armies against stephen stating that he arrived not to wage war on hungarians but to recover his land for bela deeds of john and manuel comnenus by john kinnamos 5 6 p 165 according to kinnamos bela with his uncle stephen iv and their distant relative emperor during campaign before long a new peace treaty was signed once again forcing stephen iii to renounce bela s duchy a byzantine army occupied syrmium which was organized into a byzantine theme or district stephen iii launched a new invasion against syrmium in spring of 1165 emperor manuel directed counter attack and bela accompanied him again after imperial army recaptured zimony now zemun in serbia bela persuaded emperor to prohibit execution of hungarian soldiers who were captured in fortress a byzantine army also occupied dalmatia a new peace treaty between stephen iii and emperor manuel followed which confirmed emperor s suzerainty in bela s former duchy dalmatia and bosnia were soon converted into byzantine themes emperor manuel ceremoniously made his daughter and bela alexios his heirs and forced byzantine notables to swear an oath of fidelity to them in autumn of 1165 only emperor s cousin andronikos komnenos dared to condemn this act asking what madness is this of emperor to deem every roman male unworthy of his daughter s nuptial bed to choose before all others this foreigner and interloper to be an emperor of romans and to sit above all as master o city of byzantium annals of niketas choniates 4 137 p 78 according to nearly contemporaneous niketas choniates bela alexios participated in 1166 council of blachernae together with emperor manuel and ecumenical patriarch luke in spring of 1166 bela alexios accompanied protostrator alexios who led a byzantine army against hungary in retaliation for a new hungarian invasion of syrmium on 11 april 1166 although bela alexios and his bride were related to each other emperor manuel confirmed a decision of ecumenical patriarch which stated that marriages between kin to seventh degree were void manuel even proposed a marriage between his daughter bela alexios s fiancee and new king of sicily william ii in autumn of 1166 a new war broke out between hungary and byzantine empire in 1167 because bela alexios claimed kingdom deeds of frederick barbarossa appendix p 337 of his brother according to contemporaneous rahewin henry of mugeln also wrote that many hungarians joined and served army of bela alexios stating that kingdom of hungary belonged to him bela alexios by right on 8 july 1167 byzantine army annihilated hungarian troops in battle of sirmium a peace treaty was signed which put an end to period of wars between hungary and byzantine empire and confirmed dominion of byzantine empire over central dalmatia bosnia and syrmium kaisar alexios 1169 1172 emperor manuel s wife maria of antioch gave birth to a son named alexios on 14 september 1169 emperor dissolved his daughter s betrothal to bela alexios emperor also removed bela alexios s title of despotes but granted him inferior rank of kaisar in spring of 1170 bela alexios married emperor s sister in law agnes of antioch couple went on a pilgrimage to holy land in jerusalem they donated 10 000 bezants to knights hospitaller in compensation for their hospitality in charter of grant bela alexios styled himself lord a duke of hungary dalmatia and croatia ignoring title that emperor had recently bestowed upon him reign coronation 1172 1173 bela s brother stephen iii died on 4 march 1172 arnold of lubeck who was staying in esztergom recorded a rumor suggesting that stephen had been poisoned by bela s supporters but no other source verifies this hearsay stephen iii s widow agnes left hungary although she was pregnant when her husband died a hungarian delegation visited emperor manuel and bela in sardica now sophia in bulgaria they demanded that bela be dispatched to them as king because principle of justice looked toward him after his brother s death deeds of john and manuel comnenus by john kinnamos 6 11 p 214 according to kinnamos kinnamos also said that emperor manuel made bela king after bela promised an oath to observe for whole course of his life whatever would be beneficial deeds of john and manuel comnenus by john kinnamos 6 11 pp 214 215 to emperor and byzantines a letter written by byzantine emperor isaac ii angelos in 1196 says that on same occasion bela pledged that he would never support serbians if they fought against byzantine empire bela and his wife arrived in szekesfehervar in late april or early may bela was unanimously elected king by dignitaries of hungarian kingdom according to a letter written by pope alexander iii in 1179 however bela s coronation was delayed because lucas archbishop of esztergom refused to perform coronation archbishop accused king of simony because bela had given a precious cloak to his delegate according to a scholarly theory archbishop lucas also feared that influence of schismatics would increase under bela s rule nevertheless majority of barons and prelates remained loyal to bela bela sought assistance of holy see against archbishop lucas upon bela s request pope alexander iii authorized archbishop of kalocsa to anoint bela king and place crown on his head bela s coronation took place on 18 january 1173 he issued a charter confirming right of archbishops of esztergom to crown hungarian monarchs unification of so called greek and latin crowns into holy crown of hungary seems to have occurred during his reign conflicts 1173 1178 archbishop lucas fell out of favor with bela and was ignored by him in first years of his reign instead of lucas archbishop of kalocsa baptized bela s first born son emeric in 1174 however administering sacraments to members of royal family had always been archbishops of esztergom s job according to a bohemian chronicle continuatio bela imprisoned his younger brother geza but geza escaped from prison and fled to austria in 1174 or 1175 stephen iii s judge royal lawrence accompanied geza when henry jasomirgott duke of austria refused to extradite geza bela launched plundering raids into austria together with sobeslav ii duke of bohemia meanwhile bela sent reinforcements to emperor manuel to help him fight against seljuks but their united forces suffered defeat in battle of myriokephalon on 17 september 1176 geza tried to persuade sobeslav ii of bohemia to help him meet frederick i holy roman emperor but sobeslav seized geza and handed him over to bela in 1177 bela once again imprisoned his brother and he also put their mother euphrosyne in confinement in retaliation for sobeslav s role in geza s capture emperor frederick dethroned sobeslav and appointed another member of premyslid dynasty frederick to position of duke holy roman emperor ordered new duke of austria leopold v to storm bohemia bela soon intervened threatening leopold v with an invasion which forced leopold to leave bohemia expansion and reforms 1178 1194 bela s long time favorite andrew archbishop of kalocsa insulted him around 1178 bela soon deprived him and his supporter provost of szekesfehervar chapter of their offices and seized archbishop s revenues pope alexander iii punished bela with ecclesiastic sanctions but bela reconciled with archbishop lucas of esztergom who absolved him and excommunicated andrew of kalocsa conflict ended with a compromise mediated by holy see andrew asked bela to pardon him and bela restored him to his position of archbishop upon bela s invitation cistercian monks came from france and set up new cistercian abbeys at szentgotthard and pilis between 1179 and 1184 in 1180s bela initiated building of a lofty royal castle and a new

administration according to illuminated chronicle bela introduced same form of addressing petitions as was customary in roman and imperial court hungarian illuminated chronicle ch 171 122 p 139 which suggests that royal chancery began functioning as a separate office during his reign he emphasized importance of written records ordering in 1181 that a charter was to be issued for all transactions proceeding in his presence emperor manuel i died on 24 september 1180 within six months bela had restored his suzerainty in dalmatia but no detailed contemporaneous accounts of events exist citizens

accepted bela s suzerainty in early 1181 historian john v a fine writes that bela retook suzerainty of dalmatia seemingly without bloodshed and with imperial consent because byzantine authorities preferred that bela rule province rather than republic of venice details of reconquest of syrmium are also obscure andronikos komnenos accused mother of young byzantine emperor alexios ii of inciting brother in ravage region of belgrade and barancs now branicevo in serbia in may 1182 implying that bela had by that time occupied syrmium in same month andronikos komnenos captured dowager empress and had her murdered by end of year taking advantage of emerging anarchy in byzantine empire bela advanced as far as nis and serdica in first half of 1183 in sardica he seized casket containing relics of saint ivan of rila and ordered it to be transported with great honors to his land and to be laid down with honor in church life of john of rila from stishen sofia prologue p 266 of esztergom according to saint s life from sofia prologue makk writes that bela withdrew from regions south of danube but historian paul stephenson says that bela preserved these lands andronikos komnenos murdered emperor alexios ii in late 1183 contemporaneous eustathius of thessalonica writes that andronikos s opponents sent letters to many monarchs including bela iii urging them to attack andronikos according to and other western european chroniclers bela invaded byzantine empire in early 1185 after andronikos i fell in september bela signed a peace treaty with new emperor isaac ii angelos isaac married bela s

invaded principality and expelled him instead of restoring vladimir yaroslavich to his former position bela imprisoned him and granted control of halych to andrew who was bela s younger son as a token of his conquest bela styled himself as king of galicia in summer of 1189 german crusaders marched through hungary under command of frederick i holy roman emperor bela welcomed frederick and dispatched a troop to escort crusaders across balkan peninsula at frederick s request bela released his imprisoned brother geza who joined crusaders and left hungary bela mediated a peace treaty between frederick i and isaac ii whose mutual distrust had almost caused war between german crusaders and byzantines vladimir yaroslavich escaped from captivity in early 1189 or 1190 with assistance of casimir ii of poland he expelled andrew from halych and regained control of principality in 1191 bela met his son in law isaac ii in philippopolis now plovdiv in bulgaria and syrmium but results of their negotiations remained unknown upon bela s request holy see approved canonization of ladislaus i of hungary in 1192 bela invaded serbia at beginning of 1193 isaac ii demanded withdrawal of his troops and threatened bela with war at same time doge enrico dandolo attempted to occupy zadar but failed in 1193 bela granted county in croatia to bartholomew of krk a member of frankopan family this is earliest certain example of an office being granted as a hereditary dignity in kingdom of hungary last years 1194 1196 in 1194 bela appointed his eldest son emeric who had already been crowned as future king to administer croatia and dalmatia after a united bulgarian cumanian and vlach army defeated byzantines in battle of arcadiopolis in 1194 bela was willing to assist byzantine empire however his campaign was cancelled because bela s son in law emperor isaac ii was dethroned by alexios iii angelos in april 1195 henry vi holy roman emperor was planning to launch a campaign against byzantine empire on behalf of dethroned emperor but bela prohibited his subjects from joining henry bela took cross as a token of his desire to lead a crusade to holy land however he could not fulfill his oath because he fell ill and died on 23 april 1196 he was buried in szekesfehervar cathedral his remains were confidently identified by archeologists during 19th century excavations because a

not survive infancy their younger sister constance married king ottokar i of bohemia in about 1198 a third daughter of bela and agnes anna whose name is unknown died in infancy after death of agnes anna bela proposed to theodora a granddaughter of emperor manuel i s sister theodora komnene however a synod of byzantine church forbade marriage in 1185 because theodora had entered a nunnery in late 1185 or at beginning of 1186 bela asked for hand of matilda of saxony a daughter of henry lion duke of saxony but henry ii of england matilda s grandfather hindered this marriage finally bela married henry ii s widowed daughter in law margaret of france in summer of 1186 she was daughter of louis vii of france queen margaret outlived bela and moved to holy land after his death legacy bela was one of most eminent medieval monarchs of hungary his rule not only represented apogee of kingdom of but also marked end of an epoch according to historian pal engel his establishment of royal chancery contributed to expansion of written records in hungary first charters issued by barons appeared in 1190s according to a contemporaneous list of bela s revenues his yearly income amounted to almost 170 000 marks about 23 tonnes of pure silver if list is reliable his income surpassed revenues of contemporaneous kings of france and england but reliability of list has been questioned by many historians including pal engel in about 1190 after a fire destroyed esztergom bela invited french masons to rebuild royal palace and cathedral masons introduced new architectural forms new royal palace and
