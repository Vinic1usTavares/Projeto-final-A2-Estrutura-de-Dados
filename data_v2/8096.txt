4th parachute brigade was an airborne specifically a parachute infantry brigade formation of british army during second world war formed in late 1942 in mediterranean and middle east brigade was composed of three parachute infantry units 10th 11th and 156th parachute battalions brigade was assigned to 1st airborne division just prior to allied invasion of sicily but played no part in invasion instead brigade first saw action in september 1943 during operation slapstick an amphibious landing at port of taranto as part of early stages of allied invasion of italy largely unopposed brigade captured ports of brindisi and bari before being withdrawn by end of year 4th parachute brigade was in england preparing for allied invasion of north west europe brigade did not see action in france being instead placed on standby for an emergency during normandy landings between june and august 1944 speed of subsequent allied advance obviated need to deploy airborne forces in september 1944 brigade formed part of second day s parachute landings at battle of arnhem part of operation market garden problems reaching bridges in arnhem forced divisional commander major general roy urquhart to divert one of brigade s battalions to assist 1st parachute brigade after a short delay brigade headed out for its objective when only halfway there however remaining two battalions were confronted by prepared german defences brigade having suffered heavy losses was eventually forced to withdraw next day weakened by fighting at close quarters and now numbering around 150 men brigade eventually reached divisional position at oosterbeek after a week of being subjected to almost constant artillery tank and infantry attacks remnants of brigade were evacuated south of river rhine during battle of arnhem brigade s total casualties amounted to seventy eight per cent and 4th parachute brigade was disbanded rather than reformed survivors being posted to 1st parachute brigade photo left to right

become 1st parachute battalion it was these men who took part in first british airborne operation operation colossus on 10 february 1941 guard p 218 success of raid prompted war office to expand existing airborne force setting up airborne forces depot and battle school in derbyshire and creating parachute regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions into airborne battalions

along with a headquarters company powell p 19 brigade s first commander lieutenant colonel kenneth smyth was replaced by brigadier john hackett on 4 january 1943 facilities and weather conditions at kibret proved to be unsuitable for airborne operations so brigade moved to raf ramat david in palestine to continue their training brigade came to full strength in may 1943 and in june was sent to tripoli where it joined 1st airborne division also assigned to division were 1st and 2nd parachute brigades and glider infantry of 1st airlanding brigade in 1944 brigade also had under their command

took part in operation ladbroke and 1st parachute brigade in operation fustian both brigades suffered heavy casualties so that by time operation slapstick was proposed only 2nd and 4th parachute brigades were up to strength ferguson p 13 slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert german forces from main allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact italian ports of taranto bari and brindisi blumenson p 94 lack of air transport meant that division s two available brigades had to be transported by sea they would cross mediterranean in four royal navy cruisers with their escorts if landing was successful british 78th infantry division in sicily and 8th indian infantry division in middle east under command of british v corps under lieutenant general charles walter allfrey would be sent to reinforce landings blumenson p 95 with 11 para still in palestine 4th parachute brigade only had 10 and 156 para available to take part in landings on 9 september 1943 same

only operation planned where brigade would act as an independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed entire 1st airborne division however speed of allied advance towards river seine and then onwards from paris northwards was accomplished without airborne assistance and plans were cancelled peters and buist pp 20 26 brigade s next operation was scheduled for early september 1944 codenamed comet plan called for 1st airborne division s three brigades to land in netherlands and capture three river crossings first of these was bridge over river

u s 82nd airborne division at grave required two lifts while british 1st airborne division at arnhem would need three lifts whereas two american divisions delivered at least three quarters of their infantry in their first lift 1st airborne s similar drop used only half its infantry capacity and remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery tugwell p 241 1st airborne division had required airlift capacity to deliver all three parachute brigades with their glider borne anti tank weapons or two of parachute brigades and airlanding brigade on day one however instead vast majority of division s

all officers except for battalion commanders and brigade staff and told them they could forget what they had been told being put down where we were with surprise gone and opposition alerted and given german capability for a swift and violent response to any threat to what really mattered they could expect their hardest fighting and worst casualties not in defence of final perimeter but in trying to get there ferguson p 27 division s fourth unit 1st polish parachute brigade were to arrive on day three dropping their glider troops in north and their paratroops south of river peters and buist p 60 once all units were in place division was to form a defensive ring around arnhem bridges until relieved by advance of xxx corps to south 18 september although first day s landings on 17 september were successful over night of 17 18 september divisional commander major general roy urquhart was reported missing so brigadier philip hicks of 1st airlanding brigade assumed command of division on september 18 tugwell p 258 subsequent problems in arnhem forced hicks to change divisional plan only 2nd parachute battalion had reached road bridge as strong german defences had stopped other battalions hicks decided that 2nd battalion south staffordshire regiment and 11 para would link up with 1st parachute brigade in an attempt to reach their objective urquhart p p 76 on 18 september day two of operation bad weather over england kept second lift on ground and first troops did not arrive in netherlands until 15 00 delay gave germans time to approach northern landing grounds and engage

hackett arrived at brigade headquarters he was informed by lieutenant colonel mckenzie of division s staff about change in plans explaining that 11 para was to be detached from his brigade to support push into arnhem at same time kosb until then responsible for defending northern side of landing grounds were attached to 4th parachute brigade to replace 11 para meanwhile kosb still had to defend landing zone l to protect gliders arriving on day three urquhart p 60 while hackett formulated a new plan mckenzie returned to divisional headquarters to be informed on his arrival that 60 german tanks were approaching arnhem from north transport aircraft passing over occupied channel ports had confirmed german suspicions of a second lift such that they were able to give their troops at arnhem forty five minutes advance notice of allies arrival prepared in advance for such an eventuality a waffen ss mobile unit had been dispatched towards likely landing grounds urquhart p 73 hackett decided brigade would advance between railway line and ede arnhem road in order to capture their three objectives first high ground overlooking johanna farm next woods near to house and finally high ground at koepel peters and buist p 169 delay in england meant it was 17 00 before brigade started moving powell p 60 with element of surprise gone and no intelligence on german dispositions 156 para headed for

next day an attack by german 88 mm guns destroyed some of 10 para s transport battalion counterattacked capturing guns and a nearby farm building they were using brigade advance restarted at 07 00 but

played no part in attack by dawn and under intense fire attack faltered and 11 para were ordered to carry out a left flanking attack to relieve pressure on south staffords only intervention of major general urquhart just freed from where he had been trapped stopped 11 para assault having recognised futility of battle urquhart was not prepared to reinforce failure peters and buist p 164 at 11 00

intention was to move through wolfheze and into oosterbeek where division s support units waited change of direction was further complicated by lack of vehicle crossings along railway line there were only two one at wolfheze and other at oosterbeek peters and buist p 174 both battalions were still in contact with germans during withdrawal with 10 para to north having furthest to travel to reach relative safety of rail crossing by 15 00 it became obvious that germans were already in front of battalion now as well as fighting a rearguard action they had to capture positions between themselves

were surrounded when british units on either side of them pulled back without informing them asking for permission to withdraw he gained impression that headquarters had forgotten about them or thought they had been wiped out powell pp 237 239 gaps in perimeter did allow individual german snipers to infiltrate brigade positions and glider pilots had to send out dedicated anti sniper patrols

perimeter changed tactics and now tended to rely more on artillery and mortars than on infantry and armour to break through british line however in attacks on lonsdale force germans persisted in attacking in company strength supported by one or two armoured vehicles urquhart p 124 method employed by germans was a tank or sp gun would move up and down a street blowing holes in house walls this
