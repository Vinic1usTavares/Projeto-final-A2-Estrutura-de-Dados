hit seven doubles and four home runs with 18 rbi thumb left craig batting against chicago cubs by 2011 it became apparent that craig was able to hit major league pitching as well he had in minor leagues however situation was less than ideal for him to realize regular playing time lance berkman matt holliday and albert pujols each already occupied corner positions first base left field and right field positions craig was best suited to play to get his bat in lineup more manager tony la russa began playing him at second base near end of may in june after batting 336 with 23 rbi in 107 at bats he suffered a small knee cap fracture against houston astros by running into wall tracking a fly ball in right field team placed him on disabled list dl with an expected intermission of about six

stationed at first base and in outfield corners further craig spent all of april on disabled list dl recovering from knee surgery however when he returned to play may 1 cardinals designated outfielder erik komatsu for assignment to make room and craig found a windfall of playing time with berkman now on dl after hitting five home runs in a seven game stretch injury quickly struck again when he pulled a hamstring in a game against san francisco giants on may 18 and landed back on 15 day dl to that point craig made a convincing argument for forcing his way into starting lineup with a combination of top prospect matt adams slumping and hitting 373 with a 424 on base percentage and 765 slugging percentage in thirteen games craig was back in action on june 1 and three days later his tiebreaking two run home run against mets allowed cardinals to end a five game losing streak with a 5 4 win in a stretch from june 9 21 he encountered a rare slump as he batted just 175 with one home

runners in scoring position with a 355 batting average in his 197 career at bats craig fabricated consistency throughout season finishing with a 307 average 22 hr and 92 rbi in 119 games he ranked tenth in nl in batting seventh in slugging percentage 522 and placed 19th in most valuable player award mvp balloting he also led all major leaguers with a 400 batting average with runners in scoring position risp despite two dl trips craig played 30 games in outfield and led team in starts at first base with 86 while berkman appeared in just 32 total games 2013 with berkman s departure via free agency craig became cardinals primary first baseman on march 8 club announced they had reached an agreement with him on a five year contract with a team option for a sixth season 31 million deal bought out his three future arbitration eligible years and first year of free agency craig would earn 13 million in 2018 season if cardinals exercised their option 350px thumb left craig with st louis

bats to go with 20 rbi to that point in season 14 for 31 452 batting average for his career he was also batting 452 with runners in scoring position again leading major leagues and it was third highest of all time for a single season after george brett 469 1980 and tony gwynn 459 1997 a injury on september 4 on an infield hit against reds prevented him from appearing in a game for rest of regular season at time he was third in nl in rbi with 97 he eventually finished eighth despite being shut down early he led cardinals in this category st louis post dispatch sportswriter bernie miklasz dubbed craig rbi machine and an rbi monster he also finished eighth in batting average 315 his final batting average with risp 454 remained major league high and third highest all time that figure surpassed brian jordan s average of 422 in 1996 62 of 147 as team record in spite of his success hitting with risp baseball reference com rated his wins above replacement war at 2 2 and fangraphs at 2 6 craig s chances of returning to play before end of season depended on how far cardinals could extend their season in playoffs they qualified for postseason by finishing with best regular season record 97 65 in national league they kept winning through playoffs defeating pittsburgh pirates in nlds and los angeles dodgers in nlcs ready as a hitter in time for world series against boston red sox matheny at first excluded him from defense as injury was not fully healed therefore he served as designated hitter dh at fenway park in boston and a pinch hitter at busch stadium in st louis a national league park where dh is not normally played in game 3 craig was part of an unusual game ending play with scored tied 4 4 in bottom of ninth cardinals center fielder jon jay hit a ground ball off pitcher koji uehara toward second baseman dustin pedroia who threw ball home to catcher jarrod saltalamacchia to easily tag yadier molina out attempting to score saltalamacchia then threw ball to will middlebrooks as craig rounded third but it sailed wide into left field for an error and at same time middlebrooks tripped craig while reaching for ball daniel nava recovered ball and threw it back to home plate long before craig would have successfully scored due to being tripped umpire jim joyce awarded craig home plate when he called an obstruction on middlebrooks giving cardinals a 5 4 walk off victory this is first known such walk off victory in world series history however cardinals lost series to red sox in six games craig batted 16 times and collected six hits for a 375 batting average after season he finished 21st in mvp balloting but likely would have finished much higher had he not missed nearly a month of season due to injury 2014 with another free agent departure in beltran craig again shifted positions in 2014 replacing him in right field it also cleared way for matt adams to assume first base craig started season slowly batting just 220 with a 644 ops in april he batted 291 and raised his ops to 781 in may boston red sox on july 31 2014 craig was traded along with joe kelly to red sox in exchange for john lackey and prospect corey littrell upon being inserted into red sox lineup craig struggled mightily towards last two months of season hitting only 128 while striking out 36 times following season craig began season as 1st baseman on may 9 2015 red sox optioned craig to pawtucket red sox of class aaa international league since craig had yet to accrue five years of service time red sox could option him to

craig html he elected free agency on november 2 2018 craig re signed to a minor league contract on december 19 he was released on march 19 2019 skills profile while still in minor leagues craig showed in little time that he could hit at all levels but he had no natural position in spite of challenge to categorize his defensive abilities his versatility and athleticism has allowed him to play at all positions in major leagues except pitcher shortstop and catcher after an experiment at second base early in his major league career first base and corners in outfield emerged as positions for which he was best suited he played shortstop in amateur ball and third base in minor leagues but he was not well suited to play either position in major leagues due to speed of game he posted a fielding percentage of just 927 in 246 minor league games at third base considered a very low percentage according to former cardinals player development executive jeff and memphis redbirds manager ron warner craig s arm range and footwork proved problematic for third base he improved his footwork well enough for texas league but they still considered it insufficient for major leagues because his movement to his left was inhibited restricting his ability to start double plays further with an inefficient semi sidearm throwing motion that he could not resolve craig relied on his innate strength to compensate for time lost awards and honors class wikitable margin 5px text align center awards title of times dates ranking or event refs colspan 4 style text align center major leagues major league
