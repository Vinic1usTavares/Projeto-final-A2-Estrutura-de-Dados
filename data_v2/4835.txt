seattle or minneapolis based guitar oriented grunge bands writing that afghan whigs were on rock s cutting edge while stirring a torrent of emotions on neatly paced songs in musician magazine j d considine said band was clever enough to find hooks in sort of gnarled riffs and guitar noise fugazi plays for atmosphere as well as canny enough to avoid most of mannerisms that make much amerindie rock seem so cliched considine concluded in his review best reason to join this congregation is that songs are catchy enough to hold their own against best work of bands like dinosaur jr or replacements option was less impressed appreciating record s sheer clear recording and dynamic performances but criticizing dulli s lyrics and band s cover of temple melody maker ranked congregation at number 25 on its year end best albums for 1992 with album s critical acclaim and band s steady touring afghan whigs attained a cult following and was courted by several major labels who wanted to

sinewy sound with a newfound grasp of mood and nuance in rolling stone album guide 2004 joe gross called it a quantum leap over band s previous work commenting that it shows that they ditched grunge
