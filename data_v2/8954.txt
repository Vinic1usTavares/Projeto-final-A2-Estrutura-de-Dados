mount dana yosemite national park left yellow bellied marmot lives in southwestern canada and western united states including rocky mountains and sierra nevada northwards its range extends into southern british columbia and goes eastwards up to montane and basin regions of wyoming eastern montana colorado and southern alberta southwards its range extends into northern new mexico it inhabits steppes meadows talus fields and other open habitats sometimes on edge of deciduous or coniferous forests and found from as low as to over of elevation they are found in valleys meadows and foothills and tend to occupy open areas which are free of vegetation their territory is about around a number of burrows dug during summer they choose to dig burrows under rocks as it is less likely to be visible to predators these predators include foxes dogs coyotes wolves and eagles upon seeing a predator yellow bellied marmot whistles to warn others in area after which it typically hides in a nearby rock pile until there is no more threat biology behavior thumb female with nursing pup kamloops british columbia thumb right marmots eating trash left by backpackers at trail camp near mount whitney ca marmots reproduce starting at around two years of age and may live up to an age of fifteen they reside in colonies of about ten to twenty individuals each male marmot digs a burrow soon after it wakes from hibernation and starts looking for females to reproduce by summer it may have up to four female mates litters usually average three to five offspring per female only about half of those pups survive and become yearlings marmots have a harem polygynous mating system in which male reproduces with two or three females at same time female offspring tend to stay in area around their home while male offspring typically leave when they are yearlings and will defend one or more females yellow bellied marmots spend about 80 of their lives in their burrows 60 of which is spent hibernation they often spend mid day and night in a burrow as well these burrows are usually constructed on a slope such as a hill mountain or cliff hibernating burrows can be up to deep however burrows constructed for daily use are usually only deep their hibernation period varies on elevation but it is typically from september to may occasionally they climb trees and other flora though they are usually terrestrial diet yellow bellied marmots are diurnal and are less active during night they are omnivores but generally eat a wide variety of plants as they are generalist herbivores they mostly feed on grass grains leaves flowers legumes bird eggs and insects occasionally they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees in food choice experiments yellow bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds due to this they consume flowers of lupinus larkspur and columbine but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds their food choice depends upon fatty acid and protein concentrations which are well present in cinquefoil cow parsnip and leaves of dandelion which are also present in their diet in late summer however grasses forbs and seeds make up most of their diet they also like to feed on alfalfa and clover they drink less water as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements status and conservation since 1996 it has been listed in least concern category of iucn red list of endangered species as there are no major threats to this species and it is protected in several areas throughout its range there is not much concern for serious conservation efforts to be put in place references notes external links yellow bellied yellow bellied marmot category fauna of sierra nevada u s category fauna of western united
