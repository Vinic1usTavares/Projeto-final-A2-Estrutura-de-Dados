defeated q force and their allies attend a private screening of latest secret agent clank development ratchet clank up your arsenal was main focus of insomniac team during development team of around 115 people were aiming to create a new ratchet and clank game that would differ significantly from its predecessors and almost end up being two games in one insomniac believed that one of key processes in development process was rigorous testing working closely with sony and listening to fans of ratchet and clank series they gathered feedback and made improvements to game they felt that they had created a game that would appeal to a number of genres with inclusion of elements of platform action and side scrolling gameplay at same time jak 3 was being developed by naughty dog a company closely tied with insomniac naughty dog s jak daxter series and ratchet clank series are in similar genres each game in both series has been released at a similar time and both contain references to each other ryan schneider an employee of insomniac said analogy that i like to use is that at insomniac we like to look at it as how tiger woods and michael jordan and kobe bryant act when it comes to their professions we don t really look at it as how we compare to other athletes or other games we just try to do best that we can and elevate sport reception before its release ign

game into multiplayer genre so well ratchet clank up your arsenal was featured at e3 games festival in 2004 where there was a playable demo only multiplayer siege mode and a single player demo were
