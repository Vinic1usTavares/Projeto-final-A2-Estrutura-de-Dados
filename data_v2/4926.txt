thumb 300px hubble s sharpest view of mars although acs finger intrudes it achieved a spatial scale of 5 miles or 8 kilometres per pixel at full resolution recorded history of observation of planet mars dates back to era of ancient egyptian astronomers in 2nd millennium bce chinese records about motions of mars appeared before founding of zhou dynasty 1045 bce detailed observations of position of mars were made by babylonian astronomers who developed arithmetic techniques to predict future position of planet ancient greek philosophers and hellenistic astronomers developed a geocentric model to explain planet s motions measurements of mars angular diameter can be found in ancient greek and indian texts in 16th century nicolaus copernicus proposed a heliocentric model for solar system in which planets follow circular orbits about sun this was revised by johannes kepler yielding an elliptic orbit for mars that more accurately fitted observational data first telescopic observation of mars was by galileo galilei in 1610 within a century astronomers discovered distinct albedo features on planet including dark patch syrtis major planum and polar ice caps they were able to determine planet s rotation period and axial tilt these observations were primarily made during time intervals when planet was located in opposition to sun at which points mars made its closest approaches to earth better telescopes developed early in 19th century allowed permanent martian albedo features to be mapped in detail first crude map of mars was published in 1840 followed by more refined maps from 1877 onward when astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected spectroscopic signature of water in martian atmosphere idea of life on mars became popularized among public percival lowell believed he could see a network of artificial canals on mars these linear features later proved to be an optical illusion and atmosphere was found to be too thin to support an earth like environment yellow clouds on mars have been observed since 1870s which eugene m antoniadi suggested were windblown sand or dust during 1920s range of martian surface temperature was measured it ranged from planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only trace amounts of oxygen and water in 1947 gerard kuiper showed that thin martian atmosphere contained extensive carbon dioxide roughly double quantity found in earth s atmosphere first standard nomenclature for mars albedo features was adopted in 1960 by international astronomical union since 1960s multiple robotic spacecraft have been sent to explore mars from orbit and surface planet has remained under observation by ground and space based instruments across a broad range of electromagnetic spectrum discovery of meteorites on earth that originated on mars has allowed laboratory examination of chemical conditions on planet earliest records thumb left as earth passes mars latter planet will temporarily appear to reverse its motion across sky alt at left are two concentric circles around a disk lines from circles are projected on a star chart at right demonstrating s shaped motion of mars existence of mars as a wandering object in night sky was recorded by ancient egyptian astronomers by 2nd millennium bce they were familiar with apparent retrograde motion of planet in which it appears to move in opposite direction across sky from its normal progression mars was portrayed on ceiling of tomb of seti i on ramesseum ceiling and in star map last is oldest known star map being dated to 1534 bce based on position of planets by period of neo babylonian empire babylonian astronomers were making systematic observations of positions and behavior of planets for mars they knew for example that planet made 37 synodic periods or 42 circuits of zodiac every 79 years babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to predicted positions of planets this technique was primarily derived from timing measurements such as when mars rose above horizon rather than from less accurately known position of planet on celestial sphere chinese records of appearances and motions of mars appear before founding of zhou dynasty 1045 bce and by qin dynasty 221 bce astronomers maintained close records of planetary conjunctions including those of mars occultations of mars by venus were noted in 368 375 and 405 ce period and motion of planet s orbit was known in detail during tang dynasty 618 ce early astronomy of ancient greece was influenced by knowledge transmitted from mesopotamian culture thus babylonians associated mars with nergal their god of war and pestilence and greeks connected planet with their god of war ares during this period motions of planets were of little interest to greeks hesiod s works and days c 650 bce makes no mention of planets orbital models right thumb geocentric model of universe alt a series of concentric circles surround a fanciful representation of earth at center latin words and astrological symbols lie around perimeter greeks used word to refer to seven celestial bodies that moved with respect to background stars and they held a geocentric view that these bodies moved about earth in his work republic x greek philosopher plato provided oldest known statement defining order of planets in greek astronomical tradition his list in order of nearest to most distant from earth was as follows moon sun venus mercury mars jupiter saturn and fixed stars in his dialogue timaeus plato proposed that progression of these objects across skies depended on their distance so that most distant object moved slowest aristotle a student of plato observed an occultation of mars by moon in 365 bce from this he concluded that mars must lie further from earth than moon he noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by egyptians and babylonians in china astronomers recorded an occultation of mars by moon in 69 bce see price 2000 148 aristotle used this observational evidence to support greek sequencing of planets his work de presented a model of universe in which sun moon and planets circle about earth at fixed distances a more sophisticated version of geocentric model was developed by greek astronomer hipparchus when he proposed that mars moved along a circular track called epicycle that in turn orbited about earth along a larger circle called deferent in roman egypt during 2nd century ce claudius ptolemaeus ptolemy attempted to address problem of orbital motion of mars observations of mars had shown that planet appeared to move 40 faster on one side of its orbit than other in conflict with aristotelian model of uniform motion ptolemy modified model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from center of planet s circular orbit about which planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation he proposed that order of planets by increasing distance was moon mercury venus sun mars jupiter saturn and fixed stars ptolemy s model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in multi volume collection almagest which became authoritative treatise on western astronomy for next fourteen centuries in 5th century ce indian astronomical text surya siddhanta estimated angular size of mars as 2 arc minutes 1 30 of a degree and its distance to earth as 10 433 000 km 1 296 600 yojana where one yojana is equivalent to eight km in surya siddhanta from this diameter of mars is deduced to be 6 070 km 754 4 yojana which has an error within 11 of currently accepted value of 6 788 km however this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of planet s angular size result may have been influenced by work of ptolemy who listed a value of 1 57 arc minutes both estimates are significantly larger than value later obtained by telescope s geocentric motions of astronomia nova 1609 opposition charts show direction and distance of mars relative to earth at center with oppositions and apparent retrograde motion approximately every 2 years and closest oppositions every 15 17 years due to mars eccentric orbit in 1543 nicolaus copernicus published a heliocentric model in his work de revolutionibus orbium coelestium this approach placed earth in an orbit around sun between circular orbits of venus and mars his model successfully explained why planets mars jupiter and saturn were on opposite side of sky from sun whenever they were in middle of their retrograde motions copernicus was able to sort planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on period of their orbits about sun his theory gradually gained acceptance among european astronomers particularly after publication of prutenic tables by german astronomer erasmus reinhold in 1551 which were computed using copernican model on october 13 1590 german astronomer michael maestlin observed an occultation of mars by venus one of his students johannes kepler quickly became an adherent to copernican system after completion of his education kepler became an assistant to danish nobleman and astronomer tycho brahe with access granted to tycho s detailed observations of mars kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to prutenic tables after repeatedly failing to fit motion of mars into a circular orbit as required under copernicanism he succeeded in matching tycho s observations by assuming orbit was an ellipse and sun was located at one of foci his model became basis for kepler s laws of planetary motion which were published in his multi volume work epitome astronomiae copernicanae epitome of copernican astronomy between 1615 and 1621 early telescope observations at its closest approach angular size of mars is 25 arcseconds a unit of degree this is much too small for naked eye to resolve hence prior to invention of telescope nothing was known about planet besides its position on sky italian scientist galileo galilei was first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations his records indicate that he began observing mars through a telescope in september 1610 this instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on planet so he set goal of seeing if mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to venus or moon although uncertain of his success by december he did note that mars had shrunk in angular size polish astronomer johannes hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of mars in 1645 thumb left low albedo feature syrtis major is visible at disk center nasa hst image alt an orange disk with a darker region at center and darker bands in upper and lower halves a white patch at top is an ice cap and fuzzy white regions at bottom and right side of disk are cloud formations in 1644 italian jesuit bartoli reported seeing two darker patches on mars during oppositions of 1651 1653 and 1655 when planet made its closest approaches to earth italian astronomer giovanni battista riccioli and his student francesco maria grimaldi noted patches of differing reflectivity on mars first person to draw a map of mars that displayed terrain features was dutch astronomer christiaan huygens on november 28 1659 he made an illustration of mars that showed distinct dark region now known as syrtis major planum and possibly one of polar ice caps same year he succeeded in measuring rotation period of planet giving it as approximately 24 hours he made a rough estimate of diameter of mars guessing that it is about 60 of size of earth which compares well with modern value of 53 perhaps first definitive mention of mars s southern polar ice cap was by italian astronomer giovanni domenico cassini in 1666 that same year he used observations of surface markings on mars to determine a rotation period of 24h 40m this differs from currently accepted value by less than three minutes in 1672 huygens noticed a fuzzy white cap at north pole after cassini became first director of paris observatory in 1671 he tackled problem of physical scale of solar system relative size of planetary orbits was known from kepler s third law so what was needed was actual size of one of planet s orbits for this purpose position of mars was measured against background stars from different points on earth thereby measuring diurnal parallax of planet during this year planet was moving past point along its orbit where it was nearest to sun a perihelic opposition which made this a particularly close approach to earth cassini and jean picard determined position of mars from paris while french astronomer jean richer made measurements from cayenne south america although these observations were hampered by quality of instruments parallax computed by cassini came within 10 of correct value english astronomer john flamsteed made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results in 1704 italian astronomer jacques philippe made a systematic study of southern cap and observed that it underwent variations as planet rotated this indicated that cap was not centered on pole he observed that size of cap varied over time german born british astronomer sir william herschel began making observations of planet mars in 1777 particularly of planet s polar caps in 1781 he noted that south cap appeared extremely large which he ascribed to that pole being in darkness for past twelve months by 1784 southern cap appeared much smaller thereby suggesting that caps vary with planet s seasons and thus were made of ice in 1781 he estimated rotation period of mars as 24h 39m 21 67s and measured axial tilt of planet s poles to orbital plane as 28 5deg he noted that mars had a considerable but moderate atmosphere so that its inhabitants probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to ours between 1796 and 1809 french astronomer honore noticed of mars suggesting ochre colored veils covered surface this may be earliest report of yellow clouds or storms on mars geographical period at start of 19th century improvements in size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability most notable among these enhancements was two component achromatic lens of german optician joseph von fraunhofer that essentially eliminated coma an optical effect that can distort outer edge of image by 1812 fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic objective lens in diameter size of this primary lens is main factor in determining light gathering ability and resolution of a refracting telescope during opposition of mars in 1830 german astronomers johann heinrich madler and wilhelm beer used a fraunhofer refracting telescope to launch an extensive study of planet they chose a feature located 8deg south of equator as their point of reference this was later named sinus meridiani and it would become zero meridian of mars during their observations they established that most of mars surface features were permanent and more precisely determined planet s rotation period in 1840 madler combined ten years of observations to draw first map of mars rather than giving names to various markings beer and madler simply designated them with letters thus meridian bay sinus meridiani was feature a working at vatican observatory during opposition of mars in 1858 italian astronomer angelo secchi noticed a large blue triangular feature which he named blue scorpion this same seasonal cloud like formation was seen by english astronomer j norman lockyer in 1862 and it has been viewed by other observers during 1862 opposition dutch astronomer frederik kaiser produced drawings of mars by comparing his illustrations to those of huygens and english natural philosopher robert hooke he was able to further refine rotation period of mars his value of 24h 22 6s is accurate to within a tenth of a second father secchi produced some of first color illustrations of mars in 1863 he used names of famous explorers for distinct features in 1869 he observed two dark linear features on surface that he referred to as canali which is italian for channels or grooves in 1867 english astronomer richard a proctor created a more detailed map of mars based on 1864 drawings of english astronomer william r dawes proctor named various lighter or darker features after astronomers past and present who had contributed to observations of mars during same decade comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by french astronomer camille flammarion and english astronomer nathan green at university of leipzig in 1862 64 german astronomer johann k f zollner developed a custom photometer to measure reflectivity of moon planets and bright stars for mars he derived an albedo of 0 27 between 1877 and 1893 german astronomers gustav muller and paul kempf observed mars using zollner s photometer they found a small phase coefficient variation in reflectivity with angle indicating that surface of mars is smooth and without large irregularities in 1867 french astronomer pierre janssen and british astronomer william huggins used spectroscopes to examine atmosphere of mars both compared optical spectrum of mars to that of moon as spectrum of latter did not display absorption lines of water they believed they had detected presence of water vapor in atmosphere of mars this result was confirmed by german astronomer herman c vogel in 1872 and english astronomer edward w maunder in 1875 but would later come into question a particularly favorable perihelic opposition occurred in 1877 english astronomer david gill used this opportunity to measure diurnal parallax of mars from ascension island which led to a parallax estimate of using this result he was able to more accurately determine distance of earth from sun based upon relative size of orbits of mars and earth he noted that edge of disk of mars appeared fuzzy because of its atmosphere which limited precision he could obtain for planet s position in august 1877 american astronomer asaph hall discovered two moons of mars using a telescope at u s naval observatory names of two satellites phobos and deimos were chosen by hall based upon a suggestion by henry madan a science instructor at eton college in england martian canals during 1877 opposition italian astronomer giovanni schiaparelli used a telescope to help produce first detailed map of mars these maps notably contained features he called canali which were later shown to be an optical illusion these canali were supposedly long straight lines on surface of mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on earth his term canali was popularly mistranslated in english as canals in 1886 english astronomer william f denning observed that these linear features were irregular in nature and showed concentrations and interruptions by 1895 english astronomer edward maunder became convinced that linear features were merely summation of many smaller details in his 1892 work la planete mars et ses conditions d camille flammarion wrote about how these channels resembled man made canals which an intelligent race could use to redistribute water across a dying martian world he advocated for existence of such inhabitants and suggested they may be more advanced than humans influenced by observations of schiaparelli percival lowell founded an observatory with telescopes observatory was used for exploration of mars during last good opportunity in 1894 and following less favorable oppositions he published books on mars and life on planet which had a great influence on public canali were found by other astronomers such as henri joseph and louis using a refractor at nice observatory in france one of largest telescopes of that time beginning in 1901 american astronomer a e douglass attempted to photograph canal features of mars these efforts appeared to succeed when american astronomer carl o lampland published photographs of supposed canals in 1905 although these results were widely accepted they became contested by greek astronomer eugene m antoniadi english naturalist alfred russel wallace and others as merely imagined features as bigger telescopes were used fewer long straight canali were observed during an observation in 1909 by flammarion with a telescope irregular patterns were observed but no canali were seen refining planetary parameters right thumb in left image thin martian clouds are visible near polar regions at right surface of mars is obscured by a dust storm nasa hst images alt two orange hued disks one at left shows distinct darker regions along with cloudy areas near top and bottom in right image features are obscured by an orange haze an white ice cap is visible at bottom of both disks surface obscuration caused by yellow clouds had been noted in 1870s when they were observed by schiaparelli evidence for such clouds was observed during oppositions of 1892 and 1907 in 1909 antoniadi noted that presence of yellow clouds was associated with obscuration of albedo features he discovered that mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when planet was closest to sun and was receiving more energy he suggested windblown sand or dust as cause of clouds in 1894 american astronomer william w campbell found that spectrum of mars was identical to spectrum of moon throwing doubt on burgeoning theory that atmosphere of mars is similar to that of earth previous detections of water in atmosphere of mars were explained by unfavorable conditions and campbell determined that water signature came entirely from earth s atmosphere although he agreed that ice caps did indicate there was water in atmosphere he did not believe caps were sufficiently large to allow water vapor to be detected at time campbell s results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of astronomical community but they were confirmed by american astronomer walter s adams in 1925 baltic german astronomer hermann struve used observed changes in orbits of martian moons to determine gravitational influence of planet s oblate shape in 1895 he used this data to estimate that equatorial diameter was 1 190 larger than polar diameter in 1911 he refined value to 1 192 this result was confirmed by american meteorologist edgar w woolard in 1944 using a vacuum thermocouple attached to hooker telescope at mount wilson observatory in 1924 american astronomers seth barnes nicholson and edison pettit were able to measure thermal energy being radiated by surface of mars they determined that temperature ranged from at pole up to at midpoint of disk corresponding to equator beginning in same year radiated energy measurements of mars were made by american physicist william coblentz and american astronomer carl otto lampland results showed that night time temperature on mars dropped to indicating an enormous diurnal fluctuation in temperatures temperature of martian clouds was measured as in 1926 by measuring spectral lines that were by orbital motions of mars and earth american astronomer walter sydney adams was able to directly measure amount of oxygen and water vapor in atmosphere of mars he determined that extreme desert conditions were prevalent on mars in 1934 adams and american astronomer theodore dunham jr found that amount of oxygen in atmosphere of mars was less than one percent of amount over a comparable area on earth in 1927 dutch graduate student annius van den bosch made a determination of mass of mars based upon motions of martian moons with an accuracy of 0 2 this result was confirmed by dutch astronomer willem de sitter and published posthumously in 1938 using observations of near earth asteroid eros from 1926 to 1945 german american astronomer eugene k rabe was able to make an independent estimate mass of mars as well as other planets in inner solar system from planet s gravitational perturbations of asteroid his estimated margin of error was 0 05 but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods during 1920s french astronomer bernard used a to study surface properties of moon and planets in 1929 he noted that polarized light emitted from martian surface is very similar to that radiated from moon although he speculated that his observations could be explained by frost and possibly vegetation based on amount of sunlight scattered by martian atmosphere he set an upper limit of 1 15 thickness of earth s atmosphere this restricted surface pressure to no greater than using infrared spectrometry in 1947 dutch american astronomer gerard kuiper detected carbon dioxide in martian atmosphere he was able to estimate that amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of surface is double that on earth however because he overestimated surface pressure on mars kuiper concluded erroneously that ice caps could not be composed of frozen carbon dioxide in 1948 american meteorologist seymour l hess determined that formation of thin martian clouds would only require of water precipitation and a vapor pressure of first standard nomenclature for martian albedo features was introduced by international astronomical union iau when in 1960 they adopted 128 names from 1929 map of antoniadi named la planete mars working group for planetary system nomenclature wgpsn was established by iau in 1973 to standardize naming scheme for mars and other bodies remote sensing right thumb photograph of martian meteorite alt a rough hewn rock with a yellowish sheen international planetary patrol program was formed in 1969 as a consortium to continually monitor planetary changes this worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on mars their images allow martian seasonal patterns to be studied globally and they showed that most martian dust storms occur when planet is closest to sun since 1960s robotic spacecraft have been sent to explore mars from orbit and surface in extensive detail in addition remote sensing of mars from earth by ground based and orbiting telescopes has continued across much of electromagnetic spectrum these include infrared observations to determine composition of surface ultraviolet and submillimeter observation of atmospheric composition and radio measurements of wind velocities hubble space telescope hst has been used to perform systematic studies of mars and has taken highest resolution images of mars ever captured from earth this telescope can produce useful images of planet when it is at an angular distance of at least 50deg from sun hst can take images of a hemisphere which yields views of entire weather systems earth based telescopes equipped with charge coupled devices can produce useful images of mars allowing for regular monitoring of planet s weather during oppositions x ray emission from mars was first observed by astronomers in 2001 using chandra x ray observatory and in 2003 it was shown to have two components first component is caused by x rays from sun scattering off upper martian atmosphere second comes from interactions between ions that result in an exchange of charges emission from latter source has been observed out to eight times radius of mars by xmm newton orbiting observatory in 1983 analysis of and snc group of meteorites showed that they may have originated on mars allan hills meteorite discovered in antarctica in 1984 is believed to have originated on mars but it has an entirely different composition than snc group in 1996 it was announced that this meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic fossils of martian bacteria however this finding remains controversial chemical analysis of martian meteorites found on earth suggests that ambient near surface temperature of mars has most likely been below freezing point of
