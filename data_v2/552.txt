sparsely spotted stingaree urolophus paucimaculatus also known as white spotted stingaree or dixon s stingaree is a species of stingray in family common off southern australian coast preferring sandy flats and seagrass beds this benthic ray can be found from close to shore to a depth of at least and tends to occur deeper in northern portion of its range reaching a length of this species has a broad diamond shaped pectoral fin disc that is typically plain gray in color above with a v shaped marking between eyes individuals from southerly waters also generally exhibit a smattering of small dark edged white spots this ray is further characterized by a distinctively bell shaped curtain of skin between nostrils its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf shaped caudal fin but no dorsal fin relatively inactive during daytime sparsely spotted stingaree preys mainly on crustaceans and to a much lesser extent on polychaete worms and other small benthic organisms it is aplacental viviparous with mother provisioning her young with histotroph uterine milk life history differs between eastern and western subpopulations eastern females bear litters of up to six pups with a twelve month gestation period while western females bear litters of only one or two pups with a ten month gestation period also western rays mature later and live longer than eastern rays venomous sting of sparsely spotted stingaree is potentially injurious to humans and it has been reported to react aggressively if disturbed international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed it under least concern as there is little fishing activity over majority of its range taxonomy sparsely spotted stingaree was described in a 1969 issue of victorian naturalist by joan dixon of museum victoria specific epithet paucimaculatus is derived from latin meaning few and maculatus meaning spotted type specimen was collected from bass strait near cape patton in victoria subpopulations from eastern and western portions of its range differ in aspects of life history and merit further taxonomic investigation according to international union for conservation of nature iucn distribution and habitat thumb left sparsely spotted stingaree is common in areas covered by sand or seagrass one of most abundant cartilaginous fishes off southern australia sparsely spotted stingaree has a relatively wide distribution extending from crowdy head in new south wales to in western australia including entirety of tasmania its range has expanded southward in past few decades apparently due to climate change in port phillip its numbers increased from 1970 to 1991 likely as a result of fisheries depleting its ecological competitors bottom dwelling in nature sparsely spotted stingaree inhabits a variety of sandy or seagrass bottomed habitats ranging from very shallow sheltered bays and inlets to open continental shelf deep or more rays found further north such as in great australian bight tend to be found at depths greater than by contrast rays found further south off victoria and tasmania are most common in less than of water there is no evidence for segregation by age or sex though there may be an offshore migration during winter description sparsely spotted stingray has a more or less diamond shaped pectoral fin disc wider than long with rounded outer corners anterior margins of disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on fleshy snout tip of which barely protrudes from disc small eyes are immediately followed by comma shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards back between nostrils is a bell shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin only kapala stingaree u has a similarly shaped nasal curtain small mouth contains five or six papillae nipple like structures on floor most of which have forked tips additional small papillae are present on outside of lower jaw teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases and are arranged in a quincunx pattern five pairs of gill slits are short pelvic fins are small and rounded tail measures 77 98 as long as disc it is very flattened at base and slender towards tip which bears a deep leaf shaped caudal fin there is a prominent fold of skin running along either side of tail and a serrated stinging spine placed on upper surface about halfway along its length there is no dorsal fin skin is completely devoid of dermal denticles this species is uniformly light gray above with a darker v shaped marking between eyes and white below with slightly darker lateral disc margins most rays from southern portion of its range also have a handful of small regularly arranged spots atop disc each white with a dark border juveniles have a black caudal fin which lightens with age except sometimes for margin largest individual on record was long biology and ecology during day sparsely spotted stingaree spends much time resting motionless on bottom often buried in sand crustaceans form main component of its diet accounting for over 80 of food intake by volume with amphipods mysids and shrimps being most important polychaete worms mostly of relatively mobile shallowly buried errant type are a major secondary food source on rare occasions molluscs echinoderms and small bony fishes are also eaten this species incorporates a progressively greater diversity of prey into its diet as it grows older specifically mysids isopods and amphipods decline in importance while shrimps polychaete worms penaeid prawns and crabs are consumed in greater proportions sparsely spotted stingaree is preyed upon by broadnose sevengill shark notorynchus cepedianus it is known to be parasitized by a tapeworm in genus acanthobothrium and monogeneans urolophi and urolophi like other stingrays sparsely spotted stingaree is aplacental viviparous once developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk mother supplies them with nutrient rich histotroph uterine milk via specialized extensions of uterine epithelium called trophonemata females have a single functional ovary and uterus on right side and an annual reproductive cycle in eastern subpopulation ovulation occurs in spring or early summer and litter size ranges from one to six increasing with female size gestation period lasts approximately one year and newborns measure about long males reach sexual maturity at around long and two and a half years of age and females at around long and three years of age maximum lifespan is at least 8 years for males and 9 years for females in western subpopulation mating occurs in early or mid summer and females only bear litters of one or two pups gestation period lasts ten months with birthing taking place in late spring or early summer newborns measure across males mature sexually at around across and three years of age and females at around across and five years of age maximum lifespan is 14 years in both subpopulations females grow more slowly and to a larger ultimate size than males human interactions reported to be more aggressive than other sparsely spotted stingaree readily employs its venomous sting if disturbed and can inflict a painful injury on a human it is edible but seldom brought to market fishing pressure is insignificant across large portions of this ray s range including in great australian bight though substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries off southeastern and southwestern australia in beach seines and bottom trawls sparsely spotted stingaree generally survives being captured sorted and discarded though process often causes it to abort any unborn young nevertheless losses to fisheries appear to be sustainable at present and thus iucn has listed this species under least concern there are a number of small marine protected areas within its range and it would potentially benefit from
