berkelium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol bk and atomic number 97 it is a member of actinide and transuranium element series it is named after city of berkeley california location of lawrence berkeley national laboratory then university of california radiation laboratory where it was discovered in december 1949 berkelium was fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium plutonium curium and americium major isotope of berkelium 249bk is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high flux nuclear reactors mainly at oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee usa and at research institute of atomic reactors in dimitrovgrad russia production of second most important isotope 247bk involves irradiation of rare isotope 244cm with high energy alpha particles just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in united states since 1967 there is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides a 22 milligram batch of berkelium 249 was prepared during a 250 day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at oak ridge in 2009 this sample was used to synthesize new element tennessine for first time in 2009 at joint institute for nuclear research russia after it was bombarded with calcium 48 ions for 150 days this was culmination of russia us collaboration on synthesis of heaviest elements on periodic table berkelium is a soft silvery white radioactive metal berkelium 249 isotope emits low energy electrons and thus is relatively safe to handle it decays with a half life of 330 days to californium 249 which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles this gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds since formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination but also free radical effects and self heating from emitted alpha particles characteristics physical thumb double hexagonal close packing with layer sequence abac in crystal structure of a berkelium a green b blue c red alt sequential layers of spheres

californium and below lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties its density of 14 78 g cm3 lies between those of curium 13 52 g cm3 and californium 15 1 g cm3 as does its melting point of 986 degc below that of curium 1340 degc but higher than that of californium 900 degc berkelium is relatively soft and has one of lowest bulk among actinides at about 20 gpa 2 pa berkelium iii ions shows two sharp fluorescence peaks at 652 nanometers red light and 742 nanometers deep red near infrared due to internal transitions at f electron shell relative intensity of these peaks depends on excitation power and temperature of sample this emission can be observed for example after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass by melting glass in

stable a form which has a hexagonal symmetry space group p63 mmc lattice parameters of 341 pm and 1107 pm crystal has a double hexagonal close packing structure with layer sequence abac and so is

sequence abc this phase is metastable and will gradually revert to original a berkelium phase at room temperature temperature of phase transition is believed to be quite close to melting point chemical like all actinides berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into berkelium iii state this trivalent oxidation state 3 is most stable especially in aqueous solutions but tetravalent 4 and possibly divalent 2 berkelium compounds are also known existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride strontium chloride melts a similar behavior is observed for lanthanide analogue of berkelium terbium aqueous solutions of bk3 ions are green in most acids color of ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange yellow in sulfuric acid berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature possibly due to formation of a protective oxide layer surface however it reacts with molten metals hydrogen halogens chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds isotopes about twenty isotopes and six nuclear isomers excited states of an isotope of berkelium have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from 233 to 253 except 235 237 and 239 all of them are radioactive longest half lives are observed for 247bk 1 380 years 248bk over 300 years and 249bk 330 days half lives of other isotopes range from microseconds to several days isotope which is easiest to synthesize is berkelium 249 this emits mostly soft b particles which are inconvenient for detection its alpha radiation is rather weak 1 45 with respect to b radiation but is sometimes used to detect this isotope second important berkelium isotope berkelium 247 is an alpha emitter as are most actinide isotopes occurrence all berkelium isotopes have a half life far too short to be primordial therefore any primordial berkelium that is berkelium present on earth during its formation has decayed by now on earth berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas which were used for atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980 as well as at sites of nuclear incidents such as chernobyl disaster three mile island accident and 1968 thule air base b 52 crash analysis of debris at testing site of first u s hydrogen bomb ivy mike 1 november 1952 enewetak atoll revealed high concentrations of various actinides including berkelium for reasons of military secrecy this result was published only in 1956 nuclear reactors produce mostly among berkelium isotopes berkelium 249 during storage and before fuel disposal most of it beta decays to californium 249 latter has a half life of 351 years which is relatively long when compared to other isotopes produced in reactor and is therefore undesirable in disposal products transuranic elements from americium to fermium including berkelium occurred naturally in natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so

machinery with two operators sitting aside thumb right upright berkelium is named after uc berkeley alt seal of university of california berkeley uc berkeley although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments it was first intentionally synthesized isolated and identified in december 1949 by glenn t seaborg albert ghiorso stanley g thompson and kenneth street jr they used 60 inch cyclotron at university of california berkeley similar to nearly simultaneous discovery of americium element 95 and curium element 96 in 1944 new elements berkelium and californium element 98 were both produced in 1949 1950 abstract name choice for element 97 followed previous tradition of californian group to draw an analogy between newly discovered actinide and lanthanide element positioned above it in periodic table previously americium was named after a continent as its analogue europium and curium honored scientists marie and pierre curie as lanthanide above it gadolinium was named after explorer of rare earth elements johan thus discovery report by berkeley group reads it is suggested that element 97 be given name berkelium symbol bk after city of berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue terbium atomic number 65 whose name was derived from town of sweden where rare earth minerals were first found this tradition ended on berkelium though as naming of next discovered actinide californium was not related to its lanthanide analogue dysprosium but after discovery place most difficult steps in synthesis of berkelium were its separation from final products and production of sufficient quantities of americium for target material first americium 241am nitrate solution was coated on a platinum foil solution was evaporated and residue converted by annealing to americium dioxide amo2 this target was irradiated with 35 mev alpha particles for 6 hours in 60 inch cyclotron at lawrence radiation laboratory university of california berkeley a 2n reaction induced by irradiation yielded 243bk isotope and two free neutrons 241 95 am 4 2 he 243 97 bk 2 1 0 n after irradiation coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution product was centrifugated and re dissolved in nitric acid to separate berkelium from americium this solution was added to a mixture of ammonium and ammonium sulfate and heated to convert all dissolved americium into oxidation state 6 unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by addition of hydrofluoric acid as americium iii fluoride this step yielded a mixture of accompanying product curium and expected element 97 in form of trifluorides mixture was converted to corresponding hydroxides by treating it with potassium hydroxide and after centrifugation was dissolved in perchloric acid thumb chromatographic elution curves revealing similarity between lanthanides terbium tb gadolinium gd and

elevated temperature chromatographic separation behavior was unknown for element 97 at time but was anticipated by analogy with terbium first results were disappointing because no alpha particle emission signature could be detected from elution product with further analysis searching for characteristic x rays and conversion electron signals a berkelium isotope was eventually detected its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in initial report but was later established as 243 synthesis and extraction preparation of isotopes berkelium is produced by bombarding lighter actinides uranium 238u or plutonium 239pu with neutrons in a nuclear reactor in a more common case of uranium fuel plutonium is produced first by neutron capture so called n g reaction or neutron fusion

flux several times higher than a conventional nuclear reactor such as 85 megawatt high flux isotope reactor hfir at oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee usa higher flux promotes fusion reactions involving not one but several neutrons converting 239pu to 244cm and then to curium 249 has a short half life of 64 minutes and thus its further conversion to has a low probability instead it transforms by beta decay into 249bk 249 96 cm beta 64 15 ce min 249 97 bk beta 330 ce d 249 98 cf thus produced 249bk has a long half life of 330 days and thus can capture another neutron however product again has a relatively short half life of 3 212 hours and thus does not yield any heavier berkelium isotopes it instead decays to californium isotope 250cf 249 97 bk ce n gamma 250 97 bk beta 3 212 ce h 250 98 cf although 247bk is most stable isotope of berkelium its production in nuclear reactors is very because its potential progenitor 247cm has never been observed to undergo beta decay thus 249bk is most accessible isotope of berkelium which still is available only in small quantities only 0 66 grams have been produced in us over period 1967 1983 at a high price of order 185 usd per microgram hammond c r elements in it is only berkelium isotope available in bulk quantities and thus only berkelium isotope whose properties can be extensively studied isotope 248bk was first obtained in 1956 by bombarding a mixture of curium isotopes with 25 mev a particles although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with existence of a new isotope was proven by growth of decay product which had been previously characterized half life of 248bk was estimated as hours though later 1965 work gave a half life in excess of 300 years which may be due to an isomeric state berkelium 247 was produced during same year by irradiating 244cm with alpha particles berkelium 242 was synthesized in 1979 by bombarding 235u with 11b 238u with 10b 232th with 14n or 232th with 15n it converts by electron capture to 242cm with a half life of minutes a search for an initially suspected isotope 241bk was then unsuccessful 241bk has since been synthesized separation fact that berkelium readily assumes oxidation state 4 in solids and is relatively stable in this state in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides these are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during nuclear synthesis and often favor 3 state this fact was not yet known in initial experiments which used a more complex separation procedure various inorganic oxidation agents can be applied to berkelium iii solutions to convert it to 4 state such as chromates and cro silver i lead iv oxide ozone or photochemical oxidation procedures more recently it has been discovered that some organic and bio inspired molecules such as chelator called 3 4 3 li 1 2 can also oxidize bk iii and stabilize bk iv under mild conditions berkelium iv is then extracted with ion exchange extraction chromatography or liquid liquid extraction using hdehp bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid amines tributyl phosphate or various other reagents these procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides except for lanthanide cerium lanthanides are absent in irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains a more detailed procedure adopted at oak ridge national laboratory was as follows initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent then precipitated as hydroxides filtered and dissolved in nitric acid it is then treated with high pressure elution from cation exchange resins and berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted using one of procedures described above reduction of thus obtained berkelium iv to 3 oxidation state yields a solution which is nearly free from other actinides but contains cerium berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion exchange treatment bulk metal preparation in order to characterize chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds a program was initiated in 1952 at material testing reactor arco idaho us it resulted in preparation of an eight gram plutonium 239 target and in first production of macroscopic quantities 0 6 micrograms of berkelium by burris b cunningham and stanley g thompson in 1958 after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years s g thompson bb cunningham first macroscopic observations of chemical properties of berkelium and californium supplement to paper p 825 presented at second international conference on peaceful uses of atomic energy geneva 1958 this irradiation method was and still is only way of producing weighable amounts of element and most solid state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or sized samples world s major irradiation sources are 85 megawatt high flux isotope reactor at oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee usa and sm 2 loop reactor at research institute of atomic reactors niiar in dimitrovgrad russia which are both dedicated to production of transcurium elements atomic number greater than 96 these facilities have similar power and flux levels and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements although quantities produced at niiar are not publicly reported in a typical processing campaign at oak ridge tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce quantities of californium milligram quantities of berkelium 249 and einsteinium and picogram quantities of fermium in total just over one gram of berkelium 249 has been produced at oak ridge since 1967 first berkelium metal sample weighing 1 7 micrograms was prepared in 1971 by reduction of berkelium iii fluoride with lithium vapor at 1000 degc fluoride was suspended on a tungsten wire above a tantalum crucible containing molten lithium later metal samples weighing up to 0 5 milligrams were obtained with this method similar results are obtained with berkelium iv fluoride berkelium metal can also be produced by reduction of berkelium iv oxide with thorium or lanthanum compounds oxides two oxides of berkelium are known with berkelium oxidation state of 3 bk2o3 and 4 bko2 berkelium iv oxide is a brown solid while berkelium iii oxide is a yellow green solid with a melting point of 1920 degc and is formed from bko2 by reduction with molecular hydrogen upon heating to 1200 degc oxide bk2o3 undergoes a phase change it undergoes another phase change at 1750 degc such three phase behavior is typical for actinide berkelium ii oxide has been reported as a brittle gray solid but its exact chemical composition remains uncertain halides in halides berkelium assumes oxidation states 3 and 4 3 state is most stable especially in solutions while tetravalent halides bkf4 and cs2bkcl6 are only known in solid phase coordination of

solid and is isotypic with uranium tetrafluoride or zirconium iv fluoride berkelium iii fluoride bkf3 is also a yellow green solid but it has two crystalline structures most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium iii fluoride while upon heating to between 350 and 600 degc it transforms to structure found in lanthanum iii fluoride visible amounts of berkelium iii chloride bkcl3 were first isolated and characterized in 1962 and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram it can be prepared by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about 500 degc this green solid has a melting point of 600 degc and is isotypic with uranium iii chloride upon heating to nearly melting point bkcl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase two forms of berkelium iii bromide are known one with berkelium having coordination 6 and one with coordination 8 latter is less stable and transforms to former phase upon heating to about 350 degc an important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied on these two crystal forms structure of fresh and aged 249bkbr3 samples was probed by x ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years so that various fractions of berkelium 249 had beta decayed to californium 249 no change in structure was observed upon 249bkbr3 249cfbr3 transformation however other differences were noted for 249bkbr3 and 249cfbr3 for example latter could be reduced with hydrogen to but former could not this result was reproduced on individual 249bkbr3 and 249cfbr3 samples as well on samples containing both bromides of californium in berkelium occurs at a rate of 0 22 per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties beside a chemical contamination 249cf being an alpha emitter brings undesirable self damage of crystal lattice and resulting self heating chemical effect however can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating obtained results other inorganic compounds pnictides of berkelium 249 of type are known for elements nitrogen phosphorus arsenic and antimony they crystallize in rock salt structure and are prepared by reaction of either berkelium iii hydride or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperature about 600 degc under high vacuum berkelium iii sulfide is prepared by either treating berkelium oxide with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide vapors at 1130 degc or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with elemental sulfur these procedures yield brownish black crystals berkelium iii and berkelium iv hydroxides are both stable in 1 molar solutions of sodium hydroxide berkelium iii phosphate has been prepared as a solid which shows strong fluorescence under excitation with a green light berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 degc they are non stoichiometric with nominal formula x 0 x 1 several other

fission properties of berkelium are different from those of neighboring actinides curium and californium and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor specifically berkelium 249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons 1200 barns resonance integral but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons in a thermal reactor much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium 250 which quickly decays to californium 250 g pfennig h klewe nebenius w seelmann eggebert eds karlsruhe nuclide 7 edition 2006 in principle

may not be drawn because of different radiation products electrons for berkelium and alpha particles neutrons or both for most other actinides low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium 249 less
