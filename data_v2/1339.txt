before he is executed although he has no freedom of action beyond turning his head development after an online petition signed by fans of call of duty 4 modern warfare was released requesting that a remaster of game be developed series publisher activision became interested in carrying out such a project company approached raven software who had developed multiplayer modes for several previous call of duty titles to be primary developer overseen by infinity ward who would act as executive producer raven s studio director david pellas recalled that not a single person at raven turned away and said no it was a universal yeah we re there development of modern warfare remastered began in early 2015 developers had pledged to focus on four key areas throughout development respecting original game modernizing visuals and audio improving overall experience with new technology and redefining what term remaster meant much of modern warfare was consequently rebuilt from ground up for remastered through revitalisation of original s source codes materials layouts and effects that raven were given access to from infinity ward game runs in full 1080p resolution increased to 4k for playstation 4 pro version at 60 frames per second and uses at time latest iteration of series game engine raven wanted remaster to provide a nostalgic experience for fans of modern warfare while introducing it to newcomers by connecting them to a world that they were used to in recent call of duty games albeit one that mirrored reality pellas noted that risk of negative fan reactions resulting from any small changes made to original and desire to meet high expectations was daunting for raven saying there was a realization that this is freaking terrifying because it s not just important to us to assist in their decision making they reviewed a large number of internet forums where active players of modern warfare could be found in order to understand what they would want from a re release of game raven were encouraged by their principle of keeping core gameplay unchanged a decision that remained consistent throughout process as respecting experience of original was essential subtle improvements were made to both controls and timing of existing animations such as transition between aiming a sniper rifle and scope overlay appearing but were designed to be as close to identical as possible in order to bring modern warfares visuals up to modern standards enhancements of environments and vistas were achieved using a procedure called paint over with a larger number of onscreen objects and effects being integrated into them raven also wanted to give environments a sense of place and history to avoid feeling generic vast majority of objects were remodeled with game using improved texture depth physically based rendering and light reflection and additional features such as realistic physics and joints employed for movable objects like character models developers focused on improving every gun in game explaining we needed to take weapons up to same level of personality as characters each received better dynamics alterations made to their firing mechanisms and a new feature in series that allowed each type to eject shell casings unique to that weapon raven faced some issues during remastering of game s graphics as remaster used a heavily upgraded version of series engine as a result this meant that several of modern warfares visual assets were not compatible with new technology so developers were necessitated to remake them most of existing motion capture animation was redone for same reason as well as to provide further story exposition campaign saw a number of new first person animations similarly added for further immersion and emotional responses from players and to improve how camera made use of player character s body enhancing body sense pellas said i think that for single player campaign we were definitely more liberal with our animations and additions as long as they enhanced true intent of moment artificial intelligence of non player characters was also improved to respond more realistically with environment and vice versa such as long grass reacting to player character s presence existing audio was remastered using reverberation depth and spatial effects to enhance overall ambiance of game one example a developer from raven made note of is that layering out multiple sounds now makes a big difference a range of other examples of sound encompassing both effects and dialogue that were not present in modern warfare were also used including audio channels that had been created for original but due to restraints had not been included during its development one example was training dialogue during game s introductory level which is only heard in modern warfare through use of a mod original music and voice performances were retained with exception of campaign dialogue spoken by al asad in arabic which was amended and re recorded and a slight alteration in voice acting for zakhaev during part of a speech initially original voices of multiplayer announcers from modern warfare were also changed but this was reverted for remastereds release following fan complaints expressed at call of duty xp 2016 where its multiplayer was first made playable similarly a number of weapon sounds in multiplayer that been altered were again revised to more accurately represent those found in original game in addition to these updates game received an array of new features a few new cheats were incorporated into game s campaign while keeping same cheats and intel file collectibles from original multiplayer initially remained largely unchanged in terms of content from modern warfare ten of original sixteen maps were featured at launch while remaining six were released as a free update several weeks later due to developers being unable to meet proposed deadline multiplayer began to receive support over following months during which a wide range of new items was released to bring it more in line with recent call of duty installments from december 2016 a supply drop and crafting system was introduced along with an expanded array of customization items such as emblems calling cards character skins and new varieties of weapon camouflage further guns and melee weapons were also incorporated in time since release game also published various temporary playlists and seasonal events which introduced further new multiplayer modes character skins and variants of existing

modern warfare remastered received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregator metacritic push square called it a ridiculously faithful remake that celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond call of duty up an old care package for a more modern age to near perfection metro wrote one of most influential video games of all time gets remaster it deserves and is still impressively entertaining after all these years game was awarded accolade for best remaster of 2016 from ign revised graphics sound and other improvements received unanimous praise especially when compared to other examples of video game remasters push square wrote that modern warfare remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today s graphical and aural standards while hardcore gamer called it a stunning overhaul and most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster destructoid complimented subtle differences made to original such as zones feeling more alive and atmospheric changes like adding in more details in first person cinematics ign found that range of visual and technical improvements were greater than that of most other remasters although criticized some minor shortcomings with regards to both graphical and design elements a review from metro complimented visuals saying that game still doesn t look quite as good as last couple of call of dutys but it s extremely close and whatever else you say about it on a level this is an excellent remaster critics felt that modern warfares single player campaign had become somewhat dated over nine years but otherwise praised modern day setting and core gameplay for remastered ign remarked how remaster was not as revolutionary a game compared with original but complimented gameplay as having held up remarkably well and was more gratifying as a result of being unaltered stating how it left them feeling relatively weighed down encumbered and more desperate in fray destructoid was positive of all changes made to modern warfare but stated that remastered was still at its core original game from 2007 story was used as an example writing that it was still worth playing despite having been topped by its competition with crux of narrative and relationship between soap and price worth price of admission push square wrote how playing through campaign from modern warfare reminded them of its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in series saying there s tension and gravity shot through experience as if world is on your shoulders to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth metro thought that remaster inadvertently felt cliched due to original having inspired numerous imitations although praised modern day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again hardcore gamer opined that plot was much more grounded and realistic than other recent call of duty titles writing you re not a super soldier stuck in middle of out of this world set piece but rather a regular soldier working with a squad to complete objectives some aspects were singled out by critics for having aged poorly or needing improvement both push square and ign found story to suffer from pacing issues and noted problems with artificial intelligence with ign additionally highlighting dated level design hardcore gamer also criticized decision to retain infinitely spawning enemies from modern warfare calling them a hassle and that weapons found on battlefield were barebones compared to those player starts level with divided opinions were similarly given towards game s multiplayer destructoid had no specific criticisms with online which they found to be timeless and that design of each map held up well and felt justified they compared mode to those offered by other first person shooter games stating there s a nice comfortable balance between two philosophies to point where it s not too alienating for folks who didn t grow up with or feel like dedicating time to learning ins and outs of breaching and clearing each and every room knocking on permadeath s door on every match metro praised multiplayer for being more pleasingly simple than recent call of duty games and how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of modern warfare but nonetheless criticized it for also feeling limited and shallow hardcore gamer complimented online as feeling fresh saying after years of over top killstreaks wall running and other crazy antics it s nice to get back to basics however as with single player they found preserving of several features from original game a hindrance specifically infamous perks and a lack of killstreak countering finding it extremely outdated that they had not been removed or fixed push square praised remastered multiplayer as being faithful to original regardless of its faults and felt simplicity of mode compared with that of newly released call of duty infinite warfare showed that less can be more infinite warfare bundling before its standalone version was announced in june 2017 many criticized decision that modern warfare remastered would only be available through purchasing a special edition of infinite warfare critics recognized that remastered was more sought after than infinite warfare due to contrast in fan reception of both games and saw bundling it as anti consumerist and coercing those into paying more than necessary joey thurmond disagreed with how a re release of a classic that had shaped both series formula and first person shooter genre in general had been coupled with a new poorly received title calling choice preposterous and a bullet in face to consumers he argued that selling remastered separately would actually benefit activision forecasting an eventual influx of pre owned copies of bundle being sold devaluing infinite warfares worth in process forbes paul tassi described bundling as being a way to essentially blackmail players into picking up a more expensive version of a base game they may not have even wanted infinite warfare in order to get something they desperately wanted modern warfare remastered but understood why activision had made choice as a result of it being pro money others found that bundling of games was a sensible business decision highlighting risk that sales of remastered could overshadow those of infinite warfare and result in direct competition between two stephen wright of meanwhile agreed with activision based on impulsiveness of call of duty fanbase writing that many of those who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless due to series popularity activision had capitalized on this by releasing bundle with knowledge that fans would purchase infinite warfare in order to obtain a remaster of modern warfare while wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another he expressed faith that bundle would be good value for money inclusion of microtransactions several weeks after release of remastered activision incorporated use of microtransactions into multiplayer along with further new content which had been absent from modern warfare evidence of had first been raised some days after release when data miners uncovered hidden weapons within game s files that indicated their future inclusion choice to include microtransactions in remaster resulted in a backlash from fans peter of destructoid called decision truly baffling and that it reeks of money some critics were concerned that activision would release new items in supply drops that would provide players with gameplay advantages similar to their approach with other call of duty installments connor murphy at beyond entertainment wrote that it comparatively blows open pandora s box as to what players may encounter gaming journalist jim sterling was also highly critical asserting that activision were helping to set an example for other video game publishers to sell re releases with new or omitted content at extra cost it s a rerelease of a nine year old game that quietly smuggled microtransactions into its online mode and i can t believe a concept so ludicrous is a real thing that s something a parody of industry would come up with it s one thing to see sad normalization of fee to pay elements within brand new releases but to witness them shoveled retroactively into an old beloved title from an age before such trash gained traction activision has set bar for aaa avarice a new height for greed and a new low for games business overall most remasters are sold as complete definitive editions of original games packing in all downloadable content and expansions that may have followed initial launch is paving way for publishers to triple down not just make money by selling an old game with updated visuals but by tacking on dlc and microtransactions too should this pay off i ve little doubt that other publishers will attempt it themselves rampant unchecked greed on display is almost impressive in its audacity to sneak freemium bullshit into a nine year old game that leveraged its own fandom to sell a completely different game is a masterstroke of sliminess a monument to bobby kotick s notorious lack of shame opinions of game s microtransactions post release particularly surrounding implementation of new weapons not seen in modern warfare were mixed pcgamesn expressed frustration that activision had stated that supply drops would only contain cosmetic items and made no mention of additional weapons while hardcore gamer were disappointed that guns were locked behind a and relied heavily on opening supply drops to obtain them conversely in 2019 kotakus doster wrote that while supply drop system had flaws and incorporated a grind for those not willing to spend money it felt more rewarding and less like a money grab than those offered by other call of duty titles released since remastered due to all items being obtainable through supply drop luck or enough playtime without needing to spend money she further complimented that players could choose which items they wanted to work towards unlocking and that new guns introduced were not overpowered pricing of dlc and standalone version of remastered following announcement of remastered variety map pack in march 2017 activision was condemned for deciding that downloadable content would not be available for free complaints highlighted that publisher had already generated additional revenue for remastered by bundling it with infinite warfare increasing its cost to more than an individual game and incorporating microtransactions and that as a remaster which often includes all previously released dlc from original map pack should have been released alongside remastered at launch fans also asserted that selling dlc for a higher price than its original release was an unprincipled move sterling further slated activision for charging for dlc stating that it was incomprehensible and that to increase its cost highlighted just how far activision can mock its customers and get away with it labeling it as latest scam to befall game erik kain of forbes similarly argued that dlc should have been available free of charge maintaining his belief that charging for map packs was a huge mistake however in a follow up article he felt he could sympathize with activision writing that it was easier for them to set price points for early and late buyers he also noted that remaster was cheap in its contribution to overall price for bundle and so further costs for dlc were justified activision faced further criticism upon revealing that variety map pack would equally not be sold alongside standalone version of remastered fans also argued that standalone itself was overpriced especially as both its cost and that of dlc amounted to an almost full price game additionally eurogamer and noted that version bundled with infinite warfare was now selling at a similar price to standalone version forbes kain was understanding of cost of standalone as selling it cheaply would have affronted those who had bought a special edition of infinite warfare for remaster but had been almost certain that game would have included dlc subsequently he wrote that doing so would have been a gesture of good will to community and a smart move for company mic s jason faulkner condemned activision s previous business practices involving remastered and considered standalone version to be a bad deal criticizing that game was being sold for double that of its cost than when it was bundled with infinite warfare and found it ridiculous that with dlc it amounted to almost full price as a result he advised that fans should wait for game to be reduced in price before buying jordan devore of destructoid expressed similar complaints and voiced his disinterest in buying standalone from having to wait six months for its release while also criticizing cost writing i might ve parted with that much money for it last year but not now it s too late criticism of windows version windows version of remastered was criticized by players for suffering from a number of technical issues in multiplayer with further dissatisfaction for game s available settings on steam it received mostly negative user reviews with complaints including poor performance a locked 90 frames per second insufficient mouse support numerous hackers and a low player count players felt that activision had failed to provide adequate support for pc in favor of game s console versions a trait which had also been apparent with previous installments in series consequently many users suggested that multiplayer of modern warfare would be a more suitable alternative which still attracted a sizable number of players and offered better options for performance modding and
