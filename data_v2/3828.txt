canadian government industry statistics n b during period sales figures were compiled by industry canada panties were considered lingerie rather than so called foundation undergarments and are not part of this data set in late 1950s and early 1960s majority of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments girdles were considered ladylike norm and represented close to 40 of industry sales by volume 1960s also brought to canadian lady challenges of feminism fashions and sexual revolution feminist movement cultured by thought leaders like betty friedan and germaine greer questioned mores that defined women s roles and appearance changes in fashion trends such as pantyhose and rise of miniskirt rendered girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women mintzberg 1989 p 126 while intimate apparel industry fretted about bra burning as a precursor to decline of all foundation garment sales women reserved their animosity for their girdles canadian sales data for foundation undergarments from 1960 to 1971 vividly demonstrates shift in tastes it was against this backdrop that canadian lady corset company had to act in 1964 moe nadler died and his son larry nadler inherited control of company larry nadler was a harvard trained mba and brought modern marketing strategies to industry he commissioned market research that identified women s feelings about intimate apparel women did not hate their bras rather they saw bras as a means to feel and look beautiful to be fashionable and sexy and to attract men while women sometimes went they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement canadian lady s management knew that girdles were out but bras would remain an essential part of women s wardrobes so during 1960s while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products canadian lady aggressively pursued bra market share mintzberg 1989 p 127 later larry nadler identified an age based bifurcation in market younger women aged 15 to 20 regarded their bras as an enhancement to their sexuality but were not interested in a heavily structured garment nadler learned that women wanted less bra not no bra in 1974 they introduced a new line of brassieres for teens called dici by wonderbra and invented new hot fabric molding technologies to shape cup these bras were seamless and simply designed with less support than typical bra of period company designed special packaging in shape of a die with holes mintzberg 1984 p 67 brand development in 1966 canadian lady made several important changes to their advertising strategy they introduced television advertising and changed emphasis from product to brand ads attempted to build consumer awareness of single brand name wonderbra market research showed that women did not want girdles advertised on television girdles were seen as armor against sex while bras provided a means of attraction mintzberg 1984 p 70 thumb right dici packaging logo designed by vance jonson c 1974 instead of being hidden wonderbras became more visible icons of female sex appeal company also used pricing to promote wonderbra as a luxury product with highest price of any mass merchandised brand this strategy also provided greater profits in a very competitive industry goal was to have women see their wonderbras as a cosmetic a beauty enhancer rather than a functional garment playtex leading brand at time promoted ease of care and durability of their girdles and brassieres beginning in 1967 advertising focused exclusively on wonderbra brand brassieres in
