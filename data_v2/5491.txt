metrocard select bus service thumb left a chelsea piers bound m23 sbs bus at park avenue in november 2017 shortly after select bus service was implemented m23 route has been traditionally crowded with 4 862 343 riders in 2010 and 4 075 850 riders in 2018 or 15 000 riders a day it is also among city s slowest bus routes running at an average of in 2000 and by 2015 in 2003 straphangers campaign gave m23 pokey award because it ran slower than any other bus route in all of new york city at an average speed of it also received that distinction in 2007 when it also ran at an average of slightly faster than average walking speed of rush hour bus headways on m23 are supposed to be 4 5 to 5 5 minutes a 2015 report found that half of average m23 bus s time is spent either at a bus stop or stopped in traffic that 28 of duration of average m23 trip is spent waiting at bus stops due to passengers boarding and that m23 only moves at over for an average of 10 of each trip this was exacerbated by 23rd street s varying width of causing buses to need to change lanes frequently as well as fact that bus stops were frequently blocked by other traffic and by double parked cars street was designated as a vision zero corridor due to high rate of injuries along street 714 traffic related injuries 75 of them serious as well as 5 deaths due to traffic incidents between 2009 and 2013 in 2009 metropolitan transportation authority and new york city department of transportation nycdot identified m14a d on parallel 14th street as a potential corridor for phase ii of sbs city s bus rapid transit system as well as finalized plans to implement sbs on m16 m34 along also parallel 34th street crosstown bus corridors were noted for slow travel speeds m23 was originally not planned to be an sbs route but in 2008 it had been part of a pilot program in which 30 articulated redesigned sbs buses were rolled out on m23 for some time after lengthy consultation m23 was converted to sbs on november 6 2016 with all door boarding off board fare payment dedicated new york city bus lanes and equipped countdown clocks at some stops this is keeping in line with other sbs routes with same upgrades which have seen their average speeds increase between 10 and 25 after implementation it replaced m23 local service at cost of 1 7 million m23 sbs keeps same route as m23 local with one redundant westbound stop on 5th avenue and a bidirectional stop on lexington avenue being eliminated another bus stop at intersection of 20th street and western portion of 20th street loop was planned for elimination but was retained after community members objected their objections included that removing bus stop would make it harder for elderly residents of peter cooper village to travel to nearest m23 stop and that gap between stops would be or about 0 35 miles if stop were eliminated implementation plan included repainting 23rd street so that it would have 5 lanes throughout most of its length between 2nd and 8th avenues two of these lanes one in each direction would be bus lanes with westbound bus lanes between 1st and 2nd avenues and eastbound bus lanes between 10th and 8th avenues sbs plan excluded a proposal for bus lanes in median of 23rd street which were proposed by three different community boards due to parking issues on 34th street after sbs was implemented there
