julius robert oppenheimer april 22 1904 february 18 1967 was an american theoretical physicist and professor of physics at university of california berkeley oppenheimer was wartime head of los alamos laboratory and is among those who are credited with being father of atomic bomb for their role in manhattan project world war ii undertaking that developed first nuclear weapons first atomic bomb was successfully detonated on july 16 1945 in trinity test in new mexico oppenheimer later remarked that it brought to mind words from bhagavad gita now i am become death destroyer of worlds in august 1945 weapons were used in atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki after war ended oppenheimer became chairman of influential general advisory committee of newly created united states atomic energy commission he used that position to lobby for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with soviet union after provoking ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during second red scare he suffered revocation of his security clearance in a much publicized hearing in 1954 and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence he continued to lecture write and work in physics nine years later president john f kennedy awarded and lyndon b johnson presented him with enrico fermi award as a gesture of political rehabilitation oppenheimer s achievements in physics included born oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions work on theory of electrons and positrons oppenheimer phillips process in nuclear fusion and first prediction of quantum tunneling with his students he also made important contributions to modern theory of neutron stars and black holes as well as to quantum mechanics quantum field theory and interactions of cosmic rays as a teacher and promoter of science he is remembered as a founding father of american school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in 1930s after world war ii he became director of institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey early life childhood and education oppenheimer was born in new york city on april 22 1904 to julius oppenheimer a wealthy jewish textile importer who had immigrated to united states from germany in 1888 and ella friedman a painter julius came to united states with no money no baccalaureate studies and no knowledge of english language he got a job in a textile company and within a decade was an executive with company ella was from baltimore were non observant ashkenazi jews in 1912 family moved to an apartment on 11th floor of 155 riverside drive near west 88th street manhattan an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses their art collection included works by pablo picasso and edouard vuillard and at least three original paintings by vincent van gogh robert had a younger brother frank who also became a physicist oppenheimer was initially educated at alcuin preparatory school in 1911 he entered ethical culture society school this had been founded by felix adler to promote a form of ethical training based on ethical culture movement whose motto was deed before creed his father had been a member of society for many years serving on its board of trustees from 1907 to 1915 oppenheimer was a versatile scholar interested in english and french literature and particularly in mineralogy he completed third and fourth grades in one year and skipped half eighth grade during his final year he became interested in chemistry he entered harvard college one year after graduation at age 18 because he suffered an attack of colitis while prospecting in during a family summer vacation in europe to help him recover from illness his father enlisted help of his english teacher herbert smith who took him to new mexico where oppenheimer fell in love with horseback riding and southwestern united states oppenheimer majored in chemistry but harvard required science students to also study history literature and philosophy or mathematics he compensated for his late start by taking six courses each term and was admitted to undergraduate honor society phi beta kappa in his first year he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on basis of independent study which meant he was not required to take basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones he was attracted to experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics that was taught by percy bridgman he graduated summa cum laude in three years studies in europe thumb heike kamerlingh onnes laboratory in leiden netherlands 1926 oppenheimer is in second row third from left alt fifteen men in suits and one woman pose for a group photograph in 1924 oppenheimer was informed that he had been accepted into christ s college cambridge he wrote to ernest rutherford requesting permission to work at cavendish laboratory bridgman provided oppenheimer with a recommendation which conceded that oppenheimer s clumsiness in laboratory made it apparent his forte was not experimental but rather theoretical physics rutherford was unimpressed but oppenheimer went to cambridge in hope of landing another offer he was ultimately accepted by j j thomson on condition that he complete a basic laboratory course he developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor patrick blackett who was only a few years his senior while on vacation as recalled by his friend francis fergusson oppenheimer once confessed that he had left an apple doused with noxious chemicals on blackett s desk while fergusson s account is only detailed version of this event oppenheimer s parents were alerted by university authorities who considered placing him on probation a fate prevented by his parents successfully lobbying authorities oppenheimer was a tall thin chain smoker who often neglected to eat during periods of intense thought and concentration many of his friends described him as having self destructive tendencies a disturbing event occurred when he took a vacation from his studies in cambridge to meet up with fergusson in paris fergusson noticed that oppenheimer was not well to help distract him from his depression fergusson told oppenheimer that he fergusson was to marry his girlfriend frances keeley oppenheimer did not take news well he jumped on fergusson and tried to strangle him although fergusson easily fended off attack episode convinced him of oppenheimer s deep psychological troubles throughout his life oppenheimer was plagued by periods of depression and he once told his brother i need physics more than friends in 1926 oppenheimer left cambridge for university of gottingen to study under max born gottingen was one of world s leading centers for theoretical physics oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success including werner heisenberg pascual jordan wolfgang pauli paul dirac enrico fermi and edward teller he was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion sometimes to point of taking over seminar sessions this irritated some of born s other students so much that maria goeppert presented born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of class unless he made oppenheimer quiet down born left it out on his desk where oppenheimer could read it and it was effective without a word being said he obtained his doctor of philosophy degree in march 1927 at age 23 supervised by born after oral exam james franck professor administering reportedly said i m glad that s over he was on point of questioning me oppenheimer published more than a dozen papers at gottingen including many important contributions to new field of quantum mechanics he and born published a famous paper on born oppenheimer approximation which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in mathematical treatment of molecules allowing nuclear motion to be neglected to simplify calculations it remains his most cited work early professional work educational work oppenheimer was awarded a united states national research council fellowship to california institute of technology caltech in september 1927 bridgman also wanted him at harvard so a compromise was reached whereby he split his fellowship for 1927 28 academic year between harvard in 1927 and caltech in 1928 at caltech he struck up a close friendship with linus pauling and they planned to mount a joint attack on nature of chemical bond a field in which pauling was a pioneer with oppenheimer supplying mathematics and pauling interpreting results both collaboration and their friendship were in bud when pauling began to suspect oppenheimer of becoming too close to his wife ava helen pauling once when pauling was at work oppenheimer had arrived at their home and invited ava helen to join him on a tryst in mexico though she refused and reported incident to her husband invitation and her apparent nonchalance about it disquieted pauling and he ended his relationship with oppenheimer oppenheimer later invited him to become head of chemistry division of manhattan project but pauling refused saying he was a pacifist in autumn of 1928 oppenheimer visited paul ehrenfest s institute at university of leiden netherlands where he impressed by giving lectures in dutch despite having little experience with language there he was given nickname of later anglicized by his students as from leiden he continued on to swiss federal institute of technology eth in zurich to work with wolfgang pauli on quantum mechanics and continuous spectrum oppenheimer respected and liked pauli and may have emulated his personal style as well as his critical approach to problems thumb university of california berkeley where oppenheimer taught from 1929 to 1943 alt greek style buildings and a clock tower on returning to united states oppenheimer accepted an associate professorship from university of california berkeley where raymond t birge wanted him so badly that he expressed a willingness to share him with caltech before he began his berkeley professorship oppenheimer was diagnosed with a mild case of tuberculosis and spent some weeks with his brother frank at a new mexico ranch which he leased and eventually purchased when he heard ranch was available for lease he exclaimed hot dog and later called it perro caliente literally hot dog in spanish later he used to say that physics and desert country were his two great loves he recovered from tuberculosis and returned to berkeley where he prospered as an advisor and collaborator to a generation of physicists who admired him for his intellectual virtuosity and broad interests his students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing hypnotic in private interaction but often frigid in more public settings his associates fell into two camps one that saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete other that saw him as a pretentious and insecure poseur his students almost always fell into former category adopting his walk speech and other mannerisms and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages hans bethe said of him he worked closely with nobel prize winning experimental physicist ernest o lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers helping them understand data their machines were producing at lawrence berkeley national laboratory in 1936 berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of 3 300 a year in return he was asked to curtail his teaching at caltech so a compromise was reached whereby berkeley released him for six weeks each year enough to teach one term at caltech scientific work oppenheimer did important research in theoretical astronomy especially as related to general relativity and nuclear theory nuclear physics spectroscopy and quantum field theory including its extension into quantum electrodynamics formal mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics also attracted his attention although he doubted its validity his work predicted many later finds which include neutron meson and neutron star initially his major interest was theory of continuous spectrum and his first published paper in 1926 concerned quantum theory of molecular band spectra he developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities he calculated photoelectric effect for hydrogen and x rays obtaining absorption coefficient at k edge his calculations accorded with observations of x ray absorption of sun but not helium years later it was realized that sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct reprinted as thumb left physicists albert einstein and oppenheimer conferring circa 1950 alt einstein writing at a desk oppenheimer sits beside him looking on oppenheimer also made important contributions to theory of cosmic ray showers and started work that eventually led to descriptions of quantum tunneling in 1931 he co wrote a paper on relativistic theory of photoelectric effect with his student harvey hall in which based on empirical evidence he correctly disputed dirac s assertion that two of energy levels of hydrogen atom have same energy subsequently one of his doctoral students willis lamb determined that this was a consequence of what became known as lamb shift for which lamb was awarded nobel prize in physics in 1955 oppenheimer worked with his first doctoral student a woman named melba phillips on calculations of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by deuterons when ernest lawrence and edwin mcmillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found results agreed closely with predictions of george gamow but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved results did not conform to theory in 1935 oppenheimer and phillips worked out a theory now known as oppenheimer phillips process to explain results this theory is still in use today as early as 1930 oppenheimer wrote a paper that essentially predicted existence of positron this was after a paper by paul dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy dirac s paper introduced an equation known as dirac equation which unified quantum mechanics special relativity and then new concept of electron spin to explain zeeman effect oppenheimer drawing on body of experimental evidence rejected idea that predicted positively charged electrons were protons he argued that they would have to have same mass as an electron whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons two years later carl david anderson discovered positron for which he received 1936 nobel prize in physics in late 1930s oppenheimer became interested in astrophysics most likely through his friendship with richard tolman resulting in a series of papers in first of these a 1938 paper co written with robert serber entitled on stability of stellar neutron cores oppenheimer explored properties of white dwarfs this was followed by a paper co written with one of his students george volkoff on massive neutron cores in which they demonstrated that there was a limit so called tolman oppenheimer volkoff limit to mass of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as neutron stars and would undergo gravitational collapse finally in 1939 oppenheimer and another of his students hartland snyder produced a paper on continued gravitational attraction which predicted existence of what are today known as black holes after born oppenheimer approximation paper these papers remain his most cited and were key factors in rejuvenation of astrophysical research in united states in 1950s mainly by john a wheeler oppenheimer s papers were considered difficult to understand even by standards of abstract topics he was expert in he was fond of using elegant if extremely complex mathematical techniques to demonstrate physical principles though he was sometimes criticized for making mathematical mistakes presumably out of haste his physics was good said his student snyder but his arithmetic awful oppenheimer published only five scientific papers one of which was in biophysics after world war ii and none after 1950 murray gell mann a later who as a visiting scientist worked with him at institute for advanced study in 1951 offered this opinion oppenheimer s diverse interests sometimes interrupted his focus on science in 1933 he learned sanskrit and met indologist arthur w ryder at berkeley he read bhagavad gita in original sanskrit and later he cited it as one of books that most shaped his philosophy of life his close confidant and colleague nobel prize winner isidor rabi later gave his own interpretation in spite of this observers such as nobel prize winning physicist luis alvarez have suggested that if he had lived long enough to see his predictions substantiated by experiment oppenheimer might have won a nobel prize for his work on gravitational collapse concerning neutron stars and black holes in retrospect some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime physicist and historian abraham pais once asked oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons not his work on gravitational contraction oppenheimer was nominated for nobel prize for physics three times in 1945 1951 and 1967 but never won private and political life during 1920s oppenheimer remained uninformed on worldly matters he claimed that he did not read newspapers or listen to radio and had only learned of wall street crash of 1929 while he was on a walk with ernest lawrence some six months after crash occurred he once remarked that he never cast a vote until 1936 presidential election however from 1934 on he became increasingly concerned about politics and international affairs in 1934 he earmarked three percent of his annual salary about 100 for two years to support german physicists fleeing from nazi germany during 1934 west coast waterfront strike he and some of his students including melba phillips and bob serber attended a longshoremen s rally oppenheimer repeatedly attempted to get serber a position at berkeley but was blocked by birge who felt that one jew in department was enough thumb upright oppenheimer s id badge from los alamos

frequent visitor in california when his father died in 1937 leaving 392 602 to be divided between oppenheimer and his brother frank oppenheimer immediately wrote out a will that left his estate to university of california to be used for graduate scholarships like many young intellectuals in 1930s he supported social reforms that were later alleged to be communist ideas he donated to many progressive efforts that were later branded as left wing during mccarthy era majority of his allegedly radical work consisted of hosting fundraisers for republican cause in spanish civil war and other anti fascist activity he never openly joined communist party though he did pass money to liberal causes by way of acquaintances who were alleged to be party members in 1936 oppenheimer became involved with jean tatlock daughter of a berkeley literature professor and a student at stanford university school of medicine two had similar political views she wrote for western worker a communist party newspaper tatlock broke up with oppenheimer in 1939 after a tempestuous relationship in august of that year he met katherine kitty a radical berkeley student and former communist party member kitty had been married before her first marriage lasted only a few months her second common law marriage husband was joe dallet an active member of communist party who was killed in spanish civil war kitty returned to united states where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree in botany from university of pennsylvania there she married richard harrison a physician and medical researcher in 1938 in june 1939 kitty and harrison moved to pasadena california where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at university of california los angeles oppenheimer and kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of tolman s parties in summer of 1940 she stayed with oppenheimer at his ranch in new mexico she finally asked harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant when he refused she obtained an instant divorce in reno nevada and took oppenheimer as her fourth husband on november 1 1940 their first child peter was born in may 1941 and their second child katherine toni was born in los alamos new mexico on december 7 1944 during his marriage oppenheimer continued his affair with jean tatlock later their continued contact became an issue in his security clearance hearings because of tatlock s communist associations many of oppenheimer s closest associates were active in communist party in 1930s or 1940s they included his brother frank frank s wife jackie kitty jean tatlock his landlady mary ellen washburn and several of his graduate students at berkeley when he joined manhattan project in 1942 oppenheimer wrote on his personal security questionnaire that he oppenheimer had been a member of just about every communist front organization on west coast years later he claimed that he did not remember saying this that it was not true and that if he had said anything along those lines it was a half jocular overstatement he was a subscriber to people s world a communist party organ and he testified in 1954 i was associated with communist movement from 1937 to 1942 oppenheimer was a member at berkeley of what he called a discussion group which was later identified by fellow members haakon chevalier and gordon griffiths as a closed secret unit of communist party for berkeley faculty fbi opened a file on oppenheimer in march 1941 it recorded that he attended a meeting in december 1940 at chevalier s home that was also attended by communist party s california state secretary william schneiderman and its treasurer isaac fbi noted that oppenheimer was on executive committee of american civil liberties union which it considered a communist front organization shortly thereafter fbi added oppenheimer to its custodial detention index for arrest in case of national emergency debates over oppenheimer s party membership or lack thereof have turned on very fine points almost all historians agree he had strong left wing sympathies during this time and interacted with party members though there is considerable dispute over whether he was officially a member of party at his 1954 security clearance hearings he denied being a member of communist party but identified himself as a fellow traveler which he defined as someone who agrees with many of goals of communism but without being willing to blindly follow orders from any communist party apparatus throughout development of atomic bomb oppenheimer was under investigation by both fbi and manhattan project s internal security arm for his past left wing associations he was followed by army security agents during a trip to california in june 1943 to visit his former girlfriend jean tatlock who was suffering from depression oppenheimer spent night in her apartment tatlock committed suicide on january 4 1944 which left oppenheimer deeply grieved in august 1943 he volunteered to manhattan project security agents that george eltenton whom he did not know had solicited three men at los alamos for nuclear secrets on behalf of soviet union when pressed on issue in later interviews oppenheimer admitted that only person who had approached him was his friend haakon chevalier a berkeley professor of french literature who had mentioned matter privately at a dinner at oppenheimer s house brigadier general leslie r groves jr director of manhattan project thought oppenheimer was too important to project to be ousted over this suspicious behavior on july 20 1943 he wrote to manhattan engineer district manhattan project los alamos on october 9 1941 two months before united states entered world war ii president franklin d roosevelt approved a crash program to develop an atomic bomb in may 1942 national defense research committee chairman james b conant who had been one of oppenheimer s lecturers at harvard invited oppenheimer to take over work on fast neutron calculations a task that oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor he was given title coordinator of rapid rupture which specifically referred to propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb one of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory at his building in berkeley mix of european physicists and his own students a group including robert serber emil konopinski felix bloch hans bethe and edward teller kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done and in what order to make bomb thumb

in atom bomb project and began process of transferring responsibility from office of scientific research and development to military in september groves was appointed director of what became known as manhattan project he selected oppenheimer to head project s secret weapons laboratory this was a choice that surprised many because oppenheimer had left wing political views and no record as a leader of large projects groves was concerned by fact that oppenheimer did not have a nobel prize and might not have had prestige to direct fellow scientists however he was impressed by oppenheimer s singular grasp of practical aspects of designing and constructing an atomic bomb and by breadth of his knowledge as a military engineer groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but chemistry metallurgy ordnance and engineering groves also detected in oppenheimer something that many others did not an overweening ambition that groves reckoned would supply drive necessary to push project to a successful conclusion isidor rabi considered appointment a real stroke of genius on part of general groves who was not generally considered to be a genius oppenheimer and groves decided that for security and cohesion they needed a centralized secret research laboratory in a remote location scouting for a site in late 1942 oppenheimer was drawn to new mexico not far from his ranch on november 16 1942 oppenheimer groves and others toured a prospective site oppenheimer feared that high cliffs surrounding site would make his people feel claustrophobic while engineers were concerned with possibility of flooding he then suggested and championed a site that he knew well a flat mesa near santa fe new mexico which was site of a private boys school called los alamos ranch school engineers were concerned about poor access road and water supply but otherwise felt that it was ideal los alamos laboratory was built on site of school taking over some of its buildings while many new buildings were erected in great haste at laboratory oppenheimer assembled a group of top physicists of time which he referred to as luminaries los alamos was initially supposed to be a military laboratory and oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into army he went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel s uniform and take army physical test which he failed army doctors considered him underweight at diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain plan to commission scientists fell through when robert bacher and isidor rabi balked at idea conant groves and oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby laboratory was operated by university of california under contract to war department it soon turned out that oppenheimer had hugely underestimated magnitude of project los alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6 000 in 1945 oppenheimer at first had difficulty with organizational division of large groups but rapidly learned art of large scale administration after he took up permanent residence on mesa he was noted for his mastery of all scientific aspects of project and for his efforts to control inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists and military he was an iconic figure to his fellow scientists as much a symbol of what they were working toward as a scientific director victor weisskopf put it thus thumb left a group of physicists at 1946 los alamos colloquium on super in front row are norris bradbury john manley

research on properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron generated plutonium 239 which was extremely pure but could only be created in tiny amounts when los alamos received first sample of plutonium from x 10 graphite reactor in april 1944 a problem was discovered reactor bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium 240 making it unsuitable for use in a gun type weapon in july 1944 oppenheimer abandoned gun design in favor of an implosion type weapon using chemical explosive lenses a sub critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form metal needed to travel only very short distances so critical mass would be assembled in much less time in august 1944 oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of los alamos laboratory to focus on implosion he concentrated development efforts on gun type device a simpler design that only had to work with uranium 235 in a single group and this device became little boy in february 1945 after a mammoth research effort more complex design of implosion device known as christy gadget after robert christy another student of oppenheimer s was finalized in a meeting in oppenheimer s office on february 28 1945 in may 1945 an interim committee was created to advise and report on wartime and postwar policies regarding use of nuclear energy interim committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of arthur compton fermi lawrence and oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues in its presentation to interim committee scientific panel offered its opinion not just on likely physical effects of an atomic bomb but on its likely military and political impact this included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not soviet union should be advised of weapon in advance of its use against japan trinity thumb right trinity test of manhattan project was first detonation of a nuclear device joint work of scientists at los alamos resulted in world s first nuclear explosion near alamogordo new mexico on july 16 1945 oppenheimer had given site codename trinity in mid 1944 and said later that it was from one of john donne s holy sonnets according to historian gregg herken this naming could have been an allusion to jean tatlock who had committed suicide a few months previously and had in 1930s introduced oppenheimer to donne s work oppenheimer later recalled that while witnessing explosion he thought of a verse from bhagavad gita xi 12 divi surya utthita yadi sa syad years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time namely famous verse xi 32 which he translated as i am become death destroyer of worlds in 1965 he was persuaded to quote again for a television broadcast brigadier general thomas farrell who was present in control bunker at site with oppenheimer summarized his reaction as follows physicist isidor rabi noticed oppenheimer s disconcerting triumphalism i ll never forget his walk i ll never forget way he stepped out of car his walk was like high noon this kind of strut he had done it at an assembly at los alamos on august 6 evening of atomic bombing of hiroshima oppenheimer took to stage and clasped his hands together like a prize winning boxer while crowd cheered he noted his regret weapon had not been available in time to use against nazi germany however he and many of project staff were very upset about bombing of nagasaki as they did not feel second bomb was necessary from a military point of view he traveled to washington on august 17 to hand deliver a letter to secretary of war henry l stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned in october 1945 oppenheimer was granted an interview with president harry s truman meeting however went badly after oppenheimer remarked he felt he had blood on my hands remark infuriated truman and put an end to meeting truman later told his undersecretary of state dean acheson i don t want to see that son of a bitch in this office ever again for his services as director of los alamos oppenheimer was awarded medal for merit from president harry s truman in 1946 postwar activities thumb right oppenheimer s van gogh enclosed field with rising sun manhattan project was top secret and did not become public knowledge until after bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and oppenheimer became a national spokesman for science who was emblematic of a new type of technocratic power he became a household name and his portrait appeared on covers of life and time nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of world began to realize strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons like many scientists of his generation he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as newly formed united nations which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race institute for advanced study in november 1945 oppenheimer left los alamos to return to caltech but he soon found that his heart was no longer in teaching in 1947 he accepted an offer from lewis strauss to take up directorship of institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey this meant moving back east and leaving ruth tolman wife of his friend richard tolman with whom he had begun an affair after leaving los alamos job came with a salary of 20 000 per annum plus rent free accommodation in director s house a 17th century manor with a cook and groundskeeper surrounded by of woodlands he collected european furniture and french post impressionist and artworks his art collection included works by cezanne de picasso rembrandt renoir van gogh and vuillard thumb left institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey alt four storey red brick building with a white clock tower oppenheimer brought together intellectuals at height of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer most pertinent questions of age he directed and encouraged research of many well known scientists including freeman dyson and duo of chen ning yang and tsung dao lee who won a nobel prize for their discovery of parity non conservation he also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from humanities such as t s eliot and george f kennan some of these activities were resented by a few members of mathematics faculty who wanted institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research abraham pais said that oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at institute was being unable to bring together scholars from natural sciences and humanities during a series of conferences in new york from 1947 through 1949 physicists switched back from war work to theoretical issues under oppenheimer s direction physicists tackled greatest outstanding problem of pre war years infinite divergent and non expressions in quantum electrodynamics of elementary particles julian schwinger richard feynman and shin ichiro tomonaga tackled problem of regularization and developed techniques which became known as renormalization freeman dyson was able to prove that their procedures gave similar results problem of meson absorption and hideki s theory of mesons as carrier particles of strong nuclear force were also tackled probing questions from oppenheimer prompted robert marshak s innovative two meson hypothesis that there were actually two types of mesons pions and muons this led to cecil frank powell s breakthrough and subsequent nobel prize for discovery of pion atomic energy commission as a member of board of consultants to a committee appointed by truman oppenheimer strongly influenced acheson lilienthal report in this report committee advocated creation of an international atomic development authority which would own all fissionable material and means of its production such as mines and laboratories and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production bernard baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to united nations resulting in baruch plan of 1946 baruch plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement in particular requiring inspection of soviet union s uranium resources baruch plan was seen as an attempt to maintain united states nuclear monopoly and was rejected by soviets with this it became clear to oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable due to mutual suspicion of united states and soviet union which even oppenheimer was starting to distrust thumb upright oppenheimer in 1946 with his trademark cigarette alt a man in a suit seated smoking a cigarette after atomic energy commission aec came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues oppenheimer was appointed as chairman of its general advisory committee gac from this position he advised on a number of nuclear related issues including project funding laboratory construction and even international policy though gac s advice was not always heeded as chairman of gac oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race when government questioned whether to pursue a crash program to develop an atomic weapon based on nuclear fusion hydrogen bomb oppenheimer initially recommended against it though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during manhattan project he was motivated partly by ethical concerns feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets resulting in millions of deaths but also by practical ones as there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb at time and oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons he and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to tritium production they were overridden by truman who announced a crash program after soviet union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949 oppenheimer and other gac opponents of project especially james conant felt personally shunned and considered retiring from committee they stayed on though their views on hydrogen bomb were well known in 1951 however edward teller and mathematician stanislaw ulam developed what became known as teller ulam design for a hydrogen bomb this new design seemed technically feasible and oppenheimer changed his opinion about developing weapon as he later recalled security hearing fbi under j edgar hoover had been following oppenheimer since before war when he

and office bugged his phone tapped and his mail opened fbi furnished oppenheimer s political enemies with incriminating evidence about his communist ties these enemies included strauss an aec commissioner who had long harbored resentment against oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of strauss before congress some years earlier regarding strauss s opposition to export of radioactive isotopes to other nations oppenheimer had memorably categorized these as less important than electronic devices but more important than let us say

un american activities committee where he admitted that he had associations with communist party in 1930s he testified that some of his students including david bohm giovanni rossi philip morrison bernard peters and joseph weinberg had been communists at time they had worked with him at berkeley frank oppenheimer and his wife jackie testified before huac and admitted that they had been members of communist party frank was subsequently fired from his university of minnesota position unable to find work in physics for many years he became instead a cattle rancher in colorado he later taught high school physics and was founder of san francisco exploratorium oppenheimer had found himself in middle of more than one controversy and power struggle in years from 1949 to 1953 edward teller who had been so uninterested in work on atomic bomb at los alamos during war that oppenheimer had given him time instead to work on his own project of hydrogen bomb had eventually left los alamos in 1951 to help found in 1952 a second laboratory at what would become lawrence livermore national laboratory there he could be free of los alamos control to develop hydrogen bomb long range thermonuclear strategic weapons delivered by jet bombers would necessarily be under control of new united states air force usaf oppenheimer had for some years pushed for smaller tactical nuclear weapons which would be more useful in a limited theater against enemy troops and which would be under control of army two services fought for control of nuclear weapons often allied with different political parties usaf with teller pushing its program gained ascendance in republican controlled administration following election of dwight d eisenhower as president in 1952 strauss and senator brien mcmahon author of 1946 mcmahon act pushed eisenhower to revoke oppenheimer s security clearance on december 21 1953 strauss told oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended pending resolution of a series of charges outlined in a letter and discussed his resigning oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a hearing instead charges were outlined in a letter from kenneth d nichols general manager of aec hearing that followed in april may 1954 which was initially confidential and not made public focused on oppenheimer s past communist ties and his association during manhattan project with suspected disloyal or communist scientists us department of energy made public full text of transcript in october 2014 thumb upright oppenheimer s former colleague physicist edward teller testified on behalf of government at oppenheimer s security hearing in 1954 alt head and shoulders of a man with bushy eyebrows one of key elements in this hearing was oppenheimer s earliest testimony about george eltenton s approach to various los alamos scientists a story that oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend haakon chevalier unknown to oppenheimer both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before he was surprised on witness stand with transcripts of these which he had not been given a chance to review in fact oppenheimer had never told chevalier that he had finally named him and testimony had cost chevalier his job both chevalier and eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to soviets eltenton admitting he said this to chevalier and chevalier admitting he mentioned it to oppenheimer but both put matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage either in planning or in deed neither was ever convicted of any crime teller testified that he considered oppenheimer loyal but that this led to outrage by scientific community and teller s virtual expulsion from academic science ernest lawrence refused to testify on grounds that he was suffering from an attack of ulcerative colitis but an interview transcript in which he condemned oppenheimer was presented as evidence in his absence groves threatened by fbi as having been potentially part of a coverup about chevalier contact in 1943 likewise testified against oppenheimer many top scientists as well as government and military figures testified on oppenheimer s behalf inconsistencies in his testimony and his erratic behavior on stand at one point saying he had given a cock and bull story and that this was because he was an idiot convinced some that he was unstable unreliable and a possible security risk oppenheimer s clearance was revoked one day before it was due to lapse anyway isidor rabi s comment was that oppenheimer was merely a government consultant at time anyway and that if government didn t want to consult guy then don t consult him during his hearing oppenheimer testified willingly on left wing behavior of many of his scientific colleagues had oppenheimer s clearance not been stripped then he might have been remembered as someone who had named names to save his own reputation as it happened oppenheimer was seen by most of scientific community as a martyr to mccarthyism an eclectic liberal who was unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies symbolic of shift of scientific creativity from academia into military wernher von braun summed up his opinion about matter with a quip to a congressional committee in england oppenheimer would have been knighted in a seminar at woodrow wilson institute on may 20 2009 based on an extensive analysis of vassiliev notebooks taken from kgb archives john earl haynes harvey klehr and alexander vassiliev confirmed that oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for soviet union kgb tried repeatedly to recruit him but was never successful oppenheimer did not betray united states in addition he had several persons removed from manhattan project who had sympathies to soviet union haynes klehr and vassiliev also state oppenheimer was in fact a concealed member of in late 1930s john earl haynes harvey klehr and alexander vassiliev spies rise and fall of kgb in america new haven yale university press 2009 p 58 according to biographer ray monk he was in a very practical and real sense a supporter of communist party moreover in terms of time effort and money spent on party activities he was a very committed supporter final years and death starting in 1954 oppenheimer lived for several months of year on

toni and wife kitty thumb left oppenheimer beach in saint john u s virgin islands alt a tropical beach with sand surf and trees some bathers enjoy blue waters oppenheimer was increasingly concerned about potential danger that scientific inventions could pose to humanity he joined with albert einstein bertrand russell joseph rotblat and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually in 1960 become world academy of art and science significantly after his public humiliation he did not sign major open protests against nuclear weapons of 1950s including russell einstein manifesto of 1955 nor though invited did he attend first pugwash conferences on science and world affairs in 1957 in his speeches and public writings oppenheimer continually stressed difficulty of managing power of knowledge in a world in which freedom of science to exchange ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns oppenheimer delivered reith lectures on bbc in 1953 which were subsequently published as science and common understanding in 1955 oppenheimer published open mind a collection of eight lectures that he had given since 1946 on subject of nuclear weapons and popular culture oppenheimer rejected idea of nuclear gunboat diplomacy purposes of this country in field of foreign policy he wrote cannot in any real or enduring way be achieved by coercion in 1957 philosophy and psychology departments at harvard invited oppenheimer to deliver william james lectures an influential group of harvard alumni led by edwin ginn that included archibald roosevelt protested against decision some 1 200 people packed into sanders theatre to hear oppenheimer s six lectures entitled hope of order oppenheimer delivered whidden lectures at mcmaster university in 1962

universe in september 1957 france made him an officer of legion of honor and on may 3 1962 he was elected a foreign member of royal society in britain reprinted as at urging of many of oppenheimer s political friends who had ascended to power president john f kennedy awarded oppenheimer enrico fermi award in 1963 as a gesture of political rehabilitation edward teller winner of previous year s award had also recommended oppenheimer receive it in hope that it would heal rift between them a little over a week after kennedy s assassination his successor president lyndon johnson presented oppenheimer with award for contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas and for leadership of los alamos laboratory and atomic energy program during critical years oppenheimer told johnson i think it is just possible mr president that it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make this award today rehabilitation implied by award was partly symbolic as oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy but award came with a 50 000 tax free stipend and its award outraged many prominent republicans in congress late president kennedy s widow jacqueline still living in white house made it a point to meet with oppenheimer to tell him how much her husband had wanted him to have medal while still a senator in 1959 kennedy had been instrumental in voting to narrowly deny oppenheimer s enemy lewis strauss a coveted government position as secretary of commerce effectively ending strauss s political career this was partly due to lobbying by scientific community on behalf of oppenheimer oppenheimer was a chain smoker who was diagnosed with throat cancer in late 1965 after inconclusive surgery he underwent unsuccessful radiation treatment and chemotherapy late in 1966 he fell into a coma on february 15 1967 and died at his home in princeton new jersey on february 18 aged 62 a memorial service was held a week later at alexander hall on campus of princeton university service was attended by 600 of his scientific political and military associates that included bethe groves kennan lilienthal rabi smyth and wigner his brother frank and rest of his family were also there as was historian arthur m schlesinger jr novelist john o hara and george balanchine director of new york city ballet bethe kennan and smyth gave brief eulogies oppenheimer s body was cremated and its ashes were placed into an urn his wife kitty took ashes to st john and dropped urn into sea within sight of beach house in october 1972 kitty died at age 62 from an intestinal infection that was complicated by a pulmonary embolism oppenheimer s ranch in new mexico was then inherited by their son peter and beach property was inherited by their daughter katherine toni oppenheimer silber toni was refused security clearance for her chosen vocation as a united nations translator after fbi brought up old charges against her father in january 1977 three months after end of her second marriage she committed suicide at age 32 her ex husband found her hanging from a beam in her family beach house she left property to people of st john for a public park and recreation area original house was built too close to coast and succumbed to a hurricane today virgin islands government maintains a community center in area legacy when oppenheimer was stripped from his position of political influence in 1954 he symbolized for many folly of scientists thinking they could control how others would use their research he has also been seen as symbolizing dilemmas involving moral responsibility of scientist in nuclear world hearings were motivated both by politics as oppenheimer was seen as a representative of previous administration and by personal considerations stemming from his enmity with lewis strauss ostensible reason for hearing and issue that aligned oppenheimer with liberal intellectuals oppenheimer s opposition to hydrogen bomb development was based as much on technical grounds as on moral ones once technical considerations were resolved he supported teller s hydrogen bomb because he believed that soviet union would inevitably construct one too rather than consistently oppose red baiting of late 1940s and early 1950s oppenheimer testified against some of his former colleagues and students both before and during his hearing in one incident his damning testimony against former student bernard peters was selectively leaked to press historians have interpreted this as an attempt by oppenheimer to please his colleagues in government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left wing ties and those of his brother in end it became a liability when it became clear that if oppenheimer had really doubted peters loyalty his recommending him for manhattan project was reckless or at least contradictory thumbnail left upright oppenheimer and leslie groves in

oppenheimer after appearing on west german television had its theatrical release in berlin and munich in october 1964 oppenheimer s objections resulted in an exchange of correspondence with kipphardt in which playwright offered to make corrections but defended play it premiered in new york in june 1968 with joseph wiseman in oppenheimer role new york times theater critic clive barnes called it an angry play and a partisan play that sided with oppenheimer but portrayed scientist as a tragic fool and genius oppenheimer had difficulty with this portrayal after reading a transcript of kipphardt s play soon after it began to be performed oppenheimer threatened to sue playwright decrying improvisations which were contrary to history and to nature of people involved later oppenheimer told an

centennial studies and reflections his papers are in library of congress as a scientist oppenheimer is remembered by his students and colleagues as being a brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was founder of modern theoretical physics in united states because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit nobel prize although his investigations contributing to theory of black holes may have warranted prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists an asteroid oppenheimer was named in his honor as was lunar crater oppenheimer as a military and public policy advisor oppenheimer was a technocratic leader in a shift in interactions between science and military and emergence of big science during world war ii scientists became involved in military research to an unprecedented degree because of threat fascism posed to western civilization they volunteered in great numbers both for technological and organizational assistance to allied effort resulting in such powerful tools as radar proximity fuse and operations research as a cultured intellectual theoretical physicist who became a disciplined military organizer oppenheimer represented shift away from idea that scientists had their head in clouds and that knowledge on such previously esoteric
