douglas xcg 17 was an american assault glider developed by conversion of a c 47 skytrain twin engine transport during world war ii although xcg 17 was successful in testing requirement for such a large glider had passed and no further examples of type were built one additional c 47 however was converted in field to glider configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration design and development with introduction of douglas c 54 skymaster four engined transport aircraft united states army air forces observing that conventional gliders then in service would be an inefficient use of c 54 s power and capacity determined that a requirement existed for a new much larger assault glider swanborough and bowers 1989 p 274 taylor 1991 p 151 it was determined that best solution to requirement was conversion of douglas c 47 skytrain already in large scale production to meet requirement c 47 could be converted to a glider configuration with minimal alteration to airframe and would provide required capacity trials conducted using a conventional powered c 47 first conducting ordinary deadstick landings then being towed by another c 47 indicated that scheme was feasible therefore a c 47 dl was taken in hand for conversion into a glider which was given designation xcg 17 davis 1995 p 40 aircraft formerly a northwest airlines dc 3 that had been impressed into military service at start of world war ii day 2001 was modified by removal of aircraft s engines nacelles containing landing gear remained in place covered with aerodynamically profiled hemispherical domes for streamlining containing fixed weight to compensate for removal of engines grim 2009 p 17 other equipment no longer necessary with conversion to an unpowered configuration was also removed to save weight items removed included aircraft s wiring and bulkheads along with navigator s and radio operator s positions operational history thumb right c 54 was preferred tow aircraft for xcg 17 conversion carried out at clinton county army air field was completed on june 12 1944 with aircraft undergoing its initial flight test shortly thereafter flight testing of xcg 17 proved that aircraft was satisfactory compared with conventional gliders in service aircraft possessed lower stalling and higher towing speeds than conventional gliders as well as gliding at a significantly shallower angle francillon 1988 p 233 serling 1997 p 62 tow tests were conducted using a variety of aircraft most commonly used configuration was a tandem tow by two c 47s with towing aircraft coupled one in front of other and leading aircraft detaching following takeoff this configuration was dangerous for middle c 47 however and it was determined that a single c 54 was optimal tug aircraft xcg 17 s cargo hold had a capacity of alternatively up to 40 fully equipped troops could be transported these figures being significantly larger than conventional gliders capacity xcg 17 was also capable of carrying three jeeps in a single load or alternatively two howitzers regardless of aircraft s load no ballast was required to maintain aircraft s center of gravity a trait unique among american assault gliders despite satisfactory results in testing however aircraft failed army s requirement that it be capable of landing on unimproved fields in addition by time xcg 17 s evaluation was completed need for such a large assault glider had passed primary role for glider had been intended to increase amount of supplies that could be carried to china over hump war situation had however become more favorable and added capacity an oversized glider would provide was no longer required no further examples of type were produced prototype its trials complete was placed in storage being ferried to davis monthan air force base for disposal in august 1946 in august 1949 aircraft was sold to advance industries its engines being reinstalled to return aircraft to powered status in dc 3c configuration some sources however indicate that xcg 17 was reconverted to c 47 configuration in 1946 following its restoration to powered status aircraft was transferred to mexico where it remained in civilian service until 1980 field conversion although xcg 17 failed to lead to any production of a c 47 derived glider type a single c 47 was converted in field to glider configuration by fifth air service area command located at nichols field on luzon in philippines during january 1946 carried out in much same manner as xcg 17 conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over engine mountings with an auxiliary power unit from a b 24 liberator bomber being installed referred to as xcg 47 as well as xcg 17 and named nez perce aircraft undertook its initial flight following conversion on june 17 1946 towed by a c 54 flight tests of field converted aircraft proved favorable and an ambitious flight towing aircraft from luzon to tokyo in japan was planned this flight was intended to prove suitability of large gliders to act as an aerial freight train for regular transport flight conducted in late june 1946 took 11 hours of flight time and included an overnight stay on okinawa covering it concluded at tachikawa airfield near tokyo despite success of flight aerial freight train concept did not catch on aircraft had its engines re fitted in august 1946 and was returned to service as a normal c 47 operators military as c 47 then xcg 17 united states army air forces civilian as dc 3c petroleos 2010 specifications 41 see also references notes
