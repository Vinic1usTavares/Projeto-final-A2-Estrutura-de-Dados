origin of soma soma is energy of life harnessing of which was granted to humans by extraterrestrial arethia existing in legend as a false god banished through use of soma arethia was actually a non physical collective consciousness that traded use of human bodies for technical knowledge that allowed humans to thrive arethia were eventually betrayed by humanity robbed of ability to use physical hosts after a vicious war arethia consciousness was imprisoned beyond atmosphere in soma ring in truth an orbital ring controlled from ring tower in ancient human citadel of cremona imprisoning arethia allowed humanity free use and control of soma energy a weakness eventually appeared in ring s containment field and some of arethia consciousness escaped corrupted by journey to surface formerly benign energy mutated and infected other lifeforms with a mindless wish for self preservation becoming visitors both idea and adonis were created using master cages as weapons during conflict

brainchild of tetsuya takahashi one of co founders of developer monolith soft it was first time monolith soft had full development responsibilities for a game on a portable platform game took approximately two years to develop takahashi s aim was to create an in depth introductory role playing experience for ds ds was chosen as game s platform so people could both enjoy game and play it for short bursts on go story was written by takahashi s wife soraya saga whose previous work included final fantasy vi 1994 xenogears 1998 and xenosaga series due to goal of creating a fun co op gameplay experience saga deliberately kept story simple and clear not to interrupt fun of playing narrative was based around titular energy soma which was a key part of everyday life with soma ring encircling planet forming a key part of story also among staff were director shingo kawabata art director tonny koo and character designer takahashi acted as game designer at beginning of development soma bringer was to be a standard role playing game during early testing it was seen that typical role playing games were not well suited to ds limited hardware and controls so they adjusted gameplay to its current form as an action role playing game after positive feedback from this team went ahead move to being an action role playing game enabled incorporation of cooperative multiplayer team wanted to focus as much as possible on combat and related gimmicks over environmental puzzles rather than a separate mode multiplayer was incorporated into main story development cycle differed greatly from previous monolith soft titles in takahashi s earlier games scenario was written first then gameplay was tailored to fit for soma bringer gameplay was finalized first and scenario was built around locations dungeons and mechanics team had created also in contrast to earlier monolith soft titles was lack of lengthy cutscenes which could not be incorporated into game with ds limited hardware instead team used real time graphics and gameplay models for equivalent scenes music thumb 150px right yasunori mitsuda composed and produced original score for soma bringer music for soma bringer was composed and arranged by yasunori mitsuda whose previous notable work included titles such as chrono trigger xenogears chrono cross and xenosaga episode i mitsuda was involved from very beginning of development as takahashi did not want to work on a game without mitsuda s music mitsuda accepted due to their past work on xenogears and xenosaga considering it a kind of reunion mitsuda s music formed a key part in compensating for lack of proper cutscenes as music made up for any lack in dramatic character movement during story sequences due to gameplay being created first mitsuda had difficulty pinning down what he had to do and wrote songs for soundtrack based on gradually emerging visuals and scenario mitsuda estimated that he had written around one hundred songs for game including test tracks opening vocal track titled ring was written for opening movie and set to a piece of poetry written by takahashi to portray themes of game mitsuda used three female vocalists eri kawai koko and tamie hirose and recorded in a to produce as clear a sound as possible kawai also performed vocal work for track destruction for each of location themes mitsuda used a different primary instrument to create an impression for instance for a desert location he used a sitar while a location dominated by machinery used electric guitar all instrument sounds were created using a synthesizer mitsuda and his team spent first year of game s development studying ds hardware which had notoriously bad sound quality and brought with it severe technical difficulties in creating a soundtrack of a similar caliber to mitsuda s previous work main limitations were speaker limits and limited memory capacity part of difficulty in composing music was creating different mixes for soundtrack depending on whether player selected built in speakers or headphones according to mitsuda speakers and headphones had very different hertz outputs meaning it was impossible to maintain same quality for both settings end result was described by mitsuda as a much better sound quality with a lesser amount of data two key people cited by mitsuda in overcoming these barriers were sound programmer hidenori suzuki and synthesizer operator junya kuroda kuroda came up with multiple techniques for improving sound quality a task which had been so infuriating for mitsuda that he came close to giving up multiple times according to kuroda main difficulty was not a lack of techniques for creating a clean sound for ds but applying them to music of soma bringer which was more ambitious than many other soundtracks for platform result of using their own technology meant that after adjustment and balancing tracks were very close to original tracks prior to being incorporated into game and ds sound environment suzuki worked on dedicated sound driver and mitsuda appraised him with achieving a clean sound for opening track a soundtrack album soma bringer original soundtrack was released through sleigh bells label on april 2 2008 soundtrack covers three discs in addition to tracks used in game album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks ben schweitzer writing for rpgfan positively compared score to earlier works by mitsuda calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work don kotowski of video game music online gave soundtrack album a perfect score of 5 5 stars he frequently praised mitsuda s style and like schweitzer noted that it often recalled his earlier work he also praised additional tracks for their richness and depth finishing his review by saying that it was a soundtrack not to be missed by buyers of video game music release existence of soma bringer was first hinted at when nintendo filed a trademark for title alongside others it was officially announced in october that year at a nintendo press conference published by nintendo soma bringer was first monolith soft title to be released after its acquisition by nintendo in april 2007 it was released on february 22 2008 after positive impressions from previews during public gaming events in japan both ign and 1up com voiced a hope that game would receive a localization speaking in 2010 saga said that she did not know whether it would be released outside japan or whether further games set in soma bringer universe would be developed ultimately soma bringer was not released outside japan no explanation was given by nintendo although there was some speculation that its high text content was to blame its exclusivity to japan has drawn both disappointment and criticism from some journalists in addition to continued hope for a western release an article from ign cited release of glory of heracles as a possible precursor to a western release while gaming site siliconera reported that nintendo might release it in west during transitional phase between ds and its successor nintendo 3ds although writer noted that soma bringers text heavy approach made it more difficult and thus less appealing to localize to date it remains exclusive to japan an unofficial open fan translation patch was created while not complete it translated greater majority of text into english reception soma bringer entered japanese sales charts at 4 with sales of 50 844 units with an estimated sell through rate of just over 68 limited edition was best selling ds title during its opening week on amazon japan by following week game had dropped to 7 with further sales of 17 000 units by end of 2008 game had sold 107 127 units famitsu gave game a positive review while one reviewer noted that story and gameplay offered little originality all reviewers positively noted amount of depth and customization next to ease of play gamesradar compared soma bringer to square enix s final fantasy crystal chronicles except noting that gameplay systems and customization options were deeper reviewer called it pretty good but noted that it was not import friendly due to large amount of text mike moehnke of rpgamer was generally positive about game praising character customization general gameplay ease of entry and mitsuda s music like gamesradar reviewer moehnke noted heavy amount of text making understanding japanese a necessity for understanding story despite calling it a fairly easy import as story was not game s main focus siliconera writer rolando again echoed necessity for understanding japanese due to game s text heavy nature while noting plot was quite simple and in common with other monolith soft titles but otherwise generally praised gameplay mechanics and noted that multiplayer would be fun despite lack of wifi functionality in conclusion he positively compared soma bringer to console turn based role playing game lost odyssey while it brought nothing new to genre it was a nostalgic experience that reminded players of genre s worth english previews positively compared gameplay to mana series with 1up com s jeremy parish also noting it feeling familiar to gameplay from diablo series these comparisons were also shared by other reviewers notes references external links category role playing video
