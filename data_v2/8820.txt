inventive lyrical approach and purity of tone his solos on seminal recordings such as singin blues and i m coming virginia both 1927 demonstrate a gift for extended improvisation that heralded jazz ballad style in which jazz solos are an integral part of composition moreover his use of extended chords and an ability to improvise freely along harmonic as well as melodic lines are echoed in post wwii developments in jazz in a mist 1927 is best known of beiderbecke s published piano compositions and only one that he recorded his piano style reflects both jazz and classical mainly impressionist influences all five of his piano compositions were published by robbins music during his lifetime a native of davenport iowa beiderbecke taught himself to play cornet largely by ear leading him to adopt a non standard fingering technique that informed his unique style he first recorded with midwestern jazz ensemble wolverines in 1924 after which he played briefly for detroit based jean goldkette orchestra before joining frankie tram trumbauer for an extended engagement at arcadia ballroom in st louis also under auspices of goldkette s organisation beiderbecke and trumbauer joined

recordings in 1927 goldkette band folded in september 1927 and after briefly joining bass saxophone player adrian rollini s band in new york trumbauer and beiderbecke joined america s most popular dance band paul whiteman and his orchestra beiderbecke s most influential recordings date from his time with goldkette and whiteman although he also recorded under his own name and that of trumbauer s whiteman period marked a precipitous decline in his health due to his increasing use of alcohol treatment for alcoholism in rehabilitation centers with support of whiteman and beiderbecke family

starring kirk douglas lauren bacall doris day and hoagy carmichael his life has often been portrayed as that of a jazz musician who had to compromise his art for sake of commercialism beiderbecke remains subject of scholarly controversy regarding his full name cause of his death and importance of his contributions to jazz he composed or played on recordings that are jazz classics and standards

listened to jazz from riverboats that docked in downtown davenport louis armstrong and drummer baby dodds claimed to have met beiderbecke when their excursion boat stopped in davenport dodds p 24 armstrong p 209 historians disagree over whether such an event occurred while armstrong and dodds both claimed that they met beiderbecke in davenport many historians argue it never happened berton p 24 writes there is no evidence two met in davenport while kenney p 123 writes that two may have met in louisiana missouri still critic and armstrong biographer terry teachout writes in homage to bix that beiderbecke did in fact hear armstrong in davenport beiderbecke attended davenport high school from 1918 to 1921 during this time he sat in and played professionally with various bands including

april 22 1921 a month after he turned 18 beiderbecke was arrested by two davenport police officers on an accusation that he had taken a five year old girl named sarah ivens into a neighbor s garage and committed a lewd and lascivious act with her a statutory felony in iowa according to police ledger girl accused beiderbecke of putting his hands on her person outside of her dress ledger went on to state that beiderbecke and girl were in an auto in garage and he closed door on girl and she hollered attracting attention of two young men who were across street young men went over to garage and girl went home beiderbecke was released after a 1 500 bail bond was posted sarah s father preston ivens requested that scott county grand jury drop charge to avoid harm that would result to her in going over this case and in september 1921 grand jury returned no indictment whereupon county attorney filed a dismissal of case it is not clear from official documents if sarah herself had identified beiderbecke but two young men had told her father when he questioned them a day after alleged incident that they had seen beiderbecke take girl into garage surviving official documents concerning arrest and its aftermath including two police entries and preston ivens grand jury testimony were first made available in 2001 by professor albert haim on bixography website jean pierre lion in his 2005 biography discussed incident briefly and printed texts of documents earlier biographies had not reported alleged incident in september 1921 beiderbecke enrolled at lake forest academy a boarding school north of chicago in lake forest illinois feather and gitler p 49 while historians have traditionally suggested that his parents sent him to lake forest to discourage his interest in jazz for example see feather p 49 others believe that he may have been sent away in response to his arrest lion p 26 regardless mr and mrs beiderbecke apparently felt that a boarding school would provide their son with both faculty attention and discipline required to improve his academic performance lion p 27 necessitated by fact that bix had failed most courses at high school remaining a junior in 1921 despite turning 18 in march of that year his interests however remained limited to music and sports in pursuit of former beiderbecke often visited chicago to listen to jazz bands at night clubs and speakeasies including infamous friar s inn where he sometimes sat in with new orleans rhythm kings lion pp 39 40 he also traveled to predominantly african american south side to listen to classic black jazz bands such as king oliver s creole jazz band which featured louis armstrong on second cornet don t think i m getting hard burnie he wrote to his brother but i d go to hell to hear a good band ward p 83 on campus he helped organize cy bix orchestra with drummer walter cy and almost immediately got into trouble with lake forest headmaster for performing indecorously at a school dance beiderbecke often failed to return to his dormitory before curfew and sometimes stayed off campus next day in early morning hours of may 20 1922 he was caught on fire escape to his dormitory attempting to climb back into his room faculty voted to expel him next day ward and burns p 84 due both to his academic failings and his extracurricular activities which included drinking headmaster informed beiderbecke s parents by letter that following his expulsion school officials confirmed that beiderbecke was drinking himself and was responsible in part at least in having liquor brought into school lion p 43 soon after beiderbecke began pursuing a career in music lion 44 45 he returned to davenport briefly in summer of 1922 then moved to chicago to join cascades band working that summer on lake michigan excursion boats he gigged around chicago until fall of 1923 at times returning to davenport to work for his father career wolverines thumb right wolverines with beiderbecke at doyle s academy of music in cincinnati ohio in 1924 beiderbecke joined wolverine orchestra late in 1923 and seven man group first played a speakeasy called stockton club near hamilton ohio

beiderbecke also took piano lessons from a young woman who introduced him to works of eastwood lane lane s piano suites and orchestral arrangements were self consciously american whilst also having french impressionist allusions and influenced beiderbecke s style especially on in a mist a subsequent gig at doyle s dance academy in cincinnati became occasion for a series of band and individual photographs that resulted in image of beiderbecke sitting fresh faced his hair perfectly combed and his cornet resting on his right knee lion p 60 on february 18 1924 wolverines made their first recordings two sides were waxed that day at gennett records studios in richmond indiana for more about gennett see kennedy fidgety feet written by nick larocca and larry shields from original dixieland jazz band and jazz me blues written by tom delaney beiderbecke s solo on latter heralded something new and significant in jazz according to biographers richard m sudhalter and philip r evans both qualities complementary or correlated phrasing and cultivation of vocal singing middle range of cornet are on display in bix s jazz me blues solo along with an already discernible inclination for unusual accidentals and inner chordal voices it is a pioneer record introducing a musician of great originality with a pace setting band and it astonished even wolverines themselves sudhalter and evans p 101 wolverines recorded 15 sides for gennett records between february and october 1924 titles revealed a strong and well formed cornet talent his lip had strengthened from earlier more tentative years on nine of wolverines recorded titles he proceeds from lead to opening solo without any need for a respite from playing fairweather p 127 in some respects beiderbecke s playing was sui generis cornetist rex stewart described his friend beiderbecke as playin stuff all his own didn t sound like louis armstrong or anybody else quoted in teachout homage to bix but he nevertheless listened to and learned from music around him from dixieland jazz as exemplified by original dixieland jazz band to hotter chicago style of new orleans rhythm kings and south side bands of joe king oliver and other black artists to classical compositions of claude debussy and maurice ravel lion p 78 79 louis armstrong also provided a source of inspiration though beiderbecke s style was very different from that of louis armstrong according to oxford companion to jazz where armstrong s playing was bravura regularly optimistic and openly emotional beiderbecke s conveyed a range of intellectual alternatives where armstrong at head of an ensemble played it hard straight and true beiderbecke like a shadowboxer invented his own way of phrasing around lead where armstrong s superior strength delighted in sheer power of what a cornet could produce beiderbecke s cool approach invited rather than commanded you to listen fairweather pp 124 125 armstrong tended to accentuate showmanship and virtuosity whereas beiderbecke emphasized melody even when improvising and rarely strayed into upper reaches of register kirk douglas character in young man with a horn is forever shooting for high notes i m gonna hit a note that nobody ever heard before he tells doris day s character paul mares of new orleans rhythm kings insisted that beiderbecke s chief influence was new orleans cornetist emmett hardy who died in 1925 at age of 23 sudhalter and evans p 119 indeed beiderbecke had met hardy and clarinetist leon roppolo in davenport in 1921 when two joined a local band and played in town for three months beiderbecke apparently spent time with them but it is difficult to discern degree to which hardy s style influenced beiderbecke s especially since there is no publicly known recording of a hardy performance sudhalter lost chords pp 52 56 beiderbecke certainly found a kindred musical spirit in hoagy carmichael whose amusingly unconventional personality he also appreciated two became firm friends a law student and aspiring pianist and songwriter carmichael invited wolverines to play at bloomington campus of indiana university in spring of 1924 on may 6 1924 wolverines recorded a tune carmichael had written especially for beiderbecke and his colleagues riverboat shuffle lion pp 69 72 goldkette during an engagement at cinderella ballroom in new york in september october 1924 bix tendered his resignation with wolverines beiderbecke s replacement in wolverines was 17 year old chicagoan jimmy mcpartland who emulated but generally did not copy beiderbecke s style during world war ii mcpartland married english pianist marian turner in germany marian mcpartland went on to become a jazz great in her own right leaving to join jean goldkette and his orchestra in detroit but beiderbecke s tenure with band proved to be short lived goldkette recorded for victor talking machine company whose musical director eddie king objected to beiderbecke s modernistic style of jazz playing sudhalter and evans p 188 moreover despite fact that beiderbecke s position within goldkette band was third trumpet a less taxing role than 1st or 2nd trumpet he struggled with complex ensemble passages due to his limited reading abilities after a few weeks beiderbecke and goldkette agreed to part company but to keep in touch with goldkette advising beiderbecke to brush up on his reading and learn more about music sudhalter and evans p 127 some six weeks after leaving band bix arranged a gennett recording session back in richmond with some of goldkette band members under name bix and his rhythm jugglers on january 26 1925 they set two tunes to wax toddlin blues another number by larocca and shields and beiderbecke s own composition davenport blues which subsequently became a classic jazz number recorded by musicians ranging from bunny to ry cooder and geoff muldaur lion pp 338 339 an arrangement of davenport blues as a piano solo was published by robbins music in 1927 in february 1925 beiderbecke enrolled at university of iowa in iowa city his stint in academia was even briefer than his time in detroit however when he attempted to pack his course schedule with music his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion ethics physical education and military training it was an institutional blunder that benny green described as being in retrospect comical fatuous and a parody green p 29 beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes and after he participated in a drunken incident in a local bar he was expelled sudhalter and evans pp 132 133 according to lion he was not expelled but quit pp 94 95 that summer he played with his friends don murray and howdy at a lake resort in michigan band was run by goldkette and it put beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before c melody saxophone player frankie trumbauer two hit it off both personally and musically despite trumbauer having been warned by other musicians look out he s trouble he drinks and you ll have a hard time handling him quotation from trumbauer s journal in lion p 101 they were inseparable for much of rest of beiderbecke s career with trumbauer acting as something of a guardian to beiderbecke brooks p 32 when trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at arcadia ballroom in st louis beiderbecke joined him there he also played alongside clarinetist pee wee russell who praised beiderbecke s ability to drive band he more or less made you play whether you wanted to or not russell said if you had any talent at all he made you play better lion p 104 in spring of 1926 bix and trumbauer joined goldkette s main dance band splitting year between playing a summer season at a goldkette owned resort on lake hudson indiana and headlining at detroit s graystone ballroom which was also owned by goldkette in october 1926 goldkette s famous fourteen as they came to be called opened at roseland ballroom in new york city opposite fletcher henderson orchestra one of east coast s outstanding african american big bands roseland promoted a battle of bands in local press and on october 12 after a night of furious playing goldkette s men were declared winners we were amazed angry morose and bewildered rex stewart fletcher s lead trumpeter said of listening to beiderbecke and his colleagues play he called experience most humiliating lion p 126 on october 15 1931 a few months after beiderbecke s death fletcher henderson orchestra recorded a version of singin blues that included rex stewart performing a nearly note for note homage to beiderbecke s most famous solo although goldkette orchestra recorded numerous sides for victor during this period none of them showcases beiderbecke s most famous solos band found itself subjected to commercial considerations of popular music sector that victor deliberately targeted band s recordings at few exceptions to policy include my pretty girl and clementine latter being one of band s final recordings and its effective swan song in addition to these commercial sessions with goldkette beiderbecke and trumbauer also recorded under their own names for okeh label bix waxed some of his best solos as a member of trumbauer s recording band starting with clarinet marmalade and singin blues recorded on february 4 1927 again with trumbauer beiderbecke re recorded carmichael s riverboat shuffle in may and delivered two further seminal solos a few days later on i m coming virginia and way down yonder in new orleans beiderbecke earned co writing credit with trumbauer on for no reason at all in c recorded under name tram bix and eddie in their three piece band beiderbecke switched between cornet and piano on that number and then in september played only piano for his recording of in a mist this was perhaps most fruitful year of his short career under financial pressure goldkette folded his premier band in september 1927 in new york organizations like one run by jean goldkette often operated multiple bands during summer of 1926 for instance goldkette split his personnel into two bands with beiderbecke trumbauer and company playing hudson lake goldkette also managed all african american mckinney s cotton pickers a band that at one time or another featured doc cheatham benny carter don redman rex stewart fats waller and james p johnson paul whiteman hoped to snatch up goldkette s best musicians for his traveling orchestra but beiderbecke trumbauer murray bill rank chauncey morehouse and frank signorelli instead joined bass saxophone player adrian rollini at club new yorker band also included guitarist eddie lang and violinist joe venuti who had often recorded on a freelance basis with goldkette orchestra another newcomer was sylvester ahola a schooled trumpeter who could play improvised jazz solos and read complex scores when ahola introduced himself beiderbecke famously stated hell i m only a musical degenerate sudhalter and evans p 211 when that job ended sooner than expected in october 1927 beiderbecke and trumbauer signed on with whiteman they joined his orchestra in indianapolis on october 27 lion pp 154 163 whiteman paul whiteman orchestra was most popular and highest paid dance band of day in spite of whiteman s appellation king of jazz his band was not a jazz ensemble as such but a popular music outfit that drew from both jazz and classical music repertoires according to demands of its record buying and concert going audience whiteman was perhaps best known for having premiered george gershwin s rhapsody in blue in new york in 1924 and orchestrator of that piece ferde grofe continued to be an important part of band throughout 1920s whiteman was large physically and important culturally a man flabby virile quick coarse untidy and sleek with a hard core of shrewdness in an envelope of sentimentalism according to a 1926 new yorker profile quoted in sudhalter lost chords p 423 a number of beiderbecke partisans have criticised whiteman for not giving bix opportunities he deserved as a jazz musician sudhalter in lost chords writes of whiteman as having been cast a villain in beiderbecke story pp 423 424 james pp 18 19 complains that after beiderbecke joined band whiteman moved farther and farther away from easy going rhythmically inclined style of his earlier days becoming more subservient to his business sense he goes on to suggest that this artistically compromised beiderbecke in part causing his death p 77 benny green in particular derided whiteman for being a mere mediocre vaudeville act and suggesting that today we only tolerate horrors of whiteman s recordings at all in hope that here and there a fragment will redeem mess green p 38 also quoted in sudhalter lost chords p 423 richard sudhalter has responded by suggesting that beiderbecke saw whiteman band as an opportunity to pursue musical ambitions that did not stop at jazz colleagues have testified that far from feeling bound or stifled by whiteman orchestra as green and others have suggested bix often felt a sense of exhilaration it was like attending a music school learning and broadening formal music especially synthesis of american vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation so much sought after in 1920s were calling out to him sudhalter lost chords p 423 beiderbecke is featured on a number of whiteman recordings including from monday on back in your own back yard you took advantage of me sugar changes and when these feature specially written arrangements that emphasize beiderbecke s improvisational skills bill challis an arranger who had also worked in this capacity for jean goldkette was particularly sympathetic in writing scores with beiderbecke in mind sometimes arranging entire ensemble passages based on solos that bix played sudhalter and evans p 235 beiderbecke also played on several notable hit records recorded by whiteman such as together ramona and ol man river latter featuring bing crosby on vocals heavy touring and recording schedule with whiteman s orchestra may have exacerbated beiderbecke s long term alcoholism though this is a contentious point whiteman s violinist matty said work was so hard you almost had to drink bix ain t none of them play like him yet 1981 film documentary directed and produced by brigitte berman adding he didn t get to play things he loved with whiteman band because we were a symphonic band and we played same thing every night and it got to be tiresome on november 30 1928 whilst on tour in cleveland beiderbecke suffered what lion terms a severe nervous crisis and sudhalter and evans suggest was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens presumably triggered by beiderbecke s attempt to curb his alcohol intake lion p 203 sudhalter and evans p 264 he cracked up that s all trombonist bill rank said just went to pieces broke up a roomful of furniture in hotel sudhalter and evans p 264 in february 1929 beiderbecke returned home to davenport to convalesce and was hailed by local press as world s hottest cornetist bix beiderbecke in davenport sunday democrat february 10 1929 see lion p 209 he then spent summer with whiteman s band in hollywood in preparation for shooting of a new talking picture king of jazz production delays prevented any real work from being done on film leaving beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily by september he was back in davenport where his parents helped him to seek treatment he spent a month from october 14 until november 18 at keeley institute in dwight illinois lion pp 230 234 according to lion an examination by keeley physicians confirmed damaging effects of bix s long term reliance on alcohol bix admitted to having used liquor in excess for past nine years his daily dose over last three years amounting to three pints of whiskey and twenty cigarettes a hepatic dullness was obvious knee jerk could not be obtained which confirmed spread of polyneuritis and bix was swaying in romberg position standing up with his eyes closed lion p 233 while he was away whiteman famously kept his chair open in beiderbecke s honor in hope that he would occupy it again however when he returned to new york at end of january 1930 beiderbecke did not rejoin whiteman and performed only sparingly on his last recording session in new york on september 15 1930 beiderbecke played on original recording of hoagy carmichael s new song georgia on my mind with carmichael doing vocals eddie lang on guitar joe venuti on violin jimmy dorsey on clarinet and alto saxophone jack teagarden on trombone and bud freeman on tenor saxophone song would go on to become a jazz and popular music standard in 2014 1930 recording of georgia on my mind was inducted into grammy hall of fame beiderbecke s playing had an influence on carmichael as a composer one of his compositions stardust was inspired by beiderbecke s improvisations with a cornet phrase reworked by carmichael into song s central theme sudhalter stardust melody pp 108 110 in his carmichael biography sudhalter actually charts similarities between recorded beiderbecke solos in singin blues jazz me blues and star dust writing high spot of star dust s first recorded performance is hoagy s own full chorus piano solo its chordal devices clearly echoing bix s fascination with impressionists and such moderns as igor stravinsky and his admiration for now almost forgotten american composer eastwood lane p 110 bing crosby who sang with whiteman also cited beiderbecke as an important influence bix and all rest would play and exchange ideas on piano he said with all noise of a new york pub going on i don t know how they heard themselves but they did i didn t contribute anything but i listened and learned i was now being influenced by these musicians particularly horn men i could hum and sing all of jazz choruses from recordings made by bix phil napoleon and rest lion p 177 following wall street crash of 1929 once booming music industry contracted and work became more difficult to find for a while beiderbecke s only regular income came from his work as a member of nat s orchestra on camel pleasure hour nbc radio show however during a live broadcast on october 8 1930 beiderbecke s seemingly limitless gift for improvisation finally failed him he stood up to take his solo but his mind went blank and nothing happened recalled a fellow musician frankie cush lion p 256 cornetist spent rest of year at home in davenport and

to be taken home to davenport he was buried there on august 11 1931 in family plot at oakdale cemetery evans and evans p 549 legend and legacy critical analysis of beiderbecke s work during his lifetime was sparse surprisingly his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among european critics than those in country of his birth british music trade magazine melody maker published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing in april 1927 issue bandleader fred elizalde stated bix sic is considered by red nichols himself and every other trumpet player in states for that matter as greatest trumpet player of all time magazine s editor edgar jackson was equally fulsome in his praise bix has a heart as big as your head which shines through his playing with warmth of sun s rays september 1927 issue next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by bix and if this doesn t get you right in heart you d better see a vet lion p xiv at time of his death beiderbecke was still little known by public at large though his appreciation among fellow musicians and collegiate set is indicated by contemporary news reports to a large circle of those boys and girls of high school and college age whom a staid world likes to label jazz mad generation news that leon bix beiderbecke is dead will mean something however lacking in significance it might be to their critical elders bixie was a symbol of that jazz generation expressing its wistful restless temperament through medium of unconventional dance music which constitutes its theme song in his mind were conceived wild strange contortions of rhythm and harmony which established basic motif of popular music of a year ago to most youngsters in college however weird flourishes that bixie s fingers executed on trumpet and piano were expressive they could hear lilting melody of youth that formed a smooth background for his fantastic caricatures in sound hundreds of young collegians who couldn t recall a strain of beethoven or wagner could whistle bix beiderbecke choruses in world of professional popular music bixie was an artist comparable to kreisler in field of conventional music paul whiteman called him finest trumpet player in country perhaps bixie s death at age of twenty eight also is symbolical of futility of jazz mad generation s quest for self expression however that may be if it is true as some critics contend that jazz music is establishing foundations on which a distinctive and thoroughly legitimate american music eventually will be built bix beiderbecke has left his mark on future culture of nation cedar rapids evening gazette and republican august 11 1931 cited in bixography forum one of first serious analytical obituaries to have been published in months after his death was by french jazz writer hugues notice appeared in october 1931 blumenthal p 99 new republic critic otis ferguson wrote two short articles for magazine young man with a horn july 29 1936 and young man with a horn again november 18 1940 that worked to revive interest not only in beiderbecke s music but also in his biography beiderbecke lived very briefly in what might be called servants entrance to art ferguson wrote his story is a good story quite humble and right ferguson p 19 romantic notion of short lived doomed jazz genius can be traced back at least as far as beiderbecke and lived on in glenn miller charlie parker billie holiday jaco pastorius and many more ferguson s sense of what was right became basis for beiderbecke romantic legend which has traditionally emphasized musician s iowa roots his often careless dress his difficulty sight reading purity of his tone his drinking and his early death these themes were repeated by beiderbecke s friends in various memoirs including stardust road 1946 and sometimes i wonder 1965 by hoagy carmichael really blues 1946 by mezz mezzrow and we called it music 1947 by eddie condon beiderbecke was

beiderbecke s life fairly closely focusing on his summer in hollywood and featuring appearances by al capone and clara bow critic and musician digby fairweather sums up beiderbecke s musical legacy arguing that with louis armstrong bix beiderbecke was most striking of jazz s cornet and of course trumpet fathers a player who first captivated his 1920s generation and after his premature death founded a dynasty of distinguished followers beginning with jimmy mcpartland and moving on down from there fairweather p 122 music style and influence in new orleans jazz had traditionally been expressed through polyphonic ensemble playing with various instruments weaving their parts into a single and coherent aural tapestry by early 1920s developments in jazz saw rise of jazz soloist with solos becoming longer and more complex both beiderbecke and armstrong were key figures in this evolution as can be heard on their earliest recordings according to critic terry teachout they are two most influential figures in early history of jazz and twin lines of descent from which most of today s jazz can be traced teachout homage to bix p 65 see also teachout pops beiderbecke s cornet style is often described by contrasting it with armstrong s markedly different approach teachout in homage to bix for instance contrasts beiderbecke s and armstrong s personalities styles and approach historians have taken to their stories beiderbecke s style which was all but fully formed when he made his first recordings was completely different from that of new orleans born cornet and trumpet players who preceded him armstrong included teachout writes unlike them he played with precise at times almost fussy articulation and a rounded chime like tone sticking mostly to middle register and avoiding interpolated high notes that became an armstrong trademark armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument and his solos often took advantage of that fact beiderbecke was largely although not completely self taught and constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music while armstrong often soared into upper register beiderbecke stayed in middle range more interested in exploring melody and harmonies than in dazzling audience armstrong often emphasized performance aspect of his playing while beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing uninterested in personally engaging his listeners evans and evans p xxii armstrong was deeply influenced by blues while beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as debussy and ravel as by his fellow jazzmen for blues influence on armstrong see brothers especially chapter 7 ragtime and buddy bolden pp 132 163 for bix s listening see lion pp 78 79 beiderbecke s most famous solo was on singin blues recorded february 4 1927 it has been hailed as an important example of jazz ballad style a slow or medium tempo piece played gently and sweetly but not cloyingly with no loss of muscle sudhalter and evans p 196 tune s laid back emotions hinted at what would become in 1950s cool jazz style personified by chet baker and bill evans more than that though singin blues has been noted for way its improvisations feel less improvised than composed with each phrase building on last in a logical fashion benny green describes solo s effect on practiced ears when a musician hears bix s solo on singing blues he becomes aware after two bars that soloist knows exactly what he is doing and that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution he knows also that this player is endowed with rarest jazz gift of all a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce listening musician whatever his generation or his style recognizes bix as a modern modernism being not a style but an attitude green p 34 like green who made particular mention of beiderbecke s amount of teaching jazz historian ted gioia also has emphasized beiderbecke s lack of formal instruction suggesting that it caused him to adopt an unusual dry embouchure and unconventional fingerings which he retained for rest of his life gioia points to a characteristic streak of obstinacy in beiderbecke that provokes this chronic disregard of tried and true he argues that this stubbornness was behind beiderbecke s decision not to switch from cornet to trumpet when many other musicians including armstrong did so gioia history of jazz pp 71 72 in addition gioia highlights beiderbecke s precise timing relaxed delivery and pure tone which contrasted with dirty rough edged sound of king oliver and his protege armstrong whose playing was often more energetic and whose style held more sway early in 1920s than beiderbecke s beiderbecke s playing both as a cornetist and a pianist had a profound effect on a number of his contemporaries eddie condon for instance described beiderbecke s cornet playing as like a girl saying yes and also wrote of being amazed by beiderbecke s piano playing all my life i had been listening to music but i had never heard anything remotely like what beiderbecke played for first time i realized music isn t all same it had become an entirely new set of sounds condon p 84 quoted in berton p 89 i tried to explain bix to gang hoagy carmichael wrote but i t was no good like telling of a vivid personal dream emotion couldn t be transmitted carmichael sometimes i wonder p 110 quoted in berton p 91 mezz mezzrow described beiderbecke s tone as being pickled in alcohol i have never heard a tone like he got before or since he played mostly open horn every note full big rich and round standing out like a pearl loud but never irritating or jangling with a powerful drive that few white musicians had in those days mezzrow p 80 quoted in gioia history of jazz p 73 some critics have highlighted jazz me blues recorded with wolverines on february 18 1924 as being particularly important to understanding beiderbecke s style although it was one of his earliest recordings hallmarks of his playing are evident overall impression we get from this solo as in all of bix at his best writes trumpeter randy is that every note is spontaneous yet inevitable quote in lion p 65 richard hadlock describes beiderbecke s contribution to jazz me blues as an ordered solo that seems more inspired by clarinetists larry shields of and leon roppolo of than by other trumpet players hadlock p 81 he goes on to suggest that clarinetists by virtue of their not being tied to melody as much as cornetists and trumpet players could explore harmonies jazz me blues was also important because it introduced what has been called correlated chorus a method of improvising that beiderbecke s davenport friend esten spurrier attributed to both beiderbecke and armstrong louis departed greatly from all cornet players in his ability to compose a close knit individual 32 measures with all phrases compatible with each other spurrier told biographers sudhalter and evans so bix and i always credited louis as being father of correlated chorus play two measures then two related making four measures on which you played another four measures related to first four and so on ad infinitum to end of chorus so secret was simple a series of related phrases sudhalter and evans pp 100 101 beiderbecke plays piano on his recordings big boy october 8 1924 for no reason at all in c may 13 1927 wringin and twistin september 17 1927 all with ensembles and his only solo recorded work in a mist september 8 1927 critic frank murphy argues that many of same characteristics that mark beiderbecke on cornet are also reflected in his piano playing uncharacteristic fingering emphasis on inventive harmonies and correlated choruses lion p 156 those inventive harmonies on both cornet and piano pointed way to future developments in jazz particularly bebop which abandoned melody almost entirely williams p 136 compositions bix beiderbecke wrote or
