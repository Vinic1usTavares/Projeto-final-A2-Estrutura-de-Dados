ankylosaurus is a genus of armored dinosaur its fossils have been found in geological formations dating to very end of cretaceous period about 68 66 million years ago in western north america making it among last of non avian dinosaurs it was named by barnum brown in 1908 only species in genus is a magniventris genus name means fused lizard and specific name means great belly a handful of specimens have been excavated to date but a complete skeleton has not been discovered though other members of ankylosauria are represented by more extensive fossil material ankylosaurus is often considered archetypal member of its group despite having some unusual features possibly largest known ankylosaurid ankylosaurus is estimated to have been between long and to have weighed between it was quadrupedal with a broad robust body it had a wide low skull with two horns pointing backward from back of head and two horns below these that pointed backward and down unlike other ankylosaurs its nostrils faced sideways rather than towards front front part of jaws was covered in a beak with rows of small leaf shaped teeth farther behind it it was covered in armor plates or osteoderms with bony half rings covering neck and had a large club on end of its tail bones in skull and other parts of body were fused increasing their strength and this feature is source of genus name ankylosaurus is a member of family ankylosauridae and its closest relatives appear to be anodontosaurus and euoplocephalus ankylosaurus is thought to have been a slow moving animal able to make quick movements when necessary its broad muzzle indicates it was a non selective browser sinuses and nasal chambers in snout may have been for heat and water balance or may have played a role in vocalization tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat ankylosaurus has been found in hell creek lance scollard frenchman and ferris formations but appears to have been rare in its environment although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped and ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as tyrannosaurus triceratops and edmontosaurus description thumb left alt outline of human superimposed on outline of ankylosaurus size of largest known specimen green compared to a human ankylosaurus was largest known dinosaur and possibly largest ankylosaurid in 2004 american paleontologist kenneth carpenter estimated that individual with largest known skull specimen cmn 8880 which is long and wide was about long and had a hip height of about smallest known skull specimen amnh 5214 is long and wide and carpenter estimated that it measured about long and about tall at hips in 2017 based on comparisons with more complete ankylosaurines canadian paleontologists victoria arbour and jordan mallon estimated a length of for cmn 8880 and for amnh 5214 though latter is smallest specimen of ankylosaurus its skull is still larger than those of any other ankylosaurins a few other ankylosaurs reached about in length because vertebrae of amnh 5214 are not significantly larger than those of other ankylosaurines arbour and mallon considered their upper range estimate of nearly for large ankylosaurus too long and suggested a length of instead arbour and mallon estimated a weight of for amnh 5214 and tentatively estimated weight of cmn 8880 at benson and colleagues also estimated weight for animal of amnh 5214 at in 2014 thumb alt image of restored specimen of a squat quadruped with knobby back life restoration structure of much of skeleton of ankylosaurus including most of pelvis tail and feet is still unknown it was quadrupedal and its hind limbs were longer than its forelimbs in specimen amnh 5895 scapula shoulder blade measures long and was fused with coracoid a rectangular bone connected to lower end of scapula it also had entheses connective tissue for various muscle attachments humerus upper arm bone of amnh 5214 was short very broad and about long femur thigh bone also from amnh 5214 was long and very robust while feet of ankylosaurus are incompletely known hindfeet probably had three toes as is case in advanced ankylosaurids cervical vertebrae of neck had broad neural spines that increased in height towards body front part of neural spines had well developed entheses which was common among adult dinosaurs and indicates presence of large ligaments which helped support massive head dorsal vertebrae of back had centra or bodies that were short relative to their width and their neural spines were short and narrow dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced which limited downwards movement of back neural spines had ossified turned to bone tendons which also overlapped some of vertebrae ribs of last four back vertebrae were fused to them and ribcage was very broad in this part of body ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them caudal vertebrae of tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous meaning they were concave on both sides skull thumb upright alt two views of ankylosaurus skull from above and from left skull amnh 5214 from side and above three known ankylosaurus skulls differ in various details this is thought to be result of taphonomy changes happening during decay and fossilization of remains and individual variation skull was low and triangular in shape and wider than it was long back of skull was broad and low skull had a broad beak on premaxillae orbits eye sockets were almost round to slightly oval and did not face directly sideways because skull tapered towards front braincase was short and robust as in other ankylosaurines crests above orbits merged into upper squamosal horns their shape has been described as pyramidal which pointed backwards to sides from back of skull crest and horn were probably separate elements originally as seen in related pinacosaurus and euoplocephalus below upper horns jugal horns were present which pointed backward and down horns may have originally been osteoderms armor plates that fused to skull scale like pattern on skull surface called caputegulae in ankylosaurs was result of remodeling of skull itself this obliterated sutures between skull elements which is common for adult ankylosaurs scale pattern of skull was variable between specimens though some details are shared ankylosaurus had a diamond shaped or hexagonal scale at front of snout between nostrils two squamosal osteoderms above orbit and a ridge of scales at back of skull thumb left upright tooth of amnh 5895 in inside and outside view snout region of ankylosaurus was unique among ankylosaurs and had undergone an extreme transformation compared to its relatives snout was arched and truncated at front and nostrils were elliptical and were directed downward and outward unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward additionally nostrils were not visible from front because sinuses were expanded to sides of premaxilla bone to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs large caputegulae strap like side osteoderms of snout completely roofed enlarged opening of nostrils giving a bulbous appearance nostrils also had an septum which separated nasal passage from sinus each side of snout had five sinuses four of which expanded into maxilla bone nasal cavities or chambers of ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at midline which divided inside of snout into two mirrored halves septum had two openings including internal nostrils maxillae expanded to sides giving impression of a bulge which may have been due to sinuses inside maxillae had a ridge that may have been attachment site for fleshy cheeks presence of cheeks in ornithischians is controversial but some nodosaurid ankylosaurs had armor plates that covered cheek region which may have been embedded in flesh specimen amnh 5214 has 34 35 dental alveoli tooth sockets in maxilla and has more teeth than any other known ankylosaurid tooth rows in maxillae of this specimen are about long each alveolus had a foramen opening near its side where a replacement tooth could be seen compared to other ankylosaurs mandible of ankylosaurus was low in proportion to its length and when seen from side tooth row was almost straight instead of arched mandibles are completely preserved only in smallest specimen amnh 5214 and are about long incomplete mandible of largest specimen cmn 8880 is same length amnh 5214 has 35 dental alveoli in left dentary and 36 in right for a total of 71 highest number known for any ankylosaurid predentary bone of tip of mandibles has not yet been found tooth row was relatively short like other ankylosaurs ankylosaurus had small leaf shaped teeth which were compressed sideways teeth were mostly taller than they were wide and were very small their size in proportion to skull meant that jaws could accommodate more teeth than other ankylosaurines teeth of largest ankylosaurus skull are smaller than those of smallest skull in absolute sense some teeth from behind in tooth row curved backwards and tooth crowns were usually flatter on one side than other ankylosaurus teeth are diagnostic and can be distinguished from teeth of other ankylosaurids based on their smooth sides denticles were large their number ranging from six to eight on front part of tooth and five to seven behind armor thumb arrangement of armor as suggested by arbour and mallon 2017 a prominent feature of ankylosaurus was its armor consisting of knobs and plates of bone known as osteoderms or scutes embedded in skin these have not been found in articulation so their exact placement on body is unknown though inferences can be made based on related animals and various configurations have been proposed osteoderms ranged from in diameter to in length and varied in shape osteoderms of ankylosaurus were generally thin walled and hollowed on underside compared to euoplocephalus osteoderms of ankylosaurus were smoother small osteoderms and ossicles probably occupied space between larger ones osteoderms covering body were very flat though with a low keel at one margin in contrast nodosaurid edmontonia had high keels stretching from one margin to other on midline of its osteoderms ankylosaurus had some smaller osteoderms with a keel across midline left thumb upright alt armor cervical half ring from neck of euoplocephalus a b compared with half ring fragments c j of ankylosaurus amnh 5895 and possible back osteoderms k l like other ankylosaurids ankylosaurus had cervical half rings armor plates on neck but these are known only from fragments making their exact arrangement uncertain carpenter suggested that when seen from above plates would have been paired creating an inverted v shape across neck with midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles round bony scutes to allow for movement he believed width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on neck and that it covered base of neck and continued onto shoulder region arbour and philip j currie disagreed with carpenter s interpretation in 2015 and pointed out that cervical half ring fragments of specimen amnh 5895 did not fit together in way proposed by carpenter though this could be due to breakage they instead suggested that fragments represented remains of two cervical half rings which formed two semi circular plates of armor around upper part of neck as in closely related anodontosaurus and euoplocephalus arbour and mallon elaborated on this idea describing shape of these half rings as continuous u shaped yokes over upper part of neck and suggested that ankylosaurus had six keeled osteoderms with oval bases on each half ring other ankylosaurids often have many smaller osteoderms surrounding these larger ones first osteoderms behind second cervical half ring would have been similar in shape to those in half ring and osteoderms on back probably decreased in diameter hindwards largest osteoderms were probably arranged in transverse and longitudinal rows across most of body with four or five transverse rows separated by creases in skin osteoderms on flanks would probably have had a more square outline than those on back there may have been four longitudinal rows of osteoderms on flanks unlike some basal ankylosaurs and many nodosaurs ankylosaurids do not appear to have had co ossified pelvic shields above their hips some osteoderms without keels may have been placed above hip region of ankylosaurus as in euoplocephalus ankylosaurus may have had three or four transverse rows of circular osteoderms over pelvic region which were smaller than those on rest of body as in scolosaurus smaller triangular osteoderms may have been present on sides of pelvis flattened pointed plates resemble those on sides of tail of osteoderms with oval keels could have been placed on upper side of tail or side of limbs compressed triangular osteoderms found with ankylosaurus specimens may have been placed on sides of pelvis or tail ovoid keeled and teardrop shaped osteoderms are known from ankylosaurus and may have been placed on forelimbs like those known from pinacosaurus but it is unknown whether hindlimbs bore osteoderms thumb alt fossilized tail club black in coloring only known tail club amnh 5214 american museum of natural history tail club or tail knob of ankylosaurus was composed of two large osteoderms with a row of small osteoderms at midline and two small osteoderms at tip these osteoderms obscured last tail vertebra as only tail club of specimen amnh 5214 is known range of variation between individuals is unknown tail club of amnh 5214 is long wide and tall club of largest specimen may have been wide tail club of ankylosaurus was semicircular when seen from above similar to those of euoplocephalus and scolosaurus but unlike pointed club osteoderms of anodontosaurus or narrow elongated club of dyoplosaurus last seven tail vertebrae formed handle of tail club these vertebrae were in contact with no cartilage between them and were sometimes co ossified which made them immobile ossified tendons attached to vertebrae in front of tail club and these features together helped strengthen it interlocked zygapophyses articular processes and neural spines of handle vertebrae were u shaped when seen from above whereas those of most other ankylosaurids are v shaped which may be due to handle of ankylosaurus being wider larger width may indicate that tail of ankylosaurus was shorter in relation to its body length than those of other ankylosaurids or that it had same proportions but with a smaller club history of discovery thumb left alt photograph of dorsal view of fossilized skull next to sketch of same skull of holotype amnh 5895 and reconstruction

brown s stegosaur like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs a strongly arched back a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from ilium and pubis as well as a short drooping tail without a tail club which was unknown at time brown also reconstructed armor plates in parallel rows running down back this arrangement was purely hypothetical brown s reconstruction became highly influential and restorations of animal based on his diagram were published as late as 1980s in a 1908 review of brown s ankylosaurus description american paleontologist samuel wendell williston criticised skeletal reconstruction as being based on too few remains and claimed that ankylosaurus was merely a synonym of genus which williston had named in 1905 williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of related polacanthus by hungarian paleontologist franz nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers and two genera are now considered distinct brown had collected 77 osteoderms while excavating a tyrannosaurus specimen in lance formation of wyoming in 1900 he mentioned these osteoderms specimen amnh in his description of ankylosaurus but thought they belonged to tyrannosaurus instead paleontologist henry fairfield osborn also expressed this view when he described tyrannosaurus specimen as now invalid genus dynamosaurus in 1905 more recent examination has shown them to be similar to those of ankylosaurus it seems that brown had compared them with some euoplocephalus osteoderms which had been erroneously cataloged as belonging to ankylosaurus at amnh thumb left alt photograph in black and white of rugged fissured cliff face excavation of amnh 5214 center above pick 1910 in 1910 another amnh expedition led by brown discovered an ankylosaurus specimen amnh 5214 in scollard formation by red deer river in alberta canada this specimen included a complete skull mandibles first and only tail club known of this genus as well as ribs vertebrae limb bones and armor in 1947 fossil collectors charles m sternberg and t potter collected a skull and mandible specimen cmn 8880 formerly nmc 8880 a kilometer 0 6 mile north of where 1910 specimen was found this is largest known ankylosaurus skull but it is damaged in places a section of caudal vertebrae specimen ccm was discovered in 1960s in powder river drainage montana part of hell creek formation in addition to these five incomplete specimens many other isolated osteoderms and teeth have been found in 1990 american paleontologist walter p coombs pointed out that teeth of two skulls assigned to a magniventris differed from those of holotype specimen in some details and though he expressed a considerate temptation to name a new species of ankylosaurus for these he refrained from doing so as range of variation in species was not completely documented he also raised possibility that two teeth associated with holotype specimen perhaps did not belong to it as they were found in matrix within nasal chambers carpenter accepted teeth as belonging to a magniventris and that all specimens belonged to same species noting that teeth of other ankylosaurs are highly variable thumb alt photograph of a dinosaur diorama replica of 1964 world s fair ankylosaurus note spikes and dragging tail royal alberta museum most of known ankylosaurus specimens were not scientifically described at length though several paleontologists planned to do so until carpenter redescribed genus in 2004 carpenter noted that ankylosaurus has become archetypal member of its group and best known ankylosaur in popular culture perhaps due to a life sized reconstruction of animal being featured at 1964 world s fair in new york city that sculpture as well as american artist rudolph zallinger s 1947 mural age of reptiles and other later popular depictions showed ankylosaurus with a tail club following first discovery of this feature in 1910 in spite of its familiarity it is known from far fewer remains than its closest relatives in 2017 arbour and mallon redescribed genus in light of newer ankylosaur discoveries including elements of holotype that had not been previously mentioned in literature such as parts of skull and cervical half rings they concluded that though ankylosaurus is iconic and best known member of its group it was bizarre in comparison to related ankylosaurs and therefore not representative of group many traditional popular depictions show ankylosaurus in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over ground modern reconstructions show animal with a more upright limb posture and with tail held off ground likewise large spines projecting sideways from body similar to those of nodosaurs are present in many traditional depictions but are not known from ankylosaurus itself armor of ankylosaurus has often been conflated with that of edmontonia earlier referred to as palaeoscincus in addition to ankylosaurus being depicted with spikes edmontonia has also been depicted with an ankylosaurus like tail club a feature nodosaurids did not have including in a mural by american artist charles r knight from 1930 classification thumb left alt two fossilized knobs of bone black with white streaks possible back osteoderm amnh 5895 in outer and inner view brown considered ankylosaurus so distinct that he made it type genus of a new family ankylosauridae typified by massive triangular skulls short necks stiff backs broad bodies and osteoderms he also classified palaeoscincus only known from teeth and euoplocephalus then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms as part of family due to fragmentary condition of remains brown was unable to fully distinguish between euoplocephalus and ankylosaurus having for comparison only a few incomplete members of family he believed group was part of suborder stegosauria in 1923 osborn coined name ankylosauria thereby placing ankylosaurids in their own suborder ankylosauria and stegosauria are now grouped together within clade thyreophora this group first appeared in sinemurian age and survived for 135 million years until disappearing in maastrichtian they were widespread and inhabited a broad range of environments as more complete specimens and new genera have been discovered theories about ankylosaurian interrelatedness have become more complex and hypotheses have often changed between studies in addition to ankylosauridae ankylosauria has been divided into families and sometimes these families lacked tail clubs ankylosaurus is considered part of subfamily ankylosaurinae members of which are called ankylosaurines within ankylosauridae ankylosaurus appears to be most closely related to anodontosaurus and euoplocephalus following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of ankylosaurinae conducted by arbour and currie thumb skulls of ankylosaurus bottom two compared with those of other ankylosaurins with color coded cranial ornamentation and scale bar since ankylosaurus and other late cretaceous north american ankylosaurids grouped with asian genera in a tribe authors named arbour and currie suggested that earlier north american ankylosaurids had gone extinct by late albian or cenomanian ages of middle cretaceous ankylosaurids thereafter recolonized north america from asia during campanian or turonian ages of late cretaceous and there diversified again leading to genera such as ankylosaurus anodontosaurus and euoplocephalus this explains a 30 million year gap in fossil record of north american ankylosaurids between these ages paleobiology feeding thumb skull of specimen cmn 8880 largest known ankylosaurid including lower jaw e f and tooth g like other ornithischians ankylosaurus was herbivorous its wide muzzle was adapted for non selective low browse cropping although not to extent seen in some related genera especially euoplocephalus though ankylosaurs may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants they may have had a varied diet including tough leaves and pulpy fruits ankylosaurus probably fed on abundant ferns and low growing shrubs assuming it was endothermic ankylosaurus would have eaten of ferns per day similar to amount of dry vegetation a large elephant would consume requirements for nutrition could have been more effectively met if ankylosaurus ate fruit which its small cusp like teeth and shape of its beak seem well adapted for compared to for example euoplocephalus certain invertebrates which small teeth may have been adapted for handling could also have provided supplemental nutrition fossils of ankylosaurus teeth exhibit wear on face of crown rather than on tip of crown as in nodosaurid ankylosaurs in 1982 carpenter ascribed to baby ankylosaurus two very small teeth that originate from lance and hell creek formations and measure in length respectively smaller tooth is heavily worn leading carpenter to suggest that ankylosaurids in general or at least young did not swallow their food whole but employed some sort of chewing since adult ankylosaurus did little chewing of its food it would have spent less time in day foraging than an elephant based on broadness of ribcage digestion of unchewed food may have been facilitated by hindgut fermentation like in modern herbivorous lizards which have several chambers in their enlarged colon thumb left back vertebra with fused ribs of amnh 5895 broad body housed a large digestion system in 1969 austrian paleontologist georg haas concluded that despite large size of ankylosaur skulls associated musculature was relatively weak he also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements extrapolating from this haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non abrasive vegetation later research on euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals skull being able to withstand considerable forces a 2016 study of dental occlusion contact between teeth of ankylosaur specimens found that ability for backwards palinal jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur lineages including late cretaceous north american ankylosaurids like ankylosaurus and euoplocephalus a specimen of ankylosaur pinacosaurus preserves large triangular bones or cartilages located in tongue that show signs of muscular stress and it is thought this was a common feature of ankylosaurs researchers who examined specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and tongue bones when feeding since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones and use prehensile tongues to pick up food retracted position of nostrils of ankylosaurus have been compared to those of fossorial digging worm lizards and blind snakes and though it was probably not a burrowing animal snout of ankylosaurus may indicate earth moving behavior these factors as well as low rate of tooth formation in ankylosaurs compared to other ornithischians indicate that ankylosaurus may have been omnivorous eating both plant and animal matter it may also or alternatively have dug in ground for roots and tubers airspaces and senses thumb alt diagram of internal chambers of a skull diagram showing nasal chambers inside snout amnh 5895 in 1977 polish paleontologist teresa maryanska proposed that complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened weight of skull housed a nasal gland or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance carpenter rejected these hypotheses arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through larynx not nostrils and that reduction in weight was minimal as spaces only accounted for a small percent of skull volume he also considered a gland unlikely and noted that sinuses may not have had any specific function it has also been suggested that respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal like treatment of inhaled air based on presence and arrangement of specialized bones a 2011 study of nasal passages of euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system noting extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for mucosa membrane used for heat and water exchange in modern animals researchers also supported idea of loops acting as a resonance chamber comparable to elongated nasal passages of antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans reconstructions of inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies such as low toned resonant sounds possibly produced by nasal passages they disputed possibility that looping is related to olfaction sense of smell as olfactory region is pushed to sides of main airway shape of nasal chambers of ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional looping through lungs during inhalation and exhalation although it may also have been bidirectional in posterior nasal chamber with air directed past olfactory lobes enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well developed sense of smell though hindwards retraction of nostrils is seen in aquatic animals and animals with a proboscis it is unlikely either possibility applies to ankylosaurus as nostrils tend to be reduced or premaxilla extended in addition though widely separated nostrils may have allowed for stereo olfaction where each nostril senses smells from different directions as has been proposed for moose little is known about this feature position of orbits of ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision limb movements thumb shoulder blade and coracoid of specimen amnh 5895 reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb musculature made by coombs in 1978 suggest that forelimbs bore majority of animal s weight and were adapted for high force delivery on front feet possibly for food gathering in addition coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers though hoof like structure of manus would have limited fossorial activity ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow moving and sluggish animals though they may have been capable of quick movements when necessary growth squamosal horns of largest ankylosaurus specimen are blunter than those of smallest specimen which is also case in euoplocephalus and this may represent ontogenetic variation related to growth development studies of specimens of pinacosaurus of different ages found that during ontogenetic development ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae forelimbs strongly increased in robustness while hindlimbs did not become larger relative to rest of skeleton further evidence that arms bore most of weight in cervical half rings underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with underlying osteoderms which simultaneously fused to each other on skull middle bone plates first ossified at snout and rear rim with ossification gradually extending towards middle regions on rest of body ossification progressed from neck backward in direction of tail defense thumb left alt semi posterior view of ankylosaurus with tail club prominent depiction of ankylosaurus displaying its tail club osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in comparison to those of other ankylosaurs and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed cushions of collagen fibers structurally similar to sharpey s fibres they were embedded directly into bone tissue a feature unique to ankylosaurids this would have provided ankylosaurids with an armor covering that was both lightweight and highly durable being resistant to breakage and penetration by teeth of predators palpebral bones over eyes may have provided additional protection for them carpenter suggested in 1982 that heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians thumb upright alt vertebra caudal vertebra from tail of amnh 5895 tail club of ankylosaurus seems to have been an active defensive weapon capable of producing enough of an impact to break bones of an assailant tendons of tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic allowing great force to be transmitted to club when it was used as a weapon coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled swinging of tail and that violent thrusts of club would have been able to break metatarsal bones of large theropods a 2009 study estimated that ankylosaurids could swing their tails at 100 degrees laterally and mainly cancellous clubs would have had a lowered moment of inertia and been effective weapons study also found that while adult ankylosaurid tail clubs were capable of breaking bones those of juveniles were not despite feasibility of tail swinging researchers could not determine whether ankylosaurids used their clubs for defense against potential predators in intraspecific combat or both in 1993 tony thulborn proposed that tail club of ankylosaurids primarily acted as a decoy for head as he thought tail too short and inflexible to have an effective reach dummy head would lure a predator close to tail where it could be struck carpenter has rejected this idea as tail club shape is highly variable among ankylosaurids even in same genus paleoecology thumb left map showing where ankylosaurus fossils have been discovered holotype is shown in red ankylosaurus existed between 68 and 66 million years ago in final or maastrichtian stage of late cretaceous period it was among last dinosaur genera that appeared before cretaceous paleogene extinction event type specimen is from hell creek formation of montana while other specimens have been found in lance and ferris formations in wyoming scollard formation in alberta and frenchman formation in saskatchewan all of which date to end of cretaceous fossils of ankylosaurus are rare in these sediments and distribution of its remains suggests that it was ecologically rare or restricted to uplands of formations rather than coastal lowlands where it would have been more likely to fossilize another ankylosaur a nodosaur referred to as edmontonia sp is also found in same formations but according to carpenter range of two genera does not seem to have overlapped their remains have so far not been found in same localities and nodosaur appears to have inhabited lowlands narrower muzzle of nodosaur suggests it had a more selective diet than ankylosaurus further indicating ecological separation whether their range overlapped or not with its low center of gravity ankylosaurus would have been unable to knock down trees like modern elephants do it was also incapable of chewing bark and thus unlikely to have practiced bark stripping as an adult ankylosaurus does not appear to have congregated in groups though some ankylosaurs appear to have congregated when young so although it was a large herbivore with similar energetic requirements it is therefore improbable that ankylosaurus was able to modify landscape of its ecosystem in way elephants do hadrosaurids may instead have had such an ecosystem engineer role thumb alt reconstruction of several dinosaurs of various sizes and colors ankylosaurus rear left and other animals of hell creek formation formations where ankylosaurus fossils have been found represent different sections of western shore of western interior seaway dividing western and eastern north america during cretaceous a broad coastal plain extending westward from seaway to newly formed rocky mountains these formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone which have been attributed to floodplain environments regions where ankylosaurus and other late cretaceous ankylosaurs have been found had a warm subtropical temperate climate which was monsoonal had occasional rainfall tropical storms and forest fires in hell creek formation many types of plants were supported primarily angiosperms with less common conifers ferns and cycads an abundance of fossil leaves found at dozens of different sites indicates that area was largely forested by small trees ankylosaurus shared its environment with other dinosaurs that included ceratopsids triceratops and torosaurus hypsilophodont thescelosaurus hadrosaurid edmontosaurus an indeterminate nodosaur pachycephalosaurian pachycephalosaurus and
