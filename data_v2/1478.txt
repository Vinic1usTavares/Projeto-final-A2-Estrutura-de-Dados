of crazy motherfucker would do that but where he is or what he s going to do next who knows episode s opening nightmare sequence in which jordan black brittany tiplady is terrified by a clown crawling along ceiling was inspired by childhood nightmares of morgan and wong and left tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming genge p 28 producer john peter kousakis
