to daleks he also says to doctor you re probably a vegetarian in a butcher s shop and calls him veggie referring to two doctors 1985 in which sixth doctor announced that he and peri would eat a vegetarian diet from then on dream lord also teases doctor s relationship with elizabeth i this began in shakespeare code where elizabeth i wished to behead doctor and continued in end of time which alluded to possibility two were married marriage between two was seen three years later in day of doctor production writing amy s choice was written by simon nye who is known for writing sitcom men behaving badly nye attended read throughs of previous episodes to capture character and voice of doctor and amy nye admitted to restraining himself in change from comedy to science fiction but said it was fun and hugely liberating showrunner steven moffat originally gave nye premise of episode for it to fit in series arc which was to challenge doctor and amy s relationship nye states that rory s death scene is essentially where amy realises her feelings for rory nye wanted to prove that amy really loved rory and he was not just a cypher boyfriend or fiance moffat suggested idea of dream split to nye who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real nye believed that dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within doctor who moffat also instructed nye to come up with a monster and nye chose elderly people possessed by eknodine reflecting his own fear of old people as a child but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents filming and effects thumb left 180px skenfrith castle where some scenes were filmed amy s choice was last episode of fifth series to be filmed and editing finished week it

complete series five dvd on 8 november 2010 critical reception amy s choice received generally mixed reviews from critics gavin fuller writing for daily telegraph was positive about episode calling it probably strongest all round script we ve had this year chock full of good lines he added concept of aliens inhabiting elderly people and turning them psychotic was wittily realised particularly bizarre sight of them laying siege to amy and rory s cottage with household and gardening implements he concluded that it was one of those stories that you would only find in doctor who and shows once again that series can provide genuine thought provoking interesting drama alongside its thrills and spills matt wales of ign rated episode 8 5 out of 10 and described it as surreal fantastical intriguing witty emotional and at times genuinely unsettling unlike martin he said it was impressive enough on pacing alone and made a brisk refreshing 45 minute episode however he criticised ending for being glossed over so quickly and found upper leadworth hard to believe keith phipps writing on a v club graded episode a b and stated it was a solid entry in what s been a generally terrific season of doctor who he praised toby jones performance as dream lord saying that in lesser hands he might have come off as a copycat version of star trek q but jones makes part his own however he thought its weakness was pace and retirement home dwelling bad guys who ultimately seem like a geriatric and not that frightening variation on same old shambling zombies daniel martin reviewing episode for guardian described it as at least partially successful he praised karen gillan s performance saying that she is capable of more than one liners and physical comedy and brings something to your eye too however he thought that episode lacked ideas and storylines usually found in show and criticised sitcom style dialogue patrick mulkern writing for radio times was distinctly underwhelmed comparing it to one of more disappointing episodes of sarah jane adventures he particularly disliked demonising of elderly people upon rewatching however although previous gripes remained he did appreciate some more subdued background music from murray gold script s tight structure and several amusing lines and realisation that for first time doctor is travelling with a couple in love sfx magazine jordan farley gave episode 3 and a half out of 5 stars saying direction never quite struck right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare and camera was a little flat with a strange angle he was displeased with discovery that it had all been a hallucination and stated that rory s death and other instances of horror never shock in way you might expect however he praised smith for being on blindingly good form while portraying doctor s quirkier traits considered that gillan and darvill were fast becoming most likeable companion couple in doctor who history and said jones was a lot of fun to watch despite not seeming to be completely doctor s dark side references external links category 2010 british television episodes category eleventh doctor episodes category
