with oob to train him to be earth s new guardian production writing within roughly six months of creating popular manga dr slump in 1980 akira toriyama wanted to end series but his publisher shueisha would only allow him to do so if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after he worked with his editor kazuhiko torishima on several one shots but none were successful torishima then suggested that as toriyama enjoyed kung fu films he should create a kung fu shonen manga he was inspired by hong kong martial arts films such as bruce lee s enter dragon 1973 and jackie chan s drunken master 1978 and was influenced by fight scenes in jackie chan movies this led to two part published in august and october 1983 issues of fresh jump it follows a boy adept at martial arts who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country dragon boy was very well received and evolved to become serial dragon ball dragon ball was loosely modeled on classic chinese novel journey to west he wanted to create a story with basic theme of journey to west but with a little kung fu torishima said he chose it largely because it was a free intellectual property but also because its chinese setting was not common in manga at time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from dr slumps west coast of united states feel while characters in journey to west travel to collect sacred scrolls toriyama added idea of dragon balls to give characters a game like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its shonen magazine audience with goku being sun bulma as tang oolong as zhu and yamcha being sha wujing he originally thought story would last about a year or end once dragon balls were collected toriyama said that although stories are purposefully easy to understand he specifically aimed dragon ball at an older audience than dr slump title dragon ball was inspired by enter dragon and later knockoff kung fu movies which frequently had word dragon in title manga was not popular initially although he suspected fighting genre would appeal more to its shonen audience toriyama tried to stick to journey to west adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed such as having setting change each chapter different enemies popping up and different locations it was only after he became tired of torishima nagging about its popularity that toriyama gave in and developed more battles with first shown tenkaichi budokai despite his reluctance author said it felt good when series picked up in popularity at that point however he said he still tried to resist by returning to adventure aspect with red ribbon army arc and visiting penguin village from dr slump to add comedy when that did not work out fighting became main theme for manga toriyama said that by second half of series he had become more interested in coming up with story than drawing it and that battles became more intense by him simplifying lines he also said he would get letters from readers complaining that art had become too square so he intentionally made it more so years later he stated that because dragon ball is an action manga most important aspect is sense of speed so he did not draw very elaborately suggesting that he was not interested in art as manga progressed toriyama struggled with android and cell arc feeling that he could not outdo freeza arc he added time travel but said he had a hard time with plot only being able to think of what to do that week after cell s death toriyama intended for gohan to replace goku as series protagonist but felt character was not suited for it and changed his mind even after cell arc toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to majin boo arc having resolved it would be finale he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with gohan s great persona and character however he did not think of an ending until final chapter at time toriyama said he gave dragon ball a low key ending to make it seem as if story might continue but would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in story to signal that it was truly end wanting to make it even clearer that goku s battles were over and a new generation was taking over toriyama slightly altered ending for kanzenban re release of dragon ball which finished in 2004 development thumb upright left akira toriyama did not plan series story in advance he developed it on a weekly basis as he drew it alt akira toriyama sitting on a chair smiling wearing black clothing with glasses and chin facial hair typically when creating a manga chapter an artist draws a rough draft or name then a more detailed storyboard and lastly finalized version however toriyama only draws a storyboard and then final product simply because it is less work he did not plan details of his stories in advance when he began serialization of dragon ball he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing storyboard starting around midnight he would finish it around six in morning and spend until that night inking finishing everything in about a day and a half unlike other artists he had only one assistant helping him toriyama said that thinking only about story for each chapter put him in some tight spots particularly with trunks time travel only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect making it seem to have been foreshadowing author used suggestions in fan mail he received though generally doing opposite of what was suggested as an example many fans told him not to kill vegeta which is exactly what he did wanting to escape western themes that influenced dr slump toriyama used oriental scenery in dragon ball in addition to referencing chinese buildings and scenery island where tenkaichi budokai is held is modeled on bali in indonesia which he visited in 1985 area around s spaceship was inspired by photos of africa when including fights in manga toriyama had characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties of drawing residents and destroyed buildings toriyama wanted to set dragon ball in a fictional world largely based on asia taking inspiration from several asian cultures including japanese chinese south asian central asian arabic and indonesian cultures author said that muscle tower in red ribbon army storyline was inspired by video game spartan x in which enemies appear very fast and that fights were similar to ones in tenkaichi budokai just not in a tournament setting toriyama personally dislikes idea of naming fighting techniques joking that in a real fight you would be killed before you could yell their names but torishima felt it would be best toriyama proceeded to create names for all techniques except for series signature which his wife came up with when he was indecisive about what it should be called he even selected them specifically for each character saying someone like vegeta would use english names and using kanji for more sophisticated like piccolo in order to advance story quickly by having characters travel without inconvenience he created flying cloud then gave most fighters flying technique and granted goku teleportation ability while talking to his long time friend and fellow manga artist masakazu katsura about how there was nothing stronger than a super saiyan katsura suggested having two characters fuse together leading to creation of technique toriyama enjoyed designing and drawing distinctive machines of series he finds most fun in designing original mecha thinking about how a pilot enters and where engine is with real world items he would have to look at references and being off even a little would be noticeable he goes against whatever is popular at time explaining that when he was creating dragon ball most cars were very square so he drew only round car designs in 1995 toriyama detailed equipment he used for dragon ball he used a g pen nib by zebra usually getting three chapters out of one because he typically does not press down hard toriyama used black drawing ink made by pilot but his color ink was produced by luma and applied with a ten year old fine point brush his whiteout was also made by luma he received free kent paper similar to bristol board from a seller connected to shueisha and used a 0 5mm 2b lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30 cm long characters when creating a character his process was to draw their face and body type first and then clothes while thinking if fighters can move around in them he said that he does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects readers psychologically this is not out of concern for others but because he does not enjoy drawing such things few of his characters have screentone because he found it difficult to use toriyama was not concerned about consistency with color of characters clothes for occasional color pages having sometimes used different ones than he had before he even specifically asked torishima to produce as few color pages as possible character names are almost always puns sharing a theme with characters related to them most commonly food for example all are named after vegetables being an anagram of syllables for which means vegetable such as taken from going against normal convention that strongest characters should be largest in terms of physical size he designed many of dragon balls most powerful characters including goku with small toriyama explained that he had goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier even though torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have main character of a manga series change drastically torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during series with toriyama threatening to end it if goku could not grow up editor said his concerns were unfounded as readers accepted change without complaint having created piccolo daimao as first truly evil villain he said that his part of series was most interesting to draw freeza was created around time of japanese economic bubble and inspired by real estate speculators who toriyama called worst kind of people yu kondo toriyama s second editor from saiyan arc until appearance of perfect cell and takeda his third editor from perfect cell until end of series said that dragon ball hit its peak in popularity during freeza arc in a one thousand ballot popularity poll held in weekly shonen jump dragon ball received 815 votes finding escalating enemies difficult toriyama created ginyu force to add more balance to manga when toriyama created super saiyan transformation during freeza arc he gave goku blond hair because it was easier to draw for toriyama s assistant who spent a lot of time blacking in goku s hair he also gave him piercing eyes based on bruce lee s paralyzing glare publication japanese publication dragon ball was serialized in manga anthology weekly shonen

third greatest manga of all time in a 2007 survey of one thousand people conducted by oricon goku ranked in first place as strongest manga character of all time coinciding with 2012 summer olympics oricon conducted a survey at international world cosplay summit on which manga and anime series attendees considered world class works dragon ball was overwhelmingly in first place portuguese edition of dragon ball won 2001 hq mix for best serial in 2011 manga critic and editor of viz s editions of series jason thompson said that dragon ball is by far most influential shonen manga of last 30 years and today almost every shonen jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways explaining its basic formula of lots of martial arts lots of training sequences and a few jokes became model for other shonen series such as naruto thompson cited artwork as influential pointing out that popular shonen manga of late 1980s and early 1990s had manly heroes such as city hunter and fist of north star whereas dragon ball had cartoonish and small goku thus starting a trend that he says still continues commenting on dragon balls global success nearly two decades after it ended toriyama said frankly i don t quite understand why it happened while manga was being serialized only thing i wanted as i kept drawing was to make japanese boys happy role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through i dare say i don t care even if my works have left nothing behind as long as they have entertained their readers critical reception manga has received a mostly positive reception from critics jason thompson commented that dragon ball turns from a gag adventure manga to a nearly pure fighting manga james s yadao author of rough guide to manga explains that first several chapters play out much like journey to west with dr slump like humour built in and that dr slump toriyama s previous manga has a clear early influence on series he feels series established its unique identity after first time goku s group disbands and he trains under kame sen nin on second half of manga he commented that it developed a far more action packed sinister tone with wilder battles and aerial and spiritual elements with an increased death count david brothers for comicsalliance wrote that like osamu tezuka and jack kirby before him toriyama created a story with his own two hands that seeped deep into hearts of his readers creating a love for both cast and medium at same time he said that while author has a sublime combination of looney tunes style classic humor and dirty jokes best part of dragon ball is fight scenes brothers explained that while western superhero comics would focus on a series of cool poses or impact shots with reader having to fill in blanks between panels dragon ball has a panel dedicated to one action and next panel features very next maneuver making them incredibly easy to follow natsume says that theme of disaster and growth in manga is a reference to post war japanese manga that osamu tezuka began in mid 1940s he also comments that violence in manga has context that children can understand and is not just there at random while toriyama has said that journey to west was an influence on manga xavier lopez comments that it is a parody of chinese novel since stories are similar he notes that toriyama uses chinese mythology and japanese folktales dragon shenlong who is summoned from dragon balls as well as characters who are able to come back to life as examples of similarities rachel cantrell says that manga parodies martial arts very well and mentions how toriyama uses panels to a full extent she notes that manga has a coming of age theme due to how story captures goku from a child to an adult carlo santos of anime news network described dragon balls setting as a melting pot of sci fi fantasy and folklore santos praised its quick development of new characters and storylines and claimed that series crowning achievement is in its dynamic fight scenes however he did not enjoy cliche training and tournament segments nor its crude humor his colleague allen divers praised manga s story and humor as being very good at conveying all characters personalities divers also called viz s translation one of best of all english editions of series due to its faithfulness to original japanese animerica felt series had worldwide appeal using dramatic pacing and over top martial arts action to maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on audience s attention spans comic book bin s leroy douresseaux described toriyama as a super cartoonist a blend of carl barks jack kirby and he gave dragon ball a perfect rating and called it one of best manga and comic books he has ever read ridwan khan of animefringe com commented that manga had a chubby art style but as series continued characters became more refined leaner and more muscular he cited one slight problem in viz s release translation uses informal language to capture goku s country accent but it ends up feeling forced and odd khan prefers manga over slow pacing of anime adaptations ollie barber writing for forbes echoed khan stating with a lot less padding manga s pacing is a lot tighter and makes you realize how talented dragon ball s creator akira toriyama truly is when he chooses to flex his storytelling muscles including it on a list of 10 essential manga that should belong in every comic collection matthew meylikhov of paste also praised manga over anime as an entirely different and more involved experience he wrote that you come to know and care for characters more intimately and joy and wonder of watching them fight learn and grow throughout series improves tenfold legacy many manga artists have cited dragon ball and toriyama as inspirations including fairy tail and rave author hiro mashima and boruto naruto next generations illustrator mikio ikemoto both one piece creator eiichiro oda and naruto creator masashi kishimoto have said that goku inspired their series main protagonists as well as their structures for kanzenban re release of dragon ball every odd numbered volume included a tribute illustration by a popular manga artist who was a child when it was serialized accompanied with a few words about how series influenced them artists who contributed include bleach creator tite kubo black cat author kentaro yabuki seven deadly sins author suzuki eyeshield 21 and one punch man illustrator yusuke murata bo bo bobo creator yoshio sawai pretty face author

and happy world author kenjiro takeshita producer of tekken video game series katsuhiro harada said that dragon ball was one of first works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced tekken and other japanese games such as street fighter ian jones quartey a producer of american animated series steven universe is a fan of dragon ball and dr slump and uses toriyama s vehicle designs as a reference for his own he also stated that we re all big toriyama fans on steven universe which kind of shows a bit after searching for a real life equivalent to supernaturally nutritious seen in
