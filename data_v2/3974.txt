editor on chopra s 2000 film mission kashmir they also collaborated on script munna bhai m b b s was a runaway success that prompted duo to contemplate a sequel sequel was initially known as munnabhai meets mahatma gandhi and was later titled munnabhai 2nd innings before title lage raho munna bhai was finalised hirani admitted in an interview that he felt burden of expectation while writing screenplay for lage raho munna bhai as he had to create something to match first film initially there was some effort to incorporate scenes or characteristics of first film into sequel such as idiosyncratic laugh of portrayed by boman irani in first instalment but risks of repetition were consciously averted one of hirani s goals in making film was to revive an interest in mahatma gandhi a figure whom he felt had been forgotten in contemporary india to highlight this fact hirani recounted during an interview an incident with a boy who brings tea to crew during production boy was curious he was a big munnabhai fan and kept asking name of film first working title was munnabhai meets mahatma gandhi and shantanu moitra music director told him so he said munnabhai to hai yeh mahatma gandhi kaun hai munnabhai is fine but who is this mahatma gandhi so this is sad state of affairs today i was shocked and it s not just chai a few days ago on tv a lot of politicians were asked india related questions on news channels and i can t believe a lot of them don t know 2 october is gandhiji s birthday many didn t know his first name they kept saying what s in a name we respect his ideals but come on how can you not know his name other screenwriter abhijat joshi who teaches in department of english at college in westerville ohio stated that he had been conducting extensive research on gandhi which inspired producer chopra to involve joshi in creation of second munna bhai screenplay while writing screenplay hirani and joshi stayed together for more than four months they developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing scene they would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh or cry or had some provocative thought while there was a

arshad warsi speaking with an accent warsi admitted that he had forgotten character of circuit and had to watch dvd of munna bhai m b b s three times before being able to film scene correctly dutt also confessed that he had to watch first film eight to nine times to recapture persona of munna bhai in addition dutt stated in an interview that he did not read gandhi s autobiography story of my
