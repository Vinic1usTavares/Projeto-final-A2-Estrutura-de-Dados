nasa s astronaut group 2 also known as new nine and next nine was second group of astronauts selected by nasa their selection was announced on september 17 1962 nine astronauts were neil armstrong frank borman pete conrad jim lovell james mcdivitt elliot see tom stafford ed white and john young six of nine flew to moon lovell and young twice and armstrong conrad and young walked on it as well seven of nine were awarded congressional space medal of honor group was required to augment original mercury seven with announcement of gemini program leading to apollo program while original seven had been selected to accomplish simpler task of orbital flight new challenges of rendezvous and lunar landing led to selection of candidates with advanced engineering degrees for four of nine as well as test pilot experience lovell and conrad had been candidates for original seven but were not selected then nine became first group with civilian test pilots see had flown for general electric while armstrong had flown x 15 research plane for nasa background launch of sputnik 1 satellite by soviet union on october 4 1957 started a cold war technological and ideological competition with united states known as space race demonstration of american technological inferiority came as a profound shock to american public in response to sputnik crisis president of united states dwight d eisenhower created a new civilian agency national aeronautics and space administration nasa to oversee an american space program space task group stg at nasa langley research center in hampton virginia created an american crewed spaceflight project called project mercury selection of first astronauts known as original seven or mercury seven was announced on april 9 1959 thumb left we choose to go to moon president john f kennedy speaks on nation s space effort at rice university in houston on september 12 1962 by 1961 although it was yet to launch a person into space stg was confident that project mercury had overcome its initial setbacks and united states had overtaken soviet union as most advanced nation in space technology stg began considering mercury mark ii a two person successor to original mercury spacecraft this confidence was shattered on april 12 1961 when soviet union launched vostok 1 and cosmonaut yuri gagarin became first person to orbit earth in response president john f kennedy announced a far more ambitious goal on may 25 1961 to put a man on moon by end of decade effort to land a man on moon already had a name project apollo two person mercury ii spacecraft concept did not die stg head robert r gilruth formally announced it on december 7 1961 and on january 3 1962 it was officially named project gemini on april 18 1962 nasa formally announced that it was accepting applications for a new group of astronauts who would assist mercury astronauts with project mercury and join them in flying project gemini missions it was anticipated that they might go on to command project apollo missions unlike selection process for mercury seven which was carried out in secret this selection was widely advertised with public announcements and minimum standards communicated to aircraft companies government agencies and society of experimental test pilots selection criteria five minimum selection criteria were that applicants were experienced test pilots with 1 500 hours test pilot flying time who had graduated from a military test pilot school or had test pilot experience with nasa or aircraft industry had flown high performance jet aircraft had earned a degree in engineering or physical or biological sciences were a u s citizen under 35 years of age and or less in height and recommended by employer criteria differed from those of mercury seven selection in several ways gemini spacecraft was expected to be more capacious than mercury one so height requirement was relaxed slightly this made tom stafford eligible a college degree was now required but could be in biological sciences civilian test pilots were now eligible but requirement for experience in high performance jets favoured those with recent experience and fighter pilots over those with multi engine experience perhaps most important change was lowering age limit from 40 to 35 this was because whereas mercury was a short term project project apollo was going to run until end of decade at least changed selection criteria meant that selection panel could not simply select another group from mercury seven finalists at this time jerrie cobb was pressing for women to be allowed to become astronauts and mercury 13 had passed same medical tests given to mercury seven astronauts although women were not prevented from applying requirement for jet test pilot experience effectively excluded them nasa administrator james e webb told media that i do not think we shall be anxious to put a woman or any other person of particular race or creed into orbit just for purpose or putting them there selection process u s navy usn and u s marine corps usmc submitted names of all their pilots who met selection criteria but u s air force usaf conducted its own internal selection process and only submitted names of eleven candidates air force ran them through a brief training course in may 1962 on how to speak and conduct themselves during nasa selection process candidates called it a charm school chief of staff of air force general curtis lemay told them there are a lot of people who ll say you re deserting air force if you re accepted into nasa well i m chief of air force and i want you to know i want you in this program i want you to succeed in it and that s your air force mission i can t think of anything more important in all 253 applications were received by june 1 1962 deadline neil armstrong submitted his application a week after deadline but walter c williams associate director of space task group wanted nasa test pilot so he had richard day who acted as secretary of selection panel add it to pile of applications when it arrived paul director of nasa s dryden flight research facility declined to recommend armstrong for astronaut selection because he had misgivings about armstrong s performance thumb right upright 1 5 first two groups of astronauts selected by nasa mercury seven are seated at front with next nine standing behind them three person selection panel consisted of mercury seven astronauts alan shepard and deke slayton and nasa test pilot warren j north although williams sat in on some sessions they reduced candidates to a more manageable 32 finalists from whom they hoped to select between five and ten new astronauts air force s pre selection process seems to have been successful nine of eleven were chosen as finalists and one of those rejected joe engle was selected in a later intake in 1966 of rest thirteen were from navy four were marines and six were civilians four had been finalists in mercury seven selection pete conrad jim lovell john mitchell and robert lovell was not selected due to a high bilirubin blood count finalists were sent to brooks air force base in san antonio for medical examinations tests there were much same as those employed to select mercury seven one candidate lieutenant commander carl tex birdwell was found to be too tall another four were eliminated on basis of ear nose and throat examinations remaining 27 then went to ellington air force base near houston where manned spacecraft center msc was being established they were individually interviewed by selection panel nine candidates were selected and their names forwarded to gilruth for approval slayton informed each of them by phone on september 14 nine arrived in houston on september 15 to avoid tipping off media all checked into rice hotel in houston under name of max peck its general manager on september 17 media crowded into 1800 seat cullen auditorium at university of houston for official announcement but it was a more low key event than unveiling of mercury seven three years before as with those who had been passed over in mercury seven selection most of rejected finalists went on to have distinguished careers william e ramsey became a vice admiral in navy and kenneth weir a major general in marine corps four would become nasa astronauts in later selections alan bean michael

houses in timber cove south of msc developers in timber cove and nassau bay offered astronauts mortgages with small down payments and low interest rates msc complex was not yet complete so nasa temporarily leased office space in houston slayton s wife marge and borman s wife susan organized an astronauts wives club along lines of officers wives clubs that were a feature of military bases as slayton was in charge of astronaut activities marge was considered to be equivalent of commanding officer s wife nine were honored guests at houston society parties such as those thrown by socialite joanne herring and their wives received 1 000 neiman marcus gift vouchers from an anonymous source thumb right borman armstrong young and slayton during desert survival training in nevada in august 1964 a lawyer henry batten agreed to negotiate a deal for their personal stories with field enterprises along lines of life magazine deal enjoyed by mercury seven for no fee as with life deal there was some disquiet about propriety of astronauts cashing in on government created fame but mercury seven astronaut john glenn intervened and personally raised matter with kennedy who approved deal deals with field and time life earned each of nine 16 250 per annum over next four years and provided them with 100 000 life insurance policies due to dangerous nature of an astronaut s job insurance companies would have charged them high premiums as slayton was busy with project gemini he delegated task of supervising next nine s training to mercury seven astronaut gus grissom initially each of astronauts was given four months of classroom instruction on subjects such as spacecraft propulsion orbital mechanics astronomy computing and space medicine classes were for six hours a day two days a week and all sixteen astronauts had to attend there was also familiarization with gemini spacecraft titan ii and atlas boosters and agena target vehicle jungle survival training was conducted at usaf tropic survival school at albrook air force station in panama desert survival training at stead air force base in nevada and water survival training on dilbert dunker at usn school at naval air station pensacola in florida and on galveston bay following precedent set by mercury seven each of next nine was assigned a special area in which to develop expertise that could be shared with others and to provide astronaut input to designers and engineers armstrong was responsible for trainers and simulators borman for boosters conrad for cockpit layout and systems integration lovell for recovery systems mcdivitt for guidance systems see for electrical systems and mission planning stafford for communications systems white for flight control systems and young for environmental control systems and space suits legacy thumb right president ronald reagan presents john young with congressional space medal of honor as well as nasa s distinguished service medal collins wrote that in his opinion this group of nine was best nasa ever picked better than seven that preceded it or fourteen five nineteen eleven and seven that followed slayton felt so too describing them as probably best all round group ever put together nine were deficient in only one respect there was too few of them looking over tentative schedule of apollo missions slayton calculated that up to 14 three person crews might be required but 16 astronauts on hand could fill just five while he considered schedule to be optimistic he did not want a shortage of astronauts to be reason schedule could not be met and therefore proposed that there be another round of recruiting on june 5 1963 nasa announced that it was seeking another ten to fifteen new astronauts next nine went on to illustrious careers as astronauts apart from see and white who were killed in a t 38 crash and in apollo fire respectively all went on to command gemini and apollo missions six of nine flew to moon lovell and young twice and armstrong conrad and young walked on it as well seven of nine received congressional space medal of honor for their service valor and sacrifice white posthumously killed in apollo 1 fire borman for commanding apollo 8 first crewed mission to moon armstrong for commanding apollo 11 first lunar landing lovell for commanding ill fated apollo 13 conrad for commanding skylab 2 and saving damaged
