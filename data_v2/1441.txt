splitting time with st paul saints in united states hockey league it was during this time that he would first garner nickname fog although more often associated with his loner personality and propensity for being lost in thought nickname actually began during a 1948 game in st paul minnesota high humidity on indoor ice surfaces can result in fog one night in st paul fog was so thick that shero was only player who claimed to be able to see puck thus earning him name freddy fog 1948 49 season saw shero become a regular in rangers line up as well as his first nhl post season action following season shero set career highs in games played assists and points while rangers qualified for post season in fourth and final position despite being lowest seeded team rangers made it to

louis a r pieri memorial award as ahl coach of year for 1970 71 season shero again changed teams this time coaching in central hockey league with omaha knights winning league championship although in rangers farm system for several years and winning at various levels shero was never seriously considered to replace emile francis as head coach due to shero s perceived alcohol problem and a belief that he was an ineffective communicator philadelphia flyers 1971 1978 in 1971 philadelphia flyers were looking for a new coach and general manager keith allen suggested shero to owner ed snider when asked if he knew shero allen admitted to only knowing him by reputation he knew shero always had a winning record plus he had a gut feeling he was right man for job snider agreed to bring in shero because he trusted allen s judgment thus shero became third coach in flyers history he had high hopes for season predicting that flyers would finish no worse than second in west division 1971 72 season was disappointing for shero as flyers finished in 5th place in west with a 26 38 14 record flyers 66 points were actually a decrease of 7 points in standings and they missed playoffs for second time in three years shero s fog nickname was also re established during year following a game at omni coliseum in atlanta when he left arena through a door with no re entry and became locked outside prior to post game press conference at press conference no one knew where shero was and reporters unsuccessfully searched arena for him in off season shero decided that team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams upon being elevated to nhl he had decided not to employ systems like he did in minors stating that he had too much respect for nhl players however he decided that since he had same kind of players on flyers as he did in minors he would use same systems becoming first coach to employ systems in 1972 73 shero hired mike nykoluk as an assistant coach on a one year tryout basis although assistant coaches are common today nykoluk was first full time assistant coach in league and decision to hire him led to rumors that shero must not be much of a coach if he needed help however with additional help shero guided flyers to their first winning season in franchise history and nykoluk stayed on as assistant throughout shero s tenure prior to a game during 72 73 season shero wrote a quote about commitment on dressing room blackboard and team won game from then on shero wrote inspirational quotes prior to games after finishing second in west division they faced off with minnesota north stars whom they defeated 4 2 winning first playoff series in flyers history in second round flyers matched up with montreal canadiens who defeated philadelphia 4 1 stanley cup years 160px thumb jack adams award for coach of year which shero won in its inaugural season 1973 74 following season shero led flyers to a 50 16 12 record first place in western division 112 point total also placed flyers just one point behind boston bruins for first overall in nhl it also marked first time in franchise history that flyers posted a winning percentage over 0 700 division title and high winning percentage accompanied by a 27 point increase from previous season led to shero winning inaugural jack adams award for coach of year in 1974 playoffs flyers first round match up was against atlanta flames following a game three win in which flyers went up 3 0 shero was involved in an infamous incident known for taking late night walks and stopping at local bars and pubs for a drink shero decided to go for one of those walks following game three victory though no one knows for sure what happened shero was allegedly mugged shero didn t divulge any information about what really happened but police responded to a disturbance call at 2 a m outside flyers hotel shero was found with a broken thumb and cuts and bruises to his face flyers management sent him home to recuperate and assistant coach nykoluk coached team in series winning game in semi final round flyers were considered underdogs to new york rangers however flyers had home ice advantage in seven game series home team won every game giving flyers a 4 3 series win it marked first time an expansion team defeated an original six team in a playoff series flyers advanced to stanley cup finals where they played boston bruins prior to game one shero devised an unconventional game plan flyers were to dump puck to bobby orr s side of rink orr was considered to be one of league s best players and plan was to make him skate hard back to get puck in addition team was to be physically hard on him any player who had opportunity was to check bump or put a stick on orr in an attempt to wear him down bobby clarke later recalled that strategy did work although it did take some time clarke stated that orr was best player on ice in game five but in game six orr wasn t factor he had been in other games going into game six flyers had a chance to win stanley cup prior to game shero wrote his famous quote win today and we walk together forever on dressing room blackboard for inspiration to players quote is still used today flyers went on to win game six and series thus becoming first expansion team to win stanley cup following series flyers goaltender bernie parent was named conn smythe as playoff mvp during official presentation parent was given a new car which he promptly gave to shero in 1974 75 season shero led flyers to a 51 18 11 record they won newly formed patrick division were first in new campbell conference and first overall in nhl in their opening series flyers swept toronto maple leafs setting up a semi final match up against new york islanders after taking a 3 0 series led flyers lost three straight to set up a deciding seventh game before game seven shero wrote a quote by dag hammarskjold only he deserves power who every day justifies it on blackboard though shero never admitted it quote was believed to be directed at centre rick macleish who had underperformed in series macleish responded and in game seven he registered a hat trick as flyers won game 4 1 win set up a stanley cup finals match up with buffalo shero and coaching staff again devised a game plan this time it was to stop buffalo s french connection line first part of plan was to keep sabre s centre gilbert perreault out of middle of rink and to take away his passing options flyers centres were instructed to play close to perreault and be physical against him to point where it bordered on a penalty second part involved wearing down french connection shero made numerous line changes to keep fresh players out against sabre s trio a perfect example of this part of strategy was in game one french connection took a 97 second shift and flyers made three line changes during that time shero s strategy worked and flyers won their second consecutive stanley cup in 1975 76 shero guided flyers to a 51 13 16 record highlighted by a 36 2 2 home ice record again they won patrick division and finished first overall in campbell conference season saw club set franchise records in points and winning percentage season also witnessed an exhibition game that would become one of most famous games in flyers history in 1976 soviet red army team toured north america and played four games against nhl clubs on january 11 1976 russians matched up against flyers at spectrum in philadelphia entering game red army team was unbeaten defeating both boston and rangers and registering a tie against canadiens shero had studied soviet style of play even traveling to soviet union during different off seasons shero even implemented some of russian style into his own system altering it slightly with his knowledge of russian system shero devised a game plan russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from shero instructed flyers players not to chase puck but rather hold their positions while in offensive zone flyer forwards were to hold puck as much as possible to avoid counter attacks flyers won game by a final of 4 1 and outshot red army 49 13 victory led some to see flyers as best team in world following playoffs that distinction would not last bernie parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games he was able to return for first round series win versus toronto but pain became too much for parent to continue to play in subsequent series and shero was forced to use his back up goaltender wayne stephenson flyers were also without second line centre macleish resulting in a depletion of scoring depth despite these setbacks shero led philadelphia past boston in semi finals and back to stanley cup finals however flyers fell short of winning three straight cups losing to montreal in four consecutive games in 1976 77 season flyers win total slipped from 51 to 48 but they still managed a 0 700 winning percentage this marked fourth consecutive year of having a 0 700 or better win percentage once again winning their division and finishing first in campbell conference in post season flyers again reached semi finals but lost to bruins in four straight games following season flyers record fell to 45 20 15 finishing second to islanders in both division and conference shero again led flyers to semi finals where they lost to bruins once more at end of season shero who had one more year left on his contract submitted a letter of resignation stating that flyers needed a change whether they realized it or not flyers management had previously heard rumors about shero wanting to leave philadelphia and re join rangers organization and refused to accept his letter of resignation shero then signed a 250 000 five year contract with rangers to be their new head coach and general manager believing he no longer had a contractual agreement to flyers a few weeks after signing shero rangers gave flyers their first round pick in 1978 draft ken and cash as compensation allowing rangers to avoid tampering charges new york rangers and beyond in his first season with rangers shero led them to a 40 29 11 record an increase of ten wins over previous season rangers excelled during playoffs that year defeating los angeles kings in their first round match up then knocking off shero s former club philadelphia in semi finals rangers upset their cross town rival islanders to reach stanley cup finals for first time since 1972 rangers matched up against montreal canadiens in finals after upsetting montreal in game one of finals phil esposito asked shero to get team out of town prior to game two two nights later shero decided against such a move and several rangers players were rumored to have partied hard following win rangers took a 2 0 lead in game two before losing game and eventually series 4 1 in 1979 80 season rangers record dipped to 38 32 10 good for fourth place in campbell conference in playoffs rangers defeated flames in round one but lost a playoff rematch to flyers 4 1 in round two after season shero was honored with lester patrick trophy for his contributions to growth of hockey in united states an award he shared with miracle on ice 1980 u s olympic ice hockey team next season rangers suffered injuries to key players resulting in a 4 13 3 start shero decided to step down from both his positions and was replaced by craig patrick in 1982 shero failed in an attempt to become detroit red wings head coach a year later he was diagnosed with stomach cancer he underwent surgery but remained healthy enough to start his new position as color analyst for new jersey devils radio broadcasts in 1987 shero decided he wanted to experience coaching in europe and spent one season coaching tilburg trappers in netherlands with his health declining shero returned to flyers organization as a special assistant in 1989 reunion was to help him with his medical costs but it was also something that was very important to shero on a personal level as it was a return to organization he had most success with on march 22 1990 shero was elected into flyers hall of fame eight months later on november 24 shero died at cooper hospital in camden new jersey he was 65 his passing did not diminish his popularity in philadelphia and in a 1999 philadelphia daily news poll he was selected as city s greatest professional coach manager beating out other notable coaches such as connie mack of mlb philadelphia athletics dick vermeil and greasy neale of nfl philadelphia eagles in 2010 there was a push to get him elected into hockey hall of fame which included an online petition at net shero was eventually elected to hockey hall of fame as a builder in 2013 he remains winningest coach in flyers history with 308 wins plus 48 more in playoff competition coaching style shero s introverted enigmatic personality had an effect on way in which he coached players shero often communicated with his players by way of notes left in their lockers when he did talk to them he was known for never yelling he believed that when coaches yell they do it for their own sake he always defended his player whether it was in press or even against management he always tried to make sure his players were focused during game he often asked them how much time was left in period to force them to pay attention he had a unique take on practice as well if team was winning then he worked team hard if they were losing then there would be a low key practice he believed that he could get more out of players when they were winning he often had drills designed to let players have fun stating that hockey is a child s game played by men since it s a child s game it ought to be fun to have fun flyers occasionally had 12 on 12 games with winning team earning a small monetary reward he sometimes had players perform drills that lacked purpose which team performed until a player questioned validity of drill at that point shero stopped drill and praised player for being alert shero was notoriously bad with names on one occasion it led to him trading for wrong player while gm of rangers shero traded for cam connor believing it was colin campbell upon his arrival connor had to explain that he was a winger and not a defenceman often credited with using fighting and intimidation as a tactic shero never coached players to fight he valued team toughness and insisted that players take body and follow through with their checks when it came to fighting shero was quoted as saying i swear i have never told a player to attack another player in fact i have told my players if they ever hear me saying something like this they can break a stick over my skull i ask only that they play aggressively in an interview in hbo documentary broad street bullies shero states that he had a team that liked fighting so he let them fight demonstrating his personal coaching philosophy that you have to learn to win with what you got or you don t win at all shero was an innovator aside from being first coach to employ systems and known as one of first western coaches to study soviet influences he was first coach to study film his son ray even recalls his father breaking down games from radio broadcasts he was also first to have his players use in season strength training with use of an apollo machine a precursor to nautilus equipment as well as one of first coaches to adopt morning skate he was one of first coaches to have a game plan specifically designed on how to attack opposing teams although not all of them worked to plan bernie parent recalls a game against montreal in which shero decided to out skate highly skilled canadiens after first period during which flyers goaltender faced 21 shots he jokingly summed it up by saying zamboni didn t even need to resurface other end of ice yet it illustrates shero s understanding that he didn t know everything about coaching and his pursuit to learn more personal life shero was son of russian immigrants who moved to winnipeg to avoid religious persecution he was often bullied for being son of an immigrant and went out of his way to avoid some of other children in his neighborhood shero credited his childhood experiences as a reason why he tended to be a loner as a child shero took up boxing and at age 13 he became a canadian bantamweight champion his success gave him a chance to become a professional boxer but he decided to play hockey instead when he signed his first professional contract with rangers his father cautioned him that hockey players are looking for work when they are 30
