leuschner observatory originally called students observatory is an observatory jointly operated by university of california berkeley and san francisco state university observatory was built in 1886 on berkeley campus for many years it was directed by armin otto leuschner for whom observatory was renamed in 1951 in 1965 it was relocated to its present home in lafayette california approximately east of berkeley campus in 2012 physics and astronomy department of san francisco state university became a partner presently leuschner observatory has two operating telescopes one is a optical telescope equipped with a ccd for observations in visible light and an infrared detector used for infrared astronomy other is a radio dish used for an undergraduate radio astronomy course observatory has been used to perform professional astronomy research such as orbit determination of small solar system bodies in early 1900s and supernova surveys in 1980s and 1990s it has also served as a primary tool in education of graduate and undergraduate students at uc berkeley history thumb right plaque at site of original students observatory students observatory was constructed in 1886 on berkeley campus with original funds provided by california legislature in order for observatory to provide practical training to civil engineers very quickly students observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy so that they would be better prepared to go on to use facilities at lick observatory this contributed to separation of departments of civil engineering and astronomy in mid 1890s with students observatory becoming home of berkeley astronomy department in 1898 armin otto leuschner was appointed director of students observatory a post that he held until his retirement in 1938 during this time observatory became a center for computation of orbits of comets minor planets and satellites astronomer simon newcomb said that leuschner organized department and observatory into a thorough school of astronomy than which there is none better after he stepped down observatory was directed by a series of well regarded astronomers including otto struve from 1950 59 and louis g from 1959 64 students observatory was renamed leuschner observatory by regents of university of california in 1951 in honor of a o leuschner space sciences lab which operates seti began operations in 1960 at leuschner observatory until a permanent home in berkeley hills was completed in 1966 in 1965 observatory was relocated a short distance east of berkeley campus in hills of lafayette california on russell reservation in 1968 observatory was equipped with a new ritchey chretien telescope built by tinsley laboratories since observatory has been used as a testing ground for a variety of experiments and instruments predecessor to katzman automatic imaging telescope was tested at leuschner observatory in early 1990s and in early 2000s first prototype of telescopes used at allen telescope array was unveiled at leuschner leuschner observatory s telescope continues to be regularly used in undergraduate astronomical instruction while telescope was decommissioned and is in disrepair in 2012 physics and astronomy department of san francisco state university bought into telescope sf state and uc berkeley staff jointly refurbished and upgraded motors and control system of larger telescope sf state also installed a remote observing station based in its frequently fog laden san francisco campus instruments thumb right rapid prototype array at leuschner observatory optical infrared leuschner observatory houses two optical telescopes one with a diameter and other with a diameter as of 2010 telescope is not usable and telescope is undergoing upgrades telescope is of ritchey chretien design and is equipped with both a charge coupled device ccd for observations in visible light and an infrared detector that was fabricated in 2000 in order to create an infrared laboratory course for undergraduate students at uc berkeley both optical telescopes are also outfitted with control systems which allow them be automated meaning observations are made with minimal human intervention radio leuschner observatory is home to a single radio telescope telescope was one of prototypes for allen telescope array that were tested at leuschner and has since been used in undergraduate radio astronomy lab telescope operates between 1320 1740 mhz and uses an element spectrometer with spectral resolution of about 1 5 khz and a 12 mhz bandwidth operating range allows for it to be used to observe 21 cm hydrogen line as well as hydroxyl lines from astrophysical research and discoveries orbit determination research at students observatory under a o leuschner was primarily focused on performing astrometry in order to determine orbits for newly discovered comets when clyde tombaugh reported discovery of pluto in 1930 leuschner began observing it using instruments at students observatory to determine its orbit within months of its discovery leuschner cast first doubt on pluto s status as a planet suggesting instead that it was unclear whether pluto was a large asteroid a planet or a comet using a few weeks of observation at students observatory he and his students fred whipple and e c bower determined orbital elements for pluto and an upper limit of one half mass of earth this mass meant pluto was insufficiently massive to be planet x thought to cause discrepancies between predicted and observed orbit of neptune supernova observatory was for a time home to two automated supernova surveys berkeley automated supernova search led by saul perlmutter who went on to head supernova cosmology project used telescope at leuschner to scan skies nightly for supernova leuschner observatory supernova search loss began in 1992 as berkeley automated imaging telescope bait also searched for supernova in this case under alex both were used as testing grounds for automated searches at other sites with bait eventually being succeeded by katzman automatic imaging telescope located at lick observatory while loss operated at leuschner it discovered sn sn sn sn sn sn and sn telescope was also used as part of a program called hands on universe that allows elementary and high school students to request observations on telescope in late march 1994 two high school students in oil city pennsylvania requested observations of whirlpool galaxy when astronomers discovered sn in whirlpool galaxy a few days later they realized that observations made with telescope at leuschner had captured earliest images of supernova even more images provided astronomers some of earliest supernovae light curve data on record seti leuschner observatory is also home to an optical seti experiment carried out under direction of uc berkeley astronomer dan program consists of a targeted search for bright pulses of short duration around 2500 nearby stars using automated telescope similar efforts are carried out at lick observatory using nickel telescope first optical probe seti study was also conducted at leuschner in 1979 maffei 1 and 2 in 1968 italian astronomer paolo maffei reported observing two strange objects a graduate student at berkeley used telescope at leuschner observatory to make first identification of two objects as being elliptical galaxies once it was known what they were two objects were named maffei 1 and maffei 2 after their discover in identifying nature of objects astronomers realized they were very nearby objects perhaps even belonging to local group while eventually membership in local group was ruled out maffei 1 is now recognized as being nearest major elliptical galaxy nemesis in 1984 paleontologists david m and jack suggested that extinction events on earth followed a periodic trend richard muller a professor of physics at berkeley was part of a team that suggested that sun had an unseen stellar companion which caused this periodicity with this hypothetical companion being dubbed nemesis muller was already involved in automated supernova searches underway at leuschner and began search for nemesis using optical telescopes at leuschner observatory references category astronomical observatories in california category university of california berkeley buildings category
