house of plantagenet was a royal house which originated from lands of anjou in france name plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses angevins who were also counts of anjou main body of plantagenets following loss of anjou and plantagenets two cadet branches houses of lancaster and york family held english throne from 1154 with accession of henry ii until 1485 when richard iii died in battle under plantagenets england was transformed although this was only partly intentional plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as magna carta these constrained royal power in return for financial and military support king was no longer just most powerful man in nation holding prerogative of judgement feudal tribute and warfare he now had defined duties to realm underpinned by a sophisticated justice system a distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with french scots welsh and irish and establishment of english as primary language in 15th century plantagenets were defeated in hundred years war and beset with social political and economic problems popular revolts were commonplace triggered by denial of numerous freedoms english nobles raised private armies engaged in private feuds and openly defied henry vi rivalry between house of plantagenet s two cadet branches of york and lancaster brought about wars of roses a decades long fight for english succession culminating in battle of bosworth field in 1485 when reign of plantagenets and english middle ages both met their end with death of king richard iii henry vii of lancastrian descent became king of england five months later he married elizabeth of york thus ending wars of roses and giving rise to tudor dynasty tudors worked to centralise english royal power which allowed them to avoid some of problems that had plagued last plantagenet rulers resulting stability allowed for english renaissance and advent of early modern britain terminology plantagenet thumb right alt ancient depiction of first plantagenet king henry 2nd of england upright henry ii 1154 1189 is considered by some to be first plantagenet king of england richard of york 3rd duke of york adopted plantagenet as his family name in 15th century plantegenest or plante genest had been a 12th century nickname for his ancestor geoffrey count of anjou and duke of normandy one of many popular theories suggests common broom in medieval latin as source of nickname it is uncertain why richard chose this specific name although during wars of roses it emphasised richard s status as geoffrey s patrilineal descendant retrospective usage of name for all of geoffrey s male line descendants was popular during subsequent tudor dynasty perhaps encouraged by further legitimacy it gave to richard s great grandson henry viii it was only in late 17th century that it passed into common usage among historians angevins is french for from anjou three angevin kings were henry ii richard i and john angevin can also refer to period of history in which they reigned many historians identify angevins as a distinct english royal house angevin is also used in reference to any sovereign or government derived from anjou as a noun it refers to any native of anjou or an angevin ruler and specifically to other counts and dukes of anjou including ancestors of three kings who formed english royal house their cousins who held crown of jerusalem and to unrelated members of french royal family who were later granted titles and formed different dynasties such as capetian house of anjou and valois house of anjou consequently there is disagreement between those who consider henry iii to be first plantagenet monarch and those who do not distinguish between angevins and plantagenets and therefore consider first plantagenet to be henry ii term angevin empire was coined by kate norgate in 1887 there was no known contemporary collective name for all of territories under rule of angevin kings of england this led to circumlocutions such as our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be or whole of kingdom which had belonged to his father empire portion of angevin empire has been controversial especially as these territories were not subject to any unified laws or systems of governance and each retained its own laws traditions and feudal relationships in 1986 a convention of historians concluded that there had not been an angevin state and therefore no angevin empire but that term french for plantagenet area was acceptable nonetheless historians have continued to use angevin empire origin thumb upright 1 4 alt an illuminated diagram showing angevins coloured lines connect two to show lineal descent 13th century depiction of henry ii and his

anjou in 1060 couple inherited title via cognatic kinship from an angevin family that was descended from a noble named ingelger whose recorded history dates from 870 during 10th and 11th centuries power struggles occurred between rulers in northern and western france including those of anjou normandy brittany poitou blois maine and kings of france in early 12th century geoffrey of anjou married empress matilda king henry i s only surviving legitimate child and heir to english throne as a result of this marriage geoffrey s son henry ii inherited english throne as well as norman and angevin titles thus marking beginning of angevin and plantagenet dynasties marriage was third attempt of geoffrey s father fulk v count of anjou to build a political alliance with normandy he first espoused his daughter alice to william adelin henry i s heir after william drowned in wreck of white ship fulk married another of his daughters sibylla to william clito son of henry i s older brother robert

reduced risk that king s realm would pass to his son in law s family which might have occurred if marriage of matilda and geoffrey had proved childless birth of a second son also named geoffrey increased likelihood that in accordance with french custom henry would receive english maternal inheritance and geoffrey angevin paternal inheritance this would separate realms of england and anjou in order to secure an orderly succession geoffrey and matilda sought more power from henry i but quarrelled with him after king refused to give them power that might be used against him when he died in december 1135 couple were in anjou allowing matilda s cousin stephen to seize crown of england stephen s contested accession initiated widespread civil unrest later called anarchy count geoffrey had little interest in england instead he commenced a ten year war for duchy of normandy but it became clear that to bring this conflict to a successful conclusion stephen would need to be challenged in england so in 1139 matilda and her half brother robert invaded england from age of nine henry was repeatedly sent to england to be male figurehead of campaigns since it became apparent that he would become king if england was conquered in 1141 stephen was captured at battle of lincoln and later exchanged for robert who had also been captured geoffrey continued conquest of normandy and in 1150 transferred duchy to henry while retaining primary role in duchy s government three events allowed angevins successful termination of conflict count geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing division of his realm between henry and henry s younger brother geoffrey who would have inherited anjou according to william of newburgh who wrote in 1190s count geoffrey decided that henry would receive england and anjou for as long as he needed resources for conflict against stephen count geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until henry swore an oath that young geoffrey would receive anjou when england and normandy were secured w l warren cast doubt on this account on grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source it would be questionable that either geoffrey or henry would consider such an oath binding and it would break inheritance practice of time young geoffrey died in 1158 before receiving anjou but he had become count of nantes when citizens of nantes rebelled against their ruler henry had supported rebellion louis vii of france was granted an annulment of his marriage to eleanor of aquitaine on 18 march 1152 and she married henry who would become

richard william s many competencies and importance as a royal bastard led to a long and illustrious career henry reasserted and extended previous suzerainties to secure possession of his inherited realm in 1162 he attempted to re establish what he saw as his authority over english church by appointing his friend thomas becket as archbishop of canterbury upon death of incumbent archbishop theobald becket s defiance as archbishop alienated king and his counsellors henry and becket had repeated disputes over issues such as church tenures marriage of henry s brother and taxation henry reacted by getting becket and other english bishops to recognise sixteen ancient customs in writing for first time in constitutions of clarendon governing relations between king his courts and church when becket tried to leave country without permission henry tried to ruin him by filing legal cases relating to becket s previous tenure as chancellor becket fled and remained in exile for five years relations later improved and becket returned but they declined again when henry s son was crowned as coregent by archbishop of york which becket perceived as a challenge to his authority becket later excommunicated those who had offended him when he received this news henry said what miserable drones and traitors have i nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low born clerk four of henry s knights killed becket in canterbury cathedral after becket resisted a failed arrest attempt henry was widely considered complicit in becket s death throughout christian europe this made henry a pariah in penance he walked barefoot into canterbury cathedral where he was severely whipped by monks from 1155 henry claimed that pope adrian iv had given him authorisation to reform irish church by assuming control of ireland but professor anne duggan s research indicates that is a falsification of an existing letter and that was not in fact adrian s intention it originally allowed henry s brother william some territory henry did not personally act on this until 1171 by which time william was already dead he invaded ireland to assert his authority over knights who had accrued autonomous power after they recruited soldiers in england and wales and colonised ireland with his permission henry later gave ireland to his youngest son john in 1172 henry gave john castles of chinon loudun and mirebeau as a wedding gift this angered henry s eighteen year old son henry young king who believed these were his a rebellion by henry ii s wife

and miserable french and english contemporary moralists viewed this fate as retribution for murder of becket even his favourite legitimate son john had rebelled although constantly loyal illegitimate son geoffrey remained with henry until end following richard s coronation he quickly put kingdom s affairs in order and departed on a crusade for middle east opinion of richard has fluctuated although he was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners he had rejected and humiliated sister of king of france deposed king of cyprus and later sold island he made enemies on third crusade such as leopold v duke of austria by showing disrespect to his banners as well as refusing to share spoils of war and was rumoured to have arranged assassination of conrad of montferrat his ruthlessness was demonstrated by his massacre of 2 600 prisoners in acre he obtained victories during third crusade but failed to capture jerusalem according to steven runciman richard was a bad son a bad husband and a bad king jonathan riley smith described him as vain devious and self centred in an alternate view john gillingham points out that for centuries richard was considered a model king returning from crusade with a small band of followers richard was captured by leopold and was passed to emperor henry vi henry held richard captive for eighteen months 1192 1194 while his mother raised ransom valued at 100 000 marks in richard s absence philip ii overran large portions of normandy and john acquired control of richard s english lands after returning to england richard forgave

and his sister eleanor fair maid of brittany foolishly john disregarded his allies opinions on fate of prisoners many of them their neighbours and kinsmen instead he kept his prisoners so and in such evil distress that it seemed shameful and ugly to all those who were with him and who saw this cruelty according to l histoire de guillaume le marechal as a result of john s behaviour powerful thouars lusignan and des roches families rebelled and john lost control of anjou maine touraine and northern poitou his son king henry iii maintained claim to angevin territories until december 1259 when he formally surrendered them and in return was granted gascony as duke of aquitaine and a vassal of king of france john s reputation was further damaged by rumour described in margam annals that while drunk he himself had murdered arthur and if not true it is almost certain john ordered killing there are two contrasting schools of thought explaining sudden collapse of john s position sir james holt suggests this was inevitable result of superior french resources john gillingham identifies diplomatic and military mismanagement and points out that richard managed to hold angevin territory with comparable finances nick barratt has calculated that angevin resources available for use in war were 22 per cent less than those of phillip putting angevins at a disadvantage by 1214 john had re established his authority in england and planned what gillingham has called a grand strategy to recapture normandy and anjou plan was that john would draw french from paris while another army under his nephew otto iv holy roman emperor and his half brother william attacked from north he also brought his niece eleanor of brittany aiming to establish her as duchess of brittany plan failed when john s allies were defeated at battle of bouvines otto retreated and was soon overthrown william was captured by french and john agreed to a five year truce from then on john also gave up claim to

france and henry s stepfather hugh x of lusignan they both overran much of henry s remaining continental lands further eroding angevins power on continent in his political struggles henry perceived many similarities between himself and england s patron saint edward confessor consequently he named his first son edward and built existing magnificent shrine for confessor in early 1225 a great council approved a tax of ps40 000 to dispatch an army which quickly retook gascony during an assembly feudal prerogatives of king were challenged by barons bishops and magnates who demanded that king

capricious rule later they were joined by henry bolingbroke son and heir of john of gaunt and thomas de mowbray 1st duke of norfolk initially they were successful in establishing a commission to govern england for one year but they were forced to rebel against richard defeating an army under robert de vere earl of oxford at skirmish of bridge richard was reduced to a figurehead with little

quickly grew in numbers meeting little resistance henry deposed richard to have himself crowned henry iv of england richard died in captivity early next year probably murdered bringing an end to main

miniature of henry v s victory at battle of agincourt in 1415 from enguerrand de s chronique de france circa 1495 alt 15th century illuminated manuscript of battle of agincourt henry went to convoluted legal means to justify his succession many lancastrians asserted that his mother had had legitimate rights through her descent from edmund crouchback who it was claimed was elder son of henry iii of england set aside due to deformity as great grandson of lionel of antwerp 1st duke of clarence edmund mortimer earl of march was heir presumptive to richard ii and henry used multiple rationales stressing his plantagenet descent divine grace powerful friends and richard s misgovernment in fact mortimer never showed interest in throne later marriage of his sister anne to richard of conisburgh 3rd earl of cambridge consolidated this claim to throne with that of more junior house of york henry planned to resume war with france but was plagued with financial problems declining health and frequent rebellions he defeated a scottish invasion a serious rebellion by henry percy 1st earl of northumberland in north and owain glyndwr s rebellion in wales many saw it as a punishment from god when henry was later struck down with unknown but chronic illnesses henry iv died in 1413 his son and successor henry v of england aware that charles vi of france s mental illness had caused instability in france invaded to assert plantagenet claims and won a near total victory over french at battle of agincourt in subsequent years henry recaptured much of normandy and secured marriage to catherine of valois resulting treaty of troyes stated that henry s heirs would inherit throne of france but conflict continued with dauphin when henry died in 1422 his nine month old son succeeded him as henry vi of england during minority of henry vi war caused political division among his plantagenet uncles bedford humphrey of lancaster 1st duke of gloucester and cardinal beaufort humphrey s wife was accused of treasonable necromancy after two astrologers in her employ unwisely if honestly predicted a serious illness would endanger henry vi s life and humphrey was later arrested and died in prison depopulation stemming from black death led to increased wages static food costs and a resulting improvement in standard of living for peasantry however under henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed english economy to a pitiful state known as great slump economy was in ruins by 1450 a consequence of loss of france piracy in channel and poor trading relations with hanseatic league economic slowdown began in 1430s in north of country spreading south in 1440s with economy not recovering until 1480s it was also driven by multiple harvest failures in 1430s and disease amongst livestock which drove up price of food and damaged wider economy certain groups were particularly badly affected cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years at end of 1440s collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of south west crown s debts reached 000 henry s deficit was ps20 000 per annum and tax revenues were half those of his father house of york edward iii made his fourth son edmund first duke of york in 1362 edmund was married to isabella a daughter of king peter of castile and maria de padilla and sister of constance of castile who was second wife of edmund s brother john of gaunt both of edmund s sons were killed in 1415 richard became involved in southampton plot a conspiracy to depose henry v in favour of richard s brother in law edmund mortimer when mortimer revealed plot to king richard was executed for treason richard s childless older brother edward was killed at battle of agincourt later same year constance of york was edmund s only daughter and was an ancestor of queen anne neville increasingly interwoven plantagenet relationships were demonstrated by edmund s second marriage to joan holland her sister alianore holland was mother to richard s wife anne mortimer margaret holland another of joan s sisters married john of gaunt s son she later married thomas of lancaster john of gaunt s grandson by king henry iv a third sister eleanor holland was mother in law to richard neville 5th earl of s grandson by his daughter joan beaufort countess of westmorland these sisters were all granddaughters of joan of kent mother of richard ii and therefore plantagenet descendants of edward i edmund s son richard was married to anne mortimer daughter of roger mortimer 4th earl of march and eleanor holland and great granddaughter of edward iii s second surviving son lionel anne died giving birth to their only son in september 1411 richard s execution four years later left two orphans isabel who married into bourchier family and a son who was also called richard although his earldom was forfeited richard father was not attainted and four year old orphan richard was his heir within months of his father s death richard s childless uncle edward duke of york was killed at agincourt richard was allowed to inherit title of duke of york in 1426 in 1432 he acquired earldoms of march and ulster on death of his maternal uncle edmund mortimer earl of march who had died campaigning with henry v in france and earldom of cambridge which had belonged to his father being descended from edward iii in both maternal and paternal line gave richard a significant claim to throne if lancastrian line should fail and by cognatic primogeniture arguably a superior claim he emphasised point by being first to assume plantagenet surname in 1448 having inherited march and ulster titles he became wealthiest and most powerful noble in england second only to king himself richard married cecily neville a granddaughter of john of gaunt and had thirteen or possibly fifteen children joan b 1438 died as a child anne of york 1439 1476 mitochondrial dna taken from a descendant of her second daughter anne st leger baroness de ros was used in

ruling class was deeply shocked and reconciliation was attempted york and nevilles fled abroad but nevilles returned to win battle of northampton where they captured henry when richard of york joined them he surprised parliament by claiming throne and forcing through act of accord which stated that henry would remain as king for his lifetime but would be succeeded by york margaret found this

york tudor when henry tudor seized throne there were eighteen plantagenet descendants who might today be thought to have a stronger hereditary claim and by 1510 this number had been increased further by birth of sixteen yorkist children henry mitigated this situation with his marriage to elizabeth of york she was eldest daughter of edward iv and all their children were his cognatic heirs indeed polydore vergil noted henry viii s pronounced resemblance to his grandfather edward for just as edward was most warmly thought of by english people amongst all english kings so this successor of his henry was very much like him in general appearance in greatness of mind and generosity and for that reason was most acclaimed and approved of all this did not deter margaret of york duchess of s sister and elizabeth s members of de la pole of edward s sister and john de la pole 2nd duke of suffolk from frequent attempts to destabilise henry s regime henry imprisoned margaret s nephew edward earl of warwick son of her brother george in tower of london but in 1487 margaret financed a rebellion led by lambert simnel pretending to be edward john de la pole 1st earl of lincoln joined revolt probably anticipating that it would further his own ambitions to throne but he was killed in suppression of uprising at battle of stoke field in 1487 warwick was implicated by two further failed invasions supported by margaret using perkin warbeck pretending to be edward iv s son richard of shrewsbury and warbeck s later planned escape for them both warwick was executed in 1499 edward s execution may simply have been a precondition for marriage of arthur prince of wales to katherine of aragon in 1501 de la pole john de la pole s attainder meant that his brother edmund inherited their father s titles but much of wealth of duchy of suffolk was forfeit edmund did not possess sufficient finances to maintain his status as a duke so as a compromise he accepted title of earl of suffolk financial difficulties led to frequent legal conflicts and edmund s indictment for murder in 1501 he fled with his brother richard while their remaining brother william was imprisoned in he would remain until his death 37 years part of a general suppression of edmund s associates philip fair had been holding edmund and in 1506 he returned him to henry edmund was imprisoned in tower in 1513 he was executed after richard de la pole whom louis xii of france had recognised as king of england previous year claimed kingship in his own right richard known as white rose plotted an invasion of england for years but was killed in 1525 at battle of pavia while fighting as captain of french landsknechts during francois i of france s invasion of italy pole thumb cardinal reginald pole upright alt ancient oil painting of cardinal pole warwick s sister and therefore edward iv s niece margaret pole countess of salisbury was executed by henry viii in 1541 by then cause was more religious and political rather than dynastic attainder of her father clarence was a legal bar to any claims to throne by his children additionally her marriage arranged by henry vii to sir richard pole his half cousin and trusted supporter was not auspicious nevertheless it did allow couple to be closely involved in court affairs margaret s fortunes improved under henry viii and in february 1512 she was restored to earldom of salisbury and all warwicks lands this made her first and apart from anne boleyn only woman in 16th century england to hold a peerage title in her own right her daughter ursula married son of edward stafford 3rd duke of buckingham buckingham s fall after arguments with king over property and margaret s open support for catherine of aragon and princess mary began poles estrangement from king hope of reconciliation was dashed by de letter that margaret s son reginald pole wrote to henry viii in which reginald declared his opposition to royal supremacy in 1538 evidence came to light that pole family members in england had been in communication with reginald margaret s sons geoffrey and henry were arrested for treason along with several friends and associates including henry s wife and brother in neville among those arrested was king s cousin henry courtenay 1st marquess of exeter his wife and 11 year old son courteney s wife was released two years later but their son spent 15 years in tower until queen mary released him except for surviving geoffrey pole all others implicated were beheaded margaret was attainted possibility of an invasion involving reginald via her south coast estates and her embittered relationship with henry viii precluded any chance of pardon however decision to execute her seems a spontaneous rather than a premeditated act according to calendar of state papers her execution was botched at hands of a wretched and blundering youth who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in most pitiful manner in 1886 she was beatified by pope leo xiii on grounds she had laid down her life for holy see and for truth of orthodox faith stafford edward stafford duke of buckingham combined multiple lines of plantagenet descent from edward iii by his son thomas of woodstock from edward iii via two of his beaufort grandchildren and from edward i from joan of kent and holland family his father failed in his rebellion against richard iii in 1483 but was restored to his inheritance on reversal of his father s attainder late in 1485 his mother married henry vii s uncle jasper tudor and his wardship was entrusted to king s mother lady margaret beaufort in 1502 during henry vii s illness there was debate as to whether buckingham or edmund de la pole should act as regent for henry viii there is no evidence of continuous hostility between buckingham and henry viii but there is little doubt of duke s dislike of thomas wolsey whom he believed to be plotting to ruin old nobility therefore henry viii instructed wolsey to watch buckingham his brother henry stafford 1st earl of wiltshire and three other peers neither henry viii nor his father planned to destroy buckingham because of his lineage and henry viii even allowed buckingham s son and heir henry stafford 1st baron stafford to marry ursula pole giving staffords a further line of royal blood descent buckingham himself was arrested in april 1521 he was found guilty on 16 may and executed next day evidence was provided that duke had been listening to prophecies that he would be king and that tudor family lay under god s curse for execution of warwick this was said to explain henry viii s failure to produce a male heir much of this evidence consisted of ill judged comments speculation and bad temper but it underlined threat presented by buckingham s descent tudor succession as late as 1600 with tudor succession in doubt older plantagenet lines remained as possible claimants to a disputed throne and religious and dynastic factors gave rise to complications thomas wilson wrote in his report state of england anno domini 1600 that there were 12 competitors for succession at time of writing about 1601 wilson had been working on intelligence matters for lord buckhurst and sir robert cecil alleged competitors included five descendants of henry vii and elizabeth including eventual successor james i of england but also seven from older plantagenet lines henry hastings 3rd earl of huntingdon george hastings 4th earl of huntingdon charles neville 6th earl of westmorland henry percy 9th earl of northumberland
