djibouti francolin pternistis ochropectus or djiboutian francolin is one of over forty species of francolins a group of birds in phasianidae family it is critically endangered and found only in djibouti a nation in horn of africa this species is grayish brown overall with white stripes and streaks on its underparts which become finer towards upperparts it has black markings on head and a gray crown and has a short tail it is in length and weighs its natural habitat is high altitude subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of african juniper however juniper forests preferred by francolin are dying so it may be found in other habitats such as box tree forests this bird is only known from two locations in djibouti one of which is largely unsurveyed it can be found in small groups and is extremely shy it is known to feed on berries seeds and termites and it breeds between december and february it is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90 population decline in twenty years degrading of its juniper habitat through man made disturbances such as overgrazing is a major threat to francolin s survival ongoing conservation work includes restoration of some juniper forest and surveys to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness taxonomy birds in phasianidae family such as djibouti francolin are old world ground dwelling many of which are found in forests francolins are terrestrial birds that feed on insects vegetable matter and seeds most species have a hooked upper beak tails with fourteen feathers and in many of them male has tarsal spurs b p hall 1963 francolins a study in speciation pdf bulletin of british museum 10 2 105 204 of 41 extant species 36 are found solely in africa djibouti francolin was originally collected on february 22 1952 by captain military commander of tadjoura in foret du day it was then described by french ornithologists jean dorst and christian jouanin later that year as francolinus ochropectus in l oiseau et la revue francaise d urban 1986 p 65 its specific epithet is derived from ancient greek which means ochre and latin meaning breast other authors have since proposed moving species to other genera including and pternistis latter a move proposed in a recent attempt to reorganize francolinus and one which would include 23 other francolins though some still maintain all these in francolinus dickinson e c eds 2003 howard and moore complete checklist of birds of world 3rd edition split into multiple genera is becoming more widespread sinclair i ryan p 2003

authors although its status as a full species has been maintained it forms a superspecies with jackson s francolin handsome francolin chestnut naped francolin and s francolin it is particularly closely related to latter two species and is intermediate to them in both location and morphological features djibouti francolin has no recognized subspecies this species has formerly been named as ochre breasted francolin tadjoura francolin and pale bellied francolin to native people of djibouti it is known as description this francolin is a large rotund bird of approximately in length and in weight it is grayish brown overall with white stripes and streaks on its underparts which become finer toward head bird is darker on its back than on its underside nape has a hint of rufous while top of head is gray forehead lore and eye stripe form a black mask and chin and throat are whitish eyes are brown urban 1986 p 66 feathers on body and neck have a gold or straw colored center that is bordered with dark brown and edged in white tail is short bill is black with some yellow on lower mandible and djibouti francolin s legs are a greenish yellow sexes are similar although male averages slightly larger than female and has two prominent spurs on legs whereas female is virtually female also has more rufous in its tail juvenile resembles adults but is duller with buff barring rather than streaking on underparts call of this species is a rattling erk erk erk that descends into a chuckling gurgle feeding birds may give a low conversational clucking no other francolin share this bird s restricted range although yellow necked francolin occurs elsewhere in djibouti so it is unlikely to be confused with any other species distribution and habitat thumb breeding areas djibouti francolin is endemic to djibouti a nation in eastern africa and is known from only two locations one is foret du day in goda mountains approximately north of gulf of tadjoura this site is only and is undergoing habitat changes other site is located in mabla mountains which are northeast of foret du day and remain unsurveyed this site has been exposed to more human disturbance than foret du day and is therefore considered less viable combined total estimated range of this bird is this francolin prefers dense african juniper woodland with a closed canopy between in elevation and preferably on a plateau mixed in with this forest habitat are box trees buxus hildebrandtii and african olives olea europaea africana this francolin has been found in secondary woodland box tree woodlands buxus hildebrandtii and acacia woodland acacia it is also known to venture into more open woodland and wadis following breeding season much of bird s african juniper forest habitat has been damaged or destroyed due to human usage ability of this dead woodland to support djibouti francolin remains unknown although some juveniles have been seen in it it is believed that birds are reacting to destruction of their juniper habitat by trying to find habitat as close to it as possible it has been noted that due to decline of juniper buxus hildebrandtii is now dominant tree in areas most frequently inhabited by francolin ecology and behavior this species lives in small groups and is very shy often remaining in dense vegetation to avoid detection and therefore its ecology is very little studied it is believed that francolin may migrate from lower altitudes to higher altitudes and juniper forest in warmer months its main predator is common genet bird is most active and most likely to call between 6 am and 9 am after this it may spend most of day perched motionless in a tree up to above ground it eats berries seeds termites and figs it scratches ground to collect seeds and when it finds an area disturbed by warthogs also scratches ground for termites it is monogamous and breeds between december and february only one nest has been recorded this was located on a mountain ledge and was a shallow grass lined depression in earth these birds roost in nearby trees at heights of it is probably monogamous and local people say that clutch is typically 7 9 eggs but this is unconfirmed conservation thumb acacia woodland similar to that in which djibouti francolin is occasionally seen this species is considered critically endangered by iucn because it underwent a 90 population decrease over twenty years in 1977 there were an estimated 5600 birds in foret du day which was only known location for species at time by 1986 this number had dropped to 1500 individuals species was discovered at its second site in mabla mountains in 1986 while population in mabla mountains has yet to be surveyed numbers in foret du day continued to drop with 500 1000 djibouti francolins recorded in 1998 and only 115 135 in 2004 total world population in 2006 was estimated to be between 612 and 723 adults this species is threatened because of habitat destruction at foret du day site 95 of its preferred juniper habitat is dead or dying and is unable to support this bird while an overarching reason behind this destruction remains unknown overgrazing by cattle camels and goats is believed to have been a significant contributor along with rain climate change and a fungal disease hunting gathering of firewood egg collecting and general human disturbance are also believed to be threats at mabla mountains site habitat is also being degraded by collection of firewood and overgrazing in 1937 part of foret du day site was set aside as day forest national park this designation is no longer valid there have been studies of area and related environmental and economic issues involved very few of suggestions made by these surveys have been implemented partially due to unrest in djibouti since early 1990s in may 2008 of forest near village of day were set aside for a tree nursery in an attempt to restore some of francolin s damaged habitat surveys are under way to determine population sizes and current range including plans to survey largely unknown site in mabla mountains and potentially suitable areas in between two known sites a promotional campaign in local schools took place in 2008 to raise awareness for species relationship with humans majority of native people in areas surrounding francolin s range believe that species is important either because of its meat which may be eaten by muslims who comprise predominant religious group of region or because it is part of natural heritage of region while species is rarely eaten today due to its rarity decades ago species was so common that it was easily captured when it approached nearby villages djibouti francolin has been featured on two stamps one in 1989 from djibouti and another from
