royal edinburgh zoological gardens and predated modern edinburgh zoo by some 70 years after death of james donaldson a wealthy scottish publisher and bookseller gardens of his country house broughton hall were converted into a zoological park occupying a site park was situated about a mile to north east of central edinburgh near east claremont street naturalist john graham dalyell was one of original promoters of project and eventually president of board of directors zoological gardens opened in 1839 with a collection of stock zoo animals including lions tigers monkeys bears and an elephant at time animals in zoos were typically held in poor conditions in small cramped cages and zoological gardens presented no exception as a result its animals were frequently afflicted by disease and also suffered from harsh easterly winds of edinburgh climate despite these setbacks menagerie attempted to maintain its popularity by putting on concerts acrobatics shows and displays of fireworks and montgolfier balloons children were carried around park on back of zoo s elephant giving it a rare opportunity for exercise even with these entertainments zoological gardens were eventually forced to admit defeat park was closed and site sold to a property developer in 1857 nothing now remains of house or its gardens foundation thumbnail map showing location of zoo s corstorphine hill site within edinburgh thumbnail plan showing main areas of land owned by zoo and dates they were incorporated into park edinburgh zoo was created by thomas haining gillespie a solicitor from dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in scotland at first he was told that tropical animals would never be able to live in a cold climate like edinburgh s a view that had to some extent been borne out by failure of royal zoological gardens in 1908 though he was encouraged to read of pioneering methods employed by carl hagenbeck which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in recently opened tierpark hagenbeck in hamburg germany in 1909 gillespie and others founded a registered charity which was to become royal zoological society of scotland society s first president was lawyer and politician edward theodore salvesen son of norwegian merchant christian a connection which would prove significant in later years a series of lectures given to society by j arthur thomson gave yet more momentum to modern approach being spearheaded by hagenbeck in germany thumbnail left corstorphine hill house in grounds of which edinburgh zoo stands all that remained was to find a suitable site for new zoo gillespie hoped for a site with plenty of sun and with shelter from north and east winds he also intended zoo to be cheaply and quickly accessible via public transport society secured an option to purchase corstorphine hill house estate for ps17 000 house had been built in 1793 as home of scottish accountant william keith its current scottish baronial architecture is mostly thanks to remodelling by macmillan family in 1891 zoological society found they were having difficulty gathering necessary funds before approaching expiry of purchase option edinburgh city council stepped in purchasing site outright in february 1913 zoological society was granted full use of estate in return for a 4 percent annual repayment of cost a further ps8 000 raised with help of society s members was set aside for construction and stocking of park initially zoo occupied only southernmost while land to north was used as a golf course park was designed by town planner patrick geddes and his son in law frank mears following gillespie s vision they modeled park after open designs of zoos like new york zoological park and hagenbeck s zoo in hamburg these modern zoological parks promoted a more spacious and natural environment for animals and stood in stark contrast to steel cages typical of menageries built during victorian era scottish national zoological park as it was initially called opened to public with a large collection of donated and borrowed animals on 22 july 1913 after only 15 weeks of work zoo still occupies very much same area of land today though park is being extensively redeveloped early history in its opening year zoo was incorporated by royal charter though it was not granted use of royal title until 1948 following a visit by king george vi as of june 2011 edinburgh zoo was only zoo in britain with a royal charter original charter defined zoological society s mission as being to promote facilitate and encourage study of zoology and kindred subjects and to foster and develop amongst people an interest in and knowledge of animal life thanks to zoological society s connection with salvesen family some of zoo s first animals were three king penguins arriving from south georgia with a christian salvesen whaling expedition that docked in leith in early 1914 they were first penguins to be seen anywhere in world outside of south atlantic zoo successfully hatched first ever captive king penguin chick in 1919 penguins continued to arrive with whaling ships for years afterwards today king penguins are perhaps zoo s most famous animals a tropical bird and reptile house was added in 1925 followed by an aquarium paid for by a grant in 1927 and an ape house in 1929 now famous penguin pool was constructed in 1930 though it has since been rebuilt in 1990 to include a new viewing area it was in 1928 that corstorphine golf club finally evacuated to north of estate allowing zoo to expand significantly this new area of park was again designed by mears along with his partner carus wilson and was completed in 1937 hagenbeck s modern zoo techniques proved effective and edinburgh quickly gained a reputation for its good animal conditions 1934 saw births in captivity of a sea lion and beaver and in 1936 a baby chimpanzee followed a litter of wolves was born in 1938 and soon afterwards first orangutan to be born in britain war years edinburgh zoo was bombed twice during second world war but remained mostly unharmed one of bombs in around 1940 was reported to have killed a giraffe nevertheless edinburgh was like all zoos in britain affected by war since bombs could fall at any time it was not considered safe to keep dangerous animals that might escape if their enclosures were damaged in 1941 recently born wolves had therefore to be euthanized along with a collection of dangerous snakes to guard against any possible danger to public despite war zoo continued to grow with land to east being purchased in 1942 and construction of a lake beginning soon afterwards post war era gillespie retired from his post as director in 1950 in 1956 he was succeeded by gilbert fisher who took over as director secretary of zoological society and effectively gained control of zoo thumbnail penguin parade in 1985 it was around this time that edinburgh zoo s now famous penguin parade was established a zookeeper accidentally left a gate to penguin pool open and was followed around zoo by a train of penguins visitors were so delighted with procession that it became a regular occurrence and today around two thirds of zoo s penguins parade round park every day thumbnail left woytek with a polish soldier in 1942 some years before woytek came to scotland one of zoo s famous inhabitants during post war period was voytek a syrian brown bear voytek had been sold to a group of polish soldiers during war he learned to help soldiers by carrying crates of ammunition and became an unofficial mascot in 1944 polish ii corps sailed to italy to join british 8th army voytek had to be officially drafted into polish army in order to secure his passage on a british transport ship in 1946 ii corps were demobilised and settled in scotland at winfield camp near hutton berwickshire voytek retired to edinburgh zoo in 1947 and lived there until his death in 1963 during his time in army voytek had developed a liking for cigarettes and this may have contributed to his popularity as an attraction at zoo in 1972 zoo gained yet more military credentials when king penguin nils olav was adopted by norwegian king s guard norway s connection with edinburgh s penguins began with salvesen family s links to zoo and renewed interest was sparked when a lieutenant called nils egelien visited zoo with king s guard in 1961 on his return in 1972 egelien arranged for unit to adopt one of penguins nils olav was named after egelien and in honour of king olav v of norway and given rank of lance corporal a statue of penguin now stands outside zoo three year old polar bear mercedes was given to zoo in 1984 after she was rescued in churchill manitoba canada she had begun wandering into town in search of food because of danger she posed to residents mercedes was tagged with a number so she could be tracked when she could not be persuaded to return to wild a decision was taken to shoot her a member of edinburgh zoological society collaborated with a cousin in canada and they were able to rescue mercedes finding her a new home at edinburgh zoo bear would become one of zoo s most popular attractions in 1986 society acquired highland wildlife park a safari park and zoo near kingussie south of inverness when opened in 1972 by neil macpherson wildlife park s goal was to showcase animals native to highlands of scotland today its focus has changed and it primarily houses tundra species including some animals which have been moved from edinburgh zoo itself 21st century in october 1999 zoo had begun to explore possibility of relocating in order to improve its facilities as of february 2000 zoo had scrapped its plans to relocate instead announcing a masterplan for redevelopment of entire site foot and mouth scare of 2001 forced zoo to close to protect animals from possible infection since zoo could not welcome any visitors it faced significant financial losses questions were posed about zoo s future though in end park was able to reopen after only five weeks further help came in form of a ps1 9 million donation from an anonymous former resident of city in early april just as zoo reopened in 2005 new chimp house was unveiled along with living links to human evolution centre britain s first primate behaviour research site in a scientific breakthrough in 2006 chimpanzees at edinburgh were found to use word like vocal labels for food thumbnail polar bear mercedes at edinburgh zoo in 2006 in late 2005 animal liberation front alf threatened action over holding in captivity of mercedes then britain s only polar bear zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after mercedes died when zoo officials announced plans to create a new attraction citing their responsibility to ensure survival of species alf threatened damage to zoo workers property and other scare tactics edinburgh s treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism punctuated by incidents like death in 1997 of mercedes partner barney who choked on a plastic child s toy thrown into his enclosure in 2009 zoo carried out their plans to create a new exhibit and improve conditions for mercedes moving her to highland wildlife park where she was joined by a young male polar bear named walker mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011 suffering from severe arthritis 2007 council troubles in january 2006 zoo put forward plans to sell off of land in order to raise funds for ongoing redevelopment plans were rejected by council in october 2007 by a single vote leaving zoological society extremely disappointed in november zoo announced that it planned to fight council s decision a rumor circulated later that month that zoo was considering a move to glasgow though zoo officials insisted rumor had no truth to it organised opposition to sale resulted in zoo being allowed to sell only a small portion of originally proposed land references
