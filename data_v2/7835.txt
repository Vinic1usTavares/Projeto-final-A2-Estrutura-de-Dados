russula brevipes is a species of mushroom commonly known as short stemmed russula or stubby brittlegill it is widespread in north america and was reported from pakistan in 2006 fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with trees from several genera including fir spruce douglas fir and hemlock fruit bodies are white and large with convex to funnel shaped caps measuring wide set atop a thick stipe up to long gills on cap underside are closely spaced and sometimes have a faint bluish tint spores are roughly spherical and have a network like surface dotted with warts mushrooms of russula brevipes often develop under masses of conifer needles or leaves of broadleaved trees and fruit from summer to autumn forms of mushroom that develop a bluish band at top of stipe are sometimes referred to as variety acrior although edible russula brevipes mushrooms have a bland or bitter flavor they become more palatable once parasitized by ascomycete fungus hypomyces lactifluorum a bright orange mold that covers fruit body and transforms them into lobster mushrooms taxonomy russula brevipes was initially described by american mycologist charles horton peck in 1890 from specimens collected in quogue new york it is classified in subsection a grouping of similar russula species characterized by having whitish to pale yellow fruit bodies compact and hard flesh abundant lamellulae short gills and absence of clamp connections other related russula species with a similar range of spore ornamentation heights include russula delica r and r there has been considerable confusion in literature over naming of russula brevipes some early 20th century american mycologists referred to it as russula delica although that fungus was described from europe by elias fries with a description not accurately matching north american counterparts fries s concept of r delica included a white fruit body that did not change color a smooth shiny cap and thin widely spaced gills to add to confusion rolf singer and later robert kuhner and henri romagnesi described other species they named russula delica robert shaffer summarized taxonomic conundrum in 1964 russula delica is a species that everybody knows so to speak but evidence indicates that r delica sensu fries 1838 is not r delica sensu singer 1938 which in turn is not r delica sensu kuhner and romagnesi 1953 it is best to use r brevipes for north american collections which most authors but not kuhner and romagnesi 1953 call r delica name r brevipes is attached to a type collection has a reasonably explicit original description and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed shaffer defined russula brevipes varieties acrior and megaspora in 1964 from californian specimens former is characterized by a greenish blue band that forms at top of stipe while latter variety has large spores nomenclatural database index fungorum does not consider these varieties to have independent taxonomical significance in a 2012 publication mycologist mike davis and colleagues suggest that western north american russula brevipes comprise a complex of at least four distinct species according to mycobank european species russula is synonymous with r brevipes although index fungorum and other sources consider them distinct species specific epithet brevipes is derived from latin words brevis short and pes foot hence short footed common names used to refer to mushroom include short stemmed russula short stalked white russula and stubby brittlegill description thumb left a greenish band can develop at top of stipe alt closeup of a white mushroom showing a bluish green band of color at intersection of gills and stipe fully grown cap can range from in diameter whitish to dull yellow and is funnel shaped with a central depression gills are narrow and thin decurrent in attachment nearly white when young but becoming pale yellow to buff with age and sometimes forked near stipe stipe is 3 8 cm long and 2 5 4 cm thick it is initially white but develops yellowish brownish discolorations with age mushroom sometimes develops a pale green band at top of stipe spore print is white to light cream spores of r brevipes are egg shaped to more or less spherical and measure 7 5 10 by 6 5 8 5 um they have a partially reticulate network like surface dotted with warts measuring up to 1 um high cap cuticle is arranged in form of a cutis characterized by hyphae that run parallel to cap surface comprising interwoven hyphae with rounded tips there are no cystidia on cap pileocystidia variant r brevipes var acrior shaffer has a subtle green shading at stipe apex and on gills r brevipes var megaspora has spores measuring 9 14 by 8 12 um similar species thumb right russula delica is one of several r brevipes look alikes subalpine waxy cap hygrophorus is somewhat similar in appearance to r brevipes but lacks its brittle flesh and it has a sticky glutinous cap pacific northwest species russula cascadensis also resembles r brevipes but has an acrid taste and smaller fruit bodies another lookalike r has gills that often fork near stipe attachment r is quite similar to r brevipes but has narrower spores measuring 6 5 8 5 by 4 5 5 um and it does not have pale greenish band that sometimes develops in latter species european look alike r delica is widely distributed although rarer in northern regions of continent similar to r brevipes in overall morphology it has somewhat larger spores 9 12 by 7 8 5 um with a surface ornamentation featuring prominent warts interconnected by a zebra like patterns of ridges milk cap mushroom lactifluus can be distinguished from r brevipes by production of latex when mushroom tissue is cut or injured distribution and habitat it is a common ectomycorrhizal fungus associated with several hosts across temperate forest ecosystems typical hosts include trees in genera abies picea pseudotsuga and tsuga fungus has been reported in pakistan s himalayan moist temperate forests associated with pinus fruit bodies grow singly or in groups fruiting season occurs from summer to autumn in western north america where mushroom is quite common it is encountered most frequently in late autumn mushrooms are usually found as low partially emerged mounds on forest floor and have often been partially consumed by mammals such as rodents or deer studies have demonstrated that geographically separated r brevipes populations globally and continentally develop significant genetic differentiation suggesting that gene flow between these populations is small in contrast there was little genetic differentiation observed between populations sampled from a smaller area less than approximately 1000 meters r brevipes is one of several russula species that associates with heterotrophic orchid edibility russula brevipes is a non descript edible species that tends to assume flavors of meats and sauces it is cooked with it is one of several russula species harvested in wild from mexico s popo national park and sold in local markets in nearby mushrooms are suitable for pickling due to their crisp texture fruit bodies are commonly parasitized by ascomycete hypomyces lactifluorum transforming them into an edible known as a lobster mushroom in this form surface of fruit body develops into a hard thin crust dotted with minute pimples and gills are reduced to blunt ridges flesh of mushroom normally brittle and crumbly becomes compacted and less breakable bioactive compounds sesquiterpene lactones are a diverse group of biologically active compounds that are being investigated for their antiinflammatory and antitumor activities some of these compounds have been isolated and chemically characterized from russula brevipes a and 24 ethyl 7
