2009 atlantic hurricane season was a below average atlantic hurricane season that produced eleven tropical cyclones nine named storms three hurricanes and two major hurricanes it officially began on june 1 and ended on november 30 dates that conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in atlantic basin season s first tropical cyclone tropical depression one developed on may 28 while final storm hurricane ida dissipated on november 10 most intense hurricane bill was a powerful cape verde type hurricane that affected areas from leeward islands to newfoundland season featured lowest number of tropical cyclones since 1997 season and only one system claudette made landfall in united states forming from interaction of a tropical wave and an upper level low claudette made landfall on florida panhandle with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h before quickly dissipating over alabama storm killed two people and caused 228 000 2009 usd in damage pre season forecasts issued by colorado state university csu called for fourteen named storms and seven hurricanes of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status a major hurricane is a storm that ranks as category 3 or higher on saffir simpson hurricane scale national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa later issued its initial forecast which predicted nine to fourteen named storms four to seven hurricanes and one to three major hurricanes after several revisions in projected number of named storms both agencies lowered their forecasts by middle of season several storms made landfall or directly affected land outside of united states tropical storm ana brought substantial rainfall totals to many of caribbean islands including puerto rico which led to minor street flooding hurricane bill delivered gusty winds and rain to island of newfoundland while tropical storm danny affected u s state of north carolina and erika affected lesser antilles as a poorly organized tropical system hurricane fred affected cape verde islands as a developing tropical cyclone and tropical storm grace briefly impacted azores becoming farthest northeast forming storm on record season s final storm ida affected portions of central america before bringing significant rainfall to southeast united states as an extratropical cyclone seasonal forecasts predictions of

outlooks on june 2 2009 klotzbach s team issued another updated forecast for 2009 season predicting slightly below average activity 11 named storms 5 hurricanes 2 of category 3 or higher and ace index of 85 also on june 2 2009 florida state university center for ocean atmospheric prediction studies fsu coaps issued its first ever atlantic hurricane season forecast fsu coaps forecast predicted 8 named storms including 4 hurricanes and an ace index of 65 on june 18 2009 uk met office ukmo issued a forecast of 6 tropical storms in july to november period with a 70 chance that number would be in range 3 to 9 they also predicted an ace index of 60 with a 70 chance that index would be in range 40 to 80 on august 4 2009 klotzbach s team updated their forecast for 2009 season again predicting slightly below average activity 10 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes on august 6 2009 noaa also updated their forecast for 2009 season predicting below average activity 7 11 named

eleven tropical cyclones affected land of which five actually made landfall most of damage resulted from hurricane bill which caused severe beach erosion throughout east coast of united states in united states tropical cyclones killed six people and caused roughly 46 million in damage in lesser antilles tropical storms ana and erika brought moderate rainfall to several islands but resulted in little damage elsewhere in atlantic azores islands atlantic canada bermuda cape verde islands and wales were affected by tropical cyclones or their remnants in canada hurricane bill produced widespread moderate rainfall in nova scotia and newfoundland leaving roughly 10 million in losses hurricane also produced tropical storm force winds in bermuda hurricane fred briefly impacted southern cape verde islands as it bypassed islands early in its existence azores and wales were also affected by tropical storm grace however both areas recorded only minor effects overall season s activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 53 lowest since 1997 due to low number of storms in 2009 season many of which were short lived overall ace value was ranked as below average totaling under 66 hurricane bill was responsible for ace value for august being 30 above average ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength subtropical cyclones are excluded from total systems tropical depression one during mid may a frontal boundary stalled near bahamas and slowly degenerated on may 25 2009 an area of low pressure developed along tail end of a decaying cold front near northern bahamas tracking northward this low gradually developed as it moved within 85 mi 140 km of north carolina s outer banks by may 28 deep convection developed across a small area over low pressure system leading to national hurricane center classifying system as tropical depression one depression moved over warm waters of gulf stream for following 24 hours allowing it to maintain its convection before moving into a hostile environment characterized by strong wind shear and cooler waters late on may 29 system degenerated into a remnant low several hours later on may 30 about 345 mi 555 km south southeast of halifax nova scotia tropical depression one was absorbed by a warm front as a tropical cyclone depression had no impact on land however precursor to system brought scattered rainfall and increased winds to parts of north carolina coastline but no damage upon becoming a tropical depression on may 28 tropical depression one became northernmost forming may tropical cyclone in atlantic history though subtropical cyclones formed equally far north in 1972 and 2007 it also marked third consecutive year with pre season tropical or subtropical cyclones in basin tropical storm ana ana formed out of an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on august 11 ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on august 12 before weakening back to a depression following day system degenerated into a non convective remnant low as it tracked westward on august 14 depression regenerated roughly 1 075 mi 1 735 km east of leeward islands early on august 15 storm re attained tropical storm status at which time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40 mph 65 km h and a barometric pressure of 1003 mbar hpa 29 65 inhg storm began to weaken again due to increasing wind shear and unusually fast movement of ana in post storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on august 16 before reaching any landmasses numerous tropical storm watches were issued for lesser antilles puerto rico and dominican republic between august 15 and 17 several islands took minor precautions for storm including st croix which evacuated 40 residents from flood prone areas ahead of storm in dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall in puerto rico up to causing street flooding and forcing evacuation of three schools high winds associated with storm also downed trees and power lines leaving roughly 6 000 residents without power hurricane bill as ana regenerated into a tropical depression a new tropical depression developed early on august 15 southwest of cape verde islands light wind shear and warm waters allowed depression to steadily intensify becoming tropical storm bill later that day by august 17 bill attained hurricane status about midway between cape verde islands and lesser antilles eventually hurricane attained its peak intensity as a category 4 storm roughly 345 mi 555 km east northeast of leeward islands storm attained maximum winds of 130 mph 215 km h highest of any storm during season before weakening slightly as it turned north large storm passed roughly 175 mi 280 km west of bermuda as a category 2 hurricane further weakening took place as bill brushed southern coast of nova scotia following day shortly before making landfall in newfoundland bill weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated storm eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after moving over north atlantic before being absorbed by a larger non tropical low on august 24 two people were killed by storm s large swells one in maine and another in florida hurricane came close enough to warrant tropical cyclone watches and warnings in both us and canada bill was one of three tropical storms active on august 16 large life threatening swells produced by storm impacted north facing coastlines of puerto rico and hispaniola as hurricane bill approached bermuda along coasts of north carolina waves averaging in height impacted beaches on long island beach damage was severe in some areas damage was worse than hurricane gloria in 1985 in new york severe beach erosion caused by storm resulted in over 35 5 million in losses tropical storm claudette just one day after formation of hurricane bill season s third named storm developed on august 16 forming out of a tropical wave and an upper level low pressure system claudette quickly intensified into a tropical storm offshore south of tallahassee florida by afternoon storm had attained winds of 60 mph 95 km h and steadily tracked towards florida panhandle early on august 17 center of claudette made landfall on santa rosa island several hours after landfall storm weakened to a tropical depression and hydrometeorological prediction center took over primary responsibility of storm system quickly dissipated and was last noted over alabama on august 18 national hurricane center issued tropical storm warnings for florida coastline and residents in some counties were advised to evacuate storm surge prone areas tropical storm claudette produced moderate rainfall across portions of florida georgia and alabama between august 16 and 18 two people were killed offshore amidst rough seas from storm an ef 0 tornado spawned by storm in cape coral damaged 11 homes leaving 103 000 in damages additional damages to coastal property and beaches amounted to 125 000 as a result of claudette tropical storm danny around same time remnants of hurricane bill dissipated over northern atlantic a new tropical storm developed near bahamas on august 26 system immediately declared tropical storm danny on its first advisory erratically moved in a general northwestward direction danny attained peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h before succumbing to high wind shear after turning northward storm weakened and was eventually absorbed by another low pressure system off east coast of united states early on august 29 high waves from danny killed a boy in outer banks tropical storm erika on september 1 season s fifth named storm tropical storm erika formed east of lesser antilles upon forming storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph 85 km h persistent wind shear prevented system from intensifying and resulted in storm s convection being completely displaced from center of circulation by time it passed over guadeloupe on september 2 after entering caribbean sea erika briefly regained strength before fully succumbing to strong shear system eventually dissipated on september 4 to south of puerto rico damages were minor though one island received several inches of rain hurricane fred several days after erika dissipated a new tropical depression formed southeast of cape verde islands on september 7 this depression rapidly intensified within an environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures receiving name fred on september 8 storm quickly developed an eye feature and was upgraded to a hurricane roughly 24 hours after being named within a 12 hour span storm s winds increased by 40 mph 65 km h to its peak of 120 mph 195 km h upon reaching this intensity fred became strongest storm on record south of 30degn and east of 35degw in atlantic basin not long after intensification ceased it began to weaken as dry air became entrained within system by september 11 storm nearly stalled northwest of cape verde islands and weakened to a tropical storm following day fred degenerated into a remnant low before taking a westward track across atlantic remnants of fred persisted for nearly a week nearly regenerating into a tropical depression several times low eventually dissipated on september 19 to south of bermuda tropical depression eight in late september a new well defined tropical wave moved off west coast of africa into atlantic ocean by september 25 system had developed sufficient deep convection for nhc to classify it as tropical depression eight at this time depression attained its peak intensity with winds of 35 mph 55 km h and a minimum pressure of 1008 mbar hpa shortly thereafter wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused depression to weaken system degenerated into a remnant low on september 26 before degenerating into a trough of low pressure tropical storm grace originating from an extratropical cyclone east of newfoundland on september 27 precursor to tropical storm grace tracked southeastward towards azores gaining subtropical characteristics after executing a counterclockwise loop between october 1 and 3 deep convection wrapped around a small circulation center that had developed within larger cyclone on october 4 this smaller low developed into a tropical storm while situated near azores islands becoming northeastern most forming atlantic tropical cyclone on record storm quickly turned northeastward and intensified developing an eye like feature as it attained peak winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a minimum pressure of 986 mbar hpa 29 11 inhg it weakened over increasingly colder waters and began merging with an approaching frontal boundary early on october 6 grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating later that day near wales although grace passed through azores islands storm had little known effects there in europe system and its remnants brought rain to several countries including portugal united kingdom and belgium no fatalities were linked to grace and overall damage was minimal tropical storm henri a tropical wave left coast of africa on october 1 moving westward with intermittent showers and thunderstorms on october 5 system became better organized and a low pressure area formed although thunderstorms were displaced east of center of circulation and probability for development was never high disturbance became a tropical depression around 0000 utc on october 6 about east of lesser antilles operationally storm was not designated a tropical cyclone until later on october 6 when it was immediately declared a tropical storm affected by strong wind shear henri remained disorganized with its center located on western edge of convection moving northwestward henri intensified slightly to peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h on october 7 after convection increased shortly thereafter wind shear grew stronger and on october 8 storm weakened to a tropical depression structure became further disorganized with several low level vortices just twelve hours after weakening into a depression henri degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure remnants continued northwestward before turning to west southwest due to a ridge on october 11 storm s circulation dissipated near hispaniola having never impacted land hurricane ida final storm of 2009 season formed over southern caribbean sea on november 4 slow moving system quickly developed into tropical storm ida within a favorable environment as it neared coastline of nicaragua several hours before moving over land ida attained hurricane status with winds reaching 80 mph 130 km h hours after moving inland ida weakened to a tropical storm and further to a tropical depression as it turned northward on november 7 depression re entered caribbean sea and quickly intensified early on november 8 system re attained hurricane intensity as it rapidly intensified over warm waters ida attained its peak intensity as a category 2 hurricane early next day with winds of 105 mph 165 km h as it moved over yucatan channel not long after reaching this intensity ida quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it entered gulf of mexico despite strong wind shear storm briefly re attained hurricane status for a third time near southeastern louisiana coastline before quickly weakening to a tropical storm shortly before moving inland over southern united states ida transitioned into an extratropical cyclone remnants of ida persisted until november 11 at which time low dissipated remnant energy from ida provided energy for another system which became a powerful nor easter causing significant damage in mid atlantic states resulting storm came to be known as nor ida in southern caribbean hurricane ida caused roughly 2 1 million in damage in nicaragua after destroying numerous homes and leaving an estimated 40 000 people homeless ida also produced significant rainfall across portions of western cuba with some areas recording up to of rain during storm s passage in united states hurricane and subsequent nor easter caused substantial damage mainly in mid atlantic states one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others were killed in various incidents related to nor easter overall two systems caused nearly 300 million in damage throughout country storm names following list of names was used for named storms that formed in north atlantic in 2009 this was same list used in 2003 season with exceptions of fred ida and joaquin which replaced fabian isabel and juan respectively names fred and ida were used for first time this year there were no names retired this year thus same list was used again in 2015 season ana bill claudette danny erika fred grace henri ida season effects this is a table of all of storms that formed in 2009 atlantic hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s denoted by bold location names damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals
