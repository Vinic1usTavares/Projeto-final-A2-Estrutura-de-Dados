modern life phineas and ferb co founders dan povenmire and jeff swampy marsh utilized several recurring elements in episodes that they wrote among these were actions sequences and chase scenes povenmire and marsh wanted to reuse these elements in their series and chose perry to execute it pair gave him a consistent and continuous nemesis in form of doofenshmirtz as a means of allowing viewers to get to know him while choosing a species for perry povenmire and marsh wanted to keep in mind selecting one that was uncommon an animal that kids could not pick out at a pet store and beg their parents for they chose a platypus because of animal s obscure and striking appearance animal was scarcely used in american animated programs so pair opined that perry would not have to compete with preconceived notions that viewers might bring to a more conventional critter blank storyboard they were given allowed them to make stuff up since no one knows very much about them perry has a
