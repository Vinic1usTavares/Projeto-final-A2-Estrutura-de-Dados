led by satchel paige feller s team included stan musial and phil rizzuto while paige s included buck o neil and hilton smith they played in 22 games across united states and at conclusion of tour each

feller pitched on opening day against st louis browns during game he injured his shoulder and missed rest of april his performances were mixed in rest of season and he finished year with a 15 14 record and a 3 75 era before 1950 season feller suggested to indians management he take a pay cut and did so indians general manager hank greenberg said he himself made suggestion in fact he offered

doubleheader feller became 53rd pitcher to win 200 games throughout year players noted that his velocity had returned and winning games with finesse rather than power he was again effective he finished year with 16 wins and a 3 43 era on july 1 1951 feller recorded his third career no hitter against detroit tigers i was depending on my slider and i didn t begin to think of a no hitter until about seventh inning i tried to keep it in back of my mind bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time feller said feller was third pitcher after larry corcoran and cy young to record three career no hitters he became first pitcher of 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against washington senators on august 21 along with early wynn and mike garcia feller reached 20

an appearance indians were swept in four games by giants indians manager al lopez said of not starting feller i know feller wanted to start one of games in 1954 world series when indians were swept by new york giants though we never really talked about it if we had won first or second game in new york i was going to start feller in cleveland in fourth game but when we didn t win either game in new york why in hell was i going to pitch feller he was fifth starter on club at that time and wasn t feller he d been earlier in his career in 1955 feller spent part of season as a starter then was moved

cleveland later this week and plan to confer with hank greenberg before christmas i hope to reach a decision at that time greenberg had also offered feller his release or a job with indians in their front office greenberg said we sincerely want feller to remain with us as far as i m concerned there will always be a job waiting for bob in cleveland organization on december 28 feller officially retired from indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance announcing his retirement feller said i could have gone with a couple other ball clubs but anything i might have done with them would have taken edge off success i have had with cleveland club last 20 years he continued what if i did pitch another year so what i would have to come to decision i am making now some time he spent his entire career of 18 seasons with indians being one of big four in indians pitching rotation in 1950s along with bob lemon early wynn and mike garcia feller shares major league record of 12 one

indians retired his jersey number 19 on december 27 1956 in 1962 feller was elected to national baseball hall of fame and museum along with jackie robinson both were first to be elected on their first ballot appearance since original induction class of 1936 at time of his induction only ty cobb 98 2 babe ruth 95 1 and honus wagner 95 1 had a higher percentage of ballot votes in 2010 after feller had been admitted to hospice a reporter released a story recalling a 2007 interview with an aged feller where he brought up feller and robinson s occasional dislike for each other they jackie robinson he was a good baserunner he was a fair hitter he was an average second baseman he was not as good a ballplayer as larry doby there were a lot of better black ballplayers than jackie robinson said feller dispute with commissioner chandler throughout his career feller played exhibition games during off season playing in towns unaccustomed to seeing major league ballplayers his exhibition tours often featured other big leaguers and negro league players like satchel paige who was also a teammate of feller s with indians other players included stan musial mickey vernon and jeff heath during a barnstorming tour in 1945 feller pitched against jackie robinson after he had been signed by brooklyn dodgers he told a reporter in los angeles he believed robinson was too muscle bound to succeed against pitching in major leagues although robinson recorded two hits off feller players had to notify commissioner of baseball a b happy chandler before participating in exhibition games and were not allowed to begin games before conclusion of major league season feller wrote to chandler challenging league s limit on number of games that were allowed to be played and proposing an increase commissioner agreed to feller s proposal to minimize travel time feller employed airplanes such as two dc 3s in 1947 to transport players from town to town feller s involvement as well as that of other major league players was subject of meetings between commissioner and al and nl presidents in 1947 feller announced that he would pitch in cuban winter league during off season but commissioner chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in cuba feller said he would donate his profits from playing in cuban winter league to american major league players pension fund i want to prove i m not going to cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession feller also believed it was grossly unfair that major leaguers who were u s citizens could not play in winter leagues but latin americans were permitted indians owner and president bill veeck said i have no comment on bob s outside activities i don t know whether they ve hurt him or not but i do know this great majority of people of cleveland think they ve hurt him feller s barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details made him one of wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family his first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given wrong type of blood during transfusions she subsequently became addicted to prescribed medication for her condition feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result since he missed out on over 200 000 in salary when he served in navy he missed more than three major league seasons feller s biographer john sickels suggested they were trying to make money but part of it was also he felt that black players weren t necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it and seeing those i think those exhibition games helped people realize that negro league players were just as good as major league players records thumb feller in march 2009 feller estimated that military service cost him at least 100 career wins based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons it is likely that feller would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3 800 strikeouts feller said i know in my heart i would have ended up a lot closer to 400 than 300 if i hadn t spent four seasons in navy but don t take that as a complaint i m happy i got home in one piece there is footage of a feller fastball being clocked by army ordnance equipment used to measure artillery shell velocity and registering at however this took place in later years of his career and speed of ball was measured as it crossed plate whereas later methods measure speed as it leaves pitcher s hand with primitive equipment feller was at one point measured at feller once mentioned that he was clocked at at lincoln park in chicago he also threw second fastest pitch ever officially recorded at in a game in 1946 at griffith stadium feller said a 1974 test involving nolan ryan would be evaluated when he threw ball rather than when it reached home plate and as columnist milton richman wrote feller said sandy koufax had best live fast ball he ever saw ted williams said three days before he pitched i would start thinking about robert feller bob feller i d sit in my room thinking about him all time god i loved it allie reynolds of yankees was tough and i might think about him for 24 hours before a game but robert feller i d think about him for three days feller was ranked 36th on sporting news s list of 100 greatest baseball players and also publication s greatest pitcher of his time as well as a finalist for major league
