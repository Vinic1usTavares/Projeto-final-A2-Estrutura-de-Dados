name letter effect is tendency of people to prefer letters in their name over other letters in alphabet whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of alphabet rate each of letters choose letter they prefer out of a set of two or pick a small set of letters they most prefer on average people consistently like letters in their own name most crucially subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name discovered in 1985 by belgian psychologist jozef nuttin name letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies involving subjects from over 15 countries using four different alphabets it holds across age and gender people who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer letters of both their current and original names over non name letters effect is most prominent for initials but even when initials are excluded remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non name letters most people like themselves name is associated with self and hence letters of name are preferred despite fact that they appear in many other words people who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit name letter effect a similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays people tend to prefer number signifying day of month on which they were born alternative explanations for name letter effect such as frequent exposure and early mastery have been ruled out in psychological assessments name letter preference task is widely used to estimate implicit self esteem there is some evidence that effect has implications for real life decisions in lab people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials an analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter e g kate and kevin following hurricane katrina studies that investigate impact of name letter matching on bigger life decisions where to live whom to marry which occupation to take on are controversial background systematic interest in letter preference began in 1959 with brand preference studies by researchers and horton these tried to find relative appeal of letters for use in package labels in an extension of studies subjects were asked to rank english alphabet by pleasantness of appearance of capital letters while there was not a great deal of agreement amongst subjects coefficients of concordance were low a strong positive correlation was found between a letter s average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names robert zajonc a social psychologist published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of words e g on or off in overwhelming majority of trials preferred word was also most common zajonc also tested preferences for nonsense words and found that people liked them more they heard them he interpreted these results as evidence that mere repeated exposure to a stimulus is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness around 1977 belgian experimental psychologist jozef nuttin was driving on a highway looking at license plates when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name he wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them a mere as opposed to zajonc s mere exposure first study in his lab at universiteit leuven nuttin designed experiments to test hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name it was crucial to experimental design to rule out other factors particularly mere exposure if letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency then a preference for one s own letters might arise from mere exposure effect method first 11 stimuli for a jacobs a u a u m d m d t r t r i g i g v s v s e n e n a p a p l m l m h f h f e i e i j k j k to find an effect which ruled out mere exposure nuttin created a yoked control design in which two subjects evaluated same letters separately some of letters belonged to one subject s name and some of letters belonged to other subject s name while some were random in this design any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether letter occurred in their name for example take fictitious pair irma maes and jef jacobs as shown in table first stimulus is a and u last letter of irma s first name and a letter not in her name next stimulus is m and d penultimate letter from irma s first name and a letter not part of her name as can be seen in table this is repeated for remaining letters of irma s first name letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order and finally letters of both of jef s names shading in table reveals pattern hidden to subjects who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking in first trial 38 dutch speaking local elementary school girls circled letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs a significant preference for letters of one s own name over those of other person was found second experiment used 98 dutch speaking local university students to see if more years of reading made a difference four other factors were varied 1 either pairs or triads of letters 2 encircling preferred letter or crossing out less preferred one s 3 letters qxyz infrequent in dutch included or excluded 4 own name letters presented first or last all conditions gave a name letter effect with a stronger effect when qxyz were included and less preferred letter was crossed out no significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names while effect was strongest for initials subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without first and last initial discussion nuttin concluded that experiments showed that independent of visual acoustical aesthetic semantic and frequency characteristics letters belonging to one s own first and family names are preferred above other letters he framed effect in context of narcissism gestalt theory and awareness as reflected in title of his 1985 article narcissism beyond gestalt and awareness name letter effect in which beyond gestalt refers to fact that subjects were not shown names only letters in isolation and beyond awareness to fact that subjects did not realize that letters of their own names were used nuttin claimed effect he found was first to go beyond gestalt and awareness second study in 1987 nuttin published his second study describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with help of hilde sas because of far reaching implications of name letter effect for psychological theories nuttin found it wise to first test effect s generality and robustness before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding underlying affective and cognitive processes at work he wondered whether effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities or whether first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of dutch language in belgium method cross lingual studies were performed at 13 european universities using 12 different languages viz dutch english finnish french german greek only one with a non roman alphabet hungarian italian norwegian polish portuguese and spanish because original yoked design did not lend itself well to long distance research and standardization it was replaced by a simpler easier to replicate experimental design subjects were asked to mark six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of local alphabet again without giving it much thought they had to mark their first preference with 1 their second with 2 etc new method was first applied in belgium when results showed name letter effect at work again it was copied in other countries a total of 2 047 subjects participated all students discussion across languages and letters average probability of a letter being chosen as one of six preferred letters was 0 30 for name letters and 0 20 for other letters strongest effects were observed in norwegian and finnish studies in hungarian portuguese and italian studies effect was present but not to a significant degree effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names as well as only first name letters name letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered there was a probability of 0 46 that initial letters were chosen amongst top six letters further analysis revealed that overall name letter effect is not simply due to initials when excluding initials a name letter effect was still found across all languages nuttin analyzed data to see if there was a national letter effect but failed to find one norwegians did not favor letter n for norge more than people from other countries did neither did hungarians favor letter m for magyarorszag this led nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in name letter effect cars in austria and hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match country s name in local language a and h respectively this did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more as in first study second one also included a task relating to disliking letters subjects were asked to select six letters they liked least as before merely having a letter in one s own name significantly reduced chances of disliking it this task revealed an asymmetry in letter preference hierarchy while there was a large consensus within each of 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred there was not much consensus at all around most preferred letters reception in light of how surprising finding was nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it he first mentioned it at a conference of european association of experimental social psychology in 1984 followed by 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above his work was met with widespread skepticism as he had expected loosen a researcher at nuttin s own university called name letter effect so strange that a down to earth researcher will spontaneously think of an artifact other researchers did not explicitly say that effect was spurious but they doubted its psychological relevance in first five years after publication 1985 1989 nuttin s 1985 article was cited only once and effect was studied at only one other university ohio state university where johnson replicated effect using american students this all changed in 1995 when greenwald and banaji pointed out that nuttin s work was relevant to indirect measurement of self esteem which nuttin himself had actually already suggested after that original study was cited 14 times in five years between 1995 and 1999 50 times between 2000 and 2004 114 times between 2005 and 2009 and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014 name letter effect is no longer disputed and nuttin s work has been called seminal by stieger voracek and formann in their 2012 meta analysis of 44 publications on effect their meta analysis found no trace of publication bias characteristics in her 2014 meta analysis of dozens of name letter effect studies hoorens called effect robust she noted robustness in scope name letter effect is stronger for initials than for non initials but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis gender all but two studies found effect equally strong for women and men age effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students middle aged and old aged adults culture although there are many differences between eastern and western cultures including as to how often family names or initials are used effect seems to apply across cultures in their study with subjects from thailand where family name is rarely used hoorens nuttin herman and pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name kitayama and karasawa found no special effect for initials in japan where name initials are rarely used but did find an overall name letter effect language 15 languages have been tested bulgarian dutch english finnish french german greek hungarian italian japanese norwegian polish portuguese spanish thai covering four language families indo european uralic sino tibetan japonic and five alphabets greek roman cyrillic devanagari kana in all cases a name letter effect was found time in a study on preferences for initials stieger and lebel found that people who had changed their name after marrying continued to show a preference for initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage also subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name letter effect for their new last name initial explanations various explanations for name letter effect have been explored several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected disproved causes mere exposure people may simply like most what they see most letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people s names in 1940 and and adams in 1962 found a positive correlation between frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be zajonc extended these studies using foreign symbols and controlling number of exposures this led him to formulate mere exposure hypothesis more you see something more you like it nuttin s original study showed that mere exposure can not be cause of name letter effect as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had letter in their names and those who did not he also found that whereas letter b is of low frequency in french and letter q of medium frequency in experiments with french speakers b was among most highly liked letters and q was among least liked similarly in polish y is a medium frequency letter yet was still among least preferred letters in each of languages least frequent letters were over represented in set of least preferred letters whereas most preferred letters were rarely highest frequency letters exposure counts in lab studies done by zajonc 20 to 25 times were minuscule compared to real life observation counts of any letter which also caused nuttin to cast doubt on whether zajonc s theory could hold true in real world subjective frequency subjective frequency is how frequently subjects a stimulus appears name letters may be noticed more and consequently assumed to occur more frequently than other letters early research into impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when frequency was identical hoorens and nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for name letter effect by asking subjects to rank order entire alphabet twice once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency subjects indeed significantly overestimated frequency of letters in their names although there was no significant positive correlation between overestimation of frequency and name letter effect researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name subjects who liked their name had a stronger name letter effect than those who did not like their name but they did not overestimate frequency of own name letters more than subjects who did not like their names hoorens and nuttin concluded that there is no support for subjective frequency hypothesis evaluative conditioning evaluative conditioning suggests that if name is liked then name letters will be liked too this would occur through repeated visual association of name letters with name martin and levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association given observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus as cherry found in cocktail party effect it could be that name letter effect results from evaluative conditioning feys set up a controlled study with flemish subjects pairing unfamiliar symbols japanese kanji with subjects own names and with other names he found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked kanji symbol representing their own name or other names he concluded that evaluative conditioning is not primary cause of name letter effect subjective ownership subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose letters from their own name nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time none of subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in stimulus lists ruling out possibility that they knew their own name letters were there mastery pleasure letters first learned by a child commonly their own name may come to have lasting positive associations hoorens and todorova tested this by looking for a name letter effect in bilingual subjects where their mother tongue alphabet was cyrillic and their foreign language alphabet roman because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters there should be no name letter effect in foreign language alphabet only in first language alphabet results of a study with 100 bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned english german french or spanish revealed a name letter effect for roman alphabet as well as for cyrillic researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not principal cause of name letter effect in a follow up study hoorens nuttin herman and pavakanun tested strength of name letter effect among elementary school children in a cross sectional experimental design involving flemish and hungarian second fourth and sixth graders instead of finding name effect to decrease with age as might be expected they found it increased thus proving that mastery pleasure is not principal cause they also investigated name letter effects in bilingual thai subjects some of whom had learned english alphabet at same time as thai alphabet and others who had learned it later they found that time at which students had learned second alphabet made no difference in strength of name letter effect thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co determinant probable cause effect is thought to arise from unconscious automatic processes of self evaluation with different research groups coming at it from two different angles mere ownership nuttin frames cause in terms of ownership which has roots in economic psychology endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them nuttin puts name letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them as such name letter effect is just one example of a more general mere ownership effect in which case various verifiable predictions follow most people should like their name those that do not should not like their name letters hoorens and nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly they also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name letter effect in both alphabets a weaker effect should be found in second alphabet as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to self hoorens and todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in roman alphabet effect was found to be weaker in second alphabet this was replicated in a thai english study by hoorens nuttin herman and pavakanun similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to self such as numbers of one s birthday nickell pederson and found that people like numbers representing month and year of their birth more they also found that subjects liked year of their graduation more in a study of japanese students kitayama and karasawa found a strong birthday number effect for day of month especially for numbers higher than 12 higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings implicit self esteem another group of researchers has framed cause in terms of social psychology specifically self esteem theory beginning with greenwald and banaji in 1995 this group states that name letter effect results from implicit self esteem a person s tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous automatic or unconscious manner most people like themselves halo effect of self esteem spreads to any attributes associated with self including name and its letters as early as 1926 discovered that a person s own name is special compared to others eliciting physical responses measurable on skin it is thought that when a person recognizes letters in his or her name that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self esteem these positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select letters of their own name producing name letter effect to be an automatic process effect should for each specific person be fairly stable over time koole dijksterhuis and van knippenberg investigated this by asking dutch students to rate each letter of alphabet together with some filler questions for distraction twice within a four week period they found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between first and second rating hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row to be an automatic process effect should like other automatic processes involving preferences be influenced by deliberate thought multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding koole dijksterhuis and van knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50 they made half of them explain their preferences they found a name letter effect and birthday number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking but no effects in those asked to think this points to effect being result of an automatic process unconscious self regulation has been found to increase under psychological threat for effect to be one of unconscious self regulation it too should increase under threat jones pelham mirenberg and found that when people who were high in explicit self esteem were exposed to a psychological threat they showed exaggerated name letter preferences in contrast low self esteem participants showed evidence of opposite tendency komori and murata later replicated this response to threat with japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of english alphabet if effect is an automatic process then subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences and greve investigated this by use of a priming technique they showed subjects first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject s name too briefly to be noticed this was immediately followed by words such as honest and lonely subjects had to quickly identify word they had seen as positive or negative it was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials there was no effect for negative words effects of initial letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self esteem if there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to self then people in relationships should like name letters of their partners more than other letters lebel and campbell tested this and found a name letter effect for initials of subjects partners dehart pelham carvallo and gabriel concluded that effect applies to parent child sibling and friendship relationships as well application in psychological assessments name letter effect has been exploited to measure self esteem there are two types of self esteem explicit self esteem a person s deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves and implicit self esteem because by definition implicit self esteem is not accessible to introspection measures of it do not rely on direct self reports but on degree to which objects associated with self generate positive versus negative thoughts letter preference task is second most popular method to measure implicit self esteem surpassed only by implicit association test task has also been called name letter preference task name letter ratings measure and initial preference task there is no standard method for applying task most commonly used one is a letter rating task which involves having participants judge all letters of alphabet even within this method there are variations in instructions how much you like letters or how attractive you find them in rating scales five point seven point or nine point in order of letters random or alphabetical and in data collection paper and pencil or computer based there is no standard algorithm for calculating implicit self esteem at least six algorithms are in use in their meta analysis of name letter effect stieger voracek and formann recommend using double correction algorithm so called i algorithm as originally recommended and named by lebel and in her meta analysis hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to most important psychometric quality of all validity algorithms are typically applied to initials only but can be used for all name letters stieger voracek and formann recommend that task be administered twice that effects be calculated separately for first name initial and last name initial that task be accompanied with birthday number task and that instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness they suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self esteem something which hoorens says is her most important recommendation letter preference task has been used to measure implicit self esteem in contexts as diverse as depression physical health social acceptance unrealistic optimism feedback sensitivity self regulation and defensiveness wider implications researchers have looked for wider implications of name letter effect on preferences both inside and outside lab in lab in controlled studies in lab hodson and olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things e g foods animals that matched their name initials no evidence was found neither for a between subjects effect e g judy did not like things starting with j such as jam more than doug liked things starting with j nor for a within individuals effect e g judy did not like jam more than honey researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand name preferences within individuals e g hank did like honda more than non matching brands they speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names he found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials effect mainly occurred for big brands no correlation was found between strength of an individual s name letter effect and strength of his or her name letter branding effect and investigated whether use of personal pronouns i and my in branding also had an effect on preferences given way these pronouns link to self they found that brand names with a generic self referencing pronoun e g iphone myspace were evaluated more positively than non self referencing brand names e g xbox effect behaved like name letter effect when self was put under threat effect became stronger and it disappeared for people with negative self evaluations a study by pollmann and found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase quality of group work in a study of undergraduate students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials outside lab controversial studies researchers have looked for evidence of driving force behind name letter effect outside lab a body of controversial research under umbrella of implicit egotism starting with pelham mirenberg and jones has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis an example of a confounding variable is baby name popularity this has fluctuated significantly over decades simonsohn found that although walter and dennis are of near identical popularity in a large sample of us first names of living people walter is a relatively old fashioned name he suggested that when pelham et al found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with letters den compared to with wal they had overlooked that people named walter would tend to be old and more likely to be retired baby name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more den dentists than wal than implicit egotism using both a different data set twitter and google accounts and a different statistical analysis kooti magno and weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials dyjas van der maas and criticized method pelham et al used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 saint cities in us such as st louis and st paul whereas pelham et al pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name e g louis or paul dyjas et al used bayesian hierarchical modelling to show that there are several cities where opposite happens people moving away from their name saint city they concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect a different set of cities containing 30 surnames such as jackson and johnson city did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city surname matches dyjas et al disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname but instead cited simonsohn s argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away a case of reverse causality simonsohn also raised possibility of reverse causality in case of anseel and duyck s analysis of a large data set consisting of belgians last names and companies they work for anseel and duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial but simonsohn suspected that like walt disney working for disney many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member when he controlled for reverse causality in a large us data set he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial a few controversial studies have linked performance to initials however mccullough and williams found no evidence of a name letter effect for letter k in baseball players striking out shown on scoreboard with a k despite an earlier study by nelson and simmons suggesting there was nelson and simmons also found that students with first name initials c or d get lower grades than others with initials a or b again mccullough and williams criticized statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation in response to simonsohn s critical analyses of their earlier methods pelham and carvallo published a new study in 2015 describing how they now controlled for gender ethnicity and education confounds in one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames for example baker carpenter and farmer something new scientist has coined nominative determinism voracek stieger and swami investigated which way arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation they reported that today s smiths still tend to have physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths in researchers view a genetic social hypothesis appeared more viable than hypothesis of implicit egotism effects undisputed studies thumb right alt satellite image of a hurricane upright hurricane katrina people with initial k especially donated to disaster relief research by chandler griffin and sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted they analyzed records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes among others katrina rita and mitch they found that people who shared an initial with hurricane were overrepresented as donors they concluded that people want to overcome some of negative feelings associated with shared name and thus donate simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices but would to low stakes decisions such as choosing a charity footnotes references sources
