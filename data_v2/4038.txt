give closure to samantha mulder story arc 200px thumb right closure written by series creator chris carter and executive producer frank spotnitz brought an end to mulder s quest for his sister samantha who had been abducted when he was a child while idea to close story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members many realized that time had come for show to answer one of its biggest questions spotnitz explained that i think series star david duchovny grew tired of playing man who is missing his sister i told him this is going to be last time you re going to have to play that part paul rabwin noted that it s been seven years i don t think any of us are going to miss samantha mulder that device and motivation were very strong in early years of show but as years have gone by speculation kind of melted away shapiro 2000 p 139 closure continued where previous episode sein und zeit left off but branched off into different territory carter later explained that emotionally it was heavy stuff for everybody but necessarily so these episodes involved two very personal cases search for a serial killer in sein und zeit and search for mulder s sister in closure marc shapiro in his book all things official guide to x files vol 6 noted that in addition to bringing an end to samantha story arc episode was very much a smoking man episode in that it explored his involvement in samantha s abduction and revealed to audience that he was seriously ill episode s tagline was changed from usual truth is out there to believe to understand filming manners argued that closure was one of first episodes in which production staff was able to shoot in los angeles with sun out previous to this episode show s production staff was struggling with fact that we weren t in vancouver anymore and that our show had suddenly become very bright and cheery to amend this bill roe director of photography used tree branches and c stands to block out sunlight first scene with walk ins rising up from their grave shot at griffith park above playground was tricky according to director kim manners as he felt uncomfortable telling children to rise out of graves feeling it could psychologically hurt them instead he had crew call holes in ground forts scenes taking place at april air force base were shot in san bernardino california at a closed airfield former norton air force base on airbase was a large derelict complex of over 400 buildings many of them houses that had been constructed and used by united states military according to manners entire area was an eerie ghost town as many of houses were still full of old abandoned furniture originally producers wanted name of fictitious air force base to be march air force base however presence of a real air reserve base with same name located less than 10 miles away in riverside california necessitated a change to april air force base scene at restaurant was shot at carriage inn on sepulveda boulevard during filming david duchovny decided to act out reunion scene in a manner contrary to what script called for manners later said in script it called for his sister to run up and hug him and mulder was to start crying david didn t want to cry i said david you re finally realizing your sister is in fact dead he said just watch what i do trust me and he held that little girl actress there was a beatific smile on his face that was absolutely astounding manners was very happy with change and included it in final cut of episode hurwitz and knowles 2008 p 177 to create scene featuring ghosts of dead children interacting with characters various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other scenes were laborious and took many passes to complete after shots had been secured film of ghosts had to be made slightly transparent these scenes were actually shot in daylight and a specialized day for night photography in which subjects were illuminated with bright lights and sky was completely avoided was used to make finished scene look as if it had been filmed at night scenes were shot at 48 frames a second twice that of show s normal filming speed rebecca toolan traveled to los angeles from vancouver specifically for this episode and sein und zeit to create her ghostly apparition production staff filmed toolan and superimposed image over a shot of duchovny manners played part of hypnotist in video that scully watches with director turned actor later noting i only act when you can t actually see my face manners was critical of duchovny s wig used in this scene which had been added to make footage seem older he sardonically noted that this is not one of episodes that cheri medcalf show s make up director won an emmy for composer mark snow described his score as possessing a sense of biblical fervor and religiosity an elegy a feeling about it that was so poignant and touching to me fraga 2011 p 124 my weakness a song by moby from his 1999 album play is used in this episode first when fbi discover mass grave and finally at end when mulder encounters his sister s spirit carter never told snow about decision to use someone else s music although snow has since said that his reaction to use of song was very positive and that song was a perfect fit another moby song sky is broken also from play would be featured in later seventh season episode all things anderson 2 07 2 35 themes according to amy m donaldson in her book we want to believe faith and gospel in x files mulder s opening monologue may be an example of mulder now being more receptive to possibility of god s intervention donaldson 2011 pp 44 45 throughout much of series mulder has shown a disdain for religion however in closure donaldson points out that mulder s belief in god as always revolves around his beliefs about his sister s fate as such mulder expresses hope that those who die in a cruel fashion live on in some other way furthermore she argues that because closure opens with tagline believe to understand mulder must take leap of faith in order to find enlightenment and ultimately truth about his sister first half of episode plays out according to tagline mulder first believes in his desire stated in opening voiceover and then finds closure donaldson 2011 pp 60 61 donaldson also parallels elements in episode to plots of other episodes such as fourth season entry paper hearts wherein it is suggested that a serial killer murdered samantha in paper hearts a father of a victim notes that uncertainty of his daughter s murder allowed those who were involved to consider possibilities both for best and for worst however once it is revealed that his daughter was murdered all hope was removed conversely mulder holds onto possibility that samantha is alive through much of series but when he realizes that she is indeed dead in closure hope is removed but in its place is found peace to parallel mulder s acceptance harold piller refuses to believe his son is dead as such he cling s to possibility because uncertainty allows him hope donaldson 2011 pp 68 69 reception ratings closure first aired in united states on february 13 2000 episode earned a

plans to take over earth initial reviews initial reviews were mixed with some critics applauding story s conclusion and others deriding it tom kessenich in his book examinations an unauthorized look at seasons 6 9 of x files opined that episode worked best if some of previous samantha related clues were forgotten such as when alien bounty hunter told mulder that she was still alive in end game despite this he wrote that it was only right that samantha be dead since mulder s life had always been defined by what he has lost not what he has found he surmised that episode was not perfect but that its plusses greatly outweighed any missteps along way he was also complimentary towards ethereal quality of final few moments writing that they lifted this episode up and made it one of season s most memorable kessenich 2002 pp 111 113 kenneth silber from space com was pleased with episode and wrote closure is a satisfying episode one that puts to bed now tiresome search for mulder s sister samantha jeremy conrad from ign referred to episode as excellent and noted that a large portion of x files mythology ended with resolution of samantha s abduction saying closure is a final and concrete answer to single thing that was driving mulder for entire run of series in some ways when he got that answer a major part of x files story ended not all reviews were positive paula vitaris from cfq gave episode a negative review and awarded it one and a half stars out of four she wrote instead of a grand breath taking heart breaking finale that should be climax of mulder s search for samantha story expires limply with some nonsense about samantha being of starlight children bobby bryant and tracy burlison of state named episode worst conspiracy episode two noted that because a tenet of x files was that mulder s sister samantha had been a kidnapped by aliens or b kidnapped by government conspirators fact that she had actually been turned into a spirit insanely offers a supernatural explanation to a science fiction mystery later reviews later reviews however have seen closure in a much more positive light with many critics praising its ending zack handlen of a v club awarded episode an a he argued that episode worked due to two scenes sequence in which mulder reads aloud from samantha s diary and final shot of mulder being reunited with his sister he wrote that stark simplicity of former made it emotionally powerful and that latter was a bit sappy a bit surreal a bit lovely but nonetheless a beautiful moment meghan deans of tor com felt that story was silly but that when paired with idea that samantha was truly an innocent victim successfully becomes a comfort she called it a move that show must give mulder and us in order to shut down this storyline for good robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode four stars out of five and called it brave two noted that while some of sentimentality is pushed too far such as when mulder finds his sister s diary speaking to him or when mulder talks about all lost souls being stars critical moment featuring mulder reuniting with his sister s spirit is extraordinarily moving shearman and pearson 2009 pp 216 217 footnotes bibliography external links closure at tv com category 2000 american television episodes category
