william speirs bruce 1 august 1867 28 october 1921 was a british naturalist polar scientist and oceanographer who organized and led scottish national antarctic expedition snae 1902 04 to south orkney islands and weddell sea among other achievements expedition established first permanent weather station in antarctica bruce later founded scottish oceanographical laboratory in edinburgh but his plans for a transcontinental antarctic march via south pole were abandoned because of lack of public and financial support in 1892 bruce gave up his medical studies at university of edinburgh and joined dundee whaling expedition to antarctica as a scientific assistant this was followed by arctic voyages to novaya zemlya spitsbergen and franz josef land in 1899 bruce by then britain s most experienced polar scientist applied for a post on robert falcon scott s discovery expedition but delays over this appointment and clashes with royal geographical society rgs president sir clements markham led him instead to organise his own expedition and earned him permanent enmity of british geographical establishment although bruce received various awards for his polar work including an honorary doctorate from university of aberdeen neither he nor any of his snae colleagues were recommended by rgs for prestigious polar medal between 1907 and 1920 bruce made many journeys to arctic regions both for scientific and for commercial purposes his failure to mount any major exploration ventures after snae is usually attributed to his lack of public relations skills powerful enemies and his fervent scottish nationalism by 1919 his health was failing and he experienced several spells in hospital before his death in 1921 after which he was almost totally forgotten in recent years following centenary of scottish expedition efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in history of scientific polar exploration early life home and school william speirs bruce was born at 43 kensington gardens square in london fourth child of samuel noble bruce a scottish physician and his welsh wife mary nee lloyd his middle name came from another branch of family its unusual spelling as distinct from more common spiers tended to cause problems for reporters reviewers and biographers william passed his early childhood in family s london home at 18 royal crescent holland park under tutelage of his grandfather revd william bruce there were regular visits to nearby kensington gardens and sometimes to natural history museum according to samuel bruce these outings first ignited young william s interest in life and nature in 1879 at age of 12 william was sent to a progressive boarding school norfolk county school later watts naval school in village of north elmham norfolk he remained there until 1885 and then spent two further years at university college school hampstead preparing for matriculation examination that would admit him to medical school at university college london ucl he succeeded at his third attempt and was ready to start his medical studies in autumn of 1887 edinburgh during summer of 1887 bruce travelled north to edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences six week courses at recently established scottish marine station at granton on firth of forth were under direction of patrick geddes and john arthur thomson and included sections on botany and practical zoology experience of granton and contact with some of foremost contemporary natural scientists convinced bruce to stay in scotland he abandoned his place at ucl and enrolled instead in medical school at university of edinburgh this enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as geddes and thomson and also gave him opportunity to work during his free time in edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from challenger expedition were being examined and classified here he worked under dr john murray and his assistant john young buchanan and gained a deeper understanding of oceanography and invaluable experience in principles of scientific investigation first voyages dundee whaling expedition thumb 300px alt outline of whale next to

to investigate commercial possibilities of whaling in antarctic waters by locating a source of right whales in region scientific observations and oceanographic research would also be carried out in four whaling ships balaena active diana and polar star bruce was recommended to expedition by hugh robert mill an acquaintance from granton who was now librarian to royal geographical society in london although it would finally curtail his medical studies bruce did not hesitate with william gordon burn murdoch as an assistant he took up his duties on balaena under capt alexander fairweather four ships sailed from dundee on 6 september 1892 relatively short expedition bruce was back in scotland in may 1893 failed in its main purpose and gave only limited opportunities for scientific work no right whales were found and to cut expedition s losses a mass slaughter of seals was ordered to secure skins oil and blubber bruce found this distasteful especially as he was expected to share in killing scientific output from voyage was in bruce s words a miserable show letter to h r mill 31 may 1893 quoted in in a letter to royal geographical society he wrote general bearing of master captain fairweather was far from being favourable to scientific work letter to secretaries of royal geographical society quoted in bruce was denied access to charts so was unable to establish accurate location of phenomena he was required to work in boats when he should have been making meteorological and other observations and no facilities were allowed him for preparation of specimens many of which were lost through careless handling by crew nevertheless his letter to rgs ends i have to thank society for assisting me in what has been despite all drawbacks an instructive and delightful experience in a further letter to mill he outlined his wishes to go south again adding taste i have had has made me ravenous letter to h r mill june 1893 quoted in within months he was making proposals for a scientific expedition to south georgia but rgs would not support his plans in early 1896 he considered collaboration with norwegians henryk bull and carsten borchgrevink in an attempt to reach south magnetic pole this too failed to materialise jackson harmsworth expedition from september 1895 to june 1896 bruce worked at ben nevis summit meteorological station where he gained further experience in scientific procedures and with meteorological instruments in june 1896 again on recommendation of mill he left this post to join jackson harmsworth expedition then in its third year in arctic on franz josef land this expedition led by frederick george jackson and financed by newspaper magnate alfred harmsworth had left london in 1894 it was engaged in a detailed survey of franz josef archipelago which had been discovered though not properly mapped during an austrian expedition 20 years earlier jackson s party was based at cape flora on northbrook island southernmost island of archipelago it was supplied through regular visits from its expedition ship windward on which bruce sailed from london on 9 june 1896 thumb upright left alt head of a man with a determined

nansen and his companion hjalmar johansen two norwegians had been living on ice for more than a year since leaving their ship fram for a dash to north pole and it was pure chance that had brought them to one inhabited spot among thousands of square miles of arctic wastes bruce mentions meeting nansen in a letter to mill and his acquaintance with celebrated norwegian would be a future source of much advice and encouragement during his year at cape flora bruce collected around 700 zoological specimens in often very disagreeable conditions according to jackson it is no pleasant job to dabble in icy cold water with thermometer some degrees below zero or to plod in summer through snow slush and mud many miles in search of animal life as i have known mr bruce frequently to do jackson named cape bruce after him on northern edge of northbrook island at n jackson was less pleased with bruce s attitude to his personal specimens which he refused to entrust to british museum with expedition s other finds this tendency towards scientific conceit and lack of tact in interpersonal dealings were early demonstrations of character flaws that in later life would be held against him arctic voyages

john arthur thomson and resumed his duties at ben nevis observatory in march 1898 he received an offer to join major andrew coats on a hunting voyage to arctic waters around novaya zemlya and spitsbergen in private yacht blencathra this offer had originally been made to mill who was unable to obtain leave from royal geographical society and once again suggested bruce as a replacement andrew coats was a member of prosperous coats family of thread manufacturers who had founded coats observatory at paisley bruce joined blencathra at tromso norway in may 1898 for a cruise which explored barents sea dual islands of novaya zemlya and island of before a retreat to vardo in north eastern norway to re provision for voyage to spitsbergen in a letter to mill bruce reported this is a pure yachting cruise and life is luxurious but his scientific work was unabated i have been taking 4 hourly observations in meteorology and temperature of sea surface have tested salinity with buchanan s my tow nets have been going almost constantly blencathra sailed for spitsbergen but was stopped by ice so she returned to tromso here she encountered research ship princesse alice purpose built for prince albert i of monaco a leading oceanographer bruce was delighted when prince invited him to join princesse alice on a hydrographic survey around spitsbergen ship sailed up west coast of main island of spitsbergen group and visited adventfjorden and smeerenburg in north during latter stages of voyage bruce was placed in charge of voyage s scientific observations in following summer bruce was invited to join prince albert on another oceanographic cruise to spitsbergen at red bay latitude bruce ascended highest peak in area which prince named ben nevis in his honour when princesse alice ran aground on a submerged rock and appeared stranded prince albert instructed bruce to begin preparations for a winter camp in belief that it might be impossible for ship to escape fortunately she floated free and was able to return to tromso for repairs marriage and family life it is uncertain how bruce was employed after his return from spitsbergen in autumn 1899 in his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married his bride was jessie mackenzie who had worked as a nurse in samuel bruce s london surgery bruce s marriage took place in united free church of scotland in within parish of on 20 january 1901 being attended and witnessed by their parents scotland s people gov uk statutory marriages 078 1 1901 bruce william s perhaps due to bruce s secretive nature presenting limited details even among his circle of close friends and colleagues little information about wedding has been recorded by his biographers in 1907 bruces settled in a house at south morton and leith post office directories

daughter sheila mackenzie was born seven years later during these years bruce founded scottish ski club and became its first president he was also a co founder of edinburgh zoo bruce s chosen life as an explorer his unreliable sources of income and his frequent extended absences all placed severe strains on marriage and couple became estranged around 1916 however they continued to live in same house until bruce s death eillium became a merchant navy officer eventually captaining a fisheries research ship which by chance bore name scotia scottish national antarctic expedition thumb left alt

of royal geographical society dispute with markham on 15 march 1899 bruce wrote to sir clements markham at rgs offering himself for scientific staff of national antarctic expedition then in its early planning stages markham s reply was a non committal one line acknowledgement after which bruce heard nothing for a year he was then told indirectly to apply for a scientific assistant s post on 21 march 1900 bruce reminded markham that he had applied a year earlier and went on to reveal that he was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby i could take out a second british ship he followed this up a few days later and reported that funding for a second ship was now assured making his first explicit references to a scottish expedition this alarmed markham who replied with some anger such a course will be most prejudicial to expedition a second ship is not in least required i do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started bruce replied by return denying rivalry and asserting if my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans i do not see why i should not accept it there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable markham wrote back as i was doing my best to get you appointed to national antarctic expedition i had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me he continued you will cripple national expedition in order to get up a scheme for yourself bruce replied formally saying that funds he had raised in scotland would not have been forthcoming for any other project there was no further correspondence between two beyond a short conciliatory note from markham in february 1901 which read i can now see things from your point of view and wish you success a sentiment apparently not reflected in markham s subsequent attitude towards scottish expedition voyage of scotia thumb upright alt rear view of a three masted sailing ship with all sails furled lying

ship renamed scotia he then appointed an all scottish crew and scientific team scotia left troon on 2 november 1902 and headed south towards antarctica where bruce intended to set up winter quarters in weddell sea quadrant as near to south pole as is practicable on 22 february ship reached 70deg25 s but could proceed no further because of heavy ice she retreated to laurie island in south orkneys chain and wintered there in a bay he named scotia bay a meteorological station omond house named after robert traill omond exploring polar frontiers by william j mills was established as part of a full programme of scientific work in november 1903 scotia retreated to buenos aires for repair and reprovisioning while in argentina bruce negotiated an agreement with government whereby omond house became a permanent weather station under argentinian control renamed orcadas base site has been continuously in operation since then and provides longest historical meteorological series of antarctica in january 1904 scotia sailed south again to explore weddell sea on 6 march new land was sighted part of sea s eastern boundary bruce named this coats land after expedition s chief backers on 14 march at 74deg01 s and in danger of becoming icebound scotia turned north long voyage back to scotland via cape town was completed on 21 july 1904 this expedition assembled a large collection of animal marine and plant specimens and carried out extensive hydrographic magnetic and meteorological observations one hundred years later it was recognised that expedition s work had laid foundation of modern climate change studies and that its experimental work had showed this part of globe to be crucially important to world s climate according to oceanographer tony rice it fulfilled a more comprehensive programme than any other antarctic expedition of its day at time however its reception in britain was relatively muted although its work was highly praised within sections of scientific community bruce struggled to raise funding to publish his scientific results and blamed markham for lack of national recognition post expedition years thumb upright left alt head and upper body of elderly bearded man facing left wearing a dark suit with exposed white handkerchief in breast pocket sir john murray an early mentor to bruce scottish oceanographical laboratory bruce s collection of specimens gathered from more than a decade of arctic and antarctic travel required a permanent home bruce himself needed a base from which detailed scientific reports of scotia voyage could be prepared for publication he obtained premises in nicolson street edinburgh in which he established a laboratory and museum naming it scottish oceanographical laboratory with ultimate ambition that it should become scottish national oceanographic institute it was officially opened by prince albert of monaco in 1906 within these premises bruce housed his meteorological and oceanographic equipment in preparation for future expeditions he also met there with fellow explorers including nansen shackleton and roald amundsen his main task however was masterminding preparation of snae scientific reports these at considerable cost and much delay were published between 1907 and 1920 except for one volume bruce s own log that remained unpublished until 1992 after its rediscovery bruce maintained a wide correspondence with experts including sir joseph hooker who had travelled to antarctic with james clark ross in 1839 43 and to whom bruce dedicated his short book polar exploration in 1914 discussions began toward finding more permanent homes both for bruce s collection and following death that year of oceanographer sir john murray for specimens and library of challenger expedition bruce proposed that a new centre should be created as a memorial to murray there was unanimous agreement to proceed but project was curtailed by outbreak of war and not revived scottish oceanographical laboratory continued until 1919 when bruce in poor health was forced to close it dispersing its contents to royal scottish museum royal scottish geographical society rsgs and university of edinburgh further antarctic plans on 17 march 1910 bruce presented proposals to royal scottish geographical society rsgs for a new scottish antarctic expedition his plan envisaged a party wintering in or near coats land while ship took another group to ross sea on opposite side of continent during second season coats land party would cross continent on foot via south pole while ross sea party pushed south to meet them and assist them home expedition would also carry out extensive oceanographical and other scientific work bruce estimated that total cost would be about ps50 000 value about ps rsgs supported these proposals as did royal society of edinburgh university of edinburgh and other scottish organisations however timing was wrong royal geographical society in london was fully occupied with robert scott s terra nova expedition and showed no interest in bruce s plans no rich private benefactors came forward and persistent and intensive lobbying of government for financial backing failed bruce suspected that his efforts were as usual being undermined by aged but still influential markham finally accepting that his venture would not take place he gave generous support and advice to ernest shackleton who in 1913 announced plans similar to bruce s for his imperial trans antarctic expedition shackleton not only received ps10 000 from government but raised large sums from private sources including ps24 000 from scottish industrialist sir james caird of dundee shackleton s expedition was an epic adventure but failed completely in its main endeavour of a transcontinental crossing bruce was not consulted by shackleton relief committee about that expedition s rescue when need arose in 1916 myself i suppose he wrote because of being north of tweed they think dead scottish spitsbergen

spitsbergen visits with prince albert in 1898 and 1899 bruce had detected presence of coal gypsum and possibly oil in summers of 1906 and 1907 he again accompanied prince to archipelago with primary purpose of surveying and mapping prince charles foreland an island unvisited during earlier voyages here bruce found further deposits of coal and indications of iron on basis of these finds bruce set up a mineral prospecting company scottish spitsbergen syndicate in july 1909 at that time in international law spitsbergen was regarded as terra nullius rights to mine and extract could be established simply by registering a claim bruce s syndicate registered claims on prince charles foreland and on islands of barentsoya and edgeoya among other areas map a sum of ps4 000 out of a target of ps6 000 was subscribed to finance costs of a detailed prospecting expedition during summer of 1909 in a chartered vessel with a full scientific team results however were disappointing and voyage absorbed almost all of syndicate s funds bruce paid two further visits to spitsbergen in 1912 and 1914 but outbreak of war prevented further immediate developments however early in 1919 old syndicate was replaced by a larger and better financed company bruce had now fixed his main hopes on discovery of oil but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered thereafter bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures and although it continued to exist under various until 1952 there is no record of profitable extraction its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern later life polar medals withheld during his lifetime bruce received many awards gold medal of royal scottish geographical society in 1904 patron s medal of royal geographical society in 1910 neill prize and medal of royal society of edinburgh in 1913 and livingstone medal of american geographical society in 1920 he also received an honorary lld degree from university of aberdeen honour that eluded him however was polar medal awarded by sovereign on recommendation of royal geographical society although medal was awarded to members of every other british or commonwealth antarctic expedition during early 20th century snae was exception medal was withheld bruce and those close to him blamed markham for this omission matter was raised repeatedly with anyone thought to have influence robert rudmose brown chronicler of scotia voyage and later bruce s first biographer wrote in a 1913 letter to president of royal scottish geographical society that this neglect was a slight to scotland and to scottish endeavour bruce wrote in march 1915 to president of royal society of edinburgh who agreed in his reply that markham had much to answer for after markham s death in 1916 bruce sent a long letter to his member of parliament charles price detailing sir clements s malice towards him and scottish expedition ending with a heartfelt cry on behalf of his old comrades robertson is dying without his well won white ribbon mate is dead chief engineer is dead everyone as good men as have ever served on any polar expedition yet they did not receive white ribbon no action followed this plea no award had been made nearly a century later when matter was raised in scottish parliament on 4 november 2002 msp michael russell tabled a motion relating to snae centenary which concluded polar medal advisory committee should recommend posthumous award of polar medal to dr william speirs bruce in recognition of his status as one of key figures in early 20th century polar scientific exploration last years after outbreak of war in 1914 bruce s prospecting ventures were on hold he offered his services to admiralty but failed to obtain an appointment in 1915 he accepted a post as director and manager of a whaling company based in seychelles and spent four months there but venture failed on his return to britain he finally secured a minor post at admiralty bruce continued to lobby for recognition highlighting distinctions between treatment of snae and that of english expeditions when war finished he attempted to revive his various interests but his health was failing forcing him to close his laboratory on 1920 voyage to spitsbergen he travelled in an advisory role unable to participate in detailed work on return he was confined in edinburgh royal infirmary and later in liberton hospital edinburgh where he died on 28 october 1921 in accordance with his wishes he was cremated and ashes taken to south georgia to be scattered on southern sea despite his irregular income and general lack of funds his estate realised ps7 000 value about ps assessment after bruce s death his long time friend and colleague robert rudmose brown wrote in a letter to bruce s father his name is imperishably enrolled among world s great explorers and martyrs to unselfish scientific devotion rudmose brown s biography was published in 1923 and in same year a joint committee of edinburgh s learned societies instituted bruce memorial prize an award for young polar scientists thereafter although his name continued to be respected in scientific circles bruce and his achievements were forgotten by general public occasional mentions of him in polar histories and biographies of major figures such as scott and shackleton tended to be dismissive and inaccurate thumb left alt man on right in scots highland

identity a 2003 expedition in a modern research ship scotia used information collected by bruce as a basis for examining climate change in south georgia this expedition predicted dramatic conclusions relating to global warming from its research and saw this contribution as a fitting tribute to britain s forgotten polar hero william speirs bruce an hour long bbc television documentary on bruce presented by neil oliver in 2011 contrasted his meticulous science with his rivals aim of enhancing imperial prestige bbc last explorers episode 2 of 4 william speirs bruce a new biographer peter speak 2003 claims that snae was by far most cost effective and carefully planned scientific expedition of heroic age same author considers reasons why bruce s efforts to capitalise on this success met with failure and suggests a combination of his shy solitary uncharismatic nature and his fervent scottish nationalism bruce seemingly lacked public relations skills and ability to promote his work after fashion of scott and shackleton a lifelong friend described him as being as prickly as scottish thistle itself on occasion he behaved as with jackson over question of specimens brought back from franz josef land and on another occasion with royal geographical society over question of a minor expense claim as to his nationalism he wished to see scotland on an equal footing with other nations his national pride was intense in a preparatory note to voyage of scotia he wrote while science was talisman of expedition scotland was emblazoned on its flag this insistence on emphasising scottish character of his enterprises could be irksome to those who did not share his passion however he retained respect and devotion of those whom he led and of those who had known him longest john arthur thomson who had known bruce since granton wrote of him when reviewing rudmose brown s 1923 biography we never heard him once grumble about himself though he was neither to hold or bend when he thought some injustice was being done to or slight cast on his men on his colleagues on his laboratory on his scotland then one got glimpses of volcano which his gentle spirit usually kept sleeping see also
