nihonium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol nh and atomic number 113 it is extremely radioactive its most stable known isotope nihonium 286 has a half life of about 10 seconds in periodic table nihonium is a transactinide element in p block it is a member of period 7 and group 13 boron group nihonium was first reported to have been created in 2003 by a russian american collaboration at joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna russia and in 2004 by a team of japanese scientists at riken in wako japan confirmation of their claims in ensuing years involved independent teams of scientists working in united states germany sweden and china as well as original claimants in russia and japan in 2015 iupac iupap joint working party recognised element and assigned priority of discovery and naming rights for element to riken as it judged that they had demonstrated that they had observed element 113 before jinr team did so riken team suggested name nihonium in 2016 which was approved in same year name comes from common japanese name for very little is known about nihonium as it has only been made in very small amounts that decay away within seconds anomalously long lives of some superheavy nuclides including some nihonium isotopes are explained by island of stability theory experiments support theory with half lives of confirmed nihonium isotopes increasing from milliseconds to seconds as neutrons are added and island is approached nihonium has been calculated to have similar properties to its homologues boron aluminium gallium indium and thallium all but boron are post transition metals and nihonium is expected to be a post transition metal as well it should also show several major differences from them for example nihonium should be more stable in 1 oxidation state than 3 state like thallium but in 1 state nihonium should behave more like silver and astatine than thallium preliminary experiments in 2017 showed that elemental nihonium is not very volatile its chemistry remains largely unexplored history early indications syntheses of elements 107 to 112 were conducted at gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research in darmstadt germany from 1981 to 1996 these elements were made by cold fusion reactions in which targets made of thallium lead and bismuth which are around stable configuration of 82 protons are bombarded with heavy ions of period 4 elements this creates fused nuclei with low excitation energies due to stability of targets nuclei significantly increasing yield of superheavy elements cold fusion was pioneered by yuri oganessian and his team in 1974 at joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna soviet union yields from cold fusion reactions were found to decrease significantly with increasing atomic number resulting nuclei were severely neutron deficient and short lived gsi team attempted to synthesise element 113 via cold fusion in 1998 and 2003 bombarding bismuth 209 with zinc 70 but were unsuccessful both times faced with this problem oganessian and his team at jinr turned their renewed attention to older hot fusion technique in which heavy actinide targets were bombarded with lighter ions calcium 48 was suggested as an ideal projectile because it is very neutron rich for a light element combined with already neutron rich actinides and would minimise neutron deficiencies of nuclides produced being doubly magic it would confer benefits in stability to fused nuclei in collaboration with team at lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl in livermore california united states they made an attempt on element 114 which was predicted to be a magic number closing a proton shell and more stable than element 113 in 1998 jinr llnl collaboration started their attempt on element 114 bombarding a target of plutonium 244 with ions of calcium 48 290114 2 e 290113 ne a single atom was observed which was thought to be isotope results were published in january 1999 despite numerous attempts to repeat this reaction an isotope with these decay properties has never again been found and exact identity of this activity is unknown a 2016 paper considered that most likely explanation of 1998 result is that two neutrons were emitted by produced compound nucleus leading to 290114 and electron capture to 290113 while more neutrons were emitted in all other produced chains this would have been first report of a decay chain from an isotope of element 113 but it was not recognised at time and assignment is still uncertain a similar long lived activity observed by jinr team in march 1999 in 242pu 48ca reaction may be due to electron capture daughter of this assignment is also tentative jinr llnl collaboration now confirmed discovery of element 114 was made in june 1999 when jinr team repeated first 244pu 48ca reaction from 1998 following this jinr team used same hot fusion technique to synthesise elements 116 and 118 in 2000 and 2002 respectively via 248cm 48ca and 249cf 48ca reactions they then turned their attention to missing odd numbered elements as odd protons and possibly neutrons would hinder decay by spontaneous fission and result in longer decay chains first report of element 113 was in august 2003 when it was identified as an alpha decay product of element 115 element 115 had been produced by bombarding a target of americium 243 with calcium 48 projectiles jinr llnl collaboration published its results in february 2004 291115 288115 3 284113 291115 4 283113 four further alpha decays were observed ending with spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 105 dubnium riken while jinr llnl collaboration had been studying fusion reactions with 48ca a team of japanese scientists at riken nishina center for accelerator based science in wako japan led by kosuke morita had been studying cold fusion reactions morita had previously studied synthesis of superheavy elements at jinr before starting his own team at riken in 2001 his team confirmed gsi s discoveries of elements 108 110 111 and 112 they then made a new attempt on element 113 using same 209bi 70zn reaction that gsi had attempted unsuccessfully in 1998 despite much lower yield expected than for jinr s hot fusion technique with calcium 48 riken team chose to use cold fusion as synthesised isotopes would alpha decay to known daughter nuclides and make discovery much more certain and would not require use of radioactive targets in particular isotope 278113 expected to be produced in this reaction would decay to known 266bh which had been synthesised in 2000 by a team at lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl in berkeley bombardment of 209bi with 70zn at riken began in september 2003 team detected a single atom of 278113 in july 2004 and published their results that september 278113 riken team observed four alpha decays from 278113 creating a decay chain passing through 274rg and 266bh before terminating with spontaneous fission of 262db decay data they observed for alpha decay of 266bh matched 2000 data lending support for their claim spontaneous fission of its daughter 262db had not been previously known american team had observed only alpha decay from this nuclide road to confirmation when discovery of a new element is claimed joint working party jwp of international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and international union of pure and applied physics iupap assembles to examine claims according to their criteria for discovery of a new element and decides scientific priority and naming rights for elements according to jwp criteria a discovery must demonstrate that element has an atomic number different from all previously observed values it should also preferably be repeated by other laboratories although this requirement has been waived where data is of very high quality such a demonstration must establish properties either physical or chemical of new element and establish that they are those of a previously unknown element main techniques used to demonstrate atomic number are cross reactions creating claimed nuclides as parents or daughters of other nuclides produced by a different reaction and anchoring decay chains to known daughter nuclides for jwp priority in confirmation takes precedence over date of original claim both teams set out to confirm their results by these methods thumb upright 3 center summary of decay chains passing through isotopes of element 113 ending at mendelevium element 101 or earlier two chains with bold bordered nuclides were accepted by jwp as evidence for discoveries of element 113 and its parents elements 115 and 117 2004 2008 in june 2004 and again in december 2005 jinr llnl collaboration strengthened their claim for discovery of element 113 by conducting chemical experiments on 268db final decay product of 288115 this was valuable as none of nuclides in this decay chain were previously known so that their claim was not supported by any previous experimental data and chemical experimentation would strengthen case for their claim since chemistry of dubnium is known 268db was successfully identified by extracting final decay products measuring spontaneous fission sf activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a group 5 element dubnium is known to be in group 5 both half life and decay mode were confirmed for proposed 268db which lends support to assignment of parent and daughter nuclei to elements 115 and 113 respectively further experiments at jinr in 2005 confirmed observed decay data in november and december 2004 riken team studied 205tl 70zn reaction aiming zinc beam onto a thallium rather than a bismuth target in an effort to directly produce 274rg in a cross bombardment as it is immediate daughter of 278113 reaction was unsuccessful as thallium target was physically weak compared to more commonly used lead and bismuth targets and it deteriorated significantly and became non uniform in thickness reasons for this weakness are unknown given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth riken team then repeated original 209bi 70zn reaction and produced a second atom of 278113 in april 2005 with a decay chain that again terminated with spontaneous fission of 262db decay data were slightly different from those of first chain this could have been because an alpha particle escaped from detector without depositing its full energy or because some of intermediate decay products were formed in metastable isomeric states in 2006 a team at heavy ion research facility in lanzhou china investigated 243am 26mg reaction producing four atoms of 266bh all four chains started with an alpha decay to 262db three chains ended there with spontaneous fission as in 278113 chains observed at riken while remaining one continued via another alpha decay to 258lr as in 266bh chains observed at lbnl in june 2006 jinr llnl collaboration claimed to have synthesised a new isotope of element 113 directly by bombarding a neptunium 237 target with accelerated calcium 48 nuclei 285113 282113 3 two atoms of 282113 were detected aim of this experiment had been to synthesise isotopes and 282113 that would fill in gap between isotopes produced via hot fusion 283113 and 284113 and cold fusion 278113 after five alpha decays these nuclides would reach known isotopes of lawrencium assuming that decay chains were not terminated prematurely by spontaneous fission first decay chain ended in fission after four alpha decays presumably originating from 266db or its electron capture daughter spontaneous fission was not observed in second chain even after four alpha decays a fifth alpha decay in each chain could have been missed since 266db can theoretically undergo alpha decay in which case first decay chain would have ended at known 262lr or and second might have continued to known long lived which has a half life of 51 5 days longer than duration of experiment this would explain lack of a spontaneous fission event in this chain in absence of direct detection of long lived alpha decays these interpretations remain unconfirmed and there is still no known link between any superheavy nuclides produced by hot fusion and well known main body of chart of nuclides 2009 2015 jwp published its report on elements 113 116 and 118 in 2011 it recognised jinr llnl collaboration as having discovered elements 114 and 116 but did not accept either team s claim to element 113 and did not accept jinr llnl claims to elements 115 and 118 jinr llnl claim to elements 115 and 113 had been founded on chemical identification of their daughter dubnium but jwp objected that current theory could not distinguish between group 4 and group 5 elements by their chemical properties with enough confidence to allow this assignment decay properties of all nuclei in decay chain of element 115 had not been previously characterised before jinr experiments a situation which jwp generally considers troublesome but not necessarily exclusive and with small number of atoms produced with neither known daughters nor cross reactions jwp considered that their criteria had not been fulfilled jwp did not accept riken team s claim either due to inconsistencies in decay data small number of atoms of element 113 produced and lack of unambiguous anchors to known isotopes in early 2009 riken team synthesised decay product 266bh directly in 248cm reaction to establish its link with 278113 as a cross bombardment they also established branched decay of 262db which sometimes underwent spontaneous fission and sometimes underwent previously known alpha decay to 258lr in late 2009 jinr llnl collaboration studied 249bk 48ca reaction in an effort to produce element 117 which would decay to elements 115 and 113 and bolster their claims in a cross reaction they were now joined by scientists from oak ridge national laboratory ornl and vanderbilt university both in tennessee united states who helped procure rare and highly radioactive berkelium target necessary to complete jinr s calcium 48 campaign to synthesise heaviest elements on periodic table two isotopes of element 117 were synthesised decaying to element 115 and then element 113 297117 3 a 286113 a 297117 293117 4 289115 a 285113 a new isotopes 285113 and 286113 produced did not overlap with previously claimed 282113 283113 and 284113 so this reaction could not be used as a cross bombardment to confirm 2003 or 2006 claims in march 2010 riken team again attempted to synthesise 274rg directly through 205tl 70zn reaction with upgraded equipment they failed again and abandoned this cross bombardment route after 450 more days of irradiation of bismuth with zinc projectiles riken produced and identified another 278113 atom in august 2012 although electricity prices had soared since 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami and riken had ordered shutdown of accelerator programs to save money morita s team was permitted to continue with one experiment and they chose their attempt to confirm their synthesis of element 113 in this case a series of six alpha decays was observed leading to an isotope of mendelevium 278113 this decay chain differed from previous observations at riken mainly in decay mode of 262db which was previously observed to undergo spontaneous fission but in this case instead alpha decayed alpha decay of 262db to 258lr is well known team calculated probability of accidental coincidence to be 10 28 or totally negligible resulting 254md atom then underwent electron capture to which underwent seventh alpha decay in chain to long lived 250cf which has a half life of around thirteen years 249bk 48ca experiment was repeated at jinr in 2012 and 2013 with consistent results and again at gsi in 2014 in august 2013 a team of researchers at lund university in lund sweden and at gsi announced that they had repeated 2003 243am 48ca experiment confirming findings of jinr llnl collaboration same year 2003 experiment had been repeated at jinr now also creating isotope 289115 that could serve as a cross bombardment for confirming their discovery of element 117 isotope 293117 as well as its daughter 285113 as part of its decay chain further confirmation was published by team at lbnl in 2015 approval of discoveries in december 2015 conclusions of a new jwp report were published by iupac in a press release in which element 113 was awarded to riken elements 115 117 and 118 were awarded to collaborations involving jinr a joint 2016 announcement by iupac and iupap had been scheduled to coincide with publication of jwp reports but iupac alone decided on an early release because news of riken being awarded credit for element 113 had been leaked to japanese newspapers for first time in history a team of asian physicists would name a new element jinr considered awarding of element 113 to riken unexpected citing their own 2003 production of elements 115 and 113 and pointing to precedents of elements 103 104 and 105 where iupac had awarded joint credit to jinr and lbnl they stated that they respected iupac s decision but reserved determination of their position for official publication of jwp reports full jwp reports were published in january 2016 jwp recognised discovery of element 113 assigning priority to riken they noted that while individual decay energies of each nuclide in decay chain of 278113 were inconsistent their sum was now confirmed to be consistent strongly suggesting that initial and final states in 278113 and its daughter 262db were same for all three events decay of 262db to 258lr and 254md was previously known firmly anchoring decay chain of 278113 to known regions of chart of nuclides jwp considered that jinr llnl collaborations of 2004 and 2007 producing element 113 as daughter of element 115 did not meet discovery criteria as they had not convincingly determined atomic numbers of their nuclides through cross bombardments which were considered necessary since their decay chains were not anchored to previously known nuclides they also considered that previous jwp s concerns over their chemical identification of dubnium daughter had not been adequately addressed jwp recognised jinr llnl ornl vanderbilt collaboration of 2010 as having discovered elements 117 and 115 and accepted that element 113 had been produced as their daughter but did not give this work shared credit after publication of jwp reports sergey lab director of flerov lab at jinr where discoveries were made remarked that he was happy with iupac s decision mentioning time riken spent on their experiment and their good relations with morita who had learnt basics of synthesising superheavy elements at jinr sum argument advanced by jwp in approval of discovery of element 113 was later criticised in a may 2016 study from lund university and gsi as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along decay chain which is not likely for odd nuclei and uncertainty of alpha decay energies measured in 278113 decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility if this is case similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters becomes a meaningless argument as different isomers of same nuclide can have different half lives for example ground state of has a half life of hours but an excited state has never been observed to decay this study found reason to doubt and criticise iupac approval of discoveries of elements 115 and 117 but data from riken for element 113 was found to be congruent and data from jinr team for elements 115 and 113 to probably be so thus endorsing iupac approval of discovery of element 113 two members of jinr team published a journal article rebutting these criticisms against congruence of their data on elements 113 115 and 117 in june 2017 naming thumb kosuke morita and hiroshi matsumoto celebrating naming on 1 december 2016 alt lead researcher kosuke morita and riken president hiroshi matsumoto from riken showing nh being added to periodic table using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements nihonium should be known as eka thallium in 1979 iupac published recommendations according to which element was to be called with corresponding symbol of uut a systematic element name as a placeholder until discovery of element is confirmed and a name is decided on recommendations were widely used in chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks but were mostly ignored among scientists in field who called it element 113 with symbol of 113 or even simply 113 before jwp recognition of their priority japanese team had unofficially suggested various names japonium after their home country after japanese physicist yoshio nishina founding father of modern physics research in japan and after institute after recognition riken team gathered in february 2016 to decide on a name morita expressed his desire for name to honour fact that element 113 had been discovered in japan japonium was considered making connection to japan easy to identify for non japanese but it was rejected as jap is considered an ethnic slur name nihonium was chosen after an hour of deliberation it comes from one of two japanese pronunciations for name of japan discoverers also intended to reference support of their research by japanese people riken being almost entirely government funded recover lost pride and trust in science among those who were affected by fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster and honour japanese chemist masataka ogawa s 1908 discovery of rhenium which he named nipponium with symbol np after other japanese pronunciation of japan s name as ogawa s claim had not been accepted name nipponium could not be reused for a new element and its symbol np had since been used for neptunium in march 2016 morita proposed name nihonium to iupac with symbol nh naming realised what had been a national dream in japanese science ever since ogawa s claim former president of iupap cecilia complained at nobel symposium on superheavy elements in castle sweden in june 2016 about lack of openness involved in process of approving new elements and stated that she believed that jwp s work was flawed and should be redone by a new jwp a survey of physicists determined that many felt that lund gsi 2016 criticisms of jwp report were well founded but that conclusions would hold up if work was redone and new president bruce mckellar ruled that proposed names should be released in a joint iupap iupac press release thus iupac and iupap publicised proposal of nihonium that june and set a five month term to collect comments after which name would be formally established at a conference name was officially approved in november 2016 naming ceremony for new element was held in tokyo japan in march 2017 with naruhito then crown prince of japan in attendance isotopes nihonium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesised in laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing decay of heavier elements eight different isotopes of nihonium have been reported with atomic masses 278 282 287 and 290 287nh and 290nh are unconfirmed they all decay through alpha decay to isotopes of roentgenium there have been indications that nihonium 284 can also decay by electron capture to copernicium 284 stability and half lives thumb upright 1 8 a chart of heavy nuclides with their known and predicted half lives known nuclides shown with borders nihonium row 113 is expected to be within island of stability white circle and thus its nuclei are slightly more stable than would otherwise be predicted known nihonium isotopes are too neutron poor to be within island stability of nuclei quickly decreases with increase in atomic number after curium element 96 whose half life is over ten thousand times longer than that of any subsequent element all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half lives of less than 30 hours this is because of ever increasing coulomb repulsion of protons so that strong nuclear force cannot hold nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long calculations suggest that in absence of other stabilising factors elements with more than 103 protons should not exist researchers in 1960s suggested that closed nuclear shells around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability and create an island of stability containing nuclides with half lives reaching thousands or millions of years existence of island is still unproven but existence of superheavy elements including nihonium confirms that stabilising effect is real and in general known superheavy nuclides become longer lived as they approach predicted location of island all nihonium isotopes are unstable and radioactive heavier nihonium isotopes are more stable than lighter ones as they are closer to centre of island most stable known nihonium isotope 286nh is also heaviest it has a half life of 8 seconds isotope 285nh as well as unconfirmed 287nh and 290nh have also been reported to have half lives of over a second isotopes 284nh and have half lives of 1 and 0 1 seconds respectively remaining two isotopes have half lives between 0 1 and 100 milliseconds 282nh has a half life of 70 milliseconds and lightest known nihonium isotope is also shortest lived with a half life of 1 4 milliseconds this rapid increase in half lives near closed neutron shell at n 184 is seen in roentgenium copernicium and nihonium elements 111 through 113 where each extra neutron so far multiplies half life by a factor of 5 to 20 predicted properties physical and atomic thumb atomic energy levels of outermost s p and d electrons of thallium and nihonium nihonium is first member of 7p series of elements and heaviest group 13 element on periodic table below boron aluminium gallium indium and thallium all group 13 elements except boron are metals and nihonium is expected to follow suit nihonium is predicted to show many differences from its lighter homologues major reason for this is spin orbit so interaction which is especially strong for superheavy elements because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms at velocities close to speed of light in relation to nihonium atoms it lowers 7s and 7p electron energy levels stabilising those electrons but two of 7p electron energy levels are stabilised more than other four stabilisation of 7s electrons is called inert pair effect and separation of 7p subshell into more and less stabilised parts is called subshell splitting computational chemists see split as a change of second azimuthal quantum number l from 1 to 1 2 and 3 2 for more and less stabilised parts of 7p subshell respectively for theoretical purposes valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect 7p subshell split as 7s2 7p1 21 first ionisation energy of nihonium is expected to be 7 306 ev highest among metals of group 13 similar subshell splitting should exist for 6d electron levels with four being 6d3 2 and six being 6d5 2 both these levels are raised to be close in energy to 7s ones high enough to possibly be chemically active this would allow for possibility of exotic nihonium compounds without lighter group 13 analogues periodic trends would predict nihonium to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down periodic table but calculations suggest nihonium has an atomic radius of about 170 pm same as that of thallium due to relativistic stabilisation and contraction of its 7s and 7p1 2 orbitals thus nihonium is expected to be much denser than thallium with a predicted density of about 16 to 18 g cm3 compared to thallium s 11 85 g cm3 since nihonium atoms are heavier than thallium atoms but have same volume bulk nihonium is expected to have a hexagonal close packed crystal structure like thallium melting and boiling points of nihonium have been predicted to be 430 degc and 1100 degc respectively exceeding values for gallium indium and thallium following periodic trends chemical chemistry of nihonium is expected to be very different from that of thallium this difference stems from spin orbit splitting of 7p shell which results in nihonium being between two relatively inert closed shell elements copernicium and flerovium an unprecedented situation in periodic table nihonium is expected to be less reactive than thallium because of greater stabilisation and resultant chemical inactivity of 7s subshell in nihonium compared to 6s subshell in thallium standard electrode potential for nh nh couple is predicted to be 0 6 v so nihonium should be a rather noble metal as unreactive as rhodium and ruthenium metallic group 13 elements are typically found in two oxidation states 1 and 3 former results from involvement of only single p electron in bonding and latter results in involvement of all three valence electrons two in s subshell and one in p subshell going down group bond energies decrease and 3 state becomes less stable as energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining 3 state is not always enough to outweigh energy needed to involve s electrons hence for aluminium and gallium 3 is most stable state but 1 gains importance for indium and by thallium it becomes more stable than 3 state nihonium is expected to continue this trend and have 1 as its most stable oxidation state simplest possible nihonium compound is monohydride nhh bonding is provided by 7p1 2 electron of nihonium and 1s electron of hydrogen so interaction causes binding energy of nihonium monohydride to be reduced by about 1 ev and nihonium hydrogen bond length to decrease as bonding 7p1 2 orbital is relativistically contracted this is unique among 7p element all others have relativistic expansion of bond length instead of contraction another effect of so interaction is that nh h bond is expected to have significant pi bonding character side on orbital overlap unlike almost pure sigma bonding head on orbital overlap in thallium monohydride analogous monofluoride should also exist nihonium i is predicted to be more similar to silver i than thallium i nh ion is expected to more willingly bind anions so that should be quite soluble in excess hydrochloric acid or ammonia tlcl is not in contrast to tl which forms strongly basic hydroxide in solution nh cation should instead hydrolyse all way to amphoteric oxide which would be soluble in aqueous ammonia and weakly soluble in water adsorption behaviour of nihonium on gold surfaces in experiments is expected to be closer to that of astatine than that of thallium destabilisation of 7p3 2 subshell effectively leads to a valence shell closing at 7s2 7p2 configuration rather than expected 7s2 configuration with its stable octet as such nihonium like astatine can be considered to be one p electron short of a closed valence shell hence even though nihonium is in group 13 it has several properties similar to group 17 elements tennessine in group 17 has some group 13 like properties as it has three valence electrons outside 7s2 7p2 closed shell nihonium is expected to be able to gain an electron to attain this closed shell configuration forming 1 oxidation state like halogens fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine this state should be more stable than it is for thallium as so splitting of 7p subshell is greater than that for 6p subshell nihonium should be most electronegative of metallic group 13 elements even more electronegative than tennessine period 7 congener of halogens in compound negative charge is expected to be on nihonium atom rather than tennessine atom 1 oxidation should be more stable for nihonium than for tennessine electron affinity of nihonium is calculated to be around 0 68 ev higher than thallium s at 0 4 ev tennessine s is expected to be 1 8 ev lowest in its group it is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150 kj mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around 159 kj mol significant 6d involvement is expected in nh au bond although it is expected to be more unstable than tl au bond and entirely due to magnetic interactions this raises possibility of some transition metal character for nihonium on basis of small energy gap between 6d and 7s electrons higher oxidation states 3 and 5 have been suggested for nihonium some simple compounds with nihonium in 3 oxidation state would be trifluoride and trichloride these molecules are predicted to be t shaped and not trigonal planar as their boron analogues are this is due to influence of 6d5 2 electrons on bonding heavier nihonium tribromide and triiodide are trigonal planar due to increased steric repulsion between peripheral atoms accordingly they do not show significant 6d involvement in their bonding though large 7s 7p energy gap means that they show reduced sp2 hybridisation compared to their boron analogues bonding in lighter nhx3 molecules can be considered as that of a linear species similar to hgf2 or with an additional nh x bond involving 7p orbital of nihonium perpendicular to other two ligands these compounds are all expected to be highly unstable towards loss of an x2 molecule and reduction to nihonium i nhx3 x2 nihonium thus continues trend down group 13 of reduced stability of 3 oxidation state as all five of these compounds have lower reaction energies than unknown thallium iii iodide 3 state is stabilised for thallium in anionic complexes such as and presence of a possible vacant coordination site on lighter t shaped nihonium trihalides is expected to allow a similar stabilisation of and perhaps 5 oxidation state is unknown for all lighter group 13 elements calculations predict that nihonium and pentafluoride should have a square pyramidal molecular geometry but also that both would be highly thermodynamically unstable to loss of an x2 molecule and reduction to nihonium iii despite its instability possible existence of nihonium pentafluoride is entirely due to relativistic effects allowing 6d electrons to participate in bonding again some stabilisation is expected for anionic complexes such as structures of nihonium trifluoride and pentafluoride molecules are same as those for chlorine trifluoride and pentafluoride experimental chemistry chemical characteristics of nihonium have yet to be determined unambiguously isotopes 284nh 285nh and 286nh have half lives long enough for chemical investigation from 2010 to 2012 some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at jinr to determine volatility of nihonium isotope 284nh was investigated made as daughter of 288mc produced in 243am 48ca reaction nihonium atoms were synthesised in a recoil chamber and then carried along ptfe capillaries at 70 degc by a carrier gas to gold covered detectors about ten to twenty atoms of 284nh were produced but none of these atoms were registered by detectors suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to noble gases and thus diffused away too quickly to be detected or more plausibly that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through ptfe capillaries formation of hydroxide should ease transport as nihonium hydroxide is expected to be more volatile than elemental nihonium and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapour into carrier gas it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favoured so longer lived isotopes 285nh and 286nh were considered more desirable for future experiments a 2017 experiment at jinr producing 284nh and 285nh via 243am 48ca reaction as daughters of 288mc and avoided this problem by removing quartz surface using only ptfe no nihonium atoms were observed after chemical separation implying an unexpectedly large retention of nihonium atoms on ptfe surfaces this experimental result for interaction limit of nihonium atoms with a ptfe surface disagrees significantly with previous theory which expected a lower value of 14 00 kj mol this suggests that nihonium species involved in previous experiment was likely not elemental nihonium but rather nihonium hydroxide and that high temperature techniques such as vacuum chromatography would be necessary to further probe behaviour of elemental nihonium bromine saturated with boron tribromide has been suggested as a carrier gas for experiments on nihonium chemistry this oxidises nihonium s lighter congener thallium to thallium iii providing an avenue to investigate oxidation states of nihonium
