gevingasen tunnel is a single track railway tunnel between villages of hommelvik and hell in trondelag county norway tunnel is located along nordland line blasting started in 2009 and tunnel opened on 15 august 2011 having cost built by norwegian national rail administration tunnel has shortened travel time south of stjordal by five minutes and increased capacity of trondheim stjordal to four trains per hour in each direction tunnel was first stage in a project to reduce travel time between steinkjer and trondheim to one hour tunnel section will not be suitable for high speed trains as it was built with curves with too small a diameter notwithstanding political debate about both these tight curves and possibility of double track whole project involved of new tracks and permanent way blasted rock is used to build a new apron at trondheim airport vaernes background tunnel was built between hommelvik and hell on nordland line through hill gevingasen tunnel is long although whole project consists of of track tunnel carries a single track reducing travel time by five minutes it has also created same distance between all passing loops between trondheim and stjordal allowing capacity to increase from 5 4 to 8 trains per hour both directions combined old right of way located on a ledge over sea and prone to landslides is to be closed in addition 92 houses are projected to enjoy reduced noise pollution after closing was first part of plan to reduce rail travel time from trondheim to steinkjer to one hour politicians have suggested that after tunnel is completed they want to electrify tracks from trondheim to steinkjer e6 motorway runs in a similar direction through gevingasen in hell tunnel construction construction of tunnel was done by drilling and blasting during planning use of a tunnel boring machine was considered but conventional drilling and blasting method was chosen because it was both cheaper and faster at hommelvik new section of track started at river of where it runs in a curve towards tunnel entrance at solbakken just within entrance there is a pool and pump to collect surface water a crosscut is located at muruvik close to quarry at this point into tunnel blasting was performed in both directions from tunnel s interception with crosscut muruvik also served as operational hub transport of masses to airport will run along old e6 third point of entry for blasting was at entrance at hell work include replacing level crossing at hell station with an overpass builder was norwegian national rail administration and construction of tunnel was financed through state funding with project costing construction was undertaken at same time as avinor was expanding nearby trondheim airport vaernes and spoil from tunnel was used to build a new apron planning for tunnel was completed at end of 2008 tender for construction was completed in march 2009 and won by mika construction extracted of blasted rock that was transported out of tunnel last blast was detonated on 12 august 2010 completing tunneling proper on time and on budget without injuries first revenue train ran through tunnel on 15 august 2011 because train schedules only change twice a year time saving was not accomplished until 2012 further plans include building a second track at trondheim airport station due to capacity increase created by tunnel this will allow dedicated airport trains to operate from trondheim controversy thumb map of gevingasen tunnel purple including current nordland line blue and e6 yellow trondelag council an unofficial coordination council consisting of representatives from nord trondelag county municipality sor trondelag county municipality and trondheim municipality originally stated that they wanted a double track tunnel in 2006 norwegian national rail administration stated that it was not certain that a double track in a single tunnel would meet european union regulations and that they might have to delay construction while looking into matter costs for a double track would be about 50 higher than for a single track constructing a second barrel later for a new track would cost as much as first barrel trondelag council member alf daniel moen labour stated that council abandoned demand for a double track tunnel so airport expansion and tunnel construction could be coordinated and because there was not sufficient funding at time to build both tracks tunnel raised criticism for not being in line with goals to build a high speed railway in trondelag this plan requires double track from trondheim to stjordal but such a solution through tunnel has been disregarded norsk bane which is working on plans for a high speed rail from oslo to steinkjer has criticized tunnel route for having curves that are too tight with a radius of this will only allow at hommelvik station and at hell station so although tunnel itself is straight enough to allow speeds of limitations at both ends of tunnel will not allow trains to reach a higher maximum speed of and an average speed of more than because of this gevingasen tunnel would not be able to allow high speeds defined by parliament as minimum and could not be part of a future high speed line north of trondheim norsk bane stated that part of cause is that although national rail administration has plans to build a high speed line from trondheim to steinkjer no complete plans nor any plans for trackage on either side of tunnel have been made in january 2009 just before construction commenced nord trondelag county cabinet fronted by chair alf daniel moen and councilor of transport tor erik jensen conservative stated that they did not want tunnel to run along its planned route but instead a less curved line that would allow it to be used as a high speed line in future this was rejected by ministry of transport and communications who stated that they were building a modern railway for future it could be added that most trains are regional trains which stop in both hell and hommelvik for them high speed curves are meaningless references category railway tunnels in trondelag category malvik category stjordal
