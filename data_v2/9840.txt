portia schultzi is a jumping spider which ranges from south africa in south to kenya in north and also is found in west africa and madagascar in this species which is slightly smaller than some other species of genus portia bodies of females are 5 to 7 mm long while those of males are 4 to 6 mm long carapaces of both sexes are orange brown with dark brown mottling and covered with dark brown and whitish hairs lying over surface males have white tufts on their thoraces and a broad white band above bases of legs and these features are less conspicuous in females both sexes have tufts of orange to dark orange above eyes which are fringed with pale orange hairs males abdomens are yellow orange to orange brown with blackish mottling and on upper sides are black and light orange hairs and nine white tufts those of females are pale yellow and have black markings with scattered white and orange brown hairs on upper side p schultzi has relatively longer legs than other portia and a lolloping gait while most jumping spiders focus accurately up to about 75 cm away p schultzi responds to a maximum of about 10 cm in good light and ignores everything in very subdued light for prey p schultzi prefers web based spiders then jumping spiders and finally insects females of p schultzi and other portia species build capture webs to catch prey and often join their own webs on to web based spiders to catch other spiders or their prey if a p schultzi female is mature a male p schultzi will try to copulate with her or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting they usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by female and p schultzi typically copulates for about 100 seconds while others in genus can take several minutes or even several hours females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey contests between portia females are violent and embraces in p schultzi typically take 20 to 60 seconds sometimes one female knocks other on her back and other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way when hunting p schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce risk that any other females males or juveniles of same species may contend for same prey body structure and appearance bodies of female p are 5 to 7 mm long smaller than other portia species while those of males are 4 to 6 mm long carapaces of both sexes are orange brown with dark brown mottling and covered with dark brown and whitish hairs lying over surface males have white tufts on their thoraxes and broad white band above bases of legs and these features are less conspicuous in females both sexes have tufts of orange to dark orange above eyes which are fringed with pale orange hairs females chelicerae are pale yellow with black markings at ends while males orange brown with darker markings and those of both sexes have pale orange and white hairs abdomens of females are pale yellow with black markings and upper sides have scattered white and orange brown hairs males abdomens yellow orange to orange brown with blackish mottling and on upper sides are black and light orange hairs and nine white tufts those of females are pale yellow and have black markings with scattered white and orange brown hairs on upper side but no tufts legs of both sexes are unusually long and slender and those of male s are orange brown with darker markings while those of females are light yellow with blackish markings in both sexes final two segment of each leg has no other decorations but other segments in both sexes have brownish hairs and many robust spines and those of males also scattered white tufts palps of both sexes have pale yellow hairs and white fringes all species of genus portia have elastic abdomens so that those of both sexes can become almost spherical when well fed and females can stretch as much when producing eggs movement when not hunting for prey or a mate portia species including p schultzi adopt a special posture called cryptic rest posture pulling their legs in close to body and their palps back beside chelicerae jaws which obscures outlines of these appendages when walking most portia species have a slow choppy gait that preserves their concealment pausing often and at irregular intervals waving their legs continuously and their palps jerkily up and down moving each appendage out of time with others and continuously varying speed and timing p schultzi uses what forster and murphy 1986 call a lolloping gait flexing and stretching legs they suggest that long legs are advantageous for moving through webs and that lolloping enables p schultzi to use long legs while keeping body near surface thumb right a spider at take off when jumping fixes a dragline safety line just before jumping like many species of spider a p schultzi lays a continuous dragline of silk as it moves and from time to time anchors dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk this allows spider to return to surface if animal is dislodged a spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor and then lays out a dragline as it flies unlike those of most jumping spiders p schultzi s stick to each other and when a p schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves when disturbed most leap upwards about 100 to 150 mm often from cryptic rest pose and often over a wide trajectory usually portia then either freezes or runs about 100 mm and then freezes senses thumb 75px right squared off and eye pattern of jumping spiders although other spiders can also jump salticids including p schultzi have significantly better vision than other spiders and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat s and 10 times more acute than a dragonfly s jumping spiders have eight eyes two large ones in center and front position eyes also called principal eyes housed in tubes in head and providing acute vision other six are secondary eyes positioned along sides of carapace and acting mainly as movement detectors in most jumping spiders middle pair of secondary eyes is very small and has no known function but those of portia are relatively large and function as well as those of other secondary eyes jumping spiders main eyes can see from red to ultraviolet in most jumping spiders main eyes focus accurately on an object up to about 75 cm away however p schultzi does not react at all to objectives when light is under 100 lux between 100 and 500 lux it detects and approaches objective from distances up to 6 cm from 500 lux to 1500 lux its response distance increases gradually to a maximum of about 10 cm and stronger light causes no increase in response distance for comparison trite swivels towards a movement up to 75 cm away and approaches targets from about 20 cm perhaps p schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in time to catch it like all jumping spiders p schultzi can take in only a small visual field at one time as most acute part of a main eye can see all of a circle up to 12 millimeters wide at 20 centimeters away or up to 18 millimeters wide at 30 centimeters away a portia spider takes a relatively long time to see objects possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and needs a lot of scanning this makes a portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds frogs and mantises which it often cannot identify because of other predator s size spiders like other arthropods have sensors often modified setae bristles for smell taste touch and vibration protruding through their cuticle skin unlike insects spiders and other chelicerates do not have antennae a portia can sense vibrations from surfaces and use these for mating and for hunting other spiders in total darkness it can use air and surface smells to detect prey which it often meets to identify members of same species to recognise familiar members and to determine sex of other member of same species hunting tactics tactics used by most jumping spiders and by most of genus portia members of genus portia have hunting tactics as versatile and adaptable as a lion s all members of portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey but can improvise by trial and error against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations and then remember new approach they can also make detours to find best attack angle against dangerous prey even when best detour takes it out of visual contact with prey and sometimes planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting prey from behind such detours may take up to an hour and it usually picks best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route if a portia spider makes a mistake while hunting another spider it may itself be killed while most jumping spiders prey mainly on insects and by active hunting females of portia also build webs to catch prey directly these capture webs are funnel shaped and widest at top and are about 4 000 cm3 in volume web is initially built in about 2 hours and then gradually made stronger a portia spider often joins her own web on to one of a web based spider when not joined to another spiders a p schultzi female s capture web may be suspended from rigid foundations such as boughs and rocks or from pliant bases such as stems of shrubs males of portia do not build capture webs portias hunt in all types of webs while other cursorial spiders generally have difficulty moving on webs and web building spiders find it difficult to move in webs unlike those they build where web is sparse a portia will use rotary probing in which it moves a free leg around until it meets a thread when hunting in another spider s web a portia s slow choppy movements and flaps on its legs make it resemble leaf detritus caught in web and blown in a breeze p schultzi and some other portias use breezes and other disturbances as smokescreens in which these predators can approach web spiders more quickly and revert to a more cautious approach when disturbance disappears a few web spiders run far away when they sense un rhythmical gait of a portia entering web a reaction wilcox and jackson call portia panic if a large insect is struggling in a web portia usually does not usually take insect but waits for up to a day until insect stops struggling even if prey is thoroughly stuck when an insect stuck in a web owned by p schultzi p labiata or any regional variant of p fimbriata and next to a web spider s web web spider sometimes enters portia s web and portia pursues and catches web spider webs of spiders on which portias prey sometimes contain dead insects and other arthropods which are uneaten or partly eaten p schultzi and some other portias such as p fimbriata in queensland and p labiata sometimes scavenge these corpses if corpses are not obviously decayed a portia typically takes 3 to 5 minutes to pursuit prey but some pursuits can take much longer and in extreme cases close to 10 hours when pursuing a web based spider all portias eat eggs of other spiders including eggs of their own species and of other cursorial spiders and can extract eggs from cases ranging from flimsy ones of to tough papery ones of while only p fimbriata in queensland captures cursorial spiders in their nests all portias steal eggs from empty nests of cursorial spiders portias venom is unusually powerful against spiders when a portia stabs a small to medium spider up to portia s weight including another portia prey usually runs away for about 100 to 200 millimetres enters convulsions becomes paralysed after 10 to 30 seconds and continues convulsing for 10 seconds to 4 minutes portia slowly approaches prey and takes it portia usually needs to inflict up to 15 stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider 1 5 to 2 times to portia s weight and then portia may wait about 20 to 200 millimetres away for 15 to 30 minutes from seizing prey insects are usually not immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle sometimes for several minutes if portia cannot make further contact all types of prey usually recover making sluggish movements several minutes after stabbing but often starting normal movement only after an hour occasionally a portia is killed or injured while pursuing prey up to twice portia s size in tests p schultzi is killed in 1 7 of pursuits and injured but not killed in 5 3 p labiata is killed in 2 1 and injured but not killed in 3 9 and p fimbriata in queensland is killed in 0 06 of its pursuits and injured but not killed in another 0 06 a portia s especially tough skin often prevents injury even when its body is caught in other spider s fangs when injured portia bleeds and may sometimes loses one or more legs spiders palps and legs break off easily when attacked portia s palps and legs break off exceptionally easily which may be a defence mechanism and portias are often seen with missing legs or palps while other salticids in same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps tactics used by portia schultzi all performance statistics summarise result of tests in a laboratory using captive specimens following

s web efficiency in capturing prey is percentage of pursuits in which subject captures prey p schultzi specimens from kenya were used in this analysis q nt and sl identify p from queensland northern territory and sri lanka prey used were unspecified jumping spiders and web based spiders and houseflies for resting all portias spin a horizontal web whose diameter is about twice spider s body length and is suspended only 1 to 4 millimetres below a leaf p schultzi returns to its resting platform at night while eating prey at dusk and with no platform nearby one p schultzi built a silk platform while holding prey and then continued eating p schultzi does not respond to prey if light is under 100 lux like a restaurant with only subdued artificial lighting but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10 centimetres as light level increases a test suggested that p schultzi s hunting is stimulated only by vision as prey close but hidden caused no response a preliminary check showed that lures got same responses from p schultzi as live prey and then more detailed testing with lures showed that if target moved erratically p schultzi did not pursue it if target was totally stationary spider approached very slow between 5 and 100 millimetres per minute with very long pauses in final stages and sequence was not completed in 43 of cases if lure jiggled on same spot p schultzi approached much faster and sequence was almost always completed if a lure was pulled directly away from p schultzi spider followed and faster if lure was pulled up to a limit p schultzi generally moves very slowly a female p schultzi more often pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey while it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones it is about equally effective with all sizes of web spiders up to twice p schultzi s size a female p schultzi is effective against insects up to twice p schultzi s size when insect is stuck in a non salticid s web and against insects not in webs and up to p schultzi s size while p schultzi seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in open a female p schultzi very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in p schultzi s web than in other situations males are less efficient in all cases a test in 1997 showed that p schultzi s preferences for different types of prey are in order web spiders jumping spiders and insects these preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures and to p schultzi specimens without prey for 7 days well fed and without prey for 14 days starved p schultzi specimens without prey for 21 days extra starved showed no preference for different types of prey test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders and selection of prey species showed no evidence of affecting results insects were represented by house fly musca domestica in a test p schultzi spiderlings took drosophila fruit flies almost as often as spiders p schultzi retreats from sudden flights of houseflies found in open but sometimes takes flies entangled in a web out of its web p schultzi rarely capture thomisids non web sit and wait predators usually under 13 millimetres long in open as thomisids often wave their front legs when threatened if a spider walks under a p schultzi female s capture web and vertical distance is less than 8 centimetres p schultzi often drops onto prey too fast for a human eye to follow if p schultzi misses it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance and seldom misses second time most drops cover two to four centimetres as longer drops are often obstructed by web when hunting a web spider in prey s web a p schultzi walks very slowly towards prey and then when two to three centimetres away pauses for some minutes during this time p schultzi quivers very quickly with its whole body at regular intervals in almost all cases prey stays motionless p schultzi never plucks web as portia fimbriata does unlike queensland variant of p p schultzi has no special tactics when hunting other jumping spiders when hunting mature females of p fimbriata p africana p fimbriata p labiata and p schultzi emit olfactory signals that reduce risk that any other females males or juveniles of same species may contend for same prey effect inhibits aggressive mimicry against a prey spider even if prey spider is visible and also if prey is inhabiting any part of a web if a female of one of these portias smells a male of same species female stimulates males to court these portia species do not show this behaviour when they receive olfactory signals from members of other portia species reproduction and lifecycle before courtship a male portia spins a small web between boughs or twigs and he hangs under that and on to it he then soaks semen into reservoirs on his which are larger than those of females females of many spider species including p schultzi emit volatile pheromones into air and these generally attract males from a distance among p schultzi and some other portias when adults of same species but opposite sexes recognise each other they display at 10 to 30 centimetres males usually wait for 2 to 15 minutes before starting a display but sometimes a female starts a display first portias sometimes use propulsive displays with which a member threatens a rival of same species and sex and unreceptive females also threaten males in this way a propulsive display is a series of sudden quick movements including striking charging ramming and leaps in p schultzi and in some other species contests between males usually last only 5 to 10 seconds and only their legs make contact contests between portia females are violent and embraces in p schultzi typically take 20 to 60 seconds these occasionally include grappling that sometimes breaks a leg but more usually final move is a lunge sometimes one knocks other on her back and other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way if loser has a nest winner takes over and eats any eggs there a female p schultzi that sees a male may approach slowly or wait male then walks erect and displaying by waving his legs and palps if female does not run away she gives a propulsive display first if male stands his ground and she does not run away or repeat propulsive display he approaches and if she is mature they copulate if female is sub adult one moult from maturity a male may cohabit in female s capture web portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by female p schultzi typically copulates for about 100 seconds while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours females of p schultzi like those of p labiata try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation by twisting and lunging males wait until females have hunched their legs making this attack less likely males also try to from a silk thread to approach from above but females may manoeuvre to get higher position if female moves at all male leaps and runs away before being mature enough to mate females of p and also p labiata mimic adult females to attract males as prey p schultzi usually lays eggs on dead brown leaves about 20 millimetres long suspended near top of its capture web and then cover eggs with a sheet of silk if there is no dead leaf available female will make a small horizontal silk platform in capture web lay eggs on it and then cover eggs p schultzi has been seen laying eggs in a rolled up leaf in a web of ischnothele karschi for moulting all portias spin a horizontal web whose diameter is about twice spider s body length and is suspended only below a leaf spider lies head down and often slides down during moulting portias spin a similar temporary web for resting like all arthropods spiders moult and after hatching life stage before each moult is called an instar distinctive tufts of p schultzi juveniles appear in third instar p schultzi exuviae discarded skins have been found both in their own webs and in those of i karschi which has suggested that p schultzi moults in open in one case while its new skin was still pale and soft its were still stuck in discarded skin and spider slowly twirled for about 90 seconds until it was free spider s body then darkened quickly to normal colouration and some time later spider hung in its usual upside down posture in web ecology p schultzi s range runs from durban in south africa in south to malindi in kenya in north and westwards to east african rift and also in west africa and madagascar p schultzi along with a large variety of spiders and insects is often found in dense large webs of ischnothele karschi about 15 millimetres long which are especially abundant in partly cleared secondary bush where rain forests have been cut down and usually about one metre above ground a survey of one area suggested that there is about one p schultzi per three i karschi webs p schultzi is also found in its own web and those of other spiders on tree trunks and walls of buildings and in leaf litter taxonomy p schultzi is one of 17 species in genus portia as of june 2011 portia schultzi karsch 1878 is synonymous with martini simon 1900 linus lawrence 1937 and linus lawrence 1938 divided genus portia into two species groups schultzi group in which males palps have a fixed tibial apophysis and group in which apophysis of each in males has a joint separated by a membrane schultzi group includes p schultzi p africana p fimbriata and p labiata portia is in subfamily spartaeinae which is thought to be primitive molecular phylogeny a technique that compares dna of organisms to reconstruct tree of life indicates that portia is a member of clade spartaeinae that spartaeinae is basal quite similar to ancestors of all jumping spiders that portia s closest relative is genus and that next closest are and notes
