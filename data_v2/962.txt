that attracted railway developer henry flagler flagler built a railroad along east coast of florida and eventually to key west towns grew and farmland was cultivated along rail line during his 1904 campaign to be elected governor napoleon bonaparte broward promised to drain everglades and his later projects were more effective than disston s broward s promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer s report pressure from real estate developers and burgeoning tourist industry throughout south florida increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on numbers of wading birds hunted for their plumes alligators and other everglades animals severe hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 caused catastrophic damage and flooding from lake okeechobee that prompted army corps of engineers to build a dike around lake further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern florida following another population boom after world war ii and creation of central and southern florida flood control project everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas however in late 1960s following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to everglades national park national attention turned from

waterpower obtained by draining be improved to any useful purpose would such draining render country unhealthy many queries like these passed through our minds they can only be solved by a thorough examination of whole country could waters be lowered ten feet it would probably drain six hundred thousand acres should this prove to be a rich soil as would seem probable what a field it would open

this house such information as can be obtained in relation to practicability and probable expense of draining everglades of florida from this directive secretary of treasury robert j walker requested thomas buckingham smith from st augustine to consult those with experience in everglades on feasibility of draining them saying that he had been told two or three canals to gulf of mexico would be sufficient smith asked officers who had served in seminole wars to respond and many favored idea promoting land as a future agricultural asset to south a few disagreed such as captain john sprague who wrote he never supposed country would excite an inquiry other than as a hiding place for indians and had it occurred to me that so great an undertaking one so utterly impracticable as draining ever

wright s initial report concluded that drainage would not be difficult building canals would be more cost effective than constructing a dike around lake okeechobee soil would be fertile after drainage climate would not be adversely affected and enormous lake would be able to irrigate farmland in dry season wright based his conclusions on 15 years of weather data since recording of precipitation began in 1890s his calculations concentrated on towns of jupiter and kissimmee since weather data had not been recorded for any area within everglades none was included in report furthermore heaviest year of rain on record wright assumed was atypical and he urged that canals should not be constructed to bear that amount of water due to expense wright s calculations for what canals should be able to hold were off by 55 percent mccally p 101 his most fundamental mistake however was designing canals for a maximum rainfall of of water a day based on flawed data for july and august rainfall
