cunningham took out this advertisement in international variety magazine alt words friday 13th appear in large block letters on a black background text is shown busting through a pane of glass a caption on top of image reads from producers of last house on left comes most terrifying film ever made original friday 13th was produced and directed by sean s cunningham who had previously worked with filmmaker wes craven on last house on left 1972 cunningham inspired by success of john carpenter s halloween 1978 wanted friday 13th to be shocking visually stunning and make you jump out of your seat distancing himself from last house on left cunningham wanted friday 13th to be more of a roller coaster ride first film was meant to be a real scary movie and at same time make audiences laugh concept for friday 13th began as nothing more than a title a long night at camp blood was working title victor miller used while he drafted a script but cunningham believed in his friday 13th moniker and rushed to place an advertisement in international variety worrying that someone else owned rights to title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately cunningham commissioned a new york advertising agency to develop his visual concept of friday 13th logo which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass grove david pp 15 16 in end cunningham believed there were no problems with title but distributor george mansour contends that there was an issue there was a movie before ours called friday 13th orphan moderately successful but someone still threatened to sue it is unknown whether phil scuderi paid them off but issue was eventually resolved following success of friday 13th in 1980 paramount pictures began plans to make a sequel and immediately acquired worldwide distribution rights according to paramount pictures chairman and ceo frank mancuso sr we wanted it to be an event where teenagers would flock to theaters on that friday night to see latest episode initial ideas for a sequel involved friday 13th title being used for a series of discontinuous films released once a year and each would be a separate scary movie of its own right phil scuderi a co owner of esquire theaters with steve minasian and bob barsamian and a producer of original film insisted that sequel must have jason voorhees pamela s son even though his appearance at end of original film was only meant to be a joke steve miner associate producer of first film believed in idea and he ultimately directed first two sequels after cunningham opted not to return to director s chair brack peter pp 50 52 studio continued to generate sequels over years based on financial success they produced compared to their relatively low budgets with every film repeating same basic premise filmmakers came up with subtle adjustments so audience would return changes involved addition of a subtitle as opposed to just a number attached to end like final chapter and jason takes manhattan or filming movie in 3 d as miner did for friday 13th part iii bracke peter pp 73 74 third film would also be birthplace of one of most recognizable images in popular culture that of jason s hockey mask producer frank mancuso jr eventually decided to kill jason for good after he experienced problems finding new films to produce that were more than just horror movies because his name brought constant association to friday 13th film series bracke peter pg 98 jason would not stay buried for long as success of final chapter ensured another friday 13th film mancuso sr stated quite simply public still wanted to see these films so until they really stopped coming why not continue to make more a new beginning shifted focus of story to character of tommy jarvis and how he battles his inner demons hallucinations and rages to kill after his ordeal with jason in final chapter bracke peter pg 122 123 this premise was not repeated as very next installment brought jason back from dead jason lives attempted to create a funnier faster and more action packed friday than had previously been done bracke peter pp 147 148 limited financial success of jason lives provided enough incentive to create another sequel new blood idea proposed by screenwriter daryl haney stemmed from his realization that films always ended with jason battling final girl haney decided that this final girl should have telekinetic powers which led producer barbara sachs to dub film jason vs carrie bracke peter pg 173 okay we ll make vancouver look like new york and we ll do it that way but they came back again with you can t do brooklyn bridge in vancouver you can t do madison square garden in vancouver you can t do statue of liberty in vancouver pretty soon it was half new york half on boat then it was last third in new york it just kept getting whittled down and down rob hedden writer director on deconstruction of jason takes manhattans story plans were made to take jason away from crystal lake and place him in a larger environment for eighth film new york city was selected as main setting with jason spending approximately a third of movie on a boat before reaching new york film was then subtitled jason takes manhattan ultimately character spent majority of time on cruise ship as budget restrictions forced scenes of new york to be trimmed or downgraded vancouver had to substitute for majority of new york scenes bracke peter pp 194 195 when jason takes manhattan failed to perform successfully at box office sean cunningham decided that he wanted to reacquire rights to friday 13th from paramount and start working with new line cinema on freddy vs jason as new line owned nightmare on elm street franchise concept of a fight between freddy and jason was not new since paramount had approached new line about filming a crossover years before latter had gained licensing rights to friday 13th at that time both companies wanted license to other s character so that they could control making of film negotiations on project were never finalized which led paramount to make new blood after jason takes manhattan was released in 1989 rights reverted to scuderi minasian and who sold them to new line before cunningham could start working on freddy vs jason wes craven returned to new line to make new nightmare this effectively put freddy vs jason on hold but allowed cunningham chance to bring jason back into spotlight with jason goes to hell bracke peter pp 218 219 ninth installment turned a healthy profit though it was only intended to open door for a crossover with freddy krueger rather than to start a new series for new line bracke peter pg 238 ultimately film series would go through another sequel before that would happen cunningham s frustration with delayed development of freddy vs jason project forced him to create another sequel in an effort to keep franchise in minds of audiences based on jason takes manhattans concept of taking jason away from crystal lake 10th film would put titular character in space bracke peter pp 242 243 film suffered from loss of its biggest supporter president of production michael de luca when he resigned from his position lack of support forced finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on april 26 2002 and it would go on to become lowest grossing film in franchise at domestic box office it also held distinction of having largest budget of any of previous films at that time bracke peter pp 263 264 after more than 15 years of off and on development and approximately 6 million spent in 18 unused scripts from more than a dozen screenwriters new line finally produced a freddy and jason crossover for 2003 one of biggest hurdles for film was developing a story that managed to bring two horror icons together potential stories varied widely from freddy having molested and drowned jason as a child to a cult of freddy worshipers called fred heads bracke peter pp 267 269 in january 2007 platinum dunes producers andrew form and brad fuller outlined their intended goal to bring a friday 13th reboot to life new line approached fuller and form to create a reboot but because paramount still owned certain copyrights to first film reboot would not be able to use anything from original paramount who wanted to be included in development of a reboot approached producers and gave them license to use anything from original films including title with paramount on board fuller and form decided they wanted to use pieces from early films fuller said i think there are moments we want to address like how does hockey mask happen shannon and swift writers of freddy vs jason were brought on to pen script for new film with marcus nispel director of texas

friday 13th films generally received negative reception from professional critics in contrast to other slashers like halloween critics disliked how series favored high body counts over plot and character development and how each film was almost indistinguishable from last nevertheless films were a financial success prompting paramount to release more sequels contingent on box office appeal when comparing friday 13th to other top grossing american slasher franchises a nightmare on elm street child s play halloween hannibal lecter series psycho saw scream and texas chainsaw massacre and adjusting for 2018 inflation friday 13th is second highest grossing horror franchise in united states with approximately 755 6 million a nightmare on elm street follows with 592 8 million with hannibal lecter film series closely behind with 588 7 million then comes halloween with 557 5 million saw with 457 4 million scream with 442 9 million psycho with 376 3 million texas chainsaw massacre with 304 6 million and child s play film series rounding out list with approximately 203 million financial success has extended to home release with more than five million dvds sold by 2005 impact in december 2006 ign ranked friday 13th seventh in top 25 film franchises qualifications included franchise must have at least three films released before december 2006 franchises must be either a commercial or artistic success and franchise must have had some form of impact on popular culture three senior editors editor in chief and ign s entertainment editorial manager judged various film franchises in commenting on friday seventh place ranking general consensus among reviewers was that even though halloween franchise started slasher genre friday 13th became one of most influential franchises of 1980s and that its commercial success through 11 films novelizations comic books and other collectables is proof of its legacy abc online s arts and entertainment reporter gary kemble makes note of popularity of franchise throughout popular culture kemble points out that jason s mask which was not adopted until third film in series is one of most widely recognizable images in popular culture talking with brenna o brien co founder of fridaythe13thfilms com website pair discusses how fan base of franchise has become so impassioned with series that they have created films latex body suits to emulate jason s appearance and tattoos of jason and friday 13th moniker on their body everybody in audience imitated hoot owls and hyenas another girl in film went to her room and started to undress five guys sitting together in theater started a chant we want boobs karnick believes that this excerpt from ebert s review of friday 13th part 2 shows how critics have misunderstood point friday 13th films have tried to make s t karnick editor of american culture wrote an article for national review detailing impact friday 13th has had on slasher genre and noting that reasons critics have deplored films are same reasons why franchise has had such a strong influence karnick explained that friday 13th did not try and recreate same clever film that john carpenter made in 1978 but instead codified formula of halloween and boiled it down to its essentials so that it could be copied by other filmmakers in his assessment friday 13th changed horror genre by purposefully not providing back stories for characters so that when audience witnessed a character s death they are strangely unaffected instead friday 13th focuses on history and motivations of killer who would exact revenge not on people directly responsible but on innocent people a formula karnick notes was replicated in a nightmare on elm street child s play scream i know what you did last summer saw hannibal lecter films and halloween sequels as karnick sees it these films spoke directly to fears of increasing crime and social dislocation and provided audiences with ways to detach from these worries and conquer their fears of violence by laughing at it in karnick s eyes contemporary critics have failed to see how film has affected audiences and subsequently branded film series as both irresponsible for numbing audiences to violence and puritanical for showing murders of sexually active teens quoting director john carpenter karnick emphasized that teens thus dispatched became victims not as punishment for sexual activity but simply because they were too preoccupied to notice presence of a murderer pointing to roger ebert as a prime example of how critics have misunderstood films ebert wrote that during a screening of friday 13th part 2 he noticed that audience had no sympathy for victims and cheered during death scenes karnick explains that ebert s remarks show how film series forces audiences to experience very thing that motivates murders a lack of compassion in closing karnick suggested that these films were not puritanical but proved that audiences could be just as indifferent and callous as characters in films music when harry manfredini began working on musical score for 1980 film decision was made to play music only alongside killer so as not to trick audience into believing that killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be manfredini explains that lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate there s a scene where one of girls is setting up archery area one of guys shoots an arrow into target and just misses her it s a huge scare but if you notice there s no music that was a choice manfredini also noted that when something was about to happen music would cut off so that audience would relax a bit which allowed scare to become more effective since mrs voorhees killer in original friday 13th does not show up until final reel of film manfredini had job of creating a score that would represent killer in her absence manfredini was inspired by 1975 film jaws where shark is not seen for majority of film but motif created by john williams cued audience as to when shark was present during scenes and unseen bracke peter pg 39 while listening to a piece of krzysztof penderecki music which contained a chorus with striking pronunciations manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound for friday 13th he came up with sound ki ki ki ma ma ma based on line kill her mommy which mrs voorhees recites repeatedly in final reel ki comes from kill and ma from mommy to achieve unique sound he wanted for film manfredini spoke two words harshly distinctly and rhythmically into a microphone and ran them into an echo reverberation machine manfredini finished original score after a few weeks and recorded it in a friend s basement victor miller and assistant editor jay keuper have commented on how memorable music is with keuper describing it as iconographic manfredini makes note of mispronunciation of sounds everybody thinks it s cha cha cha i m like cha cha cha what are you talking about when manfredini returned for first sequel he had an easier time composing since he only needed to perfect what he had already created bracke peter pg 70 over course of sequels manfredini loosened philosophy that theme should be reserved just for killer manfredini describes style of sequels as more of a setting em up and knocking em down approach which meant that there were more mcguffins and red herrings that required killer s theme music be played to try to trick audience manfredini explains original had real myopic approach and then we had to start thinking of sequels as more conventional films for part 3 manfredini only returned to score first and last reels of film because he was busy with a broadway production jack pieced together portions of score from first two films to fill remaining time for part 3 while michael zagar composed an opening and closing theme manfredini and zagar met at latter s apartment where zagar rescored original opening theme using a disco beat manfredini returned for final chapter and although there were similar elements to score everything was newly recorded for fourth friday 13th bracke peter pg 118 when he began work on score for a new beginning manfredini created a theme just for character of tommy jarvis idea was to suggest that there was madness afoot which he believed helped to point finger at various characters to suggest that things were not as you might expect bracke peter pg 142 for jason lives tom mcloughlin instructed manfredini to create a score that would not alert audience about what was happening or about to
