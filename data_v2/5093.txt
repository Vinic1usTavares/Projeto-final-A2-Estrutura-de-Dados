action of 31 may 1809 was a naval skirmish in bay of bengal during napoleonic wars during action an honourable east india company convoy carrying goods worth over ps500 000 was attacked and partially captured by french frigate caroline three east indiamen that made up convoy fought against their opponent with their own batteries of cannon but ultimately were less powerful less manoeuvrable and less trained than their opponent and were defeated one by one only smallest of three escaped action was first in a string of attacks on important convoys in indian ocean by french cruisers operating from ile de france and ile bonaparte during a concerted campaign against british shipping in region background in november 1808 a squadron of powerful french frigates sailed for ile de france under commodore jacques hamelin this squadron was under orders to attack and capture or destroy british shipping in indian ocean particularly heavily armed convoys of east indiamen that carried millions of pounds worth of trade goods from british india and far east to britain gardiner p 92 these convoys were operated by honourable east india company heic which ran british india and maintained a private army and navy to secure colony and its trade routes during late napoleonic wars french naval strategy focused on disruption of this trade with use of fast and well armed frigates to operate independently along british trade routes and capture british merchant ships this affected british economy which was already severely stretched by war and forced royal navy to divert resources to distant parts of world to protect british trade gardiner p 59 during late spring of 1809 following end of indian ocean hurricane season hamelin ordered his ships to operate in bay of bengal one of these frigates was 40 gun caroline which was built in antwerp in 1806 and had a burthen of 1 078 tons bm caroline was commanded by jean baptiste henri feretier newly promoted following sudden death of her previous captain james p 199 feretier was first of hamelin s captains to find a british convoy spotting three sails on horizon on 31 may these belonged to a britain bound convoy of east indiamen which had departed hooghly river on 2 may laden with over ps500 000 worth of silk and other trade goods these ships were an important asset to heic and had originally been part of a larger convoy guarded by sloop hms victor and consisting of five indiamen and several smaller vessels on 24 may a storm divided convoy victor and small ships separated from indiamen two of indiamen and separated from other three on 25 may monarch had sprung a serious leak and needed to deviate to penang and earl spencer accompanied her taylor p 215 three remaining indiamen streatham europe and lord keith were large and more importantly armed streatham and europe of 800 tons bm each and carried 30 cannon whereas smaller lord keith was 600 tons bm and carried 12 guns james p 193 four years earlier a convoy of east indiamen had driven off a french ship of line and attached frigates under admiral linois in similar waters by forming a battle line and firing on their opponents as they closed adkins p 185 crews of these east indiamen were not of royal navy standard however with insufficient training and large numbers of portuguese chinese and lascar seamen who proved unreliable in combat brenton p 398 battle one of smaller ships from convoy an american merchant ship named silenus had separated from main body in storm and arrived at nicobar islands there she had encountered caroline and american captain had reported location and value of convoy to feretier taylor p 217 setting all sail feretier took caroline to north west and sighted convoy at 05 30 only a few days after leaving nicobar islands british ships under loose command of john dale in streatham originally mistook french frigate for missing victor and it was not until another half hour had passed that dale realised danger his ships were in ordering indiamen to form a line of battle dale placed his ship in centre with small lord keith ahead and europe behind however lack of naval experience on british ships resulted in indiamen sailing too far from one another in line thus leaving them unable to provide effective mutual support able to attack heic ships individually caroline pulled alongside europe at 06 30 and began a heavy fire into merchant ship which intermittently replied with her available guns within 30 minutes europe s rigging was tattered many of her guns dismounted and a number of her crew wounded or killed james p 194 moving past his now disabled opponent feretier next attacked streatham which had slowed in an unsuccessful attempt to support europe now alone against frigate streatham came under heavy fire at 07 00 and by 08 00 was badly damaged with casualties in her crew her guns all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks with further resistance hopeless dale hauled down company flag and surrendered during engagement between streatham and caroline lord keith and europe had fired sporadically at french ship with little effect pulling away from his surrendered opponent feretier then fired on lord keith whose captain peter campbell realised that his ship stood no chance against frigate and turned eastward running before wind to escape despite suffering severe damage to lord keith s rigging as he did so william gelston captain of europe also attempted to flee but his battered ship was in no condition to outrun virtually untouched frigate and he surrendered at 10 00 lord keith eventually arrived safely at penang on 9 june taylor p 218 casualties on british ships were six killed and at least four wounded while french lost one killed and three wounded aftermath feretier repaired his captures at sea and returned to ile de france arriving two months later on 22 july discovering presence of a british frigate squadron under josias rowley off port louis feretier diverted to saint paul on ile bonaparte among goods removed from ships were ps500 000 worth of silk which was stored in warehouses near docks in british raid on saint paul on 21 september 1809 british burned warehouses and their contents and captured caroline streatham and europe gardiner p 93 despite these subsequent losses feretier was highly commended for his leadership in action and received a promotion from governor charles decaen he also received letters from captains of streatham and europe thanking him for his attention and courtesy to their crews and passengers during their period of
