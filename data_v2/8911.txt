took three weeks but pattinson was still surprised by how boring recording process was there was a lot of hanging about i didn t get all drop ins and edits bit bell 2003 pp 6 7 music and lyrics music on crocodiles is generally dark and moody in 1980 british music magazine nme described mcculloch s lyrics as scattered with themes of sorrow horror and despair themes that are reinforced by stormy animal sexual imagery and american music magazine creem described crocodiles as a moody mysterious fascinating record adams 2002 p 41 in 1981 music journalist david fricke writing for rolling stone magazine said instead of dope mcculloch trips out on his worst fears isolation death and emotional bankruptcy in his 2005 book rip it up and start again post punk 1978 1984 british music journalist simon reynolds describes sound of album as pared and sparse reynolds 2006 p 440 he goes on to describe pattinson s granite basslines carrying melody sergeant s guitar playing as jagged quartz and avoiding anything resembling a solo apart from odd flinty peal of lead playing de freitas drumming as minimal and surging urgency and mcculloch s vocals as having precocious authority reynolds then describes songs as being rooted in doubt anguish despair while tightness and brightness of their sound transmits contradictory sensations of confidence vigour and euphoria he also describes how line stars are stars and they shine so hard from track stars are stars showed how band felt no embarrassment in their wish to be famous reynolds 2006 p 443 in 1989 mcculloch told reynolds how as a teenager he felt there was a big movie camera in sky mcculloch described opening line of track going up ain t thou watching my film as a terrible line and he went on to say it was meant to be tongue in cheek but that was what spurred me on cover photographs used on cover of crocodiles were taken by photographer brian griffin griffin took a series of pictures of band in woods near rickmansworth in hertfordshire at night and which show themes of introspection despair and confusion adams 2002 pp 39 40 describing picture used on front cover of album music journalist chris salewicz said bunnymen are placed in poses of histrionic despair in a near gothic woodland that evokes memories of elfin glades and fabled arthurian legends creem magazine said cover art suggests four boys dazed and confused in a drugged dream a surreal where are we landscape bunnymen s images are of loneliness disconnection a world gone awry originally band wanted pictures to include burning stakes however given possible kkk connotations they settled for moody lighting instead despite this mcculloch was pleased with cover saying cover is better to look at than mona lisa adams 2002 p 40 sergeant was less happy and said he was pissed off that there was a solo picture of mcculloch on back cover bell 2003 p 7 in book klf by john higgs bill drummond says that he saw face of echo an imagined giant rabbit in

attractive melodies with dark and moody but not obscure personal lyrics all turned into compulsive listening by a driving beat ringing guitars and a hauntingly emotional voice reviewing album in 1981 for rolling stone magazine david fricke awarded it four out of five stars and said when describing mcculloch s vocals he specializes in a sort of apocalyptic brooding combining jim morrison style psychosexual yells a flair for david bowie like vocal inflections and nihilistic bark of his punk peers into a disturbing portrait of singer as a young neurotic he went on to say behind him gripping music swells into doors style dirges pictures on my wall pil like guitar dynamics monkeys evocative pop rescue and yardbirds cum elevators ravers jacked up in new wave manner do it clean crocodiles reviewing 2003 remastered version for american music magazine blender s website reviewer andrew harrison also gave album four out of five stars and said bunnymen were a pure nihilistic thrill with
