borders of scotland or by forces originating in region between departure of romans in fifth century and adoption of innovations of renaissance in early sixteenth century in this period conflict developed from minor raids to major conflicts incorporating many of innovations of continental warfare in early middle ages war on land was characterised by use of small war bands of household troops often engaging in raids and low level warfare arrival of vikings brought a new scale of naval warfare with rapid movement based around viking longship birlinn which developed from longship became a major factor in warfare in highlands and islands by high middle ages kings of scotland could command forces of tens of thousands of men for short periods as part of common army mainly of poorly armoured spearmen and bowmen after davidian revolution of twelfth century which introduced elements of feudalism to scotland these forces were augmented by small numbers of mounted and heavily armoured knights feudalism also introduced castles into country originally simple wooden motte and bailey constructions but these were replaced in thirteenth century with more formidable stone enceinte castles with high encircling walls in thirteenth century threat of scandinavian naval power subsided and kings of scotland were able to use naval forces to help subdue highlands and islands scottish field armies rarely managed to stand up to usually larger and more professional armies produced by england but they were used to good effect by robert i of scotland at battle of bannockburn in 1314 to secure scottish independence he adopted a policy of slighting castles and made use of naval power to support his forces beginning to develop a royal scottish naval force in late middle ages under stewart kings these forces were further augmented by specialist troops particularly men at arms and archers hired by bonds of manrent similar to english indentures of same period new livery and maintenance castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare such as longer pikes extensive use of artillery and they built up a formidable navy however one of best armed and largest scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at hands of an english army at battle of
