kahn who also directed video for brown and ester dean s drop it low said that brown played him tracks from his album on set and had a clear idea of what he wanted for i can transform ya video kahn said obviously him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley his interests in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all boy culture stuff it falls directly in line with what i like his talent is phenomenal i m still struggling to try and capture that talent on film and it s a challenge here s a guy who can literally do anything if you watch this thing he s doing nunchuck tricks and i m a huge kung fu aficionado and they re mind blowing i ve never seen stuff like that before in kung fu flicks i would say it s like a pure aesthetic dance video from very fiber of it everything dances onscreen everything has movement everything has a certain mechanical rhythm he actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical it s sort of a hyper intense version of robot even transformations go directly in line with movements kahn also said that instead of taking song s lyrics and being pretentious about it he wanted to show audience exactly what brown was singing about commenting what if we just got ambitious and demonstrated lyrics trick is to do it in a creative way let s try to display lyrics and feeling of dance at
