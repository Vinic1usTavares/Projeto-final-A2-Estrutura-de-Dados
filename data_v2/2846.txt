indian head cent also known as an indian head penny was a one cent coin 0 01 produced by united states bureau of mint from 1859 to 1909 it was designed by james barton longacre chief engraver at philadelphia mint from 1793 to 1857 cent was a copper coin about size of a half dollar discovery of gold in california caused a large inflation in prices as gold became more abundant price of copper rose cent and half cent manufacture was one of only profit centers for mint and by 1850 mint began looking for alternatives in 1857 mint reduced size of cent and changed composition to 12 nickel and 88 copper copper nickel issuing a new design flying eagle cent new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents though thicker this was first use of copper nickel by united states copper nickel made them look brighter and they began to be called white cent or nicks in 1858 flying eagle was replaced with indian head design flying eagle design caused production difficulties and mint soon looked to replace it mint director james ross snowden selected indian head design and chose a laurel wreath for reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield cents were hoarded during economic chaos of american civil war when metal nickel was in short supply as mint officials saw that privately issued bronze tokens were circulating they induced congress to pass coinage act of 1864 authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy in postwar period cent became very popular and was struck in large numbers in most years an exception was 1877 when a poor economy and little demand for cents created one of rarest dates in series with advent of coin operated machines in late 19th and early 20th centuries even more cents were produced reaching 100 million for first time in 1907 in 1909 indian head cent was replaced by lincoln cent designed by victor d brenner inception half dollar sized large cent was struck from 1793 to 1857 that coin was intended to contain close to a cent s worth of copper as people expected coins to contain close to their face values in metal nevertheless because of constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments by early 1850s fluctuations in price of copper led mint of united states to seek alternatives including reducing size of cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper result was flying eagle cent same diameter as later lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and heavier composed of 88 copper and 12 nickel flying eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a pattern coin in 1856 then for circulation in 1857 and 1858 flying eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn spanish colonial silver coins which until then had circulated widely in united states these small cents were also issued in exchange for copper coins they had replaced by 1858 mint authorities found piece unsatisfactory in production high points on both sides of coin eagle s head and wreath opposed each other and it was difficult to get design to be brought out fully in tough copper nickel alloy mint engraver james b longacre designer of flying eagle cent was instructed to develop alternative designs he produced one showing a slimmer eagle which would not clash as much with reverse wreath although this would have cured production problem design was not liked mint director james ross snowden suggested a head of columbus as an obverse design but longacre felt public would not approve of a historic figure on an american coin thumb upright left a spanish colonial two piece two bits from potosi mint today in bolivia in 1858 mint tested new designs for cent between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck consisting of standard flying eagle obverse a scrawny eagle pattern and indian head design mated with four different wreaths for reverse snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns sets were also sold to collectors indian head design was apparently prepared by april as on twelfth of that month a mr howard wrote to snowden that i have learned that a new pattern piece for cent has been struck off at mint with a head resembling that of five dollar piece and on reverse a shield at top of olive and oak wreath and asking to purchase a specimen other numismatists also sought pieces r coulton davis a philadelphia druggist with ties to mint wrote to snowden in june informing him of a favorable story in a boston newspaper and augustus b sage wrote to mint director same month asking for a specimen for himself and one for newly founded american numismatic society according to walter breen snowden most likely chose combination of indian head and laurel wreath as it was lowest relief of any of options and could be expected to strike well on november 4 1858 snowden wrote to treasury secretary howell cobb about indian head design and two days later wrote to longacre informing him that it was approved longacre was to prepare necessary dies for production which was to begin on january 1 1859 design longacre advocated his indian head design in an august 21 1858 letter to snowden by numismatic legend facial features of goddess liberty on obverse of indian head cent were based on features of longacre s daughter sarah tale runs that she was at mint one day when she tried on headdress of one of a number of native americans who were visiting and her father sketched her however sarah longacre was 30 years old and married in 1858 not 12 as in tale and longacre himself stated that face was based on a statue of crouching venus in philadelphia on loan from vatican he did often sketch his elder daughter and there are resemblances between depictions of sarah and various representations of liberty on his coins of 1850s these tales were apparently extant at time as snowden writing to treasury secretary howell cobb in november 1858 denied that coin was based on any human features in longacre family lee f mckenzie in his 1991 article on longacre notes that any artist can be influenced by many things but calls story essentially false regardless of who posed for longacre facial features of indian are essentially caucasian meaning that a caucasian woman wears headdress of a native american man longacre had in 1854 designed three dollar piece with a female with similar features also supposedly based on museum sculpture but a more fanciful headdress and adapted that design for gold dollar officials were aware of this artistic license at time of issue snowden in his november 1858 letter to cobb characterizes two earlier coins as artists at mint evidently not realizing absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of warrior brave on head of a woman longacre would not be last to juxtapose features of a white woman with an indian headdress reserved for men augustus saint gaudens for indian head eagle 1907 produced a similar design later issues depict more accurate indians including bela lyon pratt s indian head gold pieces 1908 buffalo nickel 1913 by james earle fraser who worked from native american models and oregon trail memorial half dollar 1926 designed by fraser and his wife laura thumb left cornelius vermeule thought indian head cent was better than longacre s 1859 pattern half dollar art historian cornelius vermeule had mixed emotions about indian head cent longacre enriched mythology of american coinage in a pleasant if unpretentious fashion given his pattern half dollar designs of 1859 as a yardstick he could have done worse in another comparison vermeule suggested far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically and far less attractive to eye than flying eagle indian head cent was at least to achieve blessing of popular appeal coin became perhaps most beloved and typically american of any piece great or small in american series great art coin was not but it was one of first products of united states mints to achieve common touch production redesign and surplus 1859 1861 production of indian head cent for commerce began at start of 1859 as issued for circulation pieces differ in some particulars from pattern 1858 cent of similar design longacre sharpened some details pattern coin had laurel leaves in reverse wreath in bunches of five leaves issued 1859 cent has them in bunches of six cents dated 1858 with adopted reverse with six leaf bunches are known were most likely struck in 1859 and are extremely rare in 1860 reverse of cent was changed to feature an oak wreath and a narrow shield such reverses are also known on 1859 dated pieces struck as patterns according to richard snow in his guidebook to flying eagle and indian head cents this was not due to problems with laurel wreath reverse design used in 1859 as full details survive on many extant pieces walter breen however suggested that feathers and curls on obverse did not strike as well as they would later and that this may account for snowden s decision to change design again david lange in his history of mint states that it was to give coin quoting snowden more national character all 1859 cents and some from 1860 have cutoff of liberty s bust on obverse end with a point most 1860 cents and all later issues have it rounded tens of millions of flying eagle cents had been issued in exchange for old american and small spanish silver spanish silver was still flowing into mint in early 1859 and at snowden s urging congress on march 3 of that year extended redemption of these foreign coins legal tender in us until 1857 for another two years neil carothers in his work on small denomination currency challenged this decision as unnecessary deprived of legal tender status remaining spanish silver would have been eliminated through sales to banks for their bullion those who brought old coins to mint received cents for them at first flying eagle and then indian head in year following renewal some forty million indian head cents were issued meaning nearly a hundred million copper nickel cents had entered commerce since 1857 as coin did not circulate in south and west due to prejudice against base metal money they choked commerce no one had to take them no law made them legal tender at snowden s urging congress in june 1860 ended exchange nevertheless as snowden admitted in his annual report that year there were too many cents in circulation in october 1860 bankers magazine and statistical register reported that there were ten million cents in commerce in new york city above what was needed and if anyone wished to order in bulk they could be purchased at a discount shortage and redesign 1862 1864 surplus of cents was relieved by economic chaos engendered by american civil war which began in 1861 at end of that year banks stopped paying out gold which thereafter commanded a premium over paper money these greenbacks beginning in following year were issued in large quantities by federal government silver vanished from commerce in june 1862 as price of that metal rose leaving cent sole federal coin that had not entirely vanished from commerce through hoarding glut of cents had by then abated as merchants had stored them away in quantity one new york city floor collapsed beneath load there were other means of making change which passed in emergency from postage stamps to privately issued tokens but public demand was for cent philadelphia mint struck record numbers and set aside part of production to be transmitted to other cities nevertheless by july 1862 cent in quantity could only be purchased at a premium of 4 in paper money in major cities in east copper nickel pieces were nicknamed nickels or nicks presentation of coins in payment carried with it no obligation to make change in same accordingly with a small quantity of nicks a shopper could make purchases with exact change without receiving such makeshifts as merchants credit slips that others might not accept at stated value by 1863 bankers magazine reported that premium for cents in philadelphia had risen to 20 thereafter premium decreased as there was a flood of metal tokens issued by merchants which were widely accepted other war expedients such as fractional currency lessened demand for cent by taking place of missing silver coinage small quantities of cents circulated among them though many were still hoarded government officials saw that public readily accepted merchant tokens many of these tokens were made of bronze and when in 1863 they attempted to restore coins to circulation use of bronze coins which would not contain their face values in metal was considered in his annual report submitted october 1 1863 lincoln administration mint director james pollock noted that whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins they merely want inferior base metal money for convenience in making exact payments he observed that private cent tokens had sometimes contained as little as a fifth of a cent in metal yet had still circulated he proposed that copper nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of same size pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery on december 8 pollock wrote to treasury secretary salmon p chase proposing a bronze cent and two cent piece thumb right cent sized civil war token which was issued privately as federal coinage was hoarded on march 2 1864 pollock wrote urgently to chase warning him that mint was running out of nickel and that demand for cents was at an all time high he also informed secretary that united states assay commission composed of citizens and officials who had met previous month to test nation s silver and gold coinage had recommended use of french bronze 95 copper with remainder tin and zinc as a coinage metal for cent and a new two cent piece three days later chase sent pollock s december letter and draft legislation for bronze one and two cent pieces to maine senator william p fessenden chairman of senate finance committee fessenden took no immediate action and on march 16 pollock wrote again to chase warning that mint was going to run out of nickel much of which was imported chase forwarded his letter to fessenden legislation was finally introduced by new hampshire senator daniel clark on march 22 pollock s letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as senate passed bill without debate domestic supply of nickel was at that time produced by a mine at gap pennsylvania owned by industrialist joseph wharton on march 19 pollock wrote to chase that they had no more nickel nor was any available from overseas we are thus shut up to home supply from works of mr wharton opposed to removal of nickel from cent wharton published a pamphlet in april 1864 proposing coinage of one two three five and ten cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper doubling percentage of nickel used in cent despite wharton s efforts on april 20 a select committee of house of representatives endorsed bill it was opposed by pennsylvania s thaddeus stevens who represented mining area from which wharton extracted his nickel wharton had spent 200 000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery stevens related and it was unfair to deprive him of major use of his metal shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to government besides he argued copper nickel alloy for cent had been approved by congress and new metal which he termed brass would show rust he was rebutted by iowa congressman john a kasson chairman of house committee on coinage weights and measures who stated that bronze alloy did not resemble brass and he could not support proposition that government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales legislation passed house and coinage act of 1864 was signed by president abraham lincoln on april 22 1864 legislation made base metal coins legal tender for first time both cents and two cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten government would not however redeem them in bulk act also outlawed private one and two cent tokens and later that year congress abolished all such issues legislation did not allow for redemption of old copper nickel cents it had been drafted by pollock who was hoping that seignorage income from issuing new coins would help finance mint operations and he did not want it reduced by recall of old pieces wharton and his interests were appeased by passage of a bill for a three cent piece in 1865 and a five cent piece in 1866 both of his proposed alloy out of which nickel as latter coin has come to be known is still struck despite this wharton and his nickel interests made repeated attempts to return nickel to cent each time failing both as part of deliberations over what became coinage act of 1873 and in early 1880s copper nickel cents from early in 1864 were generally bought up by speculators and did not circulate in large numbers mint began producing bronze cents on may 13 three weeks after passage of coinage act and they were released into circulation on may 20 dies prepared for copper nickel pieces were used to strike bronze sometime during 1864 longacre sharpened his design for use in striking softer bronze pieces and also added his initial l it is not known when this was done it may have been as early as may with new dies used alongside old these bronze pieces are often referred to as 1864 l and 1864 no l l is known on 1863 dated pieces in both metals and on 1864 dated copper nickel pieces some of these issues all extremely rare were likely struck at a later date bronze cent was immediately accepted by public and heavy production of issue soon alleviated shortage of cents later years 1865 1909 thumb upright rare 1877 indian head cent in postwar years heavy production of cents was scaled back as hoarding ceased and some of slack was taken up by other base metal coins nevertheless various issues of small coins at that time not redeemed by government caused another glut in commerce which was not completely broken until act of march 3 1871 allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of 20 or more pursuant to this act over thirty million copper nickel cents of both indian head and flying eagle designs were redeemed mint melted these for recoinage fifty five million bronze cents were also sold to government beginning in 1874 mint re issued these in response to commercial requests for cents lowering demand for new coins drops in price of silver brought coins of that metal hoarded for a decade or more back into commerce also decreasing demand between 1866 and 1878 production only occasionally exceeded ten million 1877 coin with a circulation mintage of 852 500 is a rare date for series after 1881 there were few of bronze cents due to high demand for denomination though copper nickel cents continued to be redeemed and melted with discontinuance of two cent piece and three cent silver in 1873 cent and three cent nickel were sole survivors of coins valued at less than five cents three cent nickel by this time was unpopular because of its odd denomination and with return of silver coinage its similarity in size to dime a three cent postage rate had been one of reasons why that denomination had begun in 1850s in early 1880s post office decreased basic rate for letters to two cents this change both increased demand for cents and decreased demand for three cent nickel which was abolished in 1890 in most years of 1880s there were large issues of indian head cents exception was in mid 1880s when poor economic times led to less demand for minor coins no cents or five cent nickels were minted after february 1885 until near end of 1886 production of undated dies into which year of issue could be punched did continue and during hiatus in coin production chief engraver charles e barber modified design removing light outlines between lettering on obverse and rest of design and making other changes this led to two types for 1886 indian head cent which may be distinguished on type i lowest feather on obverse points between i and c in america while on type ii it points between c and final a snow estimates that 14 million of mintage of 17 654 290 were type i as were a majority of 4 290 proof strikings economic panic of 1893 again caused a decrease in number of cents produced as coins accumulated in private hands were spent creating a surplus aside from that final years of series before its termination in 1909 were marked by large mintages with 1907 topping hundred million mark a healthy economy in most years fueled demand as did increasing popularity of coin operated machines some of which could be found at penny arcades by early 20th century cent was accepted across nation but by law production of cent was limited to philadelphia mint treasury officials sought removal of this restriction and for an increase in annual appropriation to purchase base metals for production of cent and nickel amount expended had remained same since 1873 although demand for cents had greatly increased by act of april 24 1906 mint received permission to strike base metal coins at any mint and appropriation was quadrupled to 200 000 small quantities of cents were struck at san francisco mint in 1908 and 1909 replacement thumb upright left 1909 s lincoln cent congress passed legislation in 1890 allowing mint to alter designs that had been in use for 25 years without need for legislative authorization in 1904 president theodore roosevelt wrote to his secretary of treasury leslie mortier shaw complaining that u s coinage lacked artistic merit and enquiring if it would be possible to engage a private artist such as sculptor augustus saint gaudens to prepare new coin designs at roosevelt s instructions mint hired saint gaudens to redesign cent and four gold pieces double eagle 20 eagle 10 half eagle 5 and quarter eagle 2 50 as designs of those pieces had remained same for 25 years they could be changed without an act of congress as could indian head cent upright thumb right saint gaudens model for cent obverse liberty with an indian headdress added design was later developed for 10 piece saint gaudens originally conceived a flying eagle design for cent but at roosevelt s request developed it for 20 piece after learning that under 1873 act an eagle could not appear on cent writer and friend witter recalled that in january 1907 saint gaudens was seriously ill with cancer and was carried to his studio for ten minutes a day to critique work of his assistants on current projects including cent saint gaudens died on august 3 1907 without having submitted another design for cent with redesign of four gold denominations completed by 1908 roosevelt turned his attention to cent centenary of birth of assassinated president abraham lincoln would occur in february 1909 and large numbers of privately manufactured souvenirs were already being issued many citizens had written to treasury department proposing a lincoln coin and roosevelt was interested in honoring his fellow republican this was a break with previous american numismatic tradition before lincoln cent no regularly circulating u s coin had featured an actual person as opposed to idealized personifications as of liberty in late 1908 roosevelt sat for sculptor victor david brenner who was designing a medal for panama canal commission it is uncertain how brenner was selected to design coin but in january 1909 mint director frank a leach hired him to design a lincoln cent this went into circulation later in 1909 putting an end to indian head cent series collecting thumb right 200px s mint mark designated with arrow on reverse of a 1908 s indian head penny indian head cents were popular among coin

seek a complete set came at a time when bronze version of indian head cent was still common in pocket change they were not widely studied until 1960s numismatic writer tom in his introduction to snow s book ascribes this to prejudice among numismatists who grew up with indian head cent as a common circulation piece he notes that 1960 edition of r s yeoman s a guide book of united states coins
