from time wrote that if you needed a reminder of just how thoroughly mariah carey dominated 90s or a refresher on staggering force of numbers she s put up throughout her career 1 to infinity will do just fine but also pointing out that most of songs were released from 1990 to 1995 just 20 of carey s entire recording career as well as criticizing lack of material released from 2005 onwards in 2015 we re as far away from we belong together as that song was from fantasy and that lost decade is root of this compilation s greatest tragedy great majority of fine work carey s done in last decade might as well not exist nonetheless he praised compilation for highlighting sheer athleticism and skill that propelled carey s early work she took very simple songs both in terms of arrangements and theme rooted in pop gospel and r b and turned them into feats of strength granting them dynamism and drama with a voice that juggled power clarity and agility with ease commercial performance 1 to
