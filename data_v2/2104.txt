nationaltheatret expansion process of extending holmenkollen line from majorstuen to city center had started in 1901 process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between city and company in part because two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway construction started in 1912 but stopped again in 1914 because municipality and company could not agree on location of terminus municipality wanted it at ruselokkveien but this would make it difficult for company to build tunnel through city center to connect to suburban tramways east of city center construction was stopped in october 1914 aspenberg 1995 11 13 following year municipality launched a contest to make best suggestion for tram networks it took five years to select a winner and this

tunnel opened in 1928 when tunnel had not been completed by 1922 aker municipality decided to purchase line at time municipality was planning to start its own tram company akersbanerne and smestad line was considered as part of network along with planned sognsvann line but delays caused sognsvann line not to open until 1934 take over caused a disagreement between two companies about payment for

on lilleaker line to sorbyhaugen on roa line construction was delayed because a bridge needed to be built across and company ran out of money and construction stopped for nine months in 1940 line was opened on 15 june 1942 and section from sorbyhaugen to kolsas was renamed kolsas line this resulted in two companies operating from sorbyhaugen to nationaltheatret but an agreement was made where only holmenkolbanen s tickets were sold on section so all revenue went to that company regardless of train s operator kolsas line operated every fifteen minutes along roa line part aspenberg 1995 24 27 baerum extensions thumb bridge over grinidammen proposals to extend line into neighboring municipality of baerum had first been launched in 1919 in 1941 construction of an extension to grini started

station had been moved and line put in a short tunnel under center of roa aspenberg 1995 33 extension via eiksmarka to lijordet opened on 3 december 1951 lijordet was intended to be named but there

aspenberg 1995 34 during early 1970s baerum municipality wanted to extend line onwards to and were willing to pay construction costs holmenkolbanen also wanted municipality to pay for new trams but municipality was not willing to do this line was therefore only extended to osteras which could be reached using existing fleet extension was opened in 1972 since 1978 holmenkolbanen has had sufficient trams to operate an extension but since then municipality has not been interested in extending line further aspenberg 1995 35 thumb left an mx3000 train arriving at smestad metro standard ownership of line was gradually taken over by municipality through oslo sporveier in 1975 most of shares were bought along with those that oslo sporveier had received as part of municipal merger with aker in 1948 gradually during 1970s and 1980s holmenkolbanen became more integrated into oslo sporveier including two using same rolling stock tickets and uniforms oslo sporveier upgraded line in last half of 1970s laying new ties upgrading tracks to higher weight and purchasing new trams aspenberg 1995 36 39 plans to have trams run through city center have existed since 1919 in late 1940s holmenkolbanen revised plan and proposed extending common tunnel eastwards from 1951 municipality started working on plans for oslo metro in eastern part of city large difference in traffic between eastern and western lines caused plans to be changed during 1960s and eastern network was equipped with third rail power supply eastern lines at first terminated at jernbanetorget and plans were to continue lines onwards towards bislett but by 1970s these plans changed largely because of increase of traffic in west and decrease in east on 7 march 1987 services from west including roa line were extended from nationaltheatret to stortinget a station that allowed transfer to metro aspenberg 1995 39 43 thumb a t1000 train at eiksmarka sognsvann line was upgraded to metro standard and reopened on 3 april 1993 roa line was closed on 5 february 1995 to be upgraded to metro standard upgrades meant that all platforms needed to be extended to to allow six car metro trains only exception was osteras that was made only long enough for five cars although this could easily be extended later upgrade involved a complete renovation of tracks with old ones being replaced with new and increasing weight to 49 kilograms per meter 33 lb ft overhead wire was replaced with a third rail this required all four level crossings at makrellbekken hovseter eiksmarka and ekraveien to be replaced in former three track was sunk under level of road requiring several hundred meters of line to be rebuilt pedestrian underpasses were built at borgen holmen huseby skole and lijordet aspenberg 1995 43 48 three stations were closed grini huseby skole and heggeli volvat kept two car length and was no longer served by roa line only kolsas line to compensate for closing of huseby skole roa was moved back to it original position causing a heated local debate signaling system was replaced with automatic train protection used on metro but installation was delayed and a temporary system was used this caused an accident at where twelve people were injured during upgrade area along line was served by buses bus stops could only be established at places where cars could pass making it difficult to place stops at roa and sorbyhaugen passengers transferring to kolsas line would normally have 15 minutes longer travel time and congestion caused delays of up to 30 minutes this caused more people to use cars which increased congestion further ridership on buses was significantly lower than on rail kolsas line opened on 20 august and roa line on 19 november after opening line connected with furuset line as line 2 and started being served by t1000 trains aspenberg 1995 46 51 roa line including common section in city center has been extended eight times more than any other line of oslo metro route thumb
