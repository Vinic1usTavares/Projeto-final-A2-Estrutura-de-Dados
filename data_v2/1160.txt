battle of manzikert was fought between byzantine empire and seljuk empire on 26 august 1071 near manzikert theme of iberia modern malazgirt in mus province turkey decisive defeat of byzantine army and capture of emperor romanos iv diogenes played an important role in undermining byzantine authority in anatolia and armenia and allowed for gradual turkification of anatolia many of turks who had been travelling westward during 11th century saw victory at manzikert as an entrance to asia minor barber malcolm crusader states yale university press 2012 page 9 brunt of battle was borne by professional soldiers from eastern and western tagmata as large numbers of mercenaries and anatolian levies fled early and survived battle fallout from manzikert was disastrous for byzantines resulting in civil conflicts and an economic crisis that severely weakened byzantine empire s ability to adequately defend its borders this led to mass movement of turks into central anatolia by 1080 an area of had been gained by seljuk turks it took three decades of internal strife before alexius i 1081 to 1118 restored stability to byzantium historian thomas asbridge says in 1071 seljuqs crushed an imperial army at battle of manzikert in eastern asia minor and though historians no longer consider this to have been an utterly cataclysmic reversal for greeks it still was a stinging setback thomas s asbridge

powerful in middle ages it began to decline under reign of militarily incompetent constantine ix and again under constantine x a brief two year period of reform under isaac i merely delayed decay of byzantine army about 1053 constantine ix disbanded what 11th century greek historian john skylitzes calls iberian army which consisted of 50 000 men skylitzes contemporaries former officials michael attaleiates and kekaumenos agree that by these soldiers constantine did catastrophic harm to empire s eastern defenses constantine made a truce with seljuks that lasted until 1064 but a large seljuk army under alp arslan attacked theme of iberia and took ani after a siege of 25 days they captured city and slaughtered its population link baynes t s ed 1878 anni encyclopaedia britannica 2 9th ed new york charles scribner s sons p 72 in 1068 romanos iv took power and after some speedy military reforms entrusted manuel comnenus nephew of isaac i comnenus to lead an expedition against seljuks manuel captured hierapolis in syria next thwarted a turkish attack against iconium with a counter attack but was then defeated and captured by seljuks under sultan alp arslan despite his success alp arslan was quick to seek a peace treaty with byzantines signed in 1069 he saw fatimids in egypt as his main enemy and had no desire to be diverted by unnecessary hostilities in february 1071 romanos sent envoys to alp arslan to renew 1069 treaty and keen to secure his northern flank against attack alp arslan happily agreed abandoning siege of edessa he immediately led his army to attack fatimid held aleppo however peace treaty had been a deliberate distraction romanos now led a large army into armenia to recover lost fortresses before seljuks had time to respond prelude accompanying romanos was andronicus ducas son of his rival john ducas army consisted of about professional byzantine troops from western provinces and probably about same number from eastern provinces this included 500 frankish and norman mercenaries under roussel de bailleul some turkic uz and pecheneg and bulgarian mercenaries infantry under duke of antioch a contingent of georgian and armenian troops and some but not all of varangian guard to total around 40 000 men j haldon byzantine wars 180 quantity of provincial troops had declined in years prior to romanos as government diverted funding to mercenaries who were judged less likely to be involved in politics and could be disbanded after use to save money thumb left alp arslan led seljuq turks to victory against byzantine annexation of manzikert in 1071 march across asia minor was long and difficult and romanos did not endear himself to his troops by bringing a luxurious baggage train along with him local population also suffered some plundering by his frankish mercenaries whom he was obliged to dismiss expedition rested at sebasteia on river halys reaching theodosiopolis in june 1071 there some of his generals suggested continuing march into seljuk territory and catching alp arslan before he was ready others including nicephorus suggested they wait and fortify their position it was decided to continue march thinking that alp arslan was either further away or not coming at all romanos marched towards lake van expecting to retake manzikert rather quickly and nearby fortress of khliat if possible alp arslan was already in area however with allies and cavalry from aleppo and mosul alp arslan s scouts knew exactly where romanos was while romanos was completely unaware of his opponent s movements thumbnail having made peace with byzantines seljuks intended to attack egypt until alp arslan learned in aleppo of byzantine advance he returned north and met byzantines north of lake van romanos ordered his general joseph tarchaniotes to take some of regular troops and varangians and accompany pechenegs and franks to khliat while romanos and rest of army marched to manzikert this split forces into halves of about 20 000 men each it is unknown what happened to army sent off with tarchaniotes according to islamic sources alp arslan smashed this army yet roman sources make no mention of any such encounter and suggests that tarchaniotes fled at sight of seljuk sultan an unlikely event considering reputation of roman general either way romanos army was reduced to less than half his planned 40 000 men battle alp arslan summoned his army and delivered a speech by appearing in a white robe similar to an islamic funeral shroud in morning of battle this was an encouraging message that he was ready to die in battle romanos was unaware of loss of tarchaneiotes and continued to manzikert which he easily captured on 23 august seljuks responded with heavy incursions of bowmen j norwich byzantium apogee 238 next day some foraging parties under bryennios discovered seljuk army and were forced to retreat back to manzikert romanos sent armenian general basilakes and some cavalry as romanos did not believe this was alp arslan s full army cavalry was destroyed and basilakes taken prisoner romanos drew up his troops into formation and sent left wing out under bryennios who was almost surrounded by quickly approaching turks and was forced to retreat once more seljuk forces hid among nearby hills for night making it nearly impossible for romanos to counterattack thumb 300px byzantine territory purple byzantine attacks red and seljuk attacks green on 25 august some of romanos turkic mercenaries came into contact with their seljuk kin and deserted romanos then rejected a seljuk peace embassy he wanted to settle eastern question and persistent turkic incursions and settlements with a decisive military victory and he understood that raising another army would be both difficult and expensive emperor attempted to recall tarchaneiotes who was no longer in area there were no engagements that day but on 26 august byzantine army gathered itself into a proper battle formation and began to march on turkish positions with left wing under bryennios right wing under theodore and centre under emperor at that moment a turkish soldier said to alp arslan my sultan enemy army is approaching and alp arslan is said to have replied then we are also approaching them andronikos doukas led reserve forces in rear a foolish mistake considering loyalties of seljuks were organized into a crescent formation about four kilometres away seljuk archers attacked byzantines as they drew closer centre of their crescent continually moved backwards while wings moved to surround byzantine troops byzantines held off arrow attacks and captured alp arslan s camp by end of afternoon however right and left wings where arrows did most of their damage almost broke up when individual units tried to force seljuks into a pitched battle seljuk cavalry simply disengaged when challenged classic hit and run tactics of steppe warriors with seljuks avoiding battle romanos was forced to order a withdrawal by time night fell however right wing misunderstood order and doukas as a rival of romanos deliberately ignored emperor and marched back to camp outside manzikert rather than covering emperor s retreat with byzantines thoroughly confused seljuks seized opportunity and attacked byzantine right wing was almost immediately routed thinking they were betrayed either by armenians or army s turkish auxiliaries some authors suppose that armenians were first to flee and they all managed to get away while by contrast turkish auxiliaries remained loyal to end other sources suggest that armenian infantry were stoutly resisting and not turning tail and did not abandon emperor as many had when romanos saw boldness of armenian foot soldiers he displayed great affection for them and promised them unheard of rewards in end emperor s personal troops and these armenian foot soldiers suffered heaviest casualties in byzantine army nicolle david manzikert 1071 breaking of byzantium

were brought before you as a prisoner romanos perhaps i d kill you or exhibit you in streets of constantinople alp arslan my punishment is far heavier i forgive you and set you free alp arslan treated romanos with considerable kindness and again offered terms of peace that he had offered prior to battle according to ibn al adim in presence of arslan romanos blamed raids of rashid al dawla mahmud into byzantine territory for his interventions in muslim territories which eventually led to battle of manzikert romanos remained a captive of sultan for a week during this time sultan allowed romanos to eat at his table whilst concessions were agreed upon antioch edessa hierapolis and manzikert were to be surrendered this would have left vital core of anatolia untouched a payment of 10 million gold pieces demanded by sultan as a ransom for romanos was deemed as too high by latter so sultan reduced its short term expense by asking for 1 5 million gold pieces as an initial payment instead followed by an annual sum of gold pieces plus a marriage alliance was prepared between alp arslan s son and romanos daughter sultan then gave romanos many presents and an escort of two emirs and one hundred mamluks on his route to constantinople shortly after his return to his subjects romanos found his rule in serious trouble despite attempts to raise loyal troops he was defeated three times in battle against doukas family and was deposed blinded and exiled to island of proti he died soon after as a result of an infection caused by an injury during his brutal blinding romanos final foray into anatolian heartland which he had worked so hard to defend was a public humiliation aftermath 300px thumb turks did not move into anatolia until after alp arslan s death in 1072 while manzikert was a long term strategic catastrophe for byzantium it was by no means massacre that historians earlier presumed modern scholars estimate that byzantine losses were relatively low considering that many units survived battle intact and were fighting elsewhere within a few months and most byzantine prisoners of war were later released certainly all commanders on byzantine side doukas tarchaneiotes bryennios de bailleul and above all emperor survived and took part in later events andronikus returned to capital tarchaneiotes did not take part bryennios and all others including romanos took part in ensuing civil war battle did not directly change balance of power between byzantines and seljuks however ensuing civil war within byzantine empire did to advantage of seljuks doukas had escaped with no casualties and quickly marched back to constantinople where he led a coup against romanos and proclaimed michael vii as basileus bryennios also lost a few men in rout of his wing seljuks did not pursue fleeing byzantines nor did they recapture manzikert itself at this point byzantine army regrouped and marched to where they were joined by romanos when he was released a week later most serious loss materially seems to have been emperor s extravagant baggage train result of this disastrous defeat was in simplest terms loss of eastern roman empire s anatolian heartland john julius norwich says in his trilogy on byzantine empire that defeat was its death blow though centuries remained before remnant fell themes in anatolia were literally heart of empire and within decades after manzikert they were gone in his smaller book a short history of byzantium norwich describes battle as greatest disaster suffered by empire in its seven and a half centuries of existence sir steven runciman in his history of crusades noted that battle of manzikert was most decisive disaster in byzantine history byzantines themselves had no illusions about it again and again their historians refer to that dreadful day anna komnene writing a few decades after actual battle wrote years and decades later manzikert came to be seen as a disaster for empire later sources therefore greatly exaggerate numbers of troops and number of casualties byzantine historians would often look back and lament disaster of that day pinpointing it as moment decline of empire began it was not an immediate disaster but defeat showed seljuks that byzantines were not invincible usurpation of andronikos doukas also politically destabilized empire and it was difficult to organize resistance to turkish migrations that followed battle finally while intrigue and deposition of emperors had taken place before fate of romanos was particularly horrific and destabilization caused by it also rippled through empire for centuries thumbnail 320px settlements and regions affected during first wave of turkish invasions in asia minor until 1204 what followed battle was a chain of events of which battle was first link that undermined empire in years to come they included intrigues for throne fate of romanos and roussel de bailleul attempting to carve himself an independent kingdom in galatia with his frankish norman and german mercenaries he defeated emperor s uncle john doukas who had come to suppress him advancing toward capital to destroy chrysopolis on asian coast of bosphorus empire finally turned to spreading seljuks to crush de bailleul which they did however turks ransomed him back to his wife and it was not before young general alexios komnenos pursued him that he was captured these events all interacted to create a vacuum that turks filled their choice in establishing their capital in iznik in 1077 could possibly be explained by a desire to see if empire s struggles could present new opportunities in hindsight both byzantine and contemporary historians are unanimous in dating decline of byzantine fortunes to this battle as paul k davis writes byzantine defeat severely limited power of byzantines by denying them control over anatolia major recruiting ground for soldiers henceforth muslims controlled region byzantine empire was limited to area immediately around constantinople and byzantines were never again a serious military force paul k davis 100 decisive battles from ancient times to present world s major battles and how they shaped history oxford oxford university press 1999 p 118 it is also interpreted as one of root causes for later crusades in that first crusade of 1095 was originally a western response to byzantine emperor s call for military assistance after loss of anatolia from another perspective west saw manzikert as a signal that byzantium was no longer capable of being protector of eastern christianity or of christian pilgrims to holy places in middle east delbruck considers importance of battle to be exaggerated but evidence makes clear that it resulted in empire being unable to put an effective army into field for many years to come battle of myriokephalon also known as myriocephalum has been compared to battle of manzikert as a pivotal point in decline of byzantine empire for example in both battles separated by over a hundred years an expansive byzantine army was ambushed by a more elusive seljuk opponent implications of myriocephalum were initially limited however thanks to manuel i komnenos holding on to power same could not be said of romanos whose enemies martyred a courageous and upright man and as a result empire would never recover cultural references thumb right 180px camlica mosque istanbul largest
