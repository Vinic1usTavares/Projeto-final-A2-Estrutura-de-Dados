edessa harran and samosata under similar circumstances with exception of heavy fighting at ras al ayn and dara iyad received surrenders of a string of other mesopotamian towns with relatively little blood spilled overall iyad s conquest of upper mesopotamia left much of captured towns intact and their inhabitants unharmed to maintain their tax payments to nascent caliphate according to historian leif inge ree petersen iyad has received little attention but was clearly of great ability early life iyad was son of a certain abd ghanm ibn zuhayr al fihri he belonged to al harith ibn ibn malik branch of quraysh tribe ibn abd ed p 233 theophilus of edessa ed hoyland 2011 p 118 n 271 latter were a mercantile arab tribe based in mecca in western arabian peninsula iyad was among few members of

bewley 1997 p 247 upon accepting islam iyad had his name changed from ibn abd ghanm to ibn ghanm abd ghanm name of his father translates in arabic as servant of ghanm an idol worshiped by pagan arabs al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 226 latter was an association that iyad detested according to 9th century historian al baladhuri rest of quraysh converted to islam in 630 campaigns in syria iyad may have been muslim commander who defeated an arab tribal revolt in oasis town of dumat al jandal during ridda wars of 632 633 tribes involved in revolt were banu kalb banu salih and ghassan other medieval reports attribute this victory to amr ibn al as in any case according to 9th century historian al tabari iyad was governor of dumat al jandal in 634 during reign of caliph abu bakr in 637 iyad was made governor of al jazira upper mesopotamia by caliph umar r 634 644 but was dismissed by latter due to allegations that he had used his office to accept gifts or bribes afterward he became a close aide and lieutenant commander of his paternal cousin and maternal nephew abu ubayda ibn al jarrah who had military authority over syria in 638 iyad was dispatched by abu ubayda to subdue aleppo beroea in northern syria then part of byzantine empire abu ubayda himself arrived later but as soon as he set up camp around city townspeople signaled their desire to negotiate terms iyad who was sanctioned by abu ubayda to negotiate on his behalf agreed to proposed terms guaranteeing safety of aleppo s inhabitants and properties but with condition that a site be made available for construction of a mosque abu ubayda later sent iyad at head of an army to capture cyrrhus whose inhabitants sent out a monk to meet iyad following this meeting iyad had monk meet abu ubayda and arrange surrender of cyrrhus al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 230 iyad continued on northward and eastward overseeing capitulation of manbij hierapolis ra ban and al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 231 conquest of upper mesopotamia thumb right 300px a map of al jazira region upper mesopotamia in 8th century iyad played a leading role in muslim conquest of region when abu ubayda died in 639 caliph umar appointed iyad in his place as amal governor of hims qinnasrin chalcis and al jazira with directions to conquer latter territory from its byzantine commanders because they had refused to pay tributes promised to muslims in 638 al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 270 by time iyad was given his assignment all of syria had been conquered by muslims leaving byzantine garrisons in al jazira isolated from empire in august 639 iyad led a 5 000 strong army toward raqqa kallinikos in al jazira and raided city s environs he encountered resistance from its defenders prompting him to withdraw and send smaller units to make raids around raqqa seizing captives and harvests al baladhuri ed hitti p 271 after five or six days of these raids raqqa s patrician negotiated surrender of city to iyad according to historian michael meinecke iyad captured city in 639 or 640 after raqqa iyad proceeded toward harran where his progress was stalled he diverted part of his army to edessa which ultimately capitulated after negotiations al baladhuri ed hitti p 272 iyad then received harran s surrender and dispatched ibn mu attal al sulami and his own kinsman habib ibn maslama al fihri to seize samosata which also ended in a negotiated surrender after muslim raiding of its countryside al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 273 by 640 iyad had successively conquered saruj jisr manbij and tell mawzin al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 274 275 before capture of tell mawzin iyad attempted to take ras al ayn but retreated after stiff resistance later he dispatched umayr ibn sa d al ansari to take city al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 276 umayr first assaulted rural peasantry and seized cattle in town s vicinity inhabitants barricaded inside walled city and inflicted heavy losses on muslim forces before ultimately capitulating about same time iyad besieged samosata in response to a rebellion nature of which is not specified by al baladhuri and stationed a small garrison in edessa after city s inhabitants violated their terms of surrender after samosata al baladhuri who gives a detailed but triumphalist account of mesopotamian campaign maintains that iyad subdued a string of villages on same terms as edessa s surrender between end of 639 and december 640 iyad and his lieutenants subdued in succession circesium al qarqisiya amid mayyafariqin nisibin tur abdin mardin dara and al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 275 according to al baladhuri with exception of nisibin which put up resistance all these cities and fortresses fell to muslims after negotiated surrenders in contrast to al baladhuri s passive account of iyad s capture of dara 10th century historian agapius of hierapolis wrote that many were slain on both sides particularly among muslims but city ultimately fell after a negotiated surrender iyad continued toward arzanene then to bitlis and finally to khilat all three cities surrendered after negotiations with their patricians shortly after iyad entrusted leader of bitlis with collecting land tax from khilat and left for raqqa on way there one medieval muslim report holds that iyad dispatched a force to capture after which he settled it with arabs al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 p 277 iyad died in hims in 641 according to al tabari iyad was succeeded as governor of hims and qinnasrin by a certain sa id ibn al but latter died soon after and umayr ibn sa d one of iyad s lieutenants was appointed in his place by caliph umar assessment according to 9th century biographer ibn sa d not a foot was left of mesopotamia unsubdued by iyad ibn ghanm and iyad effected conquest of mesopotamia and its towns by capitulation but its land by force al baladhuri ed hitti 1916 pp 273 274 petersen describes iyad as a commander who has received little attention but who clearly was of great ability tactics used by iyad in his mesopotamian campaign were similar to those employed by muslims in palestine though in iyad s case contemporary accounts reveal his specific modus operandi particularly in raqqa operation to capture that city entailed positioning cavalry forces near its entrances preventing its defenders and residents from leaving or rural refugees from entering concurrently remainder of iyad s forces cleared surrounding countryside of supplies and took captives these dual tactics were employed in several other cities in al jazira they proved effective in gaining surrenders from targeted cities running low on supplies and whose satellite villages were trapped by hostile troops iyad s overall goal was to conquer al jazira with minimal damage to ensure flow of revenue to caliphate in agreements he reached with patricians of raqqa edessa harran and samosata payments came in various forms including cash wheat oil vinegar honey labor services to maintain roads and bridges and guides and intelligence for muslim newcomers ultimately iyad s settlements with mesopotamia s cities to a large extent left most of local society untouched in petersen s view iyad s campaign partially diverted byzantines attention away from muslims central offensive against syria s port cities and province of egypt while also demonstrating to armenian nobility that caliphate had become a viable alternative to persian
