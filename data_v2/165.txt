uss indiana bb 1 was lead ship of her class and first battleship in united states navy comparable to foreign battleships of time authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later she was a small battleship though with heavy armor and ordnance ship also pioneered use of an intermediate battery she was designed for coastal defense and as a result her decks were not safe from high waves on open ocean indiana served in spanish american war 1898 as part of north atlantic squadron she took part in both blockade of santiago de cuba and battle of santiago de cuba which occurred when spanish fleet attempted to break through blockade although unable to join chase of escaping spanish cruisers she was partly responsible for destruction of spanish destroyers pluton and furor after war she quickly became obsolete despite several modernizations and spent most of her time in commission as a training ship or in reserve fleet with her last commission during world war i as a training ship for gun crews she was decommissioned for third and final time in january 1919 and was shortly after reclassified coast battleship number 1 so that name indiana could be reused she was sunk in shallow water as a target in aerial bombing tests in 1920 and her hull was sold for scrap in 1924 design and construction indiana was constructed from a modified version of a design drawn up by a us navy policy board in 1889 for a short range battleship original design was part of an ambitious naval construction plan to build 33 battleships and 167 smaller ships united states congress saw plan as an attempt to end u s policy of isolationism and did not approve it but a year later united states house of representatives approved funding for three coast defense battleships which would become indiana and her sister ships and coast defense designation was reflected in indianas moderate endurance relatively small displacement and low freeboard which limited seagoing capability she was however heavily armed and armored conway s all world s fighting ships describes her design as attempting too much on a very limited displacement construction of ships was authorized on 30 june 1890 and contract for indiana not including guns and armor was awarded to william cramp sons in philadelphia who offered to build it for 3 020 000 total cost of ship was almost twice as high approximately 6 000 000 contract specified ship had to be built in three years but slow delivery of armor plates caused a two year delay indiana s keel was laid down on 7 may 1891 and she was launched on 28 february 1893 attended by around 10 000 people including president benjamin harrison several members of his cabinet and two senators from indiana during her fitting out in early march 1894 ship undertook a preliminary sea trial to test her speed and machinery at this point her side armor guns turrets and conning tower had not yet been fitted and her official trials would not take place until october 1895 due to delays in armor deliveries service history early career indiana was commissioned on 20 november 1895 under command of captain robley d evans after further trials ship joined north atlantic squadron under command of rear admiral francis m bunce which conducted training exercises along east coast of united states in late 1896 both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas because turrets were not centrally balanced they swung from side to side with motion of ship until they were secured with heavy ropes heavier clamps were installed but in february 1896 while conducting fleet maneuvers with north atlantic squadron indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily her new captain henry clay taylor promptly ordered her back to port for fear clamps would break again this convinced navy that bilge keels omitted during construction because with them ship could not fit in most american dry docks were necessary to reduce rolling and they were installed on all three ships of indiana class spanish american war at outbreak of spanish american war in april 1898 indiana was at key west with rest of north atlantic squadron at time commanded by rear admiral william t sampson his squadron was ordered to spanish port of san juan in an attempt to intercept and destroy admiral cervera s spanish squadron which was en route to caribbean from spain harbor was empty but indiana and rest of squadron bombarded it for two hours on 12 may 1898 before realizing their mistake squadron returned to key west where news arrived three weeks later that commodore schley s flying squadron had found cervera and was now blockading him in port of santiago de cuba sampson reinforced schley on 1 june and assumed overall command thumb left alt indiana painted white against a black sea is

was assembled in key west and indiana was sent back to lead it expeditionary force under command of major general william rufus shafter landed east of city and attacked it on 1 july cervera saw that his situation was desperate and attempted to break through blockade on 3 july 1898 resulting in battle of santiago de cuba cruisers and and battleship had left day before to load coal in guantanamo bay admiral sampson s flagship cruiser had also sailed east earlier that morning for a meeting with general shafter leaving commodore schley in command this left blockade weakened and unbalanced on day of battle as three modern battleships indiana and and armed yacht guarded east while west was only defended by second class battleship cruiser and armed yacht occupying extreme eastern position of blockade indiana fired at cruisers infanta maria teresa and almirante oquendo as they left harbor but due to engine problems was unable to keep up with spanish cruisers as they fled to west when spanish destroyers pluton and furor emerged indiana was near harbor entrance and together with iowa she supported armed yacht gloucester in destruction of lightly armored enemy ships she was then ordered to keep up blockade of harbor in case more spanish ships came out and so played no role in chase and sinking of two remaining spanish cruisers vizcaya and cristobal colon post spanish american war after war indiana returned to training exercises with north atlantic squadron in may 1900 she and massachusetts were placed in reserve as navy had an acute officer shortage and needed to put new and into commission battleships were reactivated following month as an experiment in how quickly this could be achieved but indiana was placed in reserve fleet again that winter in march 1901 it was decided to use her that summer for a midshipman practice cruise and this would be her regular summer job for next few years while rest of time she would serve as a training ship she was decommissioned on 29 december 1903 to be overhauled and modernized obsolete battleship received several upgrades new babcock wilcox boilers counterweights to balance her main turrets and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets she was recommissioned on 9 january 1906 and manned by former crew of her sister ship massachusetts including captain edward d taussig commanding massachusetts had been decommissioned day before to receive similar modernization thumb alt a stripped version of indiana without gun barrels superstructure is seriously damaged and her stacks lean sideways front one

indiana spent most of her time laid up in reserve fleet occasionally participating in practice cruises in january 1907 she helped provide relief in aftermath of 1907 kingston earthquake in 1908 40 caliber guns and most of lighter guns were removed to compensate for counterweights added to main battery turrets and because ammunition supply for guns was considered problematic a year later twelve 50 caliber single purpose guns were added midships and in fighting tops at same time a cage mast was added in early 1910 she was fitted with an experimental lacoste speed brake which would be deployed from side of hull to act as an emergency brake trials were inconclusive by 1913 it was speculated that ship might soon be used for target practice but instead ship was decommissioned on 23 may 1914 after united states entered world war i indiana was commissioned for third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near tompkinsville staten island and in york river and placed under command of george landenberger thumb aerial view of damaged indiana following aerial bombing tests on 31 january 1919 she was decommissioned for final time and two months later she was renamed coast battleship number 1 so that name indiana could be assigned to newly authorized but never completed battleship old battleship was brought to shallow waters in chesapeake bay near wreck of battleship ex texas here she was subjected to aerial bombing tests conducted by navy she was hit with dummy bombs from aircraft and explosive charges were set off at positions where bombs hit tests were a response to claims from billy mitchell at time assistant to chief of air service charles t menoher who stated to congress that air service could sink any battleship conclusions drawn by navy from experiments conducted on indiana were very different as captain william d leahy stated in his report entire experiment pointed to improbability of a modern battleship being either destroyed or completely put out of action by aerial bombs subject remained a matter of dispute between mitchell and navy and several more bombing tests were conducted with other decommissioned battleships culminating in sinking of indiana sank during test and settled in shallow water where she remained until her wreck was sold for scrap on 19 march 1924 see also battleship illinois replica notes references citations
