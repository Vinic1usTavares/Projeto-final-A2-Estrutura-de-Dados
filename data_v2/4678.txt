battle of yanshi yan shi zhi zhan was fought on 5 6 october 618 between armies of wang shichong and li mi rival contenders for succession of sui dynasty wang who was still ostensibly a sui loyalist and had been blockaded in luoyang for months by li mi gambled on a decisive battle and led his troops out to attack besieging army li assembled his forces on a naturally defensible position north of yanshi town but wang managed to surprise li s forces and approach their camp before they could react aided by a secondary cavalry attack from rear wang secured a decisive victory over li s forces although li managed to escape with part of his army his authority was shattered and his followers joined wang while li mi sought refuge in rival tang court wang consolidated his control over henan and eventually deposed sui puppet ruler yang tong and declared himself as emperor of new zheng dynasty wang s power lasted until his surrender to tang prince li shimin in 621 background during later reign of second emperor of sui dynasty yang dynasty s authority began to wane immense material and human cost of protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer korean kingdom of goguryeo coupled with natural disasters caused unrest in provinces while successive military failures eroded emperor s prestige and legitimacy mandate of heaven among provincial governors yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on korean campaigns and by time he realized gravity of situation it was too late as revolts spread in 616 he abandoned north and withdrew to jiangdu where he remained until his assassination in 618 local governors and magnates rose to claim power in wake of yang s withdrawal by summer of 618 nine major contenders emerged some claiming imperial title others contenting themselves for time being with more modest titles of duke gong and king wang three most powerful were li yuan who seized sui capital of daxingcheng chang an and on 16 june 618 proclaimed himself first emperor of tang dynasty dou jiande a one time bandit leader who had risen in revolt against sui already in 611 and came to control most of hebei as king of changle and then as king of xia and li mi in henan who led a mixture of rebelled peasants and sui soldiers li mi s main antagonist was sui general wang shichong who controlled eastern capital luoyang and remnants of sui administration there emperor yang had sent him to city in mid 617 in may 618 following yang s murder by general yuwen huaji sui officials in luoyang elevated yang s grandson yang tong to throne in meantime li mi had managed to gain control over most of surrounding area when yuwen huaji moved north against li mi wang seized opportunity to play both rebels against each other li mi was offered an amnesty and a high court position if he would march against emperor yang s assassin li mi whose own base great granary at was threatened agreed hoping in turn to profit from his legitimization and gain control of luoyang in event li mi heavily defeated yuwen in a series of battles and forced him to withdraw to northern hubei feeling threatened by li mi s growing power and facing plots against him in luoyang wang launched a coup d etat on 11 august 618 and seized power for himself removing his opponents and barring city to li mi two men now moved to a confrontation that as historian david graff comments could prove decisive for outcome of civil war wang was fighting for survival while li had to capture luoyang to cement his hold over henan more importantly however victor would be left in possession of most populous region of sui empire and could expect to receive allegiance of many of smaller armed factions battle of yanshi facing starvation and surrender wang shichong decided to risk an open confrontation with li mi in an attempt to push him back and break siege wang selected 20 000 elite troops of which only 1 000 were cavalry from luoyang s garrison apparently troops who had already participated in several expeditions against rebels and bandits under his command and were especially trustworthy in order to his men wang who according to graff had a keen interest in divination and was fond of invoking unseen powers now invoked semi mythical figure of founder of luoyang duke of zhou he had a shrine erected in duke of zhou s honour and shamans declared that duke promised that if they marched to confront li mi they would win whereas if they remained in luoyang they were doomed to die of pestilence apparently this had desired effect for on 4 october 618 wang led his army out of luoyang and following course of luo river marched eastward bypassing li mi s forward positions on afternoon of next day wang s army had reached walled town of yanshi some 20 miles from luoyang and located between luo river to south and an irrigation canal to north there deep inside enemy territory wang made camp li mi had been at jinyong fortress some 6 miles east of luoyang when he learned of wang s sortie he too selected best men among his own troops numbering around 40 000 left one of his generals in charge of jinyong and followed wang eastward li mi encamped on mang hills north of yanshi once there li mi convened a council of war to determine his army s course of action li mi advocated a passive and cautious stance arguing that wang s troops were not only experienced veterans but that as they were virtually cut off from retreat due to luo river canals and presence of his own army they would fight with desperate courage a situation already described and recommended as a strategy to galvanize one s troops by no lesser authority than sun tzu and doubtlessly familiar to both opposing commanders in addition while lack of supplies constrained wang to seek an early and decisive engagement li mi s own forces had time on their side and could afford to sit out and wait until wang s provisions were utterly exhausted most of li s generals however vehemently disagreed regarding wang s army as an exhausted and demoralized force and pointing to their own considerable numerical superiority at this juncture heterogeneous nature of li s army cobbled together from bandit chieftains and sui defectors came into play li was well aware that his commanders were potentially autonomous warlords who commanded personal loyalty of their own subordinates and that he could not afford to antagonize them therefore against his better judgement he was forced to agree to an immediate confrontation nevertheless li mi decided to await wang s attack instead of attacking himself main host under li mi remained on mang hills while a detachment under shan moved down to plain just north of yanshi and established a camp there two camps in description of david graff formed an inverted letter l running east along mountain and then turning sharply south across plain to yanshi li mi felt confident in his superior position which gave him ample time to descend hills and move against wang should he try to cross canal for an attack if wang attacked either of his camps troops of other would come to aid flanking wang s forces confident in naturally defensive layout of his hilltop camp however he neglected fortifying it first clash between two armies occurred on same evening of 5 october when wang sent several hundred of his cavalry to attack shan s camp on plain li sent forces from hills to his general s aid but battle ended quickly with arrival of night this attack was nothing more than a diversion drawing li s attention to east while under cover of night wang sent 200 of his cavalry around and behind li s forces concealing themselves in a ravine behind li s camp they waited during night wang laid bridges across canal and before dawn his army crossed over and deployed in battle formation close to li mi s camps at daybreak li mi s troops were caught entirely by surprise at sight of battle ready enemy advancing onto them as camps were unfortified rebel troops tried to hastily form a battle line themselves but they were unable to prevent wang s forces from entering their encampments at same time wang signalled his hidden cavalry to attack charging down from north into li mi s camp 200 horsemen began setting fire to it at sight of camp to their rear going up in flames li mi s army broke and fled while li mi was able to escape with some 10 000 of his men many of rest surrendered to wang according to one account wang s victory was secured by a stratagem one of his soldiers who greatly resembled li mi was bound and displayed to rebel troops at height of battle whereupon latter collapsed aftermath while li mi survived his authority suffered a devastating blow from which it could not recover his followers started flocking to wang shichong who quickly became master of all territories east to sea and south as far as river yangzi with remnants of his army li mi was forced to seek refuge with tang court in chang an wang shichong on other hand now stood at apex of his power he appointed new senior officials and finally in may 619 he deposed puppet sui emperor yang tong and declared himself as first emperor of zheng dynasty soon however wang s rule became cruel and repressive costing him support he was also unable to effectively confront advancing tang armies under li shimin who in early 621 laid siege to luoyang wang allied himself with dou jiande who came to his aid but li shimin scored a decisive victory at battle of hulao on 28 may 621 taking dou jiande captive without hope of succour wang finally surrendered four days after battle and was killed on way to his exile references
