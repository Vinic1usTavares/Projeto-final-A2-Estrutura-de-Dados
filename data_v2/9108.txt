first hill streetcar officially first hill line is a streetcar route in seattle washington united states forming part of modern seattle streetcar system it travels between several neighborhoods in central seattle including international district first hill and capitol hill line has ten stops and runs primarily in mixed traffic on south jackson street and broadway streetcar line was proposed in 2005 as an alternative to a cancelled link light rail station on first hill with goal of connecting neighborhood to other light rail stations 135 million project funded primarily by sound transit was approved by voters and city council in 2008 city government selected broadway corridor and began construction on line in april 2012 also working on a parallel protected bicycle lane construction was completed in late 2014 but delays in delivery and testing of streetcar vehicles pushed opening of line to january 23 2016 a proposed connection to south lake union streetcar line was planned to be constructed in late 2010s but was suspended by city government in 2018 history background and approval thumb left first hill streetcars under construction at inekon trams factory in czech republic first hill and broadway corridor were historically served by several lines under private and municipal streetcar system beginning with first line constructed in 1891 and ending in 1941 with introduction of city trolleybuses first hill a major regional destination due to its concentration of medical facilities and seattle university was slated to receive an underground link light rail station under system s first planned expansion from downtown seattle to university district passed by voters in 1996 a technical study revealed tunneling through weak soil under first hill involved high risks and would cost 350 million beyond project s proposed budget so sound transit board voted in july 2005 to remove first hill station from their preferred light rail route in lieu of light rail service sound transit commissioned studies on alternative means of improving transit service to neighborhood leading king county executive ron sims to suggest a streetcar connecting with capitol hill light rail station sound transit city government and neighborhood stakeholders convened first hill work program to investigate alternative modes and projects among them bus improvements to broadway and madison street corridors and a streetcar from international district chinatown station to capitol hill work program was completed in april 2007 and concluded a streetcar on broadway and south jackson street would be a feasible way to connect first hill with light rail system while acting as a potential catalyst for new transit oriented development a preliminary analysis in 2005 found streetcar would cost up to 122 million to construct and attract 3 000 weekday riders if built first hill streetcar project was included in sound transit 2 plan which was approved by sound transit board and placed on roads and transit ballot measure for november 2007 election ballot measure was rejected by voters but sound transit 2 was passed by voters as a standalone ballot measure in november 2008 and included 120 million in funding for streetcar seattle city council approved first hill line in december as part of a citywide streetcar network that would expand on existing south lake union streetcar an agreement between city and sound transit was signed in october 2009 to allow city to design and construct streetcar while using funds from transit expansion plan which would also cover 5 2 million annual operating budget while initially projected to open in 2016 project timeline was accelerated by three years under agreement routing decision and construction thumb right proposed routes for first hill streetcar 2009 thumb track construction underway on jackson street in june 2013 seattle department of transportation sdot presented three basic route alignments for public consideration in december 2009 beginning with a common corridor on jackson street with a one way loop between pioneer square and international district chinatown station streetcar would use either 12th or 14th avenues to reach yesler terrace then continue north on broadway boren avenue or 12th avenue near capitol hill station streetcar would split into a one way couplet between broadway and 11th avenue with a terminal at denny way despite community support for 12th avenue option and first hill organizations backing boren option sdot recommended broadway route with no couplet or one way loop other activists also petitioned city for an extension to business district on north broadway terminating near aloha street which would require a separate funding source mayor mike mcginn endorsed broadway route and city council unanimously approved alignment in may 2010 with 10 stops and 10 minute weekday headways pre construction activities for project began in january 2011 and a formal groundbreaking was held on april 23 2012 project also included construction of a two way protected bicycle lane on east side of broadway that was added as a result of cycling accidents on south lake union line track laying began over summer on yesler way and on broadway between pine and howell streets causing street closures and other traffic disruptions during work on broadway section stacy and witbeck contractors excavated railroad ties used by original streetcar system until 1940s trackwork on south jackson street began in early 2013 after completion of sewer and utility work in international district due to existing trolleybus and electrical wires above broadway and south jackson street sdot elected to forgo wiring for its downhill inbound track and instead rely on an onboard battery testing opening and later issues street construction and electrical installation were completed in late 2014 but commencement of service was delayed to following year due to procurement issues with czech streetcar manufacturer inekon trams and a seattle based partner that would assemble half fleet inekon s delay was blamed on an existing backlog of orders battery systems and a redesign required by a change in fire regulations project overran its 134 million budget by 1 6 million which was paid by inekon as part of their contract penalties testing of first streetcar began in march 2015 and acceptance tests were completed on all five vehicles by october final phase of testing including of operation and a five train simulation was completed in early january 2016

formal grand opening during a lunar new year festival in international district on february 13 2016 in its first year of operation streetcar averaged 3 050 weekday riders and met year end projections but by june 2017 line was under performing in ridership and fare revenue projections first hill line was criticized for its slow meandering route without transit only lanes or other priority measures to give it a time advantage over buses or pedestrians while sdot included bicycle friendly features and pathways parallel to streetcar tracks remained cause of serious crashes including a fatal incident on yesler way in may 2016 a lawsuit alleging fault for cyclist s death was filed against city government and sound transit by her family and settled in 2018 another crash which resulted in severe injuries to a cyclist at south jackson street and 12th avenue south was settled in 2019 with 1 55 million paid for by city sdot planned to install a rubber flange filler between track and concrete but found that it would cause additional hazards and not last an adequate amount of time streetcar service on first hill line was halted indefinitely on march 2 2017 due to an incident where a streetcar lost electrical power and slid uncontrolled downhill for over two blocks after a brake failure vehicle was stopped at a curve in tracks by an emergency parking brake that engaged

government in 2008 explored extensions of first hill line to central district and on rainier avenue connecting broadway to mount baker light rail station at martin luther king jr way initial plans for first hill line included service north of denny way to aloha street but this section was eliminated under sound transit 2 funding plan streetcar extension was supported by community groups and merchants in broadway business district who lobbied city to study and design 20 million project in 2010 a car tab fee rejected by city voters in 2011 would have funded 18 million for various streetcar projects including aloha extension as design work progressed cost of project rose to 25 million which would be covered by a puget sound regional council grant and a local improvement district levied on local property owners city government completed 90 percent design of project in 2015 choosing a terminus at roy street and an intermediate stop at harrison street but business leaders grew skeptical of streetcar s cost and design which would limit truck access work on project was halted in december 2016 and put on indefinite hold in october 2017 alongside street improvements including protected bicycle lane extension an extension of first hill streetcar to connect with existing south lake union line was planned in 2008 city network as part of seattle center downtown seattle king street station line planning on project named center city connector began in 2012 and was approved two years later by city council to run for primarily on 1st avenue it would cost 110 million to construct and would carry streetcars at a frequency of five minutes due to an overlap of two lines during preliminary construction in late 2017 questions arose about increased costs and potential disruption to downtown businesses mayor jenny durkan cancelled work on project in march 2018 and ordered an independent review which found that construction costs had risen to 200 million due to
