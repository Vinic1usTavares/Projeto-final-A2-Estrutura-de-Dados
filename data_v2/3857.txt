ilyushin il 32 was a soviet heavy military glider developed after world war ii to deliver of cargo to facilitate loading and unloading glider s nose and tail sections were hinged to swing sideways il 32 required a four engined aircraft to tow it safely it was canceled when it became clear that no such tug was going to be available after tupolev tu 75 and ilyushin il 18 programs were both canceled because of shortages of their intended shvetsov ash 73 engines development after end of world war ii soviets devoted a considerable amount of effort to developing heavy transport gliders to deliver troops during an airborne assault as part of this effort council of ministers ordered ilyushin design bureau on 20 september 1947 to begin work on a glider capable of carrying of cargo including 60 troops or a cannon with its prime mover ammunition and crew its intended tug was tupolev tu 75 a four engined transport derived from tupolev tu 4 gordon pp 191 92 il 32 was an aluminum bodied zaloga p 123 high wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage whose fuselage was square in cross section to fit as much cargo as possible two spar wings had a moderate aspect ratio it was regarded as expendable and was built very simply to facilitate large scale manufacture nose and tail sections swung up to 95deg to starboard to facilitate loading gordon p 192 il 32 made its first flight on 20 august 1948 towed by a twin engined ilyushin il 12 but il 12 was not powerful enough to tow a fully loaded glider and four engined il 18 airliner prototype was adapted to tow it from 20 september during these flight tests it reached a cruising speed of at an altitude of and a weight of flight tests were satisfactory and preparations were made to begin series production but lack of suitable tugs was a problem none of soviet four engined aircraft that could be used were either in production or available both tupolev tu 70 and il 18 airliners had been canceled as had tu 75 transport and tu 4 was dedicated to strategic bombing mission experiments were made with a pair of il 12s towing il 32 but this was both difficult and risky for all involved il 32 was therefore canceled for lack of a proper tug specifications thumb right see also notes bibliography category 1940s military gliders il 032 category abandoned military aircraft projects of soviet union category 1940s soviet military transport aircraft category aircraft first flown in 1948
