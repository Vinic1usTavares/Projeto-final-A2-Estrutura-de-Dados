superb fairywren malurus cyaneus is a passerine bird in australasian wren family maluridae and is common and familiar across south eastern australia species is sedentary and territorial also exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead ear coverts mantle and tail with a black mask and black or dark blue throat non breeding males females and juveniles are predominantly grey brown in colour this gave early impression that males were polygamous as all dull coloured birds were taken for females six subspecies groups are recognized three larger and darker forms from tasmania flinders and king island respectively and three smaller and paler forms from mainland australia and kangaroo island like other fairywrens superb fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising young from such pairings male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display superb fairywren can be found in almost any area that has at least a little dense undergrowth for shelter including grasslands with scattered shrubs moderately thick forest woodland heaths and domestic gardens it has adapted well to urban environment and is common in suburban sydney canberra and melbourne superb fairywren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds taxonomy and systematics superb fairywren is one of eleven species of genus malurus commonly known as fairywrens found in australia and lowland new guinea within genus superb fairywren s closest relative is splendid fairywren these two blue wrens are also related to purple crowned fairywren of northwestern australia william anderson surgeon and naturalist on captain james cook s third voyage collected first superb fairywren specimen in 1777 while traveling off coast of eastern tasmania in bruny island s adventure bay he classified it in genus motacilla because its tail reminded him of european wagtails anderson did not live to publish his findings although his assistant william ellis described bird in 1782 genus malurus was later described by louis jean pierre vieillot in 1816 giving bird its current scientific name shortly after first fleet s arrival at port jackson sydney bird gained common name superb warbler in 1920s came common names wren and wren warbler both from its similarity to european wren and fairywren bird has also been called mormon wren a reference to observations of one blue plumaged bird accompanied by many brown plumaged birds which were incorrectly assumed to be all female ngarrindjeri people of murray river and coorong regions called it waatji meaning little one of waatji lignum bush and gunai called it meaning little bird with long tail both it and variegated fairywren were known as to local eora and darug inhabitants of sydney basin other alternative names for superb fairywren include australian fairywren blue wren superb blue fairywren and superb blue wren like other fairywrens superb fairywren is unrelated to true wren it was previously classified as a member of old world flycatcher family muscicapidae and later as a member of warbler family sylviidae before being placed in newly recognised maluridae in 1975 more recently dna analysis has shown family maluridae to be related to meliphagidae honeyeaters and pardalotidae pardalotes scrubwrens thornbills gerygones and allies in large superfamily meliphagoidea subspecies six subspecies are currently recognized m c cyaneus ellis 1782 nominate subspecies it is found throughout tasmania birds are larger and darker than mainland subspecies with males having a deeper azure blue coloration some authorities have also reclassified subspecies elizabethae and samueli under m c cyaneus m c samueli mathews 1912 endemic to flinders island and has males that are of intermediate colour between king island and tasmanian subspecies m c elizabethae campbell aj 1901 originally described as a separate species is endemic to king island males have a deeper blue colour than tasmanian birds king island birds also have longer tarsi lower legs m c cyanochlamys sharpe 1881 originally described as a separate species found on mainland australia in general birds are smaller and paler than those of tasmania with queensland male birds bearing a pale silvery blue crown ear tufts and mantle m c mathews 1912 found in eastern south australia males in breeding plumage differ from those of subspecies cyanochlamys by having blue tinges on their belly below chest band and on their wing remiges m c ashbyi mathews 1912 found on kangaroo island and has been separated from mainland subspecies for around 9000 years birds of this subspecies are larger have narrower bills and darker plumage than birds on nearby mainland south australia females from kangaroo island are more uniformly grey in plumage than mainland birds evolutionary history in his 1982 monograph schodde proposed a southern origin for common ancestor of superb and splendid fairywrens at some time in past it was split into south western splendid and south eastern superb enclaves as southwest was drier than southeast once conditions were more favourable splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas in east superb fairywren spread into tasmania during a glacial period when sea level was low and island was connected with rest of continent via a land bridge this gave rise to subspecies cyaneus as it became isolated when sea levels rose bass strait forms were isolated from tasmania more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained a 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear dna found ancestors of superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to white shouldered white winged and red backed fairywrens description thumb a pair in victoria australia right thumb an immature male in gippsland victoria australia young males usually develop a blue tail before their first winter superb fairywren is long and weighs with males on average slightly larger than females average tail length is among shortest in genus averaging in subspecies cyaneus and in subspecies cyanochlamys bill is relatively long narrow and pointed and wider at base wider than it is deep bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs like other fairywrens superb fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting with black and grey brown brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays breeding male has a bright blue forehead ear coverts mantle and tail brown wings and black throat eye band breast and bill females immatures and non breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn females and immatures or dull greyish blue males tail bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter immature males moult into breeding plumage first breeding season after hatching though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect both sexes moult in autumn after breeding with males assuming an eclipse non breeding plumage they moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring breeding males blue plumage particularly ear coverts is highly iridescent because of flattened and twisted surface of barbules blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens whose colour vision extends into this part of spectrum vocalisations vocal communication among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and mobbing or defending a territory basic or type i song is a 1 4 second high pitched reel consisting of 10 20 short elements per second it is sung by both males and females males also possess a peculiar song like type ii vocalization which is given in response to calls of predatory birds commonly grey butcherbirds purpose of this behaviour which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens remains unknown it is not a warning call but in fact gives away location of vocalizing male to predator it may serve to announce male fitness but this is far from certain superb fairywrens alarm call is a series of brief sharp chits universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators females also emit a purr while incubating bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites distribution and habitat thumb right at cemetery se queensland superb fairywren is common throughout most of relatively wet and fertile south eastern corner of continent from south east of south australia including kangaroo island and adelaide and tip of eyre peninsula through all of victoria tasmania coastal and sub coastal new south wales and queensland through brisbane area and extending inland north to dawson river and west to blackall it is a common bird in suburbs of sydney melbourne and canberra it is found in wooded areas generally with plenty of undergrowth and has also adapted to urban existence and can be found in gardens and urban parks as long as there is an undergrowth of native plants nearby lantana lantana camara a prolific weed in australia has also been beneficial in providing shelter in disturbed areas as has introduced and invasive blackberry unlike other fairywrens it appears to benefit from urban environment and has out competed introduced house sparrow in one study on grounds of australian national university in canberra colonies of wrens can be found in hyde park and royal botanic gardens in sydney s urbanized centre it is not found in dense forest nor in alpine environments forestry plantations of pine and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth behaviour left thumb first year male starting to moult into breeding cyaneus alt closeup of a small long tailed vivid pale blue and black bird like all fairywrens superb fairywren is an active and restless feeder particularly on open ground near shelter but also through lower foliage movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail which is usually held upright and rarely still short rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights though not for extended jaunts during spring and summer birds are active in bursts through day and accompany their foraging with song insects are numerous and easy to catch which allows birds to rest between forays group often shelters and rests together during heat of day food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend day foraging continuously superb fairywren is a cooperative breeding species with pairs or groups of 3 5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year round group consists of a social pair with one or more male or female helper birds that were hatched in territory though they may not necessarily be offspring of main pair these birds assist in defending territory and feeding and rearing young birds in a group roost side by side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening major nest predators include australian magpies butcherbirds laughing kookaburra currawongs crows and ravens shrike thrushes as well as introduced mammals such as red fox cat and black rat superb fairywrens may utilise a rodent run display to distract predators from nests with young birds head neck and tail are lowered wings held out and feathers fluffed as bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call a field study in canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners recognised miner alarm calls and took flight and had learnt to ignore their non alarm calls while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners did not respond to miner alarm calls this suggests species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species vocalisations courtship thumb right male subspecies cyanochlamys with face fan display alt a small long tailed vivid pale blue and black bird standing on ground facing camera with its cheek feathers puffed out several courtship displays by superb fairywren males have been recorded sea horse flight named for its seahorse like undulations is one such display during this exaggerated flight male with his neck extended and his head feathers erect tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and descends slowly and springs upwards by rapidly beating his wings after alighting on ground face fan display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours it involves flaring of blue ear tufts by erecting feathers during reproductive season males of this and other fairywren species pluck yellow petals which contrast with their plumage and show them to female fairywrens petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in male fairywren s own or another territory males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside breeding season presumably to promote themselves fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous pairs will bond for life though both males and females will regularly mate with other individuals a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside group young are often raised not by pair alone but with other males who also mated with pair s female assisting breeding thumb right female with juvenile begging for food northern beaches sydney alt on left a small brown bird with orange eye ring and a long tail holding a moth while at its right another similar bird has an open mouth begging for food breeding occurs from spring through to late summer nest is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs with an entrance in one side generally close to ground under and in thick vegetation two or more broods may be laid in an extended breeding season a clutch of three or four matte white eggs with reddish brown splotches and spots measuring eggs are incubated for 14 days after which they hatch within 24 hours newborn chicks are blind red and featherless though quickly darken as feathers grow their eyes open by day five or six and are fully feathered by day 10 all group members feed and remove fecal sacs for 10 14 days fledglings are able to feed themselves by day 40 but remain in family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group or assuming a dominant position in original group in this role they feed and care for subsequent broods and repel cuckoos or predators superb fairywrens also commonly play host to brood parasite horsfield s bronze cuckoo and less commonly shining bronze cuckoo and fan tailed cuckoo diet left thumb female subspecies cyanochlamys with a grasshopper alt a small brown bird with orange eye ring and a long tail holding a grasshopper in its bill while sitting on a piece of wire superb fairywrens are predominantly insectivorous they eat a wide range of small creatures mostly insects such as ants grasshoppers shield bugs flies weevils and various larvae as well as small quantities of seeds flowers and fruit their foraging termed hop searching occurs on ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres high because this foraging practice renders them vulnerable to predators birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups during winter when food may be scarce ants are an important last resort food constituting a much higher proportion of diet nestlings in contrast to adult birds are fed a diet of larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers cultural depictions superb fairywren breeding male is used as an emblem by bird observation conservation australia on 12 august 1999 a superb fairywren was
