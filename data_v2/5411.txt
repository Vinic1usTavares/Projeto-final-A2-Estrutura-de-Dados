enix and armor project a company founded by series creator yuji horii this was first modern dragon quest title to be developed by armor project and square enix as earlier mainline entries had been handled by external companies cgi opening was handled by square enix s cgi department visual works game was directed by jin fujisawa who also directed dragon quest ix scenario was written by fujisawa with later scenario support by atsushi narita horii served as game designer and general project director series art designer akira toriyama returned to design characters while music was composed by series veteran koichi sugiyama one of chief planners was naoki yoshida who had worked on earlier dragon quest spin offs and was later assigned as director of final fantasy xiv and its reboot a realm reborn a newcomer to series was producer yosuke saito formerly a staff member at cavia who worked as a programmer on drakengard series before producing its spin off game nier after cavia closed in 2010 saito formed his own company orca which was chosen by square enix to support development of dragon quest x due to this work had to be scrapped on a playstation vita version of nier saito had earlier worked with mmorpgs when he was involved with development of cross gate 2001 a second newcomer was chikara saito who after working on dragon quest x during its development alongside cross treasures would take over as game s director in 2013 when speaking about why an online game was chosen as next step in series fujisawa cited intuitive character ai in dragon quest iv and party member communication in dragon quest vii solid ideas for an online game set within dragon quest series were first suggested in 2005 when development was wrapping up on dragon quest viii it was initially worked on by a very small team who worked together on groundwork for some time a core part of initial plan was that game would have a pre planned ten year lifespan with continual content updates once work had finished on dragon quest ix dragon quest x took full priority during these earlier phases it was still undecided whether to make game a mainline title and there was even doubt as to whether it could be an mmorpg rather than just an online multiplayer game these doubts held by saito were assuaged by fujisawa s confidence in project despite this fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing mmorpgs putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as saito yoshida and second chief planner takashi anzai change to a new genre presented multiple challenges to team while standard rpgs were designed around a scripted experience mmorpgs were more reliant on a true sense of unscripted adventure a major disadvantage was that fujisawa was inexperienced with working on mmorpgs first major developmental issue was need in an mmorpg to have a full customizable character another related problem was initial premise of an unseen force as threat which was unusual within form fujisawa rationalized it into a kind of common sense related to interaction between player community and necessary events within game world that worked against accepted principles of mmorpg gameplay which resulted in multiple staff members raising doubts as to whether game could work second major issue was what types of environments to include or discard and for this fujisawa was prepared due to his long experience with franchise on top of this staff needed to evaluate what would work for an mmorpg in unpredictable japanese gaming market which unlike other parts of world was not a major consumer of mmorpgs their main object for comparison was world of warcraft which by that time had 12 million players worldwide but only had a small holding in japan while this appeared discouraging there had not been many titles of similar scale and success within country so there was both space for and detractions against an equivalent mmorpg experience during this evaluation process three key constraints were pinned down for developers to face first was hardware related as wii had a limited lifespan as a viable console second was requirement of a subscription a necessity to make game profitable and third was a natural reticence against playing an online only title wii had been chosen as game s platform due to its large install base and popularity in japan but it would inevitably be left behind for newer consoles so it was decided to create future versions of dragon quest x for other viable platforms to combat monetary concerns team looked at typical flat rate subscription which at time was between y 1200 us 12 and y 2000 us 20 then set it at y 1000 us 10 so it would be attractive to more casual gamers while still being profitable despite low fee fujisawa felt that this might turn away long term fans who were not hardcore gamers solution was kid s time which despite name was intended as a means for people of all ages to have free access to game regardless of its online approach opening of game was designed as an offline introductory experience this caused technical issues for developers online game processing was divided between online servers and hardware while opening relied entirely on hardware resulting in slowdown issues that needed addressing kid s time offered a solution to third constraint game made use of square enix s crystal tools game engine making it only square enix game outside final fantasy series to make use of it cloud saves were used in place of usb storage as that would have taken up too much space on wii hardware and made it potentially impossible for players to store either saves or other downloaded games gameplay was intended to stay true to dragon quest formula within design necessities and limitations of an mmorpg during an earlier development phase ui featured a large amount of information showing various player statuses but seeking to streamline and simplify game they removed most of display a different gameplay challenge was presented by move from turn based to real time battles which went against traditions of dragon quest series fujisawa wanted to implement classic battle system but was opposed by horii and other staff members who successfully pushed for a real time combat system elements of that battle system such as ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic proved extremely challenging for developers speaking about difference between dragon quest x and final fantasy xiv a realm reborn yoshida said that they needed to preserve atmosphere of a normal dragon quest title despite mmorpgs not being designed for solo playing it was for this reason that loaning of player characters as npc party members was incorporated during later development and following game s release main focus was on balancing various elements items and weapons so as to create a level playing field in addition to keeping in game economy balanced several features featured in earlier entries such as casino and coliseum needed to be kept back for a later time scenario was based around concept of five different races and interaction with a human character story premise of a human character becoming a member of one of five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what player character should be concept of a non human character was introduced by horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in idea of a human saving other tribes this raised some contention among staff including fujisawa due to dragon quest series established convention of a human as main protagonist but fujisawa and horii decided to have player character be a human first and later become one of five tribes part of story s initial drama came from player character growing accustomed to their new form once basic scenario concept had been finalized team commissioned various character designs from toriyama in contrast to greater majority of mmorpgs which did not seem to have a solid ending team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal rpgs release dragon quest x was first hinted at during a square enix press conference in december 2008 when horii revealed that game was being developed for wii game s year of release status as an mmorpg and its eventual release on wii u were announced in september 2011 applications for beta test opened in

lead staff said they would love to in multiple interviews staff have outlined problems with localizing title two main issues are amount of text and technical issues related to servers and other elements involved in operating an mmorpg over multiple regions a later interview at 2016 electronic entertainment expo revealed that square enix was testing waters for possible localization of dragon quest x and dragon quest xi with recent western 3ds releases of dragon quest vii and dragon quest viii in addition to new releases such as dragon quest heroes and dragon quest builders in 2016 square

their review until they had sufficient experience with game after launch one reviewer praised presentation from warmly familiar world to story that has a tendency to wrap you up in it they also praised gameplay and its openness to accept novice players despite reviewer noting that it seemed to take longer to level up a character compared to offline dragon quest entries two of other reviewers pointed out issues with messaging and a lack of guidance about which enemies were too strong for a player character s current level in an import preview kotaku s richard eisenbeis shared famitsus praise of how game was welcoming to players without experience of mmorpgs an issue he pointed out with exploration and battle was that early sections required either a high level or a party for easy progression but this eased up later into game in addition to enjoying story and battle system his main criticisms were chat systems which were clumsy and difficult to use even with right hardware peripheral and overly high amount of experience grinding he needed to do he finished preview by calling dragon quest x surprisingly backwards in its execution despite its sometimes inspired ideas and low entry bar matt walker of nintendo world report mainly focused on gameplay noting like eisenbeis that game required a lot of experience grinding placed an emphasis on forming a party over playing alone and made messaging other players a laborious process despite overall gameplay being enjoyable and absorbing as to graphics which suffered a slowdown in areas with multiple players he was impressed by amount of textures and environmental effects when compared to other wii titles he concluded his preview by calling game a solid enjoyable jrpg experience that has promise to be enjoyable
