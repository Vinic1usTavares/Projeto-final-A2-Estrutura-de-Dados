zong massacre was mass killing of more than 130 african slaves by crew of british slave ship zong on and in days following 29 november 1781 gregson slave trading syndicate based in liverpool owned ship and sailed her in atlantic slave trade as was common business practice they had taken out insurance on lives of slaves as cargo when ship ran low on drinking water following navigational mistakes crew threw slaves overboard into sea to drown in part to ensure survival of rest of ship s passengers and in part to cash in on insurance on slaves thus not losing money on slaves who would have died from lack of water after slave ship reached port at black river jamaica zongs owners made a claim to their insurers for loss of slaves when insurers refused to pay resulting court cases gregson v gilbert 1783 3 doug kb 232 held that in some circumstances deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for slaves deaths judge lord chief justice earl of mansfield ruled against syndicate owners in this case due to new evidence being introduced suggesting captain and crew were at fault following first trial freed slave olaudah equiano brought news of massacre to attention of anti slavery campaigner granville sharp who worked unsuccessfully to have ship s crew prosecuted for murder because of legal dispute reports of massacre received increased publicity stimulating abolitionist movement in late 18th and early 19th centuries zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of horrors of middle passage of slaves to new world non denominational society for effecting abolition of slave trade was founded in 1787 next year parliament passed slave trade act 1788 its first law regulating slave trade to limit number of slaves per ship then in 1791 parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners when slaves were thrown overboard massacre has also inspired works of art and literature it was remembered in london in 2007 among events to mark bicentenary of british slave trade act 1807 which abolished british participation in african slave trade though not slavery itself a monument to murdered slaves on

surgeons were typically involved in selecting slaves for purchase in africa so their medical expertise supported determination of commodity value for a captive krikler 2012 p 409 if surgeon rejected a captive that individual suffered commercial death being of no value and was liable to be killed by african handlers sometimes these killings happened in presence of surgeon it is likely that collingwood had already witnessed mass killing of slaves as historian jeremy krikler commented this may have prepared him psychologically to condone massacre that took place on zong krikler 2007 p 31 walvin 2011 p 52 zong first mate was james kelsall who had also served on william vessel s only passenger robert stubbs was a former captain of slave ships in early 1780 he was appointed by african

zong sailed from accra with 442 slaves on 18 august 1781 it had taken on more than twice number of people that it could safely transport in 1780s british built ships typically carried 1 75 slaves per ton of ship s capacity on zong ratio was 4 0 per ton webster 2007 p 289 a british slave ship of period would carry around 193 slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of zong relatively small

to stop there to replenish its water supplies lewis 2007 pp 362 363 it is unclear who if anyone was in charge of ship at this point walvin 2011 p 90 as luke collingwood had been gravely ill for some

similarly if slaves died a natural death as contemporary term put it at sea then insurance could not be claimed if some slaves were jettisoned in order to save rest of cargo or ship then a claim could

ship reached jamaica account of king s bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto ship crew claimed that slaves had been jettisoned because ship did not have enough water to keep

42 slaves were killed it rained heavily for more than a day allowing six casks of water sufficient for eleven days to be collected lewis 2007 p 366 arrival at jamaica on 22 december 1781 zong arrived

blame it is possible that figures concerning number of slaves killed amount of water that remained on ship and distance beyond jamaica that zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate walvin 2011 p 95 first trial legal proceedings began when insurers refused to compensate owners of zong dispute was initially tried at guildhall in london guildhall museum of london on 6 march 1783 with lord chief justice earl of mansfield overseeing trial before a jury mansfield was previously judge in s case in 1772 which concerned legality of keeping slaves in britain he had ruled that slavery had never been established by statute in britain and was not supported by common law krikler 2007 p 39 robert stubbs was only witness in first zong trial and jury found in favour of owners under an established

proceedings walvin 2011 p 139 summing up verdict reached in first trial mansfield said that jury had no doubt though it shocks one very much that case of slaves was same as if horses had been thrown over board question was whether there was not an absolute necessity for throwing them over board to save rest and jury were of opinion there was walvin 2011 p 153 krikler 2007 p 36 collingwood had died in 1781 and only witness of massacre to appear at westminster hall was passenger robert stubbs although a written affidavit by first mate james kelsall was made available to lawyers walvin 2011 pp 144 155 stubbs claimed that there was an absolute necessity for throwing over negroes because crew feared all slaves would die if they did not throw some into sea walvin 2011 p 144 insurers argued that collingwood had made a blunder and mistake in sailing beyond jamaica and that slaves had been killed so their owners could claim compensation they alleged that collingwood did this because he did not want his first voyage as a slave ship captain to be unprofitable walvin 2011 pp 144 145 john lee responded by saying that slaves perished just as a cargo of goods perished and were jettisoned for greater good of ship walvin 2011 p 146 insurers legal team replied that lee s argument could never justify killing of innocent people each of three addressed issues of humanity in treatment of slaves and said that actions of zong crew were nothing less than murder as historian james walvin has argued it is possible that granville sharp directly influenced strategy of insurers legal team at hearing new evidence was heard that heavy rain had fallen on ship on second day of killings but a third batch of slaves was killed after that this led mansfield to order another trial because rainfall meant that killing of those slaves after water shortage had been eased could not be justified in terms of greater necessity of saving ship and rest of its human cargo krikler 2007 pp 36 38 walvin 2011 p 155 one of justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated findings of jury in first trial as jury had heard testimony that water shortage resulted from poor condition of ship brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions rather than from errors committed by its captain oldham 2007 pp 313 314 mansfield concluded that insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by zong crew there is no evidence that another trial was held on this issue krikler 2007 p 37 weisbord 1969 p 564 despite granville sharp s efforts no member of crew was prosecuted for murder of slaves walvin 2011 p 167 yet zong case did eventually gain both national and international attention a summary of appeal on zong case was eventually published in nominate reports prepared from contemporaneous manuscript notes of sylvester douglas baron glenbervie and others it was published in 1831 as gregson v gilbert 1783 3 doug kb 232 mansfield s motivations jeremy krikler has argued that mansfield wanted to ensure that commercial law remained as helpful to britain s overseas trade as possible and as a consequence was keen to uphold principle of general average even in relation to killing of humans for mansfield to have found in favour of insurers would have greatly undermined this idea krikler 2007 pp 32 33 36 38 42 revelation that rain had fallen during period of killings enabled mansfield to order a retrial while leaving notion of general average intact he emphasised that massacre would have been legally justified and owners insurance claim would have been valid if water shortage had not arisen from mistakes made by captain krikler 2007 p 38 krikler comments that mansfield s conclusions ignored ruling precedent of his predecessor matthew hale that killing of innocents in name of self preservation was unlawful this ruling was to prove important a century later in r v dudley and stephens which also concerned justifiability of acts of murder at sea mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act krikler 2007 pp 42 43 effect on abolitionist movement thumb alt a

restricted number of slaves that could be transported to reduce problems of overcrowding and poor sanitation its renewal in 1794 included an amendment that limited scope of insurance policies
