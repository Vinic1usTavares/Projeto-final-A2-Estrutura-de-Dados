authorities with regards to maximum speeds organisers then began putting forward their candidacies for cities to hold race they plead for eprix to be held in lugano on 7 may 2016 to replace berlin

bird vergne rosenqvist buemi and jose maria lopez of dragon placed second through tenth during practice which had several drivers venture deep onto run off areas bird was close by electrical energy conservative lopez and was impeded by him at final corner he was then caught out by lopez braking early and trying to let him through on main straight and he lost control of his car s rear on bumpy track by locking his front brakes bird crashed into a barrier lining track damaging his right rear suspension and steering but returned to pit lane to switch into a second car turvey damaged his suspension by glancing a barrier and stephane sarrazin of andretti and luca filippi for nio stopped at turns one and two towards session s conclusion after first practice an annoyed bird went to lopez s garage confronted him about crash and latter attempted to explain his perspective to bird lopez then spoke to his team who reviewed television footage of incident and apologised to bird through media in second practice rosenqvist was fastest with a maximum power lap of 1 minute and 12 007 seconds that he set ten minutes before practice concluded evans was 0 054 seconds slower in second and dragon pair of jerome d ambrosio and lopez were third and fourth rest of top ten heading into qualifying were virgin s alex lynn bird vergne andre lotterer of techeetah buemi and piquet traffic forestalling competitor s running and several drivers locked their brakes some again went onto track s run off areas buemi spun entering turn four but sustained light damage to his vehicle s rear from contact with outside barrier lopez then locked his rear tyres under braking approaching turn one and he slid sideways into left hand side tecpro barrier but he returned to pit lane with minor bodywork damage in session s closing seconds lotterer misjudged his braking point and hit rear of nico prost s e dams renault car at turn ten hairpin dislodging prost s left rear sidepod sunday s afternoon qualifying session ran for an hour and was divided into four groups of five cars each group was determined by a lottery system and was permitted six minutes of on track activity all drivers were limited to two timed laps with one at maximum power fastest five overall competitors in four groups participated in a super pole session with one driver on track at any time going out in reverse order from fifth to first each of five drivers was limited to one timed lap and starting order was determined by competitor s fastest times super pole from first to fifth and group qualifying from sixth to twentieth driver and team who recorded fastest time were awarded three points towards their respective championships left thumb upright sam bird pictured in 2015 was highest placed championship contender by starting from third and finishing second in first group of five runners all competitors bar vergne waited for four minutes to begin their lap times on bumpy track bird paced session with a benchmark time ahead of buemi rosenqvist and abt pole position favourite vergne could not feel grip in his car and he was first group s slowest driver vergne was later summoned to stewards office and reprimanded for violating article 33 3 of formula e sporting regulations because his team misread line indicating end of second sector this meant he intermittently activated power mode approximately before then evans set fastest overall lap time of anyone in group stages in group two at 1 minute and 12 594 seconds lotterer placed second in closing seconds of group and di grassi and piquet were third and fourth turvey glanced turn two barrier with his right rear wheel which bent a track rod and he was slowest overall in group qualifying track conditions improved as each group passed and attention switched to third group and whether they could demote championship contenders further down grid however nobody in group three recorded a lap that put them in top five as lynn was fastest followed by heidfeld edoardo mortara of venturi and andretti driver antonio felix da costa maro engel for venturi made a driving error and was third group s slowest driver in group four dragon pair of d ambrosio and lopez were two fastest drivers and stopped di grassi from entering super pole prost lost confidence after locking his tyres on his warm up lap but nevertheless came within 0 023 seconds of teammate buemi for seventh overall sarrazin and filippi were group four s two slowest drivers at end of group qualifying evans d ambrosio lopez lotterer and bird s lap times progressed them to super pole evans was last driver to set a super pole lap and took a wide line over bumps at turn one he took his maiden pole position and jaguar s first in single seater racing with an error free lap of 1 minute and 12 811 seconds he was joined on grid s front row by lotterer his best qualifying performance of season who was 0 137 seconds slower and he had pole position until evans lap bird was first on track and he clipped barrier for third and it prevented him from reducing vergne s lead in drivers championship d ambrosio appeared to go faster than lotterer but he lost a tenth of a second at final turn and took fourth fifth placed lopez drifted sideways and lost a second as he narrowly avoided hitting a wall leaving turn one right hander after qualifying lopez received a three place grid penalty for not slowing under yellow flag conditions in first practice lynn lost same amount of positions due to an inter team miscommunication that caused him to drive into fast lane of pit lane before it opened for group three race weather conditions at start of race were dry and sunny air temperature throughout eprix was between and track temperatures ranged from hot weather caused teams to prioritise maintenance of their car s battery temperatures a special feature of formula e is fanboost feature an additional 100 kilowatts 130 hp of power to use in driver s second car three drivers who were allowed to use boost were determined by a fan vote for zurich race buemi di grassi and rosenqvist were handed extra power around 150 000 people attended event eprix began at 18 04 central european summer time utc 02 00 rather than usual 16 04 because formula e did not wish to clash with men s singles finals of french open and race organisers held it on a sunday for better localised traffic management evans made a good start and defended his lead from lotterer on approach to turn one lotterer then blocked bird from taking second di grassi tried to pass d ambrosio around outside for fourth but no space was left for an overtake rest of field passed through next sequence of corners with minor contact and it appeared all had escaped without issue however as everybody closed up at tramstop chicane piquet mounted rear of abt s car removing abt s rear wing and a section of piquet s front wing accident scattered debris on track thumb upright jerome d ambrosio pictured in 2012 took his first podium in formula e since second 2016 london eprix round at end of first lap evans led lotterer by two seconds and bird d ambrosio and di grassi were close by vergne overtook engel to move into sixteenth place while di grassi passed d ambrosio entering tramstop chicane around inside for fourth position on next lap d ambrosio lost fifth to buemi entering turn one at start of third lap by next lap piquet and abt were shown black flag with an orange disc which required them to enter pit lane for repairs to their cars both entered pit lane on following lap in meantime evans reported rising battery temperatures lessening his ability to harvest electrical energy under braking on lap eight one of mortara s tie rods on his right rear suspension sheared on a kerb heading to tramstop chicane and forcing him to retire by ninth lap vergne moved into top ten with successive overtakes on lynn mortara and heidfeld on approach to first corner as he conserved his electrical energy usage similarly di grassi had an electrical energy advantage over top three due to better efficiency of his audi s powertrain he used this to close up enough to bird and affect a successful overtake for third place by turning left on entry to turn ten on lap 13 di grassi had enough momentum to provide him with an opportunity to get past lotterer on outside line going into turn ten on next lap but lotterer turned right to block him he tried for a second time on start finish straight but lotterer again fended off di grassi s attack at his third try at beginning of lap 16 di grassi aggressively overtook lotterer for second on run into first turn further back in field on 17th lap vergne steered right on approach to turn one as he sought his way past eighth placed rosenqvist who was to his left rosenqvist resisted vergne s attack and two made contact he slid wide into a tecpro barrier at first corner while vergne continued without damage to his car rosenqvist extricated himself from barrier and debris from his car littered track and his front wing detached leaving turn two at end of same lap evans repelled a challenge from di grassi driving into turn ten hairpin however he lost lead to di grassi on approach to first corner at start of lap 18 because di grassi had more usable electrical energy left thumb upright lucas di grassi pictured in 2016 led a race high 22 laps for his first victory of season and seventh of his career di grassi began to pull away from evans as buemi overtook bird into turn one for fourth on 19th lap soon after vergne was about to get ahead of d ambrosio for seventh when he hit rosenqvist s detached front wing because latter was to his left but vergne avoided picking up a front right puncture in response race director scot elkins activated full course yellow procedure to allow marshals to clear debris from track during full course yellow field chose to make their mandatory pit stops to change into a second vehicle at conclusion of lap 19 di grassi kept lead from evans and lotterer while vergne lost twelve seconds because he had trouble starting his car when he tried to exit his garage he fell to ninth piquet retired with a broken driveshaft on lap 21 eight laps later it was announced that quintet of evans lotterer buemi lopez and vergne were under investigation by stewards for exceeding speed limit during full course yellow procedure first four were issued drive through penalties on next lap evans and lotterer took their penalties at start of lap 31 while buemi and lopez served theirs at end of same lap vergne received a drive through penalty on lap 32 prost s brakes failed driving into turn ten hairpin and he ran straight into barrier to outside of track on lap 33 vergne took his penalty at conclusion of 34th lap he emerged in twelfth place behind engel whom he overtook on approach to turn ten hairpin buemi activated his fanboost to get ahead of evans going into turn one at beginning of 36th lap on same lap lotterer earned one championship point for setting race s fastest lap at 1 minute and 14 730 seconds unhindered in final 20 laps di grassi opened his advantage to more than seven seconds and took chequered flag after 39 laps to claim his first victory of season and seventh of his career bird was 7 542 seconds behind in second and drive through penalties helped d ambrosio take his first podium finish since second 2016 london eprix race off podium lotterer finished fourth buemi fifth and heidfeld sixth evans came seventh and felix da costa had a clean race in eighth turvey held off vergne for ninth by six tenths of a second final classified finishers were engel lopez abt sarrazin rosenqvist and lynn there were two lead changes among two drivers during event di grassi led once for a race high 22 laps post race top three drivers appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media in a later press conference di grassi spoke of his happiness over taking victory and dedicated it to his unborn son leonardo weekend was amazing and event here was fantastic you could hear huge number of people cheering all over track i tried to save a bit more energy in first half of first stint and then managed to overtake next three cars bird said he was disappointed after his qualifying performance but was confident he could challenge di grassi in new york city eprix double header we settled into a rhythm in race and it s become apparent that i have to lift more than people around me that s just way it is but we ve got ourselves in this fantastic position in title fight and scored second place today with a little bit of luck i have to say third placed d ambrosio said he adapted his strategy to conserve electrical energy it was emotional but a steady race i did best i could to bring it home and that was important we still have some work to do in race especially on my side in qualifying i ve done a really good job in last three races and we ve done a tremendous job since berlin but we need to better ourselves for new york thumb upright jean eric vergne pictured in 2016 maintained lead of drivers championship after race allan mcnish team principal of audi commented on his surprise that di grassi won despite his qualifying performance when he got up in fourth and then speed with which he caught sam bird then i thought crikey this is on to be leading coming in to pit stop was mighty but at stop there was a worry about an unsafe release but lucas was flawless in race it was a very accomplished win and so deserving for him after start to season rosenqvist spoke to vergne after media left paddock and he accepted an apology from vergne for his lap seventeen crash rosenqvist said it was a misunderstanding that had a serious consequence for him just as i turned in he dived at last moment and i had to do something not to hit him but genuinely i tried to let him through but it didn t work out like that as i was one who lost out and he went free which is a bit harsh evans admitted to feeling conflicted after taking his maiden pole position and finishing seventh our first formula e pole position was a huge motivation boost for troupe and showed how far we have come in meantime unfortunately race did not go that way as we had hoped evans lotterer and lopez were later discovered to have not slowed sufficiently by time full course yellow was activated on lap nineteen while buemi and vergne were penalised for accelerating just before system was lifted on next lap lotterer argued stewards should improve leniency in their decision making when no driver has gained an advantage and felt penalty he received prevented him from getting onto podium it s rules there s no point complaining about it but it s super frustrating you wish that something they would let a few things slide as it didn t change anyone s position buemi said that he felt his early reaction to lifting of full course yellow was caused by him not being able to hear race director over his radio momentarily and it prompted him to brake sharply out of uncertainty vergne accused formula e of creating a new regulation during event to allow for increased suspense in championship at season ending new york city eprix it s weird it s five of us getting penalised we re not daft we ve been racing these cars all year with full course yellows we never got penalties now suddenly there are five drivers getting one four ahead of bird and me it s a bit weird consequence of final positions meant vergne still led drivers championship with 163 points but his advantage over bird narrowed to 23 points because of bird s second place finish with 101 points di grassi s victory moved him from sixth to third buemi s fifth place finish advanced him to fourth with 92 points and rosenqvist fell to fifth after scoring no points techeetah retained first in teams championship with 219 points audi moved closer to their nearest rivals for a deficit of 33 points and virgin dropped further back in third mahindra and jaguar maintained fourth and fifth with two races left in season 2019 edition of race was relocated to bern after zurich city officials expressed concerns
