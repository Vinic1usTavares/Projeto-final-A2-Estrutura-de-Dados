legislation for commemorative coins to mark 150th anniversary of vermont declaring itself fully independent in 1777 and of american victory at battle of bennington same year his bill passed senate without difficulty but in house of representatives faced an array of problems treasury secretary andrew w mellon sent a letter opposing bill and dispatched three treasury officials to testify against it arguing that public was being confused as special coin issues entered circulation committee s resolve to have no more commemorative coins after this one did not impress full house which added two more half dollars to legislation to mark other anniversaries senate agreed to changes and president calvin coolidge signed authorizing act on february 24 1925 there was a lengthy battle over design between commission of fine arts and vermont commission in charge of organizing coin issue as a result of which original designer sherry fry left project replaced by keck although eventual reverse design of a catamount satisfied fine arts commission it has been severely criticized by later writers coins did not sell out over a fourth of issue was returned for redemption and melting coins sell for at least in hundreds of dollars today depending on condition background in days before american revolutionary war ownership of what is now state of vermont was uncertain new hampshire claimed it deeming its own western boundary to be east of hudson river colony of new york believed it owned territory north of massachusetts east to connecticut river british authorities awarded land to new york in 1764 but settlers felt more affinity with new hampshire from which they had secured land grants when new york issued grants for same real estate there was conflict between two groups of settlers and those deriving title from new hampshire organized green mountain boys a local militia at first boys concentrated on fending off unwanted settlers from new york but after war began in 1775 they turned their attention to british brothers ira and ethan allen were born in connecticut and were leaders of green mountain boys ethan allen led an ill advised raid on montreal in 1775 was captured and spent remainder of revolutionary war a prisoner of british ira allen besides being a military leader was a member of convention that declared vermont independent in january 1777 a key player in vermont politics in revolutionary war years allen served as state treasurer designed great seal and in 1780s surveyed several towns three of which are named for him ira and vermont last likely a

advanced south from canada hoping to divide colonies by capturing hudson valley in what is called saratoga campaign low on supplies he heard of a poorly guarded american depot at what is now bennington vermont and sent part of his force to secure it vermonters were joined by some 1 500 new hampshire militiamen and on august 16 1777 battle of bennington took place about 200 of british forces were killed and 700 taken prisoner only 40 americans were killed weakened by losses and failure to obtain supplies burgoyne was defeated at battle of saratoga in new york state that october an american victory that historian edmund morgan deemed a great turning point of war because it won for americans foreign assistance from france which was last element needed for victory legislation legislation for a silver fifty cent piece and a gold one dollar piece in commemoration of 150th anniversaries of battle of bennington and of independence of vermont was introduced in senate by that state s frank greene on january 9 1925 greene had not always been a friend to commemorative coins when monroe doctrine centennial half dollar was debated in 1922 he commented question is whether united states government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this well his bill was referred to committee on banking and currency greene a member of that committee reported bill back to senate on january 20 with an amendment and a recommendation that it pass amendment deleted proposed one dollar piece and increased mintage of half dollar from 20 000 to 40 000 on january 24 new hampshire s george h moses acting on greene s behalf moved that senate consider bill and it passed that body without opposition after house received senate passed bill it was referred to committee on coinage weights and measures which held hearings on january 30 with chairman indiana representative albert h vestal presiding he introduced into record a letter from treasury secretary andrew w mellon opposing measure mellon noted that many commemorative issues had failed to sell out leaving coins in mint or returning them for melting mellon felt that public was being confused as surplus commemoratives entered circulation treasury had sent three officials mint director robert j grant assistant director mary m o reilly and garrard b winston assistant to undersecretary of treasury o reilly who had been with treasury longer than other two addressed committee warning that there were six coinage bills before congress and that mint had struck nine commemoratives in past five years she answered questions from congressmen on panel vermont representative frederick g fleetwood addressed committee o reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations and fleetwood stressed importance in american history of events that were being commemorated vestal and others supported a ban on committee passing further commemorative coin bills but wanted vermont bill to pass for one thing as massachusetts robert m leach noted president calvin coolidge was a vermonter by birth treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin but as illinois morton d hull pointed out sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus over a medal that could not leach s attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical i believe we have been going too fast and i believe at some time we ought to quit it but i dislike quitting on these gentlemen representing state of vermont this morning vestal issued a report same day stating that committee was against more commemorative coin issues but that bennington issue should pass because of national importance of events of 1777 and because issue of 40 000 was relatively small bill came to floor of house of representatives on february 16 as soon as bill was read california representative john e raker pressed an amendment to provide for a california diamond jubilee half dollar he explained that senator samuel shortridge had gotten a bill through senate that was nearly identical to his amendment and senator is exceptionally anxious that it go through vestal asked to be heard in opposition to amendment stating that his committee after recommending bennington bill had decided to promote no further coin bills he added that because of this washington representative albert johnson had agreed to withdraw his bill for a commemorative honoring centennial of fort vancouver in his state minority leader democratic congressman finis j garrett of tennessee asked why committee had not set rule before considering bennington bill and vestal admitted that was hard to answer house voted and california amendment was added but representative johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment to add and vancouver wash that is state of washington amendment passed as did bill johnson realized that such a simple amendment might not result in a coin being issued and returned to house floor soon thereafter asking that bill be reconsidered so he could couch his amendment in same phrasing as for other two coins once bill was again being considered johnson added his amendment but vestal moved that bill be returned to his committee his motion failed 24 to 67 lengthy procedural wrangling followed over whether that vote could be objected to because there was no quorum present once this was resolved house passed bill again bill was returned to senate following day kansas charles curtis moved on behalf of greene that senate agree to house amendments and bill authorizing all three coins was enacted by coolidge s signature on february 24 1925 anthony swiatek and walter breen in their 1988 book on commemoratives state that bill would probably not have passed congress if coolidge had not been known to have an interest in bennington observances preparation thumb alt bronze statue of a man in garb of late 18th century statue is in an outdoor setting and man is depicted as looking forward statue of ira allen by sherry fry 1921 after approval of legislation vermont sesquicentennial commission moved quickly to secure designs to be used for half dollar members decided to have coin show ira allen on obverse and battle of bennington monument on reverse they commissioned sherry fry who had created a statue of allen for university of vermont to design coin on july 1 1925 fry wrote to charles moore chairman of commission of fine arts charged by a 1921 executive order by president warren g harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks including coins informing him that models would be ready in about a week louis ayres a member of fine arts commission and james earle fraser a former member viewed models before they were sent and did not approve of them ayres wrote to moore on july 15 stating that designs were mediocre but that it was not entirely fry s fault as sesquicentennial commission had dictated designs moore wrote to mint director grant on 18th noting problem and relaying a suggestion from ayres that sketches be approved by mint before artist spent time and effort on making plaster models and that fry be allowed to make designs of his own choosing in spite of this fry formally submitted photographs of his models on august 9 once mint had established that fry had authority to act o reilly sent them to fine arts commission for its verdict on september 5 moore replied rejecting models on several grounds fine arts commission questioned choice of allen did not like lettering objected to misspelling of bennington as and had mistaken monument for one erected for battle of lake champlain and thus felt that there was an issue regarding relevance on september 11 chairman of sesquicentennial commission john spargo wrote to grant pointing out error and strongly defending choices of allen and monument he wrote again on 15th this time directly to moore your commission has touched pride of vermonter there with a rather rough hand moore wrote to spargo on september 18 stating that his commission had approved head of allen but was dissatisfied with lettering spargo had mentioned that president coolidge liked bennington monument and moore stated that fine arts commission was anxious to get right a coin for president s state of birth fry he wrote had talent to design a handsome coin but had not done so next day spargo replied hopeful that they would soon resolve dispute he stated that sesquicentennial commission felt that designs other than monument would not do for example use of a green mountain boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating minuteman seen on lexington concord sesquicentennial half dollar issued earlier in 1925 he was also unwilling to have a two headed coin as such a design combined with depiction of allen would be spargo suggested that moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce fry to continue with project because sculptor wanted to withdraw from it despite conciliatory efforts fry refused to continue and after failure of brief negotiations with theodore spicer simson vermont commission engaged charles keck thumb upright left alt a bronze medal bearing legends battle of bennington and 1777 1927 and 14 stars this surrounds a wreath with ribbons with names of battle participants such as allen within wreath is a building and inscription fay s tavern keck repurposed his rejected design for half dollar as one side of official medal it was not until march 24 1926 that new models by keck were sent to fine arts commission although commission admired keck s portrait of allen they disliked his choice of fay s tavern for reverse and also disliked his enclosing building in a wreath on april 2 moore wrote to keck advising him to get rid of both and to put in place of building a catamount which would make a coin one could admire animal is a reference to fay s tavern that was also known as catamount tavern and was a place where green mountain boys met a copy of letter was sent by keck to spargo who wrote to moore on 12th suggesting fine arts commission was overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate design but to resolve matter he would agree to catamount life is too short to be spent in futile argument with commission of fine arts by end april 1926 keck had prepared three models two with catamount and a third featuring revolutionary war memorabilia commission on 30th approved one showing a walking catamount for reverse and asked that words founder of vermont be removed and ira allen be substituted vermont commission objected and matter was resolved by name being added e pluribus unum and in god we trust also had to be added to reverse keck promised completion within several days when he wrote to grant on may 24 with photographs to be submitted to secretary mellon for final approval in july spargo wrote to grant advising him of how coins would be distributed and making arrangements to secure first coins struck to be used for presentations medallic art company of new york reduced keck s plaster models to coin sized hubs from which dies could be made by philadelphia mint design obverse features an idealized portrait of ira allen one different from one fry had used in his statue and models allen wears a periwig and below his head appears his name words founder of vermont and united states of america surround his portrait reverse features a catamount facing and walking to left animal is virtually penned in with lettering with battle of bennington in god we trust and anniversary dates above him e pluribus unum and half dollar below aug 16 representing battle s date below its head and designer s initials ck between its rearmost paw and end of its tail keck s design has been widely criticized often because of catamount swiatek and breen summed up coin as an almost unrecognizably idealized ira allen mated with an equally unrecognizably idealized wildcat we cannot be sure of species cougar panther puma q david bowers described reverse as bearing a large catlike animal of uncertain species which had nothing to do with history of vermont being commemorated but was a rebus for catamount fay s tavern a subtlety lost on just about everyone who saw it art historian cornelius vermeule in his volume about u s coins and medals wrote that vermont coin is spoiled by an excess of lettering on both sides it seems superfluous to have to state on obverse that ira allen was founder of vermont production distribution and collecting a total of 40 034 vermont sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at philadelphia mint during january and february 1927 with excess over round number reserved for inspection and testing at 1928 meeting of annual assay commission they were distributed by local banks which charged 1 per coin and they sold principally to vermonters distribution was coordinated by bennington battle monument and historical association of bennington vermont four banks in bennington each received 2 000 coins for distribution as did four banks in rutland in 1929 bennington group was selling coins by mail at a charge of 1 25 per coin by registered mail and 1 per coin for ten or more if buyer paid for conveyance by an express company sales were not as robust as hoped in november 1928 spargo wrote to mint director grant requesting information on how to return several thousand coins and by 1934 a total of 11 892 pieces had been returned to mint for redemption and melting profits from coin went to vermont historical trust and were used to benefit museums and historical societies in state including bennington museum swiatek and breen alluding to scandals that embroiled other commemorative coins noted that it is a testimony to something or other in vermont that there was never faintest breath of suspicion at any time about anything connected with distribution of coins by 1935 coins in uncirculated condition sold for about 2 a price increased by fifty cents during commemorative coin boom of 1936 they had subsided
