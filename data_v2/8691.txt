precarious situation reds knew yekaterinburg would fall to better manned and equipped white army when whites reached yekaterinburg imperial family had simply disappeared most widely accepted account

had ricocheted off corsets of two or three of grand duchesses executioners later came to find out that this was because family s crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside linings of corsets to hide them from their captors corsets thus served as a form of armor against bullets anastasia and maria were said to have crouched up against a wall covering their heads in terror until they were shot down by bullets recalled yurovsky however another guard peter told his wife that anastasia had been finished off with bayonets as bodies were carried out one or more of girls cried out and were clubbed on back of head wrote yurovsky false reports of survival anastasia s supposed escape and possible survival was one of most popular historical mysteries of 20th century provoking many books and films at least ten women claimed to be her offering varying stories as to how she had survived anna anderson best known anastasia impostor first surfaced publicly between 1920 and 1922 she contended that she had feigned death among bodies of her family and servants and was able to make her escape with help of a compassionate guard who noticed she was still breathing and took sympathy upon her kurth 1983 pp 33 39 her legal battle for recognition from 1938 to 1970 continued a lifelong controversy and was longest running case ever heard by german courts where it was officially filed final

sample from anderson located in a hospital and blood of prince philip duke of edinburgh a great nephew of empress alexandra according to dr gill who conducted tests if you accept that these samples came from anna anderson then anna anderson could not be related to tsar nicholas or tsarina alexandra anderson s mitochondrial dna was a match with a great nephew of franziska a missing polish factory

reported that they saw anastasia her mother and sisters in perm after murders this story is now widely discredited rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed to hide fact that family was dead a few days after they had been murdered german government sent several telegrams to russia demanding safety of princesses of german blood russia had recently signed a peace treaty with germans and did not want to upset them by letting them know women were dead so they told them they had been moved to a safer location v v last act of a tragedy documents from german

masquerade as one of grand duchesses to assist in deceiving families he had defrauded some biographers accounts speculated that opportunity for one or more of guards to rescue a survivor existed yakov

earlier but was kept hidden by its discoverers from communists who were still ruling russia at time grave only held nine of expected eleven sets of remains dna and skeletal analysis matched these remains to tsar nicholas ii tsarina alexandra and three of four grand duchesses olga tatiana and presumably maria other remains with unrelated dna correspond to family s doctor yevgeny botkin their valet alexei their cook ivan and alexandra s maid anna demidova forensic expert william r maples decided that tsarevitch alexei and anastasia s bodies were missing from family s grave russian scientists contested this conclusion however claiming it was body of maria that was missing russians identified body as that of anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of youngest grand duchess with skulls of victims from mass grave they estimated height and width of skulls where pieces of bone were missing american scientists found this method inexact massie 1995 p 67 american scientists thought missing body to be anastasia because none of female skeletons showed evidence of immaturity such as an immature collarbone undescended wisdom teeth or immature vertebrae in back that they would have expected to find in a seventeen year old in 1998 when remains of imperial family were finally interred a body measuring approximately 5 7 1 70 m was buried under name of anastasia

two burned partial skeletons at a bonfire site near yekaterinburg that appeared to match site described in yurovsky s memoirs archaeologists said bones were from a boy who was roughly between ages of ten and thirteen years at time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between ages of eighteen and twenty three years old anastasia was seventeen years and one month old at time of assassination while her sister maria was nineteen years one month old and her brother alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday anastasia s elder sisters olga and tatiana were twenty two and twenty one years old respectively at time of assassination along with remains of two bodies archaeologists found shards of a container of sulfuric acid nails metal strips from a wooden box and bullets of various caliber site was initially found with metal detectors and by using metal rods as probes dna testing by multiple international laboratories including armed forces dna identification laboratory and innsbruck medical university confirmed that remains belong to tsarevich alexei and to one of his sisters proving conclusively that all family members including anastasia died in 1918 parents and all five children are now accounted for and each has his or her own unique dna profile while tests have confirmed that all romanov bodies have been found one of studies was still unsure which body from two graves was maria s and which was anastasia s a well publicized debate over which daughter maria according to russian experts or anastasia according to us experts has been recovered
