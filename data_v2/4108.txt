after being buried for 15 years graves are exhumed and remains removed if religion of deceased permits cremation exhumed remains are cremated and stored in government columbaria niches otherwise remains are re buried in smaller individual plots sea burial sea burial is being implemented at tanah merah by end of 2019 cremation history in days of british rule number of chinese burial grounds in singapore increased very rapidly and colonial government had little power to control burial spaces because it did not possess sanctions of sufficient strength clan associations met all physical and social needs of chinese majority and result was creation of segmented chinese immigrant communities separated by kinship ties and operating independently of state each conducting their own death rites and running their own cemeteries local authorities began to view these cemeteries as hazardous sources of disease causing vectors such as mosquitoes singapore parliamentary debates official report 20 march 1975 as well as a form of land waste there were urgent demands on space in land scarce singapore in name of national development in words of e w barker then minister for law environment science and technology needs of singapore s young population must require use of sterilised land for economic and social good of all citizens of singapore singapore parliamentary debates official report 7 april 1978 in 1965 master plan which was designed to guide land use development in singapore cemeteries were identified as land considered available for development and cremation was mooted as a viable option to deal with exhumed bodies from these burial grounds and as a way to dispose of people who died to encourage population to adopt this relatively new way of treating dead state employed help of funerary middlemen who could erode distrust of cremation because they were respected for their knowledge of death rites and disposal in addition rallying cries of national development common good and country s future were used to encourage populace to take up idea of cremation and to abandon their insistence of traditional burial grounds in 1972 state made it clear that it would close all cemeteries near and around city area to conserve land addendum to presidential address singapore parliamentary debates official report 20 july 1972 state power over cemeteries was considerably strengthened by an alteration in law allowing public commissioner to close cemeteries without assigning reasons for doing so singapore parliamentary debates official report 3 november 1972 as an alternative means of managing disposal of dead state offered burial space at a state owned public cemetery complex at choa chu kang although it made it clear that it considered cremation as only viable long term option as various academics have pointed out clearance of ethnic burial grounds served more than a practical purpose as it signified transferring of power from clan and ethnic based associations which had previously run these burial grounds to state organizations development and evolution of crematoria and columbaria thumb right 220px an elaborate tombstone from bidadari christian cemetery preserved at garden of remembrance a private columbarium with limit of 15 years for burial such memorials are becoming rare in singapore thumb right 220px garden of remembrance is a private columbarium in singapore earliest government crematorium situated at mount vernon began operations in 1962 with only one funeral service hall and about four cremations a week by 1995 it had three service halls and was averaging 21 cremations a day with operations beginning every day at 9 00 am with cremations scheduled at 45 minute intervals until about 6 00 or 7 00 pm site includes a columbarium built in several phases comprising niches arranged in numbered blocks which either feature chinese style green roofs or housed within a nine storey pagoda style building there also exists a two storey church style building towards end of 1970s mount vernon complex which was initially intended for storage of ashes from recent deaths could no longer cope with scale of exhumation projects fuelling demand for columbarium niches another crematorium and columbarium complex was built at mandai and this commenced operations in 1982 equipped with eight small and four medium sized and a total of 64 370 niches for storage of cremated remains chinese voluntary associations such as pek san were allowed to build columbaria to house remains of those exhumed from clan owned cemeteries and temples and churches were allowed to accommodate cremated remains mount vernon crematorium ceased operations on 30 june 2004 present after a body is cremated family of deceased can store ashes at home or in a columbarium or scatter them in sea about south of pulau there are three crematoria in singapore mandai crematorium only government facility is now operated by national environment agency other two crematoria are privately operated one is in kong meng san phor kark see monastery at bright hill drive bishan and other is in tse toh aum temple at sin ming drive there are three government columbaria and 57 private ones government operated columbaria are at mandai and choa chu kang a fourth government columbarium at mount vernon is due to close at an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area into a public housing estate private columbaria are operated by kong meng san phor kark see monastery roman catholic church of saint mary of angels in bukit and singapore soka association among others as with crematoria there is a significant price difference between niches in private and government columbaria a standard niche in any government columbarium costs less than 900 but one at kong meng san monastery costs more than 15 000 government columbaria allocate niches sequentially and charge an extra 250 for any location change request for an extra price private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability and even to pre book niches before death there has been an increase in number of singaporeans pre booking niches at private crematoria even though some people consider talking about death and pre booking a final resting place inauspicious reasons for pre booking include wanting one s ashes to be close to those of loved ones and hedging against higher prices for niches in future bodies of foreigners regardless of where they die can be cremated in singapore but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria there are also irregular instances of singaporeans dying overseas such as 2015 accident surrounding huang lin davina a high profile demise of a singaporean abroad it has been observed that architecture of government columbaria reflects outlook of singaporean nation early columbaria were simple with few aesthetic ornaments just like early singaporean housing flats later columbaria have more modern designs with well designed landscaped environments and looking similar to contemporary hdb housing and development board flats these columbaria include chua chu kang columbarium and mandai columbarium which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60 000 niches designs are more elaborate and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life comparisons have been drawn between architecture of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death see also death penalty in singapore notes further reading uses data on suicides from 1989 to 1998 external links association
