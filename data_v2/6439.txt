nonetheless pemberton acknowledged that not everyone enjoys crosswords hence i always hated cryptic crosswords why can t people just say what they mean instead of trying to trick you all time from shearsmith s tyler in an interview with connor published after riddle of sphinx had aired pemberton explored ways in which writing for inside no 9 was like writing for a cryptic crossword in both cases misdirection is key and utterly arbitrary choices or happenings can serve as important inspirations in dvd commentary for episode shearsmith and pemberton expressed a hope that pemberton s crossword could be published before episode s airing so that viewers would be able to watch episode having unknowingly already completed crossword around which it revolves pemberton s crossword was published in guardian on same day that episode aired credited to sphinx for one critic this explained and justified answer mysteryguest collaboration between inside no 9 and guardian drew inspiration

of anton chekhov were also identified as possible influences chekhov and his work are referenced in episode chekhov s gun is referred to in closing seconds while squires identifies gun in episode as from a production of seagull which was authored by chekhov this play like riddle of sphinx features a character named nina and a gunshot suicide mark butler writing for inews co uk noted references to greek tragedy arguing that episode followed a long tradition of grotesque dramatic reveals nina as well as being name of a character in episode is a name given by crossword enthusiasts to hidden messages in crosswords such as squires s iswappedcups character of nina is reminiscent of eliza doolittle with squires acting as henry higgins episode explicitly references bernard shaw s play pygmalion from which these characters originate while squires s language echoes that of higgins in my fair lady musical adaptation of play ninas butler and comedy critic bruce dessau suggested that crossword answers may contain a hidden political message on episode s audio commentary shearsmith denied that nina ripnhs should be read as a political statement namely rest in peace national health service similarly in his interview with connor pemberton noted that most people think that nina is political but that it was an accidental introduction and only woven into plot once crossword had been completed political commentator kerry anne mendoza reached out to bbc for comment on apparent political message a bbc spokesperson clarified that nhs are initials of professor in question who takes his own life and subsequently that apparent political message was genuinely a complete coincidence every episode of inside no 9 features an ornamental hare somewhere on screen according to pemberton because each episode is so wildly different there was nothing really linking them other than fact they were all inside a number nine i just thought it would be nice to have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set there is no particular significance to hare itself hare is visible though not clearly in riddle of sphinx on a table in squires s fireplace there is also a second hare though it is not visible in partially completed crossword shown at end of episode crossword published in guardian contains a nina spelling onelepus lepus being generic name for hares reception critics responded very positively to riddle of sphinx which was variously called a brilliant episode of inside no 9 comfortably best thus far of third series and even one of best episodes ever it was praised by ben lawrence of telegraph co uk for its near brilliance while dessau characterised it as a beautiful constructed playlet at end of fourth series butler listed riddle of sphinx as second strongest episode of inside no 9 describing it as sheer brilliance he listed 12 days of christine as strongest episode was widely noted as both very dark and very clever dessau characterised it as cleverest episode of inside no 9 and freelance journalist dan owen described it as undoubtedly most complex and surprising instalment of inside no 9 favouring attention to detail and narrative precision similarly mellor called it most complicated tale inside no 9 has ever spun plot offered much to admire for crossword fans but viewers enjoyment it was suggested may depend on how much they enjoy crosswords latter half of episode introduced a very wide array of twists owen speculated that episode could lose viewers at end due to its minimal hand holding suggesting that there may have been too many twists if you missed just one line of dialogue he explained it would ve left you scrambling to understand exactly what s going on between three characters nonetheless episode was for owen a writing masterclass created with considerable skill and with a plot that held together even when scrutinised mellor similarly praised intelligence of plot provided one takes on faith unlikely notion that a mother and her new husband would have no contact with her children from a previous marriage not even recognising them as adults from lightning flashes that punctuate hints and story shifts to wordplay and in jokes peppered through script mellor said episode is highly precise butler called episode s ending one of inside no 9 darkest and most bizarre some he suggested may have found it a bit too unpalatable though he added that plot and ironic humour suggested that viewers can perhaps avoid taking it too seriously morales received particular praise for his attention to detail and foreshadowing of future events in episode with mellor explaining that he and writers continually draw our attention to key props of gun and teacups camera follows squires gun to his desk drawer and we re kept aware of its presence thanks to nina and squires if i d shot you here in dark with an empty gun good luck exchange nina is shown drinking from poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls squires devious a hint at her true feelings about him and once again when she emphasises word plan while squires is telling story of sphinx and she seems to be gazing at statue of it she s actually looking at photograph of her brother on display directly below actors performances were also commended with particular praise for roach who was characterised as funny likeable and endearingly crude as nina then captivating and clever when charade drops patrick mulkern writing for radiotimes com also praised zingy funny lines in earlier part of episode and butler commended smart
