development neverwinter nights 2 was unofficially announced on april 1 2004 when an atari employee listed names of several games in development including a nwn2 in response to an inflammatory comment on atari s forums company officially announced game on august 4 2004 obsidian entertainment handled development of game and bioware company that created first neverwinter nights offered support and guidance to obsidian two companies collaborated in a similar manner on star wars knights of old republic ii an obsidian developed sequel to a bioware game bioware joint ceo ray muzyka said neverwinter nights remains one of most important titles bioware has ever created we certainly plan to remain involved in production and development of neverwinter nights 2 obsidian employed several game designers from defunct black isle studios which developed other dungeons dragons role playing video games such as planescape torment icewind dale series and baldur s gate series development of neverwinter nights 2 began in july 2004 when obsidian assigned several staff members to work on project staff included darren monahan producer of several icewind dale and baldur s gate dark alliance games marc holmes art director of first neverwinter nights and chris avellone lead designer of planescape torment and knights of old republic ii thumb right alt a screenshot of electron software in use electron toolset being used to create a module bioware provided its aurora engine from neverwinter nights for sequel one of decisions to use aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was toolset obsidian wanted players to continue to be able to make content for game which may not have been possible with a new engine bioware made itself available to obsidian with technical support on engine but obsidian planned on completely overhauling aurora including its code designers wanted to improve visuals of first game with additions such as better lighting and textures which required significant changes to engine upgraded engine was referred to as electron electron was designed to incorporate directx to make it compatible for a potential xbox 360 release but obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to system for financial reasons toolset that was used to create game was also revamped and included several additions like a customizable interface a new dialogue format and building assistants similar to wizards found in microsoft word and excel like neverwinter nights toolset was included in game s release for players to use obsidian drew on older computer rpgs for inspiration on storyline and gameplay like fallout and ultima series obsidian ceo feargus urquhart said we ve been thinking about a lot of older rpgs and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent rpgs he compared neverwinter nights 2 to baldur s gate ii stating that he wanted to expand upon city of neverwinter as baldur s gate ii had done with its setting we re looking at how to make neverwinter a really intriguing place to be and make it a place where you go and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for game urquhart said game s story while still revolving around city of neverwinter would be unrelated to neverwinter nights instead of starting game as a powerful important character players would begin neverwinter nights 2 as nobodies obsidian wanted realism in game and concrete consequences for player s actions story would be centered on player character who would have to gradually earn respect of lord nasher and city of neverwinter instead of henchmen system used in neverwinter nights obsidian overhauled game s party format to mimic knights of old republic ii like neverwinter nights expansion hordes of underdark player would be able to recruit more than one party member each character could be directly controlled but party members would also be able to come to a player s aid even when not controlled such as summoning a rogue to open a locked chest companions would have distinct personalities and their own agendas but it would be possible for player character to influence them characters can leave party permanently under certain circumstances other changes from first game include addition of prestige classes and more exotic races like and elven subraces in 2012 gamespy company providing multiplayer support for game was purchased by glu mobile after purchase glu mobile raised fees being charged to publishers to provide online services for their games new owners then shut down a number of online

nominated for a golden joystick award for best pc game of 2006 editors of computer games magazine presented neverwinter nights 2 with their 2006 best writing award and it was a runner up for their list of year s top 10 computer games while some reviewers considered neverwinter nights 2 superior to its predecessor neverwinter nights sequel received lower overall review ratings implementation of dungeons dragons 3 5 ruleset was praised as faithful to pen and paper version with gamedaily stating 3 5 edition ruleset is in full swing in neverwinter nights 2 where critical hits can devastate your entire party game s representation of forgotten realms campaign setting was also well received storyline was widely considered one of game s strong points and an improvement over neverwinter nights gamespy stated that single player campaign was worthy of its exhaustive pedigree and game informer s reviewer said this title easily trumps original s campaign with a vastly superior story and characters another reviewer declared it one of best written games in history aaron r conklin of wisconsin state journal said it d be very easy to be turned off by first mundane chapters of game s sprawling plot stick with it once your party hits neverwinter and reaches level seven or so proceedings become significantly more interesting especially in terms of character interaction and development nwn2 is a masterpiece of storytelling and scope conklin and matt slagle of deseret news were pleased with ethical choices in game with both noting approvingly that diplomacy was a very valid option that could succeed in place of combat other reviewers were less convinced with australia s palgn referring to story as rather predictable and cliched jonathan of personal computer world wrote dialogue is nwn2 s key component but those who favour fisticuffs may find it tiresome after playing for several billion hours similarly reception of neverwinter nights 2 s graphics was mixed some reviewers referred to visuals as new age and beautiful but others noticed inconsistencies in their rendering and performance especially on lower end pcs sydney morning herald said detailed 3d engine allows for lush scenery giving you a greater sense of exploration as you poke around rustic villages and murky swamps several comments on audio and voice acting were positive though one reviewer expressed disappointment that some sound effects had apparently been recycled from neverwinter nights conklin called in game camera abysmal and said game had many graphical glitches slagle agreed writing i had a lot of stuttering graphics and voiceovers that were out of synch with characters on screen animations most common criticism of game was its numerous technical glitches adam diamond of isthmus was not happy with pathfinding writing i often found myself traveling solo through a dungeon my companions spread out far behind me leaving me vulnerable to attack what s point of having henchmen if they re not there to protect you some reviews compared neverwinter nights 2 to star wars knights of old republic ii a previous obsidian game that had received similar complaints bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and downright infuriating and one reviewer encountered a showstopper bug in initial retail version that prevented him from playing game past a certain point bugs were said to negatively affect npc ai camera operation and pathfinding one review stated launch to load time is fairly long so be prepared to wonder if game has crashed or is loading obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs but later reviews still described glitches as a serious problem 1up com s review written two weeks after game s release stated but sad truth is that nwn2 shipped in a pretty messy state and even after a couple patches as of this writing biggest problems remain level editor and design toolset were widely praised with deseret referring to them as insanely powerful and complex mac version received mixed reception and reviewers complained about its lack of editor toolkit and its high system requirements 1up com writer matt peckham caused controversy with his initial review of neverwinter nights 2 a 1up editor pulled review from site and officially retracted it from print version of january 2007 issue of games for windows official magazine explaining that we felt that this particular review of neverwinter nights 2 did a disservice to fans of role playing game genre subsequent review by jeff green gave game a score of c and is one of most negative reviews among major outlets a modified version of peckham s review was later published by sci fi channel and another version of review can be found at penny arcade references
