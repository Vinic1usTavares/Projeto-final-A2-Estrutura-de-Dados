force designated second australian imperial force second aif would be formed for overseas service meanwhile conscription was introduced in october 1939 to keep militia at strength as its members volunteered for aif australian army subsequently made an important contribution to allied campaigns in mediterranean middle east and north africa fighting germans italians and vichy french during 1940 and 1941 and later in jungles of south west pacific area fighting japanese between late 1941 and 1945 following japanese surrender australian army units were deployed as occupation forces across south west pacific meanwhile army contributed troops to british commonwealth occupation force bcof in japan from 1946 army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to japanese threat to australia during this year army s strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions and in august 1942 army had a strength of 476 000 men this force was larger than australia s population and economy could sustain and its strength was reduced in second half of year militia units were able to serve outside of australian territory in south west pacific area from january 1943 after defence citizen military forces act 1943 was passed but few did so army was further reduced by 100 000 members from october 1943 to free up manpower for industry at end of 1943 army s strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades although further reductions were ordered in august 1944 and june 1945 australian army generally had a long standing policy of using british designed equipment but equipment from australia united states and some other countries was introduced into service in war s later years pre war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a european environment and army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943 in early 1943 army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting pre war field service regulations to meet conditions in south west pacific demands of combat during world war ii led to changes in composition of army units success of german mechanised units during invasions of poland and france convinced australian defence planners that army required armoured units and these began to be raised in 1941 these units were not suitable for jungle warfare however and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 conditions in south west pacific also led army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles this organisation proved only moderately successful and divisions were strengthened for their 1944 45 campaigns process of demobilisation began immediately after end of hostilities in august 1945 and was finally completed on 15 february 1947 a total of 730 000 personnel enlisted in australian army during war a figure which represented around 10 percent of population nearly 400 000 men ultimately served overseas with 40 percent of total force serving in front line areas as a proportion of its population australian army was ultimately one of largest allied armies during world war ii casualties included 11 323 killed in action 1 794 who died of wounds and 21 853 wounded another 5 558 were killed or died as prisoners of war pows while non battle casualties in operational areas were also significant and included 1 088 killed and 33 196 wounded or injured in addition army suffered a substantial number of casualties in non operational areas 1 795 soldiers killed and 121 800 wounded or injured background thumb

permanent military forces pmf and larger part time militia throughout inter war years a combination of complacency and economic austerity had resulted in limited defence spending in 1929 following election of scullin labor government conscription was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby militia would be maintained on a part time voluntary basis only size of army remained small up until 1938 and 1939 when militia was rapidly expanded as threat of war grew in 1938 there had been only 35 000 soldiers in militia but by september 1939 this had been increased to 80 000 supported by a pmf of 2 800 full time soldiers whose main responsibility was largely to administer and train militia this expansion had little impact on improving readiness of australian forces upon outbreak of war though as provisions of defence act 1903 restricted pre war army to service in australia and its territories including papua and new guinea as a result when australia entered war in 1939 a new all volunteer force was required that could fight in europe or elsewhere outside of australia s immediate region similarly in world war i all volunteer first australian imperial force first aif was raised and served with distinction at gallipoli in middle east and on western front from 1920s australia s defence thinking was dominated by singapore strategy which centred on establishment of a major naval base at singapore and use of naval forces to respond to any future japanese aggression in region as a maritime strategy it resulted in a defence budget that was focused on building up royal australian navy ran in order to support british royal navy between 1923 and 1929 ps20 000 000 was spent on ran while australian army and munitions industry received only ps10 000 000 and fledgling royal australian air force raaf just ps2 400 000 strategy met significant political opposition from sections of regular army including several prominent officers such as henry wynter and john lavarack wynter in particular argued that war was most likely to break out in pacific at a time when britain was involved in a crisis in europe and would be unable to send sufficient resources to singapore he contended that singapore was vulnerable especially to attack from land and air and argued for a more balanced policy of building up army and raaf rather than relying on ran thumb left alt a group of soldiers marching in column of route men from darwin mobile force in april 1939 unit was an early attempt by australian government to raise a regular infantry field force amidst concerns about australia s readiness for war during 1930s australian army s organisation equipment and doctrine were similar to those of world war i militia was organised into infantry and horse mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports while army recognised that there was a threat of war with japan little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in main population centres of australia s eastern seaboard along with isolated attacks against strategic points in western australia army followed trends in british army as it modernised in late 1930s but was unable to obtain up to date equipment needed to properly implement new british doctrines and organisations due to a lack of resources as a result of limited defence expenditures nevertheless militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand army in event of war and indeed during course of war about 200 000 militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service in 1942 army adopted title australian military forces amf to encompass various categories of service aif militia and permanent forces wartime exigencies required a rapid expansion of army and during war 730 000 personnel enlisted in either militia or aif a figure which represented around 10 percent of australia s population of just seven million one of highest percentages of any of allied armies during world war ii it subsequently made an important contribution to allied campaigns in mediterranean middle east and north africa fighting germans italians and vichy french during 1940 and 1941 as part of british commonwealth forces and later in jungles of south west pacific area swpa fighting japanese between late 1941 and 1945 primarily in conjunction with forces from united states nearly 400 000 men served overseas with 40 percent of total force serving in front line areas

000 strong expeditionary force designated second australian imperial force would be formed for overseas service like its predecessor second aif was a volunteer force formed by establishing entirely new units in many cases these units drew their recruits from same geographical areas as first aif units and they were given same numerical designations albeit with prefix 2 in october 1939 conscription was introduced to keep militia at strength as its members volunteered for aif from january 1940 all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service while a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter military remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service a side effect of this arrangement was creation of two different armies with different conditions of service one part volunteer part conscript militia and other all volunteer aif this situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout war as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between men of two forces later provision was made to allow militia units to transfer to aif if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under aif terms of service this required 65 percent of a unit s war establishment or 75 percent of its actual strength to volunteer and allowed whole battalions to become part of aif an early problem was whether to adopt british or australian organisation in 1939 british army was in process of re equipping with new weapons and a new organisation was required this new equipment was not available in australia so it was decided to organise first unit to be raised 6th division with some elements of old organisation and some of new consequently 6th division was raised as an infantry division of around 18 000 personnel and initially comprised twelve 900 man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies a battalion headquarters regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals mortars carriers pioneers anti aircraft and administration artillery support was provided by three field regiments each attached at brigade level as well an anti tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with armoured vehicles corps troops included a machine gun battalion and various engineer logistics and communication units three further aif infantry divisions were formed during 1940 7th division in february 1940 8th division in may and 9th division in june however establishment of these divisions was reduced to new nine battalion organisation as size of an australian division was reduced to approximately 17 000 men and three surplus battalions of 6th division became part of 7th division further changes included addition of a light anti aircraft regiment at divisional level and a reorganisation of divisional artillery from three four battery regiments consisting of 16 guns to three two battery regiments of 12 guns an aif corps headquarters designated i corps was formed in march 1940 along with various support units 1st armoured division final aif division to be formed was established in july 1941 built around a core of two armoured brigades each consisting of three tank equipped armoured regiments supported by motorised cavalry armoured cars engineers and artillery several units such as z and m special units were also raised for irregular warfare as were 12 commando companies many corps support and service units were also raised during war to provide combat and logistical support forces in australia and pacific thumb 220px left alt a map of australian military districts australian military districts october 1939 army s command and administrative arrangements at start of war were based on a system of military districts that had existed since federation albeit with a number of modifications australia was divided into six military districts each of which largely equated to a state or territory and reported to department of chief of general staff meanwhile military board was responsible for administration of army with regular members consisting of deputy adjutant general chief of intelligence chief of general staff chief of ordnance and a civilian finance member in addition to a number of consultative members under overall control of minister of defence 1st military district 1 md encompassed queensland 2nd included most of new south wales 3rd was primarily based on victoria 4th included south australia 5th included western australia and 6th encompassed forces in tasmania in 1939 northern territory was designated 7th military district while and 8th military district was later activated in port moresby to command forces in new guinea following outbreak of world war ii a regional command structure was subsequently adopted with 2 md becoming eastern command 5 md redesignated western command while 1 md in queensland became northern command and three southern states of new south wales victoria and tasmania were amalgamated into southern command in early years of war this structure proved effective for operations overseas however as threat of war with japan grew various commands and military districts came under greater pressure activation of militia for full time duty after japan s entry into war in late 1941 compounded situation in response army command structure was reorganised in early 1942 while western australia remained unchanged queensland new south wales victoria tasmania and south australia were redesignated as lines of communications areas 7 md became northern territory force and 8 md was redesignated as new guinea force in july 1942 military board s functions were assumed by commander of military forces general sir thomas blamey aif s requirements for manpower and equipment constrained militia during early years of war at outbreak of pacific war main army units in australia were five militia infantry divisions 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th divisions two militia cavalry divisions 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and aif 1st armoured division volunteer defence corps vdc which was a part time volunteer force of 100 000 men based on british home guard was also available for local defence in addition by early 1942 there were 12 000 garrison force personnel mostly reservist veterans of world war i organised into 13 garrison battalions for coastal defence and five battalions and two companies for internal security tasks including guarding prisoner of war camps yet at this time only 30 percent of militia units were on full time duty with remainder periodically undertaking three month long mobilisations militia was also poorly armed and there was insufficient equipment to be issued to all units if they were mobilised in response to japanese threat following outbreak of pacific war and capture of 8th division in malaya condition of militia became a pressing concern after largely having been ignored since 1940 several middle ranking and senior officers of aif were subsequently posted to militia units and formations to give them experience meanwhile army was forced to move units between militia divisions so that most combat ready could be sent to areas believed to be under greatest threat of attack some battalions were amalgamated and although some were later separated and reformed others were disbanded altogether after defence citizen military forces act 1943 was passed militia units were able to serve outside australian territory in south west pacific area from january 1943 though 11th brigade was only major formation to do so thumb right alt a row of open topped armoured vehicles lined up across a dirt row with their crews 13 33rd battalion s bren carrier platoon at sydney in 1943 army was considerably

three armoured divisions 1st 2nd and 3rd organised into first and second armies and i ii and iii corps as well as many support and service units in august 1942 army had a strength of 476 000 men this force proved larger than what australia s population and industry could sustain by late 1942 number of personnel who needed to be inducted each month to make good losses caused by sickness and combat was much larger than numbers who were becoming eligible for service and allocation of a high proportion of australia s limited supply of manpower to military was inhibiting expansion of munitions industry and other key sectors of economy army was also unbalanced as a large majority its personnel were employed in arms corps undertaking combat and combat support roles heavily reliant upon its allies for logistical support it required more personnel in support arms such as ordnance and transport to be functional as a self sufficient organisation this situation was most acute in 1942 at that time there were 137 236 men serving arms corps such as infantry cavalry and armour while there were just 29 079 in ordnance this imbalance was slowly addressed after 1942 as army s size was reduced most of units that were disbanded were militia arms corps units and by september 1943 aif outnumbered militia having 265 000 members compared to just over 117 000 further reductions came in october 1943 when army s strength was further reduced by 100 000 men to free up manpower to work in industry at end of 1943 army s strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades although further reductions were ordered in august 1944 and june 1945 by 1945 support arms had grown considerably as a proportion of total force and by august 1945 ordnance and electrical and mechanical engineers totalled 42 835 men while artillery had been reduced to half its previous strength infantry cavalry and armoured corps personnel numbered just 62 097 men while engineers signals and medical services remained same albeit as part of a much smaller army regardless at end of war it remained one of largest allied armies as a proportion of population being second only to soviet union vdc was also reduced in size in may 1944 and was finally disbanded on 24 august 1945 if conflict had continued past august 1945 size of army would have been further reduced to three divisions once bougainville new guinea and new britain had been secured two of these divisions would have been used on garrison duties while a brigade group may have been made available for british led operations in south east asia and remaining division was to take part in invasion of japan demands of combat during world war ii led to changes in composition of army units success of german mechanised units during invasions of poland and france convinced australian defence planners that army required armoured units and these began to be raised in 1941 when 1st armoured division was formed two militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and 3rd army tank brigade was formed to provide support to infantry these large armoured units were not suitable for jungle warfare however and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 conditions in south west pacific also led army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 reducing authorised strength of division by about 4 000 men each infantry battalion shed around 100 personnel as various support elements such as anti aircraft and carrier platoons were removed and consolidated at divisional level amount of heavy weapons and vehicles was also reduced but conditions that organisation was designed for did not recur and it proved only moderately successful as a result divisions were strengthened for their 1944 45 campaigns by returning artillery and anti tank units that had been removed creation of jungle divisions represented first time in australian army s history that it had adopted an organisation specifically for conditions in which its forces would fight previously force structure had been heavily influenced by british army and decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence yet it also resulted in adoption of a two tier force structure as formations that were not designated for jungle warfare remained on previous scales of equipment and manning ultimately while their structure was better suited to operations in australia they were no longer able to be used against japanese as a result burden of fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re organised while remainder of army was relegated to garrison duties thumb left alt a large coastal artillery gun a 9 2 inch coastal artillery emplacement at fort banks la perouse new south wales army also raised many anti aircraft and coastal defence units during war pre war coastal defences were greatly expanded from 1939 and many new batteries were built near major ports in australia and new guinea in response to threat of japanese attack australia had a limited capacity to produce anti aircraft guns and bulk of equipment had to come from britain as such development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944 army had few anti aircraft guns at outbreak of war and a high priority was given to expanding air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities by 1942 anti aircraft batteries were in place around all major cities as well as key towns in northern australia expansion of artillery in general and coastal defence and anti aircraft units in particular meant that by june 1942 some 80 000 of 406 000 members of army were artillerymen vdc units gradually took over responsibility for manning fixed coastal and anti aircraft defences as threat of attack against australian mainland receded traditionally australian army had relied on its major allies to provide logistic support primarily raising combat units rather than support arms during times of conflict consequently these services were relatively underdeveloped and they remained so during first years of war while british units provided many logistic and line of communication services for aif in north africa during early campaigns in 1940 and 1941 army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in pacific following japanese entry into war as a result growth of support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic including many capabilities which australian army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining these units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas in addition with australia s national support base located well to rear in major cities in south east of country significant expansion of army s transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to field force based in northern australia and new guinea many road transport units were raised to move supplies around australia while royal australian engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1 900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft women s services thumb right alt a group of nurses stand in front of a brick building a group of aans sisters who had previously served in

were employed in military hospitals in australia and overseas until after end of war before returning to civilian control in 1948 shortages of manpower also led to establishment of australian women s army service awas in august 1941 awas members filled a wide range of roles to allow army to redeploy male soldiers to fighting units while they mainly worked in clerical and administrative positions and auxiliary roles such as drivers and signallers many served in anti aircraft batteries operating radars and searchlights but not guns themselves while blamey sought to have members of awas posted overseas from early 1941 onwards australian government did not agree to this until 1945 as a result only about 400 of 24 000 women who joined awas served outside australia awas was reduced in size following war and was finally disbanded on 30 june 1947 colonel sybil irving commanded awas from september 1941 until 1947 in total some 35 000 women served in army making up about 5 percent of force campaigns north africa during first years of world war ii australia s military strategy was closely aligned with that of united kingdom s imperial defence policy singapore strategy which seemingly negated need for large scale land forces in pacific was a key component of this policy and consequently most australian military units that were deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to mediterranean and middle east where they formed an integral part of commonwealth forces in area three aif infantry divisions dispatched to middle east were subsequently heavily involved in fighting that followed in addition to force which was sent to north africa two aif brigades 18th and 25th were stationed in britain from june 1940 to january 1941 and formed part of british mobile reserve

counter perceived japanese threat to australia australian government agreed to requests from britain and united states to temporarily retain 9th division in middle east in exchange for deployment of additional us troops to australia and britain s support for a proposal to expand raaf to 73 squadrons government did not intend that 9th division would play a major role in active fighting and it was

sustain it and this was agreed to by british and us governments in late november 9th division left egypt for australia in january 1943 ending aif s involvement in war in north africa malaya and singapore due to emphasis placed on cooperation with britain relatively few australian military units were stationed in australia and asia pacific region after 1940 measures were taken to improve australia s defences as war with japan loomed in 1941 but these proved inadequate 8th division was subsequently dispatched to singapore in february 1941 while plans were made for a militia battalion to be stationed between port moresby and thursday island an aif battalion was also allocated to garrison rabaul and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to timor and ambon meanwhile in july

partially trained and equipped divisions in australia including 1st armoured division in keeping with singapore strategy a high proportion of australian forces in asia were concentrated in malaya during 1940 and 1941 as threat from japan increased at outbreak of war australian forces in malaya consisted of two brigade groups from 8th division 22nd and 27th brigades under command of major general gordon bennett along with four raaf squadrons and eight warships following japanese invasion on 8 december 1941 8th division and its attached indian army units was assigned responsibility for defence of johore in south of malaya as a result it did not see action until mid january 1942 when japanese spearheads first reached state having pushed back british and indian units defending

assigned crucial coastal sector and stronger australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas while commonwealth forces in johore achieved a number of local tactical victories most notably around gemas bakri and jemaluang they were unable to do more than slow japanese advance and suffered heavy casualties in doing so after being outmanoeuvred by japanese remaining commonwealth units withdrew to singapore on night of 30 31 january following this 8th division was deployed to defend singapore s north west coast due to casualties suffered in johore most of division s units were at half strength and replacements that had been received a draft of about 1 900 replacements was sent in late january were barely trained some having as little as two weeks training in australia before being dispatched assigned larger than normal frontages to defend along beaches that were ill suited for defence 22nd and 27th brigades were spread thin on ground with large gaps in their lines commander of singapore fortress lieutenant general arthur ernest percival believed that japanese would land on north east coast of island and deployed near full strength british 18th division to defend this sector nevertheless on 8 february japanese landed in australian sector and 8th division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting a subsequent landing took place at kranji but division was unable to turn this back and subsequently withdrew to centre of island after further fighting in which commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around urban area of singapore percival surrendered his forces on 15 february although some australians were able to escape following capitulation 14 972 australians were taken prisoner bennett was among those that managed to get out having left island night before surrender via sampan after handing over command of his division to brigadier cecil callaghan he later justified his actions saying that he had gained an understanding of how to defeat japanese and needed to return to australia to pass his knowledge on but two post war inquiries found that he was unjustified in leaving his command loss of almost a quarter of australia s overseas soldiers and failure of singapore strategy that had permitted it to accept sending of aif to aid britain stunned country fall of singapore raised fears of a japanese invasion of australian mainland and government became concerned about army s ability to respond although large forces in australia contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility in response most of aif was brought back from middle east and australian prime minister john curtin appealed to united states for assistance as japanese forces advanced through burma towards india in early 1942 british prime minister winston churchill attempted to divert 6th and 7th divisions while they were en route to australia but curtin refused to authorise this movement as a compromise 16th and 17th brigades of 6th division disembarked at ceylon and formed part of island s garrison until they returned to australia in august 1942 netherlands east indies and rabaul while australia s contribution to pre war plans to defend south east asia from japanese aggression was focused on defence of malaya and singapore small australian forces were also deployed to defend several islands to

reinforce it before japanese south seas force landed at rabaul on 23 january 1942 outnumbered australian force was swiftly defeated and most of survivors surrendered in weeks after battle few members of lark force survived war as at least 130 were murdered by japanese on 4 february and 1 057 australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from rabaul were killed when ship carrying them to japan

by mid 1942 army had a strength of ten infantry divisions three armoured divisions and hundreds of other units thousands of australians who were ineligible for service in military responded to threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as volunteer defence corps and volunteer air observers corps which were modelled on british home guard and royal observer corps respectively however australia s population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once threat of invasion had passed and army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 despite australian fears japanese never intended to invade australian mainland while an invasion was considered by japanese imperial general headquarters in february 1942 it was judged to be beyond japanese military s capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken instead in march 1942 japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating australia from united states by capturing port moresby in new guinea and solomon islands fiji samoa and new caledonia yet this plan was frustrated by japanese defeat in battle of coral sea and was postponed indefinitely after battle of midway while these battles ended threat to australia australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid 1943 a series of japanese air raids against northern australia occurred during 1942 and 1943 and while main defence was provided by raaf and allied fighters a number of australian army anti aircraft batteries were also involved in dealing with this threat left thumb alt a map of asia pacific

under an american commander general douglas macarthur after halting japanese allies moved onto offensive in late 1942 with pace of advance accelerating in 1943 from 1944 australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping up operations but continued to conduct large scale operations until end of war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in final months of conflict than at any other time papuan campaign japanese forces first landed on mainland of new guinea on 8 march 1942 when they invaded lae and salamaua to secure bases for defence of important base

of ioribaiwa near port moresby after several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses japanese troops were within of port moresby yet supply problems made any further advance impossible and japanese began to fear an allied counter landing at buna following reverses at hands of us forces on guadalcanal japanese imperial general headquarters decided they could not support fronts on both new guinea and guadalcanal horii was subsequently ordered to withdraw his troops on kokoda track until issue at guadalcanal was decided after this australian forces were heavily reinforced by 7th

personnel australians pursued japanese back along kokoda track in early november they had been forced into a small bridgehead on north coast of papua australian and us forces attacked japanese bridgehead in papua in late november 1942 allied force consisted of exhausted 7th division and inexperienced and ill trained us 32nd infantry division and was short of artillery and supplies due to a lack of supporting weapons and macarthur and blamey s insistence on a rapid advance allied tactics during battle were centred on infantry assaults on japanese fortifications these resulted in heavy

guinea meanwhile during fighting in 1942 43 australian army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over japanese in jungle warfare papuan campaign led to a significant reform in composition of australian army during campaign restriction banning militia personnel from serving outside of australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between aif and militia in late 1942 and early 1943 curtin overcame opposition within labor party to extending geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of south west pacific and necessary legislation was passed in january 1943 this made deploying militia easier but ultimately only one brigade 11th was dispatched outside of australian territory being deployed to merauke on south coast of dutch west papua in nei during 1943 and 1944 as part of merauke force new guinea offensives after halting japanese advance allied forces went on offensive across swpa from mid 1943 australian forces played a key role throughout this offensive which was designated operation cartwheel in particular blamey oversaw a series of highly successful operations around north east tip of new guinea which was high point of australia s experience of operational level command during war after successful defence of wau 3rd division began advancing towards salamaua in april 1943 this advance was mounted to divert

was gradually brought in to reinforce 20th brigade against expected counter attack japanese mounted a strong attack in mid october which was defeated by 9th division after heavy fighting during second half of november 9th division captured hills inland of finschhafen from well dug in japanese forces following its defeat 20th division retreated along coast with 9th division and 4th brigade in

april advance to philippines australian military s role in south west pacific decreased during 1944 as us forces took over responsibility for main allied effort in region in latter half of 1943 australian government decided with macarthur s agreement that size of military would be decreased to release manpower for war related industries which were important to supplying britain and us forces in pacific australia s main role in allied war effort from this point forward was supplying other allied countries with food materials and manufactured goods needed for defeat of japan as a result of this policy size of army was reduced from late 1943 onwards though an offensive force of six infantry divisions three aif and three militia divisions was maintained until end of war in early 1944 all but two of army s divisions were withdrawn to atherton tableland for training and rehabilitation however several new battalions of australian led papuan and new guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into pacific islands regiment these troops had earlier seen action alongside australian units throughout new guinea campaign and they largely replaced australian army battalions disbanded during year while australian government offered i corps for use in leyte and luzon nothing came of several proposals to utilise it in liberation of these islands army s prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern and many australians believed that aif should be demobilised if it could not be used for offensive operations this was politically embarrassing for government and helped motivate it to look for new areas where military could be used it also impacted upon army s morale as allies advanced further towards japan army was increasingly relegated to second string roles despite having fought above its weight for most of war mopping up in new guinea and solomons in late 1944 australian government committed twelve australian army brigades to replace six us army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in bougainville new britain and aitape wewak area in new guinea in order to free up american units for operations in philippines while us units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions their australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy remaining japanese forces in these areas value of these campaigns was controversial at time and remains so to this day as australian government authorised these operations for primarily political rather than military reasons it was believed that keeping army involved in war would give australia greater influence in any post war peace conferences and that liberating australian territories would enhance australia s influence in its region critics of these campaigns such as author peter charlton argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of lives of australian soldiers involved as japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective thumb left

supported by allied intelligence bureau division conducted amphibious landings at open bay and wide bay at base of gazelle peninsula in early 1945 and defeated small japanese garrisons in these areas by april japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in gazelle peninsula by australian force s aggressive patrolling 5th division suffered 53 fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign after war it was found that japanese force was 93 000 strong which was much higher than 38 000 which allied intelligence had estimated remained on new britain ii corps continued bougainville

garrisoned neighbouring islands and was supported by raaf royal new zealand air force and united states marine corps air units while xiv corps had maintained a defensive posture australians conducted offensive operations aimed at destroying japanese force on bougainville as japanese were split into several enclaves ii corps fought separate offensives in northern central and southern portions of island main focus was against japanese base at buin in south and offensives in north and centre of island were largely suspended from may 1945 while australian operations on bougainville continued

eighteenth army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties 6th division s advance was also hampered by supply

campaign goals of this campaign were to capture borneo s oilfields and brunei bay to support us led invasion of japan and british led liberation of malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945 australian government did not agree to macarthur s proposal to extend offensive to include liberation of java in july 1945 however and its decision not to release 6th division for this operation

landings at brunei and balikpapan while it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure tarakan and re open airstrip intensive fighting on island lasted until 19 june and airstrip was not opened until 28 june as a result operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile next phase began on 10 june when 9th division conducted simultaneous assaults in north west labuan and on coast of brunei while brunei was quickly secured japanese garrison on labuan held out for over a week after brunei bay region was secured 24th brigade was landed in north borneo and 20th brigade advanced along western coast of borneo south from brunei both brigades rapidly advanced against weak japanese resistance and most of north west borneo was liberated by end of war during campaign 9th division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against japanese forces with support of australian special forces such as z special unit third and final stage of campaign was capture of balikpapan on central east coast of borneo this operation had been opposed by blamey who believed that it was unnecessary but went ahead on orders of macarthur after a 20 day preliminary air and naval bombardment 7th division landed near town on 1 july balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 july but mopping up continued until end of war as isolated pockets of japanese resistance remained capture of balikpapan was last large scale land operation conducted by western allies during world war ii although borneo campaign was criticised in australia at time and in subsequent years as pointless or a waste of soldiers lives it did achieve a number of objectives such as increasing isolation of significant japanese forces

lieutenant general on 13 october 1939 blamey was subsequently appointed general officer commanding goc i corps following its raising in march 1940 while mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of 6th division and lavarack assumed command of newly formed 7th division next most senior regular officers all colonels included men like vernon sturdee henry wynter and john northcott all of whom had joined army before world war i these officers held senior commands throughout war but seldom active ones below them were a distinct group of regular officers graduates of royal military college duntroon which had opened in 1911 their number included frank berryman william bridgeford cyril clowes horace robertson sydney rowell and george alan vasey these officers had fought in world war i and reached rank of major but their promotion prospects were restricted and they remained majors for twenty years many left army to join british or indian armies or raaf or to return to civilian life as a group they had become embittered and resentful and determined to prove that they could lead troops in battle many regular officers had attended training courses or been on exchange with british army

menzies ordered that all commands in 6th division be given to reservists rather than regular officers who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to singapore strategy appointments therefore went to reservists like stanley savige arthur allen leslie morshead and edmund herring later other militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders distinguished records of officers like heathcote hammer ivan dougherty david whitehead victor windeyer and selwyn porter would challenge regular officers contention that they had a special claim to senior command ability at start of war majority of battalion commands went to older reservists many of whom had commanded battalions or served in first aif as war went on average age of battalion commanders declined from 42 9 years old in 1940 to 35 6 in 1945 prevalence of regular officers in senior positions also rose and in 1945 they held half of all senior appointments they remained under represented in unit commands and as in 1940 there was still only one infantry battalion commanded by a regular officer following outbreak of war with japan many senior officers with distinguished records in middle east were recalled to australia to lead militia formations and fill important staff posts as army expanded following year though army reached its greatest extent after which it shrank in size with a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than required blamey faced public and political criticism after he shelved several senior officers career prospects of junior officer were also affected particularly in infantry of 52 officers promoted to substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in last six months of 1944 only five were infantrymen while two were engineers and 45 were from supporting arms meanwhile return of aif divisions to australia from middle east in 1942 coincided with arrival of large numbers of american troops including us 32nd and 41st

amf in march following his promotion to general setting up land headquarters to subsume role of military board which was suspended on 30 july as commander in chief amf he reported directly to macarthur and was subsequently also given command of allied land forces in theatre yet although australian forces made up bulk of allied forces in swpa until 1944 in practice for political reasons

equipment from australia united states and some other countries was introduced into service in war s later years pre war defence policies favoured ran which received majority of defence spending in interwar period result was that when war came in 1939 army s equipment was of world war i vintage and australian factories were only capable of producing small arms most equipment was obsolescent and had to be replaced and new factories were required to produce latest weapons equipment and motor vehicles some 2 860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for militia and another 784 for 6th division but since a division s war establishment was around 3 000 this was only enough for training in february 1940 treasury urged war cabinet to slow orders of motor

later also medium machine gun platoons within infantry battalions bren gun replaced lewis gun as standard automatic rifle in early years of war and within infantry battalions was utilised at section

which began coming off assembly lines in australia in july 1942 in turn it was replaced in 1944 by 17 pounder which was manufactured at maribyrnong ordnance factory anti aircraft artillery were equipped with swedish designed bofors 40 mm gun which was manufactured in australia and british 3 7 inch anti aircraft gun medium artillery included american 155 mm long tom and british 5 5 inch gun

to approve manufacture of sentinel tank in 1940 some 66 of them were delivered by time manufacture ceased in july 1943 but none were used in action otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas a quantity of m3 stuart light tanks were received in september 1941 while first shipment of british matilda ii tanks arrived in july 1942 and these proved to be most suitable type for jungle warfare a flame thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in borneo campaign most numerous tank used by australian army was m3 lee several hundred of these equipped armoured divisions but unlike stuarts and matildas they did not see action an australian scout car known as dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of canadian armoured car became available in 1944 australian army also operated some amphibious tractors australian army developed its own landing craft development of an australian version of landing craft assault alcv australian landing craft vehicle was carried out by army personnel working alongside ford motor company prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on brisbane river initial version known as alcv i was found to be too small so larger 12 metre alcv ii was developed an australian version of landing craft mechanized alcm was also developed and manufactured by ford in brisbane and later at geelong operational experience demonstrated need for larger landing craft so alcv iii an enlarged version of alcm ii with four ford v8 engines and twice cargo capacity was produced army also ordered 15 alcm iiis a type of similar capacity to an american landing craft tank with five ford v8 engines only four were delivered before end of war but they arrived in time to see service in new guinea by 1945 due to a shrinking number of operational units and stepped up production equipment shortages were a thing of past indeed army had more equipment that it actually needed for example a total of 368 25 pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1 516 on hand additionally a total of 530 2 pounder and 6 pounder anti tank guns were required but army had 1 941 while 68 3 7 inch anti aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training but there were 640 pieces available similar surpluses existed with small arms such as bren of which 9 438 were required but there were 21 139 in system situation in relation to bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of 3 767 vehicles actually being required due to decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare training and doctrine thumb right alt soldiers with rifles and sub machine guns man a defensive line three infantrymen of 2 6th battalion training in watsonville area of north queensland in april 1944 australian army s pre war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a european environment this doctrine and supporting training manuals were common to those of all commonwealth countries following outbreak of war army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in europe and north africa by far single greatest difficulty in training in early war years was shortage of equipment however there were also critical shortages of instructors decision to form 1st armoured division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel but there were few officers and men with required skills in small pre war army and many of them were already serving in aif s divisional mechanised cavalry regiments an armoured fighting vehicles school was created at puckapunyal victoria in 1941 and in march 1943 armoured corps training centre was moved there another problem for militia was a lack of continuity in training when war began men were called up for only one month s additional training this was then increased to three months additional training in 1940 41 officers and non commissioned officers were intensively trained for 18 to 24 days after which there was a camp for 70 days meanwhile soldiers who had been through 90 day training regimen in 1939 40 were given 12 days additional training while those who had not completed this training undertook 70 days this allowed for individual training but prevented proper unit training in july 1941 fully trained soldiers who had completed 90 days training became liable for three months additional training per year while new recruits were liable for six months at same time war cabinet provided for more intensive training for full time cadre of militia units which were not to exceed 25 percent of unit s strength training for militia and vdc was also hampered in early war years by a lack of small arms particularly after dunkirk evacuation when australia dispatched its reserve stock of rifles to britain in an effort to help replace equipment lost by british army amidst concerns of an invasion of united kingdom after fall of france although army s focus was on conventional warfare in late 1940 lieutenant colonel j c mawhood a british officer arrived in australia with a small specialist staff to conduct training in unconventional warfare a school known as no 7 infantry training centre was opened at wilsons promontory victoria which was described as an isolated area of high rugged and heavily timbered mountains precipitous valleys swiftly running streams and swamps 1st 2nd and 3rd independent companies and a nucleus of 4th were raised by october 1941 when training was discontinued after outbreak of war with japan school was reopened as guerrilla warfare school training of fourth company was completed these independent companies were later redesignated as commando squadrons of which twelve were eventually raised including 1st which had been destroyed early in war as war progressed they were used more in flank protection and reconnaissance roles than for unconventional warfare australian army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1942 some lessons were passed on by officers who escaped from malaya and singapore however and these were incorporated into a training memorandum in may that year aif units that returned from north africa undertook some training in jungle tactics before going into action but militia units which initially faced japanese in new guinea suffered from inadequate training and this led to them suffering heavy casualties in order to be able to move troops to front in new guinea more rapidly to acclimatise them during process and to allow more realistic training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria free terrain blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on atherton tableland in november 1942 eventually accommodation was provided there for 70 000 troops as divisions returned from tours of duty in new guinea in 1943 and 1944 they were sent to atherton for anti malaria treatment men then went on leave after which they returned to atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again in early 1943 army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting pre war field service regulations to meet conditions in south west pacific army s front line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with this doctrine during year a jungle warfare school was opened at canungra queensland in november 1942 and all reinforcements for combat units subsequently passed through school before joining their unit canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre an independent company training centre and a tactical school with establishment of canungra independent company training centre on wilsons promontory was closed thumb left alt soldiers running up a beach from ocean troops and landing craft crews training at hmas

nelson bay adjacent to port stephens new south wales as a central establishment for training staffs beach parties and small boat crews in july 1942 a combined training school was established at bribie island queensland and nearby toorbul point for army units during 1943 and 1944 combined training with raaf and ran was also carried out at trinity beach near cairns in preparation for amphibious operations in south west pacific as allies advanced australian army began training paratroops in december 1942 as an offshoot of training of independent companies 1st parachute battalion was subsequently formed in march 1943 it reached full strength by january 1944 but although it was warned for action a number of times including possible rescue of prisoners of war held at sandakan in 1945 it did not see any fighting after war it participated in reoccupation of singapore by 1945 army possessed a comprehensive schools system with 40 schools of various kinds between 1942 and 1945 96 000 training courses were conducted soldiers who were selected to become officers were trained at various officer cadet training units around country and by end of war these units had produced 7 887 officers meanwhile regular officers of pmf continued to be trained at royal military college duntroon with a number of shortened courses of between six months and a years duration being run unlike first aif newly commissioned lieutenants were not sent back to their original unit but were posted to first vacancy other schools included school of artillery guerrilla warfare school cooking and catering school school of military law and school of movement and transport recruit training was now thorough and exacting and for infantrymen culminated in a jungle training course at canungra where jungle warfare school turned out 4 000 reinforcements a month in 1945 29th brigade received 1 000 young reinforcements shortly before embarking for torokina but their commander later remarked that their training at canungra had been so thorough that they reacted with almost miraculous quickness to conditions of battle prisoners of war thumb right alt four malnourished shirtless men sit against

captured during retreat from cyrenaica in early 1941 siege of tobruk or fighting near el alamein in mid 1942 like other western allied pows australians were held in permanent camps in italy and germany and were generally treated in accordance with geneva conventions as war neared its end germans moved many prisoners towards interior of country to prevent them from being liberated by advancing allied armies these movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths as war drew to a close a unit designated aif reception group united kingdom was established near eastbourne in england to provide accommodation and support for pows once they were released by august 1945 all former australian pows in europe had embarked on ships bound for australia while australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in german and italian captivity than their counterparts in world war i it was much lower than rate suffered under japanese internment more than 21 000 members of aif were captured by japanese during first months of 1942 most of these men were members of 8th division captured at singapore nei and rabaul but about 2 000 members of i corps party sent to java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there throughout captivity these pows were treated harshly resulting in a high death rate australians were held in camps across asia pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships while most of australian pows who died in japanese captivity were victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease hundreds were murdered by their guards burma thai railway was most notorious of prisoner of war experiences as 13 000 australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other allied pows and asians conscripted by japanese nearly 2 650 australians died there thousands of australian pows were also sent to japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions pows held in camps at ambon and borneo suffered highest death rates 77 percent of those at ambon died and few of 2 500 australian and british prisoners in borneo survived almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945 overall only 14 000 of australian prisoners taken by japanese survived captivity majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease treatment of pows prompted many australians to remain hostile towards japan after war australian authorities investigated abuses against allied pows in their country s zone of responsibility after war and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by australian administered war crimes trials demobilisation process of demobilisation began immediately after end of hostilities although it had partially commenced as early as 1943 at end of war strength of australian army was 398 594 men approximately half of which were serving overseas in south west pacific area demobilisation plan was put into action on 16 august 1945 day after japan surrendered undertaken in four phases it was finally completed on 15 february 1947 by which time a total of 349 964 soldiers had been discharged although process largely proceeded smoothly many soldiers felt it was too slow and there was widespread dissatisfaction among men continuing to serve in south west pacific after war ended speed of demobilisation was hampered by requirement to continue to maintain security in areas still occupied lack of sufficient shipping administrative workload entailed and limited facilities for use for demobilisation process although second aif was not disbanded until 30 june 1947 a temporary organisation known as interim army was established at end of war and included all members of army on full time duty meanwhile in a departure from previous defence policy australian government decided that a small peacetime regular force was to be raised to provide a trained full time force capable of being deployed either in australia or overseas in a national emergency and australian regular army was subsequently established on 30 september 1947 militia under guise of citizen military forces was re established on 1 july 1948 to provide a part time volunteer force which would be able to provide basis for expansion in wartime casualties thumb right alt soldiers in
