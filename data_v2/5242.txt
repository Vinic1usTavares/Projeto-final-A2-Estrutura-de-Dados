role of garrett a master thief trained by a secret society who while carrying out a series of robberies becomes embroiled in a complex plot that ultimately sees him attempting to prevent a great power from unleashing chaos on world thief was first pc stealth game to use light and sound as game mechanics and combined complex artificial intelligence with simulation systems to allow for emergent gameplay game is notable for its use of first person perspective for non confrontational gameplay which challenged first person shooter market and led developers to call it a first person sneaker while it also had influences in later stealth games such as tom clancy s splinter cell and hitman game received critical acclaim and has been placed on numerous hall of fame lists achieving sales of half a million units by 2000 making it looking glass most commercially successful game it is regarded as one of greatest video games of all time and helped popularize stealth genre thief was followed by an expanded edition entitled thief gold 1999 which modified certain missions and included a few brand new levels two sequels thief ii metal age 2000 and thief deadly shadows 2004 and a reboot of series thief 2014 thief was one of two games in series that looking glass worked on before it was forced to close gameplay left thumb alt a long darkened stone hallway with a light at far end against which a figure is silhouetted carpet is placed down middle of black and white tiled floor and a black object protrudes from bottom right corner of image game s emphasis on stealth means that players must plan their moves carefully and use their environment to get around hostile enemies or in some cases take them out using their equipment such as blackjack thief takes place from a first person perspective in a 3d environment with game s story taking place over a series of missions in which player character is able to perform various actions such as leaning crouching swimming climbing running and fighting amongst other abilities levels are largely unscripted and maze like and allow for emergent gameplay while non player characters npcs may either remain stationary or walk about on a patrol route players have freedom to choose how to get around them and obstacles in a level s environments in order to complete specific tasks such as getting through a locked door in each level player is given a set of objectives to complete such as stealing a specific object which they must complete in order to progress to next level player can choose to play on one of three difficulty settings before starting a level which they can change between missions with higher difficulties adding additional objectives such as not killing human npcs or stealing a certain amount of loot from amount available in a level changing amount of health player character has and changing how sensitive a npc is to their environment in some missions players may find objectives being changed or new ones being added due to certain circumstances they encounter while failing a key objective or dying will fail a level forcing a player to either replay it or load up a previous save as game s emphasis is on stealth players are encouraged to focus on concealment evasion distraction misdirection and subtle takedowns rather than on outright confrontation player s character can engage in sword based combat when need arises and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances to do so players must remain aware of their surroundings to assist them in remaining hidden a special meter on heads up display hud in form of a gem helps to indicates player s visibility to npcs brighter it is more easily they can be visually detected thus sticking to dark shady spots where gem dims ensures player is hidden though npcs can still find them if they get to close in front of them to remain quiet players must be careful of how much noise they produce as well as what surfaces they are moving over walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass is preferable as footsteps remain quiet compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles which produce a lot of noise npcs also produce noise either from whistling or walking about for example which can help players determine how far they are to their own position noise can be used by player to mislead distract npcs such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere game s npcs feature artificial intelligence ai systems that detect unscripted visual and aural cues if an npc sees or hears something out of place it will react to this depending on level of its suspicions if for a brief second they will simply ignore it but if for long enough they will become alert to their surroundings and begin searching area npcs will react to things such as clashing swords or reaction in other npcs voices as well as to visual changes to their environment such as blood stains opened doors and fallen bodies players can avoid leaving visual clues by cleaning them up such as hiding bodies npcs are divided between three categories guards servants and non human whose reactions vary guards will call out an alert if they spot player and attack them servants will run for help if they spot player or a body non human npcs will merely pursue and attack player if a guard is significantly injured he will try to escape and find help some non human npcs will merely flee non human characters range from giant spiders feral creatures to zombies and ghosts with certain levels containing survival horror elements to assist them on each level player character carries with them a few pieces of equipment a blackjack which can incapacitate humanoid npcs a sword which can kill npcs and a bow which can be used for ranged combat as well as a tool players can use a variety of arrows with their bow each varying in properties for example water arrows can be used to douse torches and any other source of fire as well as clean up blood stains rope arrows can attach a climbable rope to wooden surfaces moss arrows can cover an area with moss that muffles footsteps and fire arrows can relight torches and do considerable damage to npcs other tools are also available including which can stun npcs for a brief few moments and potions player can cycle through inventories for weapons arrows and tools through hud in addition players can purchase additional arrows and tools between levels with loot they have acquired both loot and remaining items do not roll over between missions and find additional items during a level players can also find books and scrolls that can contain information on in game lore or useful clues to get around an obstacle in a level as well as food that can be eaten and keys that can unlock doors and chests crates plot setting thief takes place in a metropolis called city which has been noted to contain elements of middle ages like dark fantasy and industrial revolution project director greg lopiccolo said in an early preview in essence it s this undefined medieval age sort of medieval europe meets brazil meets city of lost children there s some electricity some magic and some 19th century machinery kind of stuff setting has been described as steampunk a fantastical setting where steam engine technology is prominently used during levels player may learn about setting by finding notes and overhearing conversations it has been noted that player participates in revelation of thiefs setting city contains three factions keepers and two opposing religious orders known as pagans and order of hammer or hammerites latter two have been cited as representations of chaos and order respectively neutral secretive keepers strive to maintain balance within city hammerites worship a deity called builder and believe in progress craftsmanship and righteousness pagans who have been described as primitive almost animalistic worship dangerous trickster god and value natural world it has been assessed that design of each group s architecture reflects their beliefs story game s prologue sees garrett protagonist describing his youth as a homeless orphan on city s streets he is caught while attempting to pickpocket a suspicious man who reveals himself to be a keeper impressed by garrett s ability to see him he offers him chance to join his order garrett accepts but later leaves order to pursue a life of thievery years later garrett works as a thief and is under pressure to join a crime ring as punishment for his failure to pay a protection fee he is targeted for assassination by crime lord ramirez garrett evades assassins and robs ramirez s mansion in retaliation following this he is approached by a woman named viktoria representative of an anonymous client who was impressed by garrett s theft from ramirez he is contracted to steal a sword from constantine an eccentric nobleman who recently arrived in city after garrett completes mission viktoria takes him to constantine who explains that he hired garrett to steal his own sword as a test constantine offers him a fortune to steal eye a gem kept within a sealed and deserted hammerite cathedral to reach cathedral garrett ventures through old quarter a haunted abandoned district of city through an opening in cathedral eye informs garrett of a nearby keeper sanctuary where he may learn how to unseal cathedral there garrett discovers that cathedral was sealed to prevent city s destruction by trickster he learns that there are four talismans needed to remove seal two hidden in ancient ruins beneath city and two inside a hammerite temple in thief gold one talisman is in possession of mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from caves below while other two are in lost city and hammerite temple as in original game garrett recovers talismans and returns to cathedral after unsealing cathedral he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by eye he returns eye to constantine who reveals himself to be trickster viktoria says that eye requires a flesh eye to function she binds garrett with vines and removes his right eye trickster places it on gemstone and two disappear through a portal garrett left for dead is found and freed by two keepers during his escape from trickster s mansion he learns that trickster plans to use eye to revert world to a wild state after garrett escapes mansion he seeks help from order of hammer however he finds that trickster has attacked hammerite temple in a refuge beneath temple he finds hammerite survivors who provide him with a booby trapped replica of eye garrett descends into trickster s domain where he finds trickster performing a ritual with eye to complete his plan garrett stealthily substitutes eye with its copy which kills trickster later garrett has acquired a mechanical replacement for his lost eye on streets of city a keeper approaches garrett and claims that he will soon require keepers help garrett dismisses him and as he walks away keeper warns of encroaching metal age development origins thief began development in april 1996 for game s original designer and writer ken levine credited by telegraph as a key figure in creation of thief lewis denby bioshock infinite interview ken levine telegraph 03 nov 2011 inspirations came from two of his favourite games castle wolfenstein and diablo dan ryckert things you didn t know about ken levine com may 30 2012 initial concept was to make an action role playing game and levine was given job of designing game s world and story levine said initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into dark camelot before eventually evolving into dark project included school of wizards dark elves must die and better red than undead latter of which was a campy story about communist zombies game was supposed to be a first person sword fighting simulator but marketing department killed idea to his disappointment according to programmer marc leblanc first proposal was better red than undead a 50s cold war game where soviet union is overrun with zombies and you have to go hack them to pieces as loner from cia because bullets don t work on undead doug church said game s design was built around idea of having factions who you could ally with or oppose yourself with or do things for or not rouse r game design theory and practice 2005 chapter 26 interview doug church dark camelot next concept dark camelot still focused on sword combat its plot an inversion of arthurian legend featured mordred as a misunderstood hero king arthur as a tyrannical villain and merlin as a psychopath according to church game featured morgan le fay as mordred s sort of good advisor and guinevere as a lesbian who would betray lancelot and help mordred to break into camelot and steal holy grail game s design combined a first person perspective with action role playing and adventure elements warren spector who had recently left origin systems to found looking glass studios austin became dark camelots producer after his predecessor departed artist dan said for a good long time we had no idea what game was about until somebody stumbled upon whole thief game play where you re not just running out trying to chop people up vault network news week of february 7 1999 church recalled that basic stealth model was having guard looking other way and you going past pretty quickly so paul had been pushing for a while that thief side of it was really interesting part and why not you just do a thief game a previously unreleased trailer for dark camelot and its stargate engine was uploaded to youtube in 2013 craig pearson pre thief dark camelot footage rock paper shotgun may 17th 2013 production in early 1997 dark camelots name was tentatively changed to dark project and its design altered to focus on thievery and stealth nevertheless some levels originally designed for dark camelot ended up in final product in march project director greg lopiccolo described game s design essentially we re building a type of simulator where object interactions are correct and physics are tied in correctly then lead designer jeff reiterated goal is for everything to behave as it should for example things that burn will burn and then it s up to player to decide to burn things whether or not we ve anticipated it first draft of stealth design was presented by levine and dorian hart on april 4 levine said inspiration for idea of being powerful when undetected but very vulnerable when exposed came from concept of submarine warfare and in particular from 1985 simulation video game silent service multiplayer support was planned including mode where small teams of thieves compete under time pressure to steal greatest value of swag from territory of wealthy npc s and their guard full scale development on dark project began in may 1997 with a frantic work on a demo level and trailer for e3 1997 originally announced to come out in summer 1997 game was delayed to winter 1997 98 however looking glass studios experienced serious financial trouble as development progressed into mid 1997 company s austin branch closed costing spector and several game engine programmers this team relocated to ion storm and released deus ex in 2000 spector later called his impact on thief at best minimal levine too had left dark project project before keepers factions was added to game by april 18 looking glass studios laid off half of its entire staff in six months which damaged morale of dark project team which at this point was vastly different from one with which development began few emotions can compare to stress of heading to work not knowing who might be laid off including yourself or whether doors would be locked when you got there lead programmer tom leonard later said this stress caused several team members to voluntarily quit including lead programmer briscoe rogers who had designed game s ai system which suffered from software bugs and problems with complexity when leonard took over position of lead programmer he believed that ai system was over several months he learned that pathfinding database code that helps ai navigate a map was unsalvageable he completed design but not implementation of a new system by november 1997 using an estimated one fifth of original code several features were removed during development among them multiplayer support a complex inventory interface and branching mission structures leonard said they focused in on creating a single player linear mission based game centered exclusively around stealth he believed that removal of multiplayer support and game s renaming from dark project to thief dark project solidified this in minds of team game was renamed on april 3 1998 new title being much more descriptive and inspired by that of role playing game vampire masquerade several features have been brainstormed and rejected including spider man esque ability to climb on walls and ceilings and shrinking and invisibility potions by summer 1998 team was challenged by exhaustion and game s numerous simulation and ai glitches these problems resulted in what leonard later described as a game that could not be called fun implementation of leonard s new ai system was halted so team could quickly assemble proof of concept demos publisher eidos interactive had grown skeptical over team s vision work on ai did not resume until march 1998 and after 12 more weeks of constant work it was ready for what leonard called real testing three months before game s scheduled ship date most problems had been resolved team began to believe as leonard described that thief did not stink and might actually be fun further release of games like commandos behind enemy lines half life and metal gear solid eased worries that experimental gameplay styles were unmarketable according to leonard a new energy revitalized team long hours driven by passion and measured confidence marked closing months of project game went gold in november 1998 following an estimated 2 5 year development cycle and a 3 million budget design design of thief focused on stealth and evasion from a first person perspective leonard said this idea challenged standard first person shooter concept it is a game style that many observers were concerned might not appeal to players and even those intimately involved with game had doubts at times in response to sentiment that their previous games required a fair amount of investment from player to get maximal enjoyment team specifically designed thief to allow players to pick it up and start playing while team s goal was to push envelope with game s design church said that it shared its core design with previous looking glass studios games he explained we try to provide a range of player capability in a world where player can choose their own goals and their own approaches to an obstacle so that when they reach goal it is far more satisfying and that flexible simulation of game elements is a powerful way to enable player to make their own way in world thief was designed to be largely unscripted events instead of being pre defined by designers occur naturally intent was to further increase amount of player interaction and improvisation over their previous games according to leonard thief s central gameplay mechanic was player s relationship with npcs who are primary obstacle in game game s goal of emergent events required a sophisticated ai system leonard later demonstrated that first person shooters like half life often utilize look and listen ai systems wherein npcs become aggressive when player is seen or heard he explained that thief system defined a broader range of internal states a npc could feel such as suspicion for example a npc who heard a suspicious noise would investigate rather than become immediately hostile designer randy smith said in thief safe boundary is often between light and shadow but these boundaries are not stable or secure player will eventually have to emerge from safe zone and embrace risk until another safe boundary can be found he explained that players felt unsafe even when hidden but learned to judge their level of safety as they improved certain levels included horror elements and one such mission return to cathedral intentionally removes players ability to judge their vulnerability believing that nothing augments fear associated with boundaries like forcing player to violate them of their own free will smith said of mission eventually you force yourself to do practically every scary thing you noticed potential to do in whole level kieron gillen of pc gamer uk believed that level creates a cycle of relaxation and abhorrence that results in a devastating pummelling of nerve endings game s missions were designed to suit story rather than story to fit missions making of thief ii featurette thief gold taking inspiration from goldeneye 007 team added a difficulty system that changes mission objectives leonard said it allowed designers to create a very different experience at each level of difficulty without changing overall geometry and structure of a mission this gave game a high degree of replayability at a minimum development cost team extended concept by decreasing player s ability to kill human characters on higher difficulty settings writer and voice actress terri brosius said we took pains to make sure all missions could be won without killing any humans project director greg lopiccolo wanted thiefs audio to both enrich environment and enhance gameplay and game s design necessitated an advanced sound system designers created a room database for every mission these provided a realistic representation of sound wave propagation audio designer eric brosius and development team gave sound multiple roles it was used to give player aural clues about npcs locations and internal states to enhance this vocals were recorded for npcs conversely sounds generated by objects gave clues to npcs about player s location and npcs used sound to communicate a guard s call for help signals other guards within earshot sound was also used to divulge narrative information so that stealthy players could eavesdrop on npc conversations and learn more about game s backstory was developed with dark engine a proprietary game engine it was written during game s development rather than as a separately budgeted project which led to time constraint issues an emphasis was placed on simulating real life physics arrows would arc through air rather than fly straight engine features alpha blending texture filtering and lighting techniques motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation engine s renderer which draws graphics was largely written by looking glass studios programmer sean barrett in fall 1995 while renderer was expected to be finished before game s release date barrett left company in 1996 he later performed contract work for company and assisted in writing features like hardware support however renderer was never fully addressed and was less advanced than others of time dark engine was designed to be reusable and to give programmers ability to easily integrate their work leblanc wrote dark object system which became center of this concept according to leonard object system was a general database for managing individual objects in a simulation designers were able to alter game s behavior by manipulating objects content that composes game without writing additional code system also managed source data game s tangible content such as textures maps models and sounds an unfinished build of dark engine was used to develop system shock 2 a collaboration between looking glass and irrational games object system worked so well that thief and system shock 2 used same executable for most of their development was released by eidos interactive on december 1 1998 an expanded edition of game thief gold was released by looking glass and eidos on october 29 1999 it features three new missions and improvements to original 12 its disc also contains a level editor and a making of thief ii metal age video among other extras reception sales in united states thief dark project sold 88 101 units during 1999 its global sales reached 500 000 copies by may 2000 making it looking glass studios most commercially successful game according to boston globe critical dark project received critical acclaim from sources including washington post pc gamer and salon com lance a larka of computer gaming world wrote if you re tired of doom clones and hungry for challenge give this fresh perspective game a try i was pleasantly surprised emil pagliarulo of adrenaline vault wrote i will tell you without reservation that this has become my favorite game of all time paul presley of pc zone called it a bloody good game kieron gillen of pc gamer uk wrote freedom thief offers you is at first terrifying then absolutely intoxicating aaron curtiss of los angeles times noted that game demands thought t liam mcdonald of pc gamer us called thief a challenging riveting game that defies easy categorization and praised game for its focus on player s cunning jason cross of computer games strategy plus noted that it s quite amazing how much fun it can be to avoid action chan chun of new straits times described game as being incredibly immersive and suspenseful and a highly recommended game for those yearning to be a night rogue peter of gamepro praised game s ai and said that game gets better more time you spend with it in a retrospective review allgame editor peter praised game touting that game s first rate storyline as well as visual and audio effects make thief quite an immersive gaming experience game s sound was widely praised presley wrote sound adds a whole new level of realism to game and boosts that whole total immersion thing to previously unattained levels larka noted that audio is simply amazing with directional noises and haunting background effects you are plunged into garrett s shadowy world and left with a pounding heart and twitchy nerves wagner james au of salon com noted that game s level of suspense was exquisite and that its use of detailed aural cues as a gameplay device bordered on virtual reality thief s graphics received a mixed reaction with several negative comparisons to half life and unreal however andrew sanchez of maximum pc praised game s graphics and noted that dark engine went feature for feature with lithtech quake and unreal engines he also praised game s ai sound and plot larka disliked game s extremely dark areas which required him to max out gamma correction and set his monitor to its brightest setting just to see barest details but called graphics seamless some reviews complained about collision detection issues game s use of supernatural and cave exploring elements received criticism and several reviewers opined that more realistic mansion robbing missions should have been used instead presley believed that game s undead enemies caused game to degenerate into standard hack n slash sub conan sort of thing that heretic and a million others gave us and that it amounts to an erosion of storytelling skills that looking glass once had gillen decried certain levels for ing on tomb raider territory and then not quite pull ing it off larka found certain levels too difficult next generation noted that while sneaking can get repetitive thief is still a fun game to play and a worthy addition to genre was first 3d stealth game for a personal computer and its stealth gameplay innovations influenced later games in genre game has been cited as first to use light and shadow as a stealth mechanic and first to use audio cues such as ability to eavesdrop on conversations and alert guards with loud footsteps game s use of sound wave propagation which allowed sounds to travel around corners and through rooms became widely considered by game developers thief s influence has been recognized in other stealth games such as assassin s creed hitman splinter cell and tenchu marc laidlaw writer and designer on half life said that thief is single most terrifying immersive and rewarding game i have played and one single player game i continue to replay there are countless books i wish i had written thief is one of few games i wish i had worked on laidlaw called thief his favorite game an opinion shared by fallout 3 lead designer emil pagliarulo and michel sabbagh of bethesda softworks thief dark project has been declared one of greatest games of all time by several publications inducting it into its hall of fame gamespy writer rich carlson wrote with a tactical philosophy contrary to nearly every first person shooter action game at that time thief rewarded stealth and sneaking over brazen frontal assault continuing while inadvertently undermining notion that all action games need be shooters it carved a completely new niche in same already genre gamespot editor greg kasavin argued that while metal gear solid tenchu stealth assassins and thief all defined stealth action genre it was thief that displayed purest depiction of what it might be like to slip from shadow to shadow and largely remains an unsurpassed achievement in gaming in 2009 thief was added to ign s hall of fame sid shuman writing for gamepro asserted that thief pioneered its own genre stealth action title john walker of eurogamer wrote in a retrospective review thief is an embarrassment to modern stealth games each of which produces only a faded parody of this masterful original in 2012 mike fahey of kotaku called thief best stealth game i ve ever played superior to modern games in genre that same year time named it one of 100 greatest video games of all time thief dark project was followed by two sequels and a
