musical trends by internet outlets rather than geographic location pirnia wrote in 2010 quoting palomo whereas musical movements were once determined by a city or venue where bands congregated now it s just a blogger or some journalist that can find three or four random bands around country and tie together a few commonalities between them and call it a genre style and milieu precursors chillwave

pink s albums are zany personal largely rock based and dressed in awkward glam genre s flourishing between 2008 and 2009 was prefigured by 2007 album person pitch by animal collective s noah lennox which is credited with launching style album influenced a wide range of subsequent indie music with its sound serving as major inspiration for chillwave and a number of animal collective s music also contributed to movement their album merriweather post pavilion released in january 2009 was particularly influential for its ambient sounds and repetitive melodies but was not as tightly associated with hazy psychedelia that chillwave would be identified with according to tom hawking chillwave acts extrapolated sort of ill defined pastoral nostalgia from animal collective s early work and spun it into an entire genre however animal collective were never really part of that scene such as it was they were more like its spiritual overlords summer of chillwave 2009 summer of chillwave was marked by an inundation of artists with names and song titles referencing summertime beach or surfing songs were generally of low to moderate tempo and incorporated vintage analog instrumentation that evoked popular music of late 1970s and early 1980s initially chillwave tag was subsumed under glo fi and hypnagogic pop labels journalist david keenan coined hypnagogic pop a few weeks after chillwave was invented to describe a trend of 2000s lo fi and post noise music in which varied artists began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia childhood memory and outdated recording technology while chillwave and hypnagogic pop both evoke 1980s 90s imagery chillwave has a more commercial sound that emphasizes cheesy hooks and reverb effects neon indian alan palomo washed out ernest greene and toro y moi chaz bundick were considered to be vanguard of chillwave movement all three were one man acts from southern u s while greene and bundick were acquaintances and collaborators greene s

dubbed bundick godfather of chillwave although it had no specific geographical chillwave was concentrated in south and east coast of us with brooklyn new york figuring most prominently hawking notes that fact this was such beach centric music makes it interesting chillwave also strikes me as hugely middle class music whereas punk reacted with anger and a desire for change chillwave was sound of escapism and resignation it s surely no coincidence that chillwave s rise coincided with aftermath of 2007 sub prime economic meltdown eric grandy of stranger said that genre s practitioners shared a kind of fond nostalgia for some vague idealized childhood its posture is a sonic shoulder shrug a languorous musical another attempt at identifying common threads of scene was offered by jon pareles in new york times they re solo acts or minimal bands often with a laptop at their core and they trade on memories of electropop from 1980s with bouncing blipping dance music hooks and often weaker lead voices it s recession era music low budget and danceable in november 2009 pitchfork ran an editorial feature on summer of chillwave beach boys brian wilson who had been compared to animal collective was mentioned as a looming figure throughout that summer s indie music an unnamed editor argued that similarities were more abstract than musical and that wilson s influence stems from his legend as an emotionally fragile dude with mental health problems who coped by taking drugs summertime now is about disorientation should have taken acid with you sun was high and so am i you take fantasy of his music cars sand surf add a dollop of melancholy and a smudge of druggy haze and you have some good music for being alone in a room with only a computer to keep you company vultures frank guan writes that evocation of summer is not as a season of deprivation and loss of control but as a summer spent in suburban quiet and prosperity chilling indoors alone with central a c watching daytime tv or listening to music vaporwave vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music that originated as an ironic variant of chillwave it was loosely derived from work of hypnagogic artists such as ariel pink and james ferraro which was characterized by invocation of retro popular culture as well as analog nostalgia of chillwave scene amplifying experimental tendencies of hypnagogic pop vaporwave is cleanly produced and composed almost entirely from samples early incarnations of genre relied on sources such as smooth jazz retro elevator music r b and dance music from 1980s and 1990s along with application of slowed down chopped and screwed techniques looping and other effects one of its many descriptions that were levied by online forums was chillwave for marxists as it is often associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and popular culture vaporwave found wider appeal over middle of 2012 building an audience on sites like last fm reddit and 4chan a wealth of its own subgenres and offshoots some of which deliberately gesture at genre s non seriousness soon followed criticism and decline thumb right chaz bundick toro y moi pictured in 2012 felt that chillwave did its thing and once it became a thing people stopped caring about it even artists making it chillwave reached its peak in mid 2010 same year it was received with widespread criticism some of common descriptors used for music in reviews or blog posts became cliches including soundscapes dreamy lush glowing and sun kissed village voices christopher weingarten remarked in december 2009 that 90 percent of writing about glo fi mentions summer in some fashion and summer s been over for like four months now one unnamed pitchfork writer opined this music isn t easy to write about it takes a lot of work to get past soundtrack to summer and makes me want to hit beach so much of this summer obsessed lo fi is about atmosphere and feel that it can seem weird to scrutinize it george mcintire of san francisco bay guardian described chillwave s origin as in throes of blogosphere and called term a cheap slap on label used to describe grainy dancey lo fi 1980s inspired music and a disservice to any band associated with it in 2011 carles said it was ridiculous that any sort of press took it seriously and that although bands he spoke to get annoyed by tag they understand that it s been a good thing what about itunes making it an official genre it s now theoretically a marketable indie sound chillwave scene ultimately withered and died one major reason was a sudden oversaturation of artists which came as a consequence of its simple production process writing in new times broward palm beach reed fischer referred to pitchforks negative review of s perfectly fine album replicants 2011 as a declaration of genre s demise dave schilling argued that term was created to reveal how arbitrary and meaningless existing labels such as shoegaze and dream pop were he explained that chillwave was a parody of a scene both a defining moment for music blogosphere and last gasp sites like gorilla vs bear and pitchfork bought into it for a while and sincere think pieces in traditional media publications like wall street journal asked is chillwave next big music trend it never could have been a proper trend because it was transparently manufactured majority consensus was that chillwave was a fabricated non genre in 2016 palomo described labels like chillwave and vaporwave as arbitrary and that he couldn t have been more happy about chillwave descriptor falling out of favor toro y moi s chaz bundick publicly expressed ambivalence toward genre saying i like fact that i m associated with it it s cool not a lot of artists get a chance to be a part of some sort of movement so i guess in a way i m super flattered to be considered a part of that in 2015 fitzmaurice reflected that holy of washed out toro y moi and neon indian had maintained their careers in spite of genre s decline tom hawking predicted that chillwave era will most likely be a footnote to musical history a faint flaring of middle class angst in a frightening time for everyone but that doesn t mean it s not worth examining regardless because its simple existence says far more about a generation than music itself ever did list of artists references bibliography external links category 2009
