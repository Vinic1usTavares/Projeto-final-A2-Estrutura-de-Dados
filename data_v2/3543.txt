digital spy felt song was no great departure from what he s given us before but felt production of tricky and dream helped give song a simple big chorus about puppy love that works melanie bertoldi of billboard said midtempo number s undeniably contagious chorus should keep bieber s tween fan base satisfied and ludacris brief cameo adds a welcome urban twist bertoli went on to say matchup adds a layer of maturity to bieber s repertoire and should further solidify his growing presence on charts rap up magazine said that sweet pop fare gets a little street cred courtesy of teen sensation s labelmate ludacris jody rosen of rolling stone appreciated song s vintage doo wop and fifties aesthetic and hip hop chants and said song included one of catchiest choruses concocted by dream and tricky stewart duo behind umbrella and single ladies luke o neill of boston globe had mixed thoughts about song calling ludacris cameo goofy and said song effects a musical anachronism albeit a catchy
