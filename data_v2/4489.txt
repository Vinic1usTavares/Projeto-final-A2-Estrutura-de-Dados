south park s main characters and was followed in 1995 by another short film jesus vs santa which became popular and was widely shared over internet short s popularity caused parker and stone to develop a series based off it and project was first considered for purchase by fox broadcasting company fox ultimately passed on show and comedy central signed on to produce series instead south park debuted on august 13 1997 on comedy central with an initial run of six episodes due to its success an additional seven episodes were quickly produced complete season was released on dvd in november

kitty cartman s mom is a dirty slut episodes development idea for south park originated in 1992 when creators trey parker and matt stone met in a film class as students at university of colorado they discussed filming a three minute short film involving a boy who befriended a talking piece of feces named mr hankey although such a short was never made parker and stone created a christmas related animated short commonly known as jesus vs frosty crude low budget animation featured prototypes for main characters of south park including cartman stan and kyle fox broadcasting company executive brian graden saw film and in 1995 sent a check of 1 200 to parker and stone asking them to create a second short film that he could send to his friends as a christmas video card titled spirit of christmas but also known as jesus vs santa short resembled style of later series more closely in 1997 spirit of christmas won los angeles films critics association award for best animation thus further bringing two filmmakers to attention of industry representatives jesus vs santa video was widely copied and shared over internet george clooney was reported to have made 300 copies for his friends and short was subsequently regarded as likely first viral video popularity of short led to parker and stone to develop an adult animated show concept with four children as main protagonists and fictional town of south park in colorado rocky mountains through graden duo persuaded fox to buy their series due to its reputation with primetime edgier shows such as cops simpsons and x files fox set up a meeting at its office in century city to discuss with parker and stone on how show would proceed it did not go well fox hated mr hankey being included in show as they felt a talking stool character would not fly well with its viewers parker and stone refused to honor fox s requests to remove character and completely severed ties with network as a result later comedy central executive doug herzog saw jesus vs santa short and considered it to be literally funniest thing he d ever seen and requested parker and stone to develop a show for his network during negotiations parker and stone brought up idea of a mr hankey episode with parker claiming to have asked that one thing we have to know before we really go any further how do you feel about talking poo network s executives were receptive to idea which would be one of main reasons parker and stone decided to sign on with channel first episode of series cartman gets an anal probe debuted on comedy central on august 13 1997 while mr hankey debuted a few months later in ninth episode mr hankey christmas poo thumb alt two seated men one holds a microphone in one hand and gestures with other 260px left south park creators trey parker and matt stone in 2007 pilot episode received poor results from test audiences parker later conceded that regarding language he and stone felt pressure to live up to their previous two shorts and tried to push things maybe further than we should have in contrast they allowed subsequent episodes to be more natural focusing more on making fun of topics considered taboo without just throwing a bunch of dirty words in there after poor results from test audience comedy central executives were unsure whether they wanted to order additional episodes after cartman gets an anal probe however when buzz began to generate on internet about two original shorts network commissioned parker and stone to write one more episode without committing to a full series until they had seen script while working on 1997 film orgazmo parker and stone wrote script for what would later become episode weight gain 4000 duo sought to give comedy central executives an idea of how series would be and how each episode could differ from others network liked script and when parker and stone refused to write another script before signing off on at least six episodes executives agreed to commit to a series comedy central originally ordered only these six episodes but when show proved successful they requested an additional seven which parker and stone had to produce quickly pinkeye first of these new episodes would air on october 29 1997 only two and a half months after show s premiere there were three holiday episodes pinkeye starvin marvin and mr hankey christmas poo which aired at intervals of three weeks while remaining four aired later in february 1998 cartman gets an anal probe was only episode animated almost completely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques all subsequent episodes would be fully computer animated using power animator or maya by eighth episode damien much of drawing and animation responsibilities handled by parker and stone were now being delegated to a team of animators this would be only episode aside from cartman gets an anal probe to receive a tv 14 unsuitable for children under age of 14 rating instead of show s customary tv ma unsuitable for under age of 17 parker and stone credit fourth episode big gay al s big gay boat ride with helping to raise ratings during early part of season they felt that show s first official christmas special mr hankey christmas poo brought south park to a new level of popularity and parker said this episode just vaulted everything reception ratings south park s first season was a ratings success for comedy central cartman gets an anal probe earned a nielsen rating of 1 3 translating to 980 000 viewers which was considered high for a cable program in united states at time it increased slightly by third episode volcano and by sixth episode death show had reached a rating of 1 7 ratings continued to rise rapidly from then on to 3 8 pinkeye 4 8 starvin marvin 5 4 mr hankey christmas poo 6 4 damien and 6 9 mecha streisand respectively this corresponded to an increase to 5 4 million viewers in 3 2 million households season finale cartman s mom is a dirty slut received a nielsen rating in 8 0 range and gained over 300 000 viewers when first aired in canada in august 1998 south park became one of first television series to be bootlegged via internet just as spirit of christmas had been before it college students digitized many episodes from first season and streamed them online for friends who were unable to receive comedy central critics despite high ratings reviews from television critics for season were mixed both washington post and new york times had three articles mentioning show usually in terms of class based taste arguments cartman gets an anal probe first episode of series received generally negative reviews after airing brent bozell founder and then president of parents television council gave an unfavorable review to episode stating that show is so offensive that it shouldn t have been made it doesn t just push envelope it knocks it off table bruce fretts of entertainment weekly thought poorly of writing and characters lampooning that if only kids jokes were as fresh as their mouths and that it might help if south park kids had personalities but they re as one dimensional as show s cut and paste animation calling series sophomoric gross and unfunny hal boedeker of orlando sentinel reckoned that episode made such a bad impression that it s hard to get on show s strange wavelength tom shales of washington post considered that most of alleged humor on premiere is self conscious and self congratulatory in its vulgarity flatulence jokes repeated use of word dildo in literal as well as pejorative sense and a general air of malicious unpleasantness when weight gain 4000 aired many writers in mainstream media were still debating longevity and overall quality of south park with series still in its earliest stages episode continued to shock many due to characters frequent use of profanities nevertheless several reviewers felt weight gain 4000 was a significant improvement over cartman gets an anal probe and felt that it went in a much more satirical direction several media outlets described fifth episode of season an elephant makes love to a pig as one of most popular early episodes tom carson of newsday said it was most outrageous south park episode until mr hankey christmas poo aired three months later many reviewers also said this mere title demonstrated crudeness and originality of south park due to its impact south park made cover of rolling stone in february 1998 and of newsweek in march 1998 it was discussed in five different new york times articles in 1998 franck rich of new york times mentions show s ability to engage political topics with far more success than other more obviously political shows and considered that show is hilariously candid about faith family and death as well and is neither politically correct nor incorrect it s on a different post ideological comic map altogether in 2002 jeremy conrad of ign wrote in a dvd review that it is rare when a television season is perfect but first season of south park comes pretty damn close and that almost every single episode in this three disc set is a classic and each is still funny as hell even after so many viewings over years in 2008 scholar stephen groening argued that show appeared as part of a reaction to culture wars of 1980s and 1990s in united states in which issues such as murphy brown s motherhood winky s sexuality and simpsons family values were extensively debated culture wars and political correctness in particular were driven by belief that relativism was becoming more relevant to daily life groening explained that south park made a name for itself as rude crude vulgar offensive and potentially dangerous its critics argued that stan kyle cartman and kenny were poor role models for children while its supporters celebrated show s defense of free speech impact on comedy central in 2006 devin leonard of fortune regarded that launch of south park transformed comedy central from a not so funny network to a cable industry power almost overnight impact show had ended up surprising everybody involved at time cable network had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers comedy central marketed show aggressively before its launch billing it as that s why they invented v chip resulting buzz led to network earning an estimated 30 million in t shirts sales alone before first episode was even aired south park became immediately one of most popular shows on cable television averaging consistently between 3 5 and 5 5 million viewers denver based tele communications inc largest cable operator in u s at time had just dropped comedy central but when south park debuted denver newspapers and radio stations heavily criticized operator for not carrying hit show of two local filmmakers parker and stone doug herzog comedy central s president at time said that public went nuts as network received about ten million new subscriptions through tele communications inc alone which at that time was unheard of an affiliate of mtv network until then comedy central decided in part due to success of south park to have its own independent sales department by end of 1998 comedy central had sold more than 150 million worth of merchandise for show including t shirts and dolls over next few years comedy central s viewership spiked largely due to south park adding 3 million new subscribers in first half of 1998 alone and allowed network to sign international deals with networks in several countries awards some episodes of first season received nominations for several entertainment awards season s fourth episode big gay al s big gay boat ride was nominated for an emmy award in 1998 in outstanding animated program for programming less than
