first battle of passchendaele took place on 12 october 1917 during first world war in ypres salient on western front attack was part of third battle of ypres and was fought west of passchendaele village british had planned to capture ridges south and east of city of ypres as part of a strategy decided by allies at conferences in november 1916 and may 1917 passchendaele lay on last ridge east of ypres from railway junction at roulers which was an important part of supply system of german 4th army after a dry spell in september rains began on 3 october and by battle of poelcappelle on 9 october much of british field artillery opposite passchendaele was out of action due to rain mud and german artillery fire remaining guns were either left in old positions and fired at limit of their range or were operated from any flat ground near wooden roadways or from platforms many of which were unstable where it was found impossible to move them forward general herbert plumer and field marshal douglas haig were left under impression that a big advance had been made towards passchendaele ridge but most of ground had been lost to german counter attacks in afternoon british attack on 12 october began from village instead of originally thought air reconnaissance revealed true position too late to make substantial changes to plan main attack of second army was by two anzac corps supported by fifth army to north on passchendaele ridge opposite i and ii anzac corps attack was repulsed or captured ground was recovered by german counter attacks attack on right flank of fifth army was a costly failure but on left fringe of houthoulst forest was gained british attacks were postponed until weather improved and communications behind front were restored battle was a german defensive success but was mutually costly and two german divisions were diverted to flanders to replace extraordinarily high losses in worst weather conditions of campaign in five weeks after battle of broodseinde number of troops engaged by british amounted to no more than those involved in battle of pilckem ridge on 31 july british losses in october 1917 were third highest of war after july 1916 and april 1917 background tactical developments 12 october 1917 date degf 102 114 127 in july 1917 field marshal douglas haig began third battle of ypres campaign to advance from ypres salient at battle of messines far east side of messines ridge had been captured down to oosttaverne line and a substantial success gained in subsequent battle of pilckem ridge at battle of langemarck there was only an advance of around langemarck village by xiv corps failure of fifth army to advance on gheluvelt plateau in august led haig to send artillery reinforcements to south east along higher ground of gheluvelt plateau broodseinde ridge and southern half of passchendaele ridge gheluvelt plateau was taken over by second army general herbert plumer which continued evolution of bite and hold tactics that had been used in july and august second army planned to attack with a succession of bodies of infantry on narrower fronts to first objective about forward second objective was beyond and final objective was further on pauses on objectives would become longer and attacks would be protected by a bigger deeper multi layered creeping barrage standing barrages beyond objectives were to be fired during pauses to obstruct german counter attacks to confront them with defensive areas based on british objectives british infantry would be in communication with its artillery and have much more local support from royal flying corps rfc beyond creeper four heavy artillery counter battery double groups with and howitzers covered a front ready to engage german guns with gas and high explosive shell at battle of menin road ridge 20 september battle of polygon wood 26 september and battle of broodseinde 4 october these methods produced a advance in two weeks inflicted many german casualties germans changed tactics several times against refined british methods but all failed in lower ground west of passchendaele ridge three months of shelling had blocked watercourses that normally provided drainage on night of 4 october it began to rain intermittently for next three days much of battlefield again became a quagmire making movement extremely difficult had german defence collapsed during battle of poelcappelle on 9 october reserve brigades of ii anzac corps were to have passed through later in day to advance to far side of passchendaele village and goudberg spur to north on 7 october afternoon attack had been cancelled by haig because of rain and final details of plan for renewed attack of 12 october were decided on evening of 9 october plumer had received misleading information about progress of attack that day and believed that a sufficiently good jumping off line had been achieved passing erroneous information back to haig decision was made to continue offensive to gain higher ground for winter to assist french with their attack due on 23 october battle of la malmaison and to hold german troops in flanders for battle of cambrai due in november prelude british offensive preparations thumb alt a collection of men pulling a field gun through mud encouraged by unusually high german losses during battle of broodseinde and reports of lowered german morale haig sought quickly to renew allied offensive and secure passchendaele ridge battle of poelcappelle began on 9 october and was costly to both sides most of ground captured opposite passchendaele was lost later in day to german counter attacks news of this german defensive success was slow in reaching higher british commanders because usual collapse of communications during an attack was exacerbated by rain and mud late on 9 october plumer erroneously informed haig that ii anzac corps had reached first objective which made a good jumping off position for attack due on 12 october many british guns had sunk in mud bogged down while being moved forward or run short of ammunition german artillery fire had become much heavier as british heavy artillery counter battery fire almost ceased from 9 to 12 october as attempts were made to move guns forward although defenders were still caused considerable difficulty by british bombardments 3rd australian division and new zealand division relieved 66th 2nd east lancashire division and 49th west riding division on night of patrols discovered that 49th west riding division had reached wallemolen spur east of ravebeek creek but advance beyond had been stopped by new barbed wire entanglements around 66th 2nd east lancashire division on right flank was found to be back near its start line of 9 october new zealand division made hurried preparations to restore communications and reconnoitre ground because information from 49th west riding division headquarters was insufficient some wounded were still stranded in no man s land when attack began on 12 october many field guns needed for attack remained bogged in mud and other field guns were placed on improvised platforms when their new sites had proved impossible to reach from which they fired slowly and inaccurately or sank into mud a german bombardment took place on morning of 11 october and later in day british shelled german defences on wallemolen spur to little effect some progress was made in building of plank roads since attack on 9 october and a few more guns had reached their new positions by 12 october commander royal artillery cra of new zealand division reported that adequate artillery support for his division could not be guaranteed plumer discovered that line near passchendaele had hardly changed and that main reason for failure on 9 october was uncut barbed wire deep in front of pillboxes at hamlet of bellevue on wallemolen spur new zealand division commander major general andrew russell later wrote that accurate information had arrived too late to ask for a postponement or radically to alter barrage plan and unit orders true position of front line meant that advance of to final objective would actually have to cover opening barrage line planned for 3rd australian division was moved back but this still required infantry to advance for to reach it duckboard tracks had been extended to line held on 9 october which allowed infantry to move up on night of 11 october in time for attack despite rain and a german gas bombardment on gravenstafel spur high winds and heavy rain began about zero hour and

in some parts of front despite a certain reluctance among some of local commanders outposts beyond german advanced defensive zone were to hold front line in enough strength to stop british from sapping forward garrisons were to withdraw to main line at rear of when attacked signalling to artillery with rockets and very lights for barrage fire german artillery would place barrage in front of main line of resistance before british infantry reached it and if possible troops in front position were to attempt to defeat attack without calling on supporting division to limit casualties in his diary rupprecht wrote that he was doubtful about changes of tactics required by ludendorff especially his instructions for more counter battery fire since in previous battles german artillery had engaged british infantry an anticipated french attack on chemin des dames meant that fewer reinforcements could be expected by 4th army making a fighting withdrawal only possible response to british attacks rupprecht wrote that fighting power of german troops in flanders was declining and that all attempts to counter british artillery had failed requiring a greater retreat far enough back to force british into a laborious artillery redeployment after being postponed from 2 october due to delays in transport of ammunition operation moonlight took place at midnight on a strip of ground from

9th brigade of 3rd australian division managed to reach first objective and battalion due to advance to second objective went straight on as soon as those troops began to descend from a slight rise they were engaged by german field and heavy artillery brigade kept going to second objective although part of advance remained bogged down short of first objective 10th brigade 3rd australian division

across keiberg spur but suffered many casualties and brigade repulsed two german counter attacks between and an attempt was made to use reserve battalion of 9th brigade to outflank bellevue pillboxes combined with a new attack by new zealand division around attack was eventually cancelled as 9th scottish division to north and 3rd australian division to south were forced back by fire of bellevue machine guns artillery bombardment went ahead dropping on some new zealand positions but also dispersing two german parties massing for a counter attack by 10th brigade had filtered back to its start line due to fire from bellevue spur 9th brigade was exposed by this retirement and fell back from second objective in face of artillery machine gun and sniper fire with many casualties when anzac advance broke into front between passchendaele and keiberg spur i battalion reserve infantry regiment 55 of 220th division was attached to 195th division and ii battalion reserve infantry regiment 55

division withdrew to a line on lower slopes of wallemolen spur fifth army protection of northern flank of main attack by second army was provided by fifth army with single brigades of 9th scottish and 18th eastern divisions of xviii corps attacking from north of goudberg to north of lekkerboterbeek stream adjacent to northern boundary of second army 26th brigade of 9th scottish division was to advance on a front with its left flank on lekkerboterbeek into an area dotted with fortified farm buildings 55th brigade of 18th eastern division attacked north of lekkerboterbeek over ground soaked after rain all day on 11 october a low flying german aircraft had reconnoitred area near 55th brigade so position of jumping off line was altered to avoid a possible german counter barrage as brigade formed up for advance xviii corps 9th scottish division was hampered by effect of rain and mud on supply routes which stranded guns and caused shortages of ammunition particularly in smoke shells at midnight on 11 october torrential rain fell and a german gas and high explosive bombardment fell on divisional forming up areas wide front left numerous gaps in line as 26th brigade advanced behind a barrage moving at in eight minutes assisted by a machine gun barrage from creeping barrage began at and was described as thin and ragged advancing troops lost direction and communication broke down as carrier pigeons were hindered by high wind and messenger dog handlers became casualties infantry continued their advance and on right of captured adler farm and reached green line at source trench in centre attackers had to dig in after a advance small parties reached source trench and some may have advanced as far as vat cottages on left of brigade ground was even worse infantry were unable to keep up with barrage and lost direction but managed to capture a pillbox and move forward some of troops on left flank inadvertently crossed lekkerboterbeek advanced and then formed a flank with troops from 18th eastern division except on right flank attack was stopped by germans only from start line despite 27th brigade being sent to reinforce attack in which some of british infantry drowned in shell holes new front line ran from junction with new zealand division at cemetery near wallemolen to oxford houses then back to old front line barrage began at and 55th brigade of 18th eastern division infantry advanced in snake formation divisional field artillery suffered same fate as those of divisions to south many guns sinking into soft ground a german counter barrage began within a minute of advance and as british troops took cover german machine gunners fired at crater lips of shell holes through which bullets penetrated and hit soldiers sheltering inside effect of german barrage was worst on right flank and added to german machine gun fire from brewery and helles house strong points situation at requette farm was not known as all runners sent from area were killed mud clogged weapons of all types and at a british trench mortar battery and some supporting machine guns had to cease fire because of wet and dirty ammunition at noon german counter attacks towards west end of poelcappelle began and lasted all afternoon germans trying to exploit a gap between british 4th and 18th divisions defensive positions in shell holes were held by survivors of british attack xiv corps northern flank of fifth army on boundary with french first army was held by xiv corps which also attacked with a brigade of each division to close up to houthoulst forest after dark on 11 october tape was laid beyond front line in corps area for troops to form up on beyond a possible german counter barrage to avoid detection scouts patrolled further forward to ambush german patrols 3rd guards brigade of guards division moved up on night of 11 october through heavy rain and a german gas barrage operation which caused many casualties in this part of front artillery barrage began on schedule at and german counter barrage was slow to begin falling mostly behind attacking waves xiv corps divisions had much better artillery and machine gun barrages than divisions further south and creeping barrage moved at a very slow rate of in ten minutes in two bounds 12th brigade headquarters 4th division next to xviii corps area was to attack with a composite force of two battalions of 10th brigade and two from 12th brigade two battalions were to lead with a battalion each in support and reserve following on to a first objective about forward then pivoting on right to final objective another forward at water house ground had been soaked again by overnight rain and advance by right hand battalion was stopped at requette farm by determined german resistance and massed machine gun fire during which contact with neighbouring battalion of 18th eastern division was lost left hand battalion advance faced less opposition and by had crossed poelcappelle le cinq chemins road captured memling and senegal farms and then made contact with 17th northern division after capture of requette farm by right hand battalion more german machine gun fire was received from brewery and helles house which stopped attack on right flank requette farm was lost to a german counter attack around noon and attempts by reinforcements to re take farm were abandoned as dark fell brigade extended a defensive flank on right to maintain contact with 18th eastern division new front line curved back through farm to west of helles house south west of requette farm north of poelcappelle

beyond railway advance of 51st brigade veered slightly south away from a german strongpoint which caused many casualties and lost touch with guards division south of embankment astride and watervlietbeek streams several german farm strongpoints pillboxes and shell hole positions were overrun by infantry who were able to keep well up to very slow moving barrage brigade reached its first objective by despite a number of german reinforcements arriving through british artillery barrages final objective was reached at and on right a defensive flank was thrown back from memling farm at final objective to link with 4th division by noon advance was complete had been taken and no german counter attack followed resistance being limited to a small amount of rifle fire in cold wet weather 3rd guards brigade made a short advance behind a ragged barrage took higher ground on edge of houthoulst forest and cut off rest of spur running north east from contact with 17th northern division on right flank was lost after left flank formation of 17th northern division veered south and crew of a contact patrol aircraft failed to see loss of direction two platoons due to meet attacking brigade of 17th northern division had to dig in near angle point pillbox under machine gun fire after dark guards and 17th northern division closed gap by capturing blockhouses at angle point and aden house next day conditions were so bad that attacking brigade was relieved by 1st guards brigade fresh troops patrolled vigorously to southern edge of houthoulst forest against little organised german resistance except for extensive sniping around colbert cross roads and colombo house air operations during battle forty one british pilots made low altitude strafing and bomb attacks british flew an

british german 18th division held line opposite poelcappelle and retained most of its area after committing all of its reserves german command considered allied advance in north to be less dangerous than that towards defensive line between passchendaele and one division was moved to and another to area between and either side of passchendaele 195th division at passchendaele had so many casualties from 9 to 12 october that it had to be relieved by 238th division ludendorff changed his mind about prospect of retaining passchendaele ridge believing that british had only fourteen days before weather made attacks impossible and ordered rupprecht to stand fast at a conference on 18 october hermann von kuhl advocated a retreat as far to east as possible sixt von armin 4th army commander and his chief of staff colonel fritz von lossberg preferred to fight to hold their remaining defences in and because ground beyond passchendaele watershed was untenable even in winter british attack was costly for both sides but captured more ground opposite passchendaele than on 9 october british took prisoner more than british artillery support was inadequate due amount of field artillery out of action and vast increase in mud which smothered high explosive shell detonations weather from 4 to 12 october also prevented counter battery fire and little was achieved by heavier guns on 13 october british decided to stop offensive until better weather returned and roads and tracks had been repaired to ensure that deliberate attacks with a greater quantity of artillery support could be resumed operations were to continue to reach a suitable line for winter and to keep german attention on flanders to help french attack due on 23 october and third army operation south of arras set for mid
