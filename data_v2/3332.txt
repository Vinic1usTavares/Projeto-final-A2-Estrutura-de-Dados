simarouba amara is a species of tree in family simaroubaceae found in rainforests and savannahs of south and central america and caribbean it was first described by aublet in french guiana in 1775 and is one of six species of simarouba tree is evergreen but produces a new set of leaves once a year it requires relatively high levels of light to grow and grows rapidly in these conditions but lives for a relatively short time in panama it flowers during dry season in february and march whereas in costa rica where there is no dry season it flowers later between march and july as species is dioecious trees are either male or female and only produce male or female flowers small yellow flowers are thought to be pollinated by insects resulting fruits are dispersed by animals including monkeys birds and fruit eating bats and seeds are also dispersed by leaf cutter ants simarouba amara has been studied extensively by scientists in an attempt to understand tree and also to gain a better understanding of ecology of rainforest in general many of these studies were conducted on barro colorado island in panama or at la selva biological station in costa rica of particular interest is how it competes with other species and with individuals of same species at different stages in its life cycle seedlings are normally limited by amount of light and nutrients found where they are growing and saplings are considered relatively light demanding compared to other species young individuals are more likely to survive when they grow further away from their parents and when there are few other individuals growing near to them which may be due to them being able to escape diseases plant physiologists have investigated how leaves of tree differ depending on their location in forest canopy finding they are thicker in canopy and thinner in understory they have also measured how water potential of their leaves changes and when their stomata open and close during day findings suggest that rather than closing their stomata to control water loss it is controlled by leaf area instead population geneticists have examined way in which its genes vary at both local scale and across its range using microsatellites it is genetically diverse indicating gene flow occurs between populations and seeds can be dispersed up to 1 km leaves of s amara are eaten by several species of caterpillar particularly those in genus atteva several species of termite and ants live on or around tree and lianas and epiphytes grow on tree bark of s amara has been used by people in its range to treat dysentery and diarrhea as well as other diseases and was also exported to europe in eighteenth century to treat these illnesses a number of compounds have since been isolated from bark and have been shown to have antimicrobial effects local people use wood of tree for various purposes and it is also grown in plantations and harvested for its timber some of which is exported description simarouba amara grows to heights of up to 35 metres with a maximum trunk diameter of 125 cm and a maximum estimated age of 121 years it has compound leaves that are each around 60 cm long petioles are 4 7 cm long and each leaf has 9 16 leaflets each leaflet is 2 5 11 cm long and 12 45 mm wide with those towards end of compound leaf tending to be smaller flowers occur on a that is around 30 cm in length which is widely branched and densely covered in flowers flowers are unisexual small 1 cm long and pale yellow in colour they are thought to be pollinated by insects such as small bees and moths on barro colorado island bci panama it tends to flower during dry season from end of january to end of april persisting for 11 to 15 weeks each year in costa rica it flowers slightly later between march and july peaking in april fruits form between 1 and 3 months after pollination occurs fruits are brightly colored green to purplish black approximately 17 mm long and contain large seeds 10 14 mm they occur in groups of 3 5 drupes seeds cannot stay dormant and are dispersed by vertebrates each seed weighs approximately 0 25 g it is an evergreen species with a new flush of leaves growing between january and april during dry season when highest light levels occur in rainforest this phenology is thought to allow s amara to photosynthesise most effectively since new leaves are more efficient than those they replace it has visible but indistinct growth rings that are on average 7 mm wide a study of individuals in panama found that they grow on average 8 4 mm in diameter each year in costa rica growth rates as fast as 18 mm per year have been recorded and stem grows constantly throughout year xylem vessels in mature trees range from 20 to 90 mm in diameter with around 50 vessels present per mm2 of branch density of wood is between 0 37 0 44 g cm3 lower than many other species in rainforest it is a fast growing light demanding and shade intolerant species saplings are typically one straight pole with several compound leaves and only one point of growth this allows sapling to achieve greatest vertical growth with a minimum amount of biomass they start to branch once they are 2 5 m tall a study in forest dynamics plot on bci found that between 1982 and 2000 around 65 of individuals died with mortality highest amongst small individuals 1 cm dbh large trees 20 cm dbh are relatively rare averaging 2 4 trees per hectare compared to 40 trees per hectare of 1 cm dbh taxonomy thumb left illustration of s amara as quassia simarouba drawn by adolphus and published in 1813 note that flowers are incorrectly coloured and should be yellow simarouba amara was first described by jean baptiste fusee aublet in french guiana in 1775 and is type species of genus simarouba in 1790 william wright described quassia simarouba which auguste decandolle suggested was same species as s amara however because s amara was described as monoecious by aublet and q simarouba was described as dioecious by wright they were still regarded as separate species in 1829 by 1874 when flora brasiliensis was published they were considered synonymous among six species of simarouba two besides s amara occur on continent s glauca and s versicolor s amara can be distinguished from other continental species by having smaller flowers anthers and fruit and straight rather than curved petals leaves of simarouba amara subsp opaca are not a bluish grey or green colour on their underside whereas those of simarouba amara subsp typica are table of flower characteristics of s amara and

many common names where in neotropics in bolivia it is known as in brazil as marupa parahyba and in colombia it is called simaruba in ecuador as cedro cuna and in french guiana as simarouba in guyana as in peru as marupa in surinam as and in venezuela cedro blanco and simarouba in europe it was known by various names during nineteenth century when it was used as a medicine these names included bitter ash mountain and stave wood distribution thumb range of simarouba amara in green natural range of s amara is in neotropics ecoregion of central and south america its range extends from guatemala in north to bolivia in south and from ecuador in west to east coast of brazil it has been introduced to islands of dominica and puerto rico in caribbean sea becoming naturalised in puerto rico on bci mature trees 10 cm dbh are found at a frequency of 5 per hectare in ecuador at 0 7 per hectare and in french guiana at 0 4 per hectare genetic analysis of populations suggests that it has always been relatively common within its range it grows in rainforests and in savannahs seedlings of s amara are rare in primary forest due to their light demanding habit genetics populations of s amara display high levels of heterozygosity indicating that it is genetically diverse this is consistent with tree outcrossing over large distances by long distance pollen flow and that there has been sufficient long distance gene flow between populations to counteract effects of genetic drift a study of 478 plants from 14 populations across south america found that 24 of all alleles occurred in only one population a study of 300 plants on barro colorado island found that heterozygosity at 5 microsatellite loci varied between 0 12 and 0 75 8 out of 50 alleles scored occurred in only one plant reproduction individuals do not typically reproduce until they have a trunk diameter of 30 cm once mature trees produce flowers each year but not all females produce fruit each year their flower morphology is typical of being pollinated by generalist small insects such as bees and moths it has been reported to be pollinated by non sphingid moths but other authors have questioned whether this is correct seed dispersal thumb a mantled howler one animal that disperses seeds of s amara seeds of s amara are dispersed by vertebrates mainly large birds and mammals including flycatchers thrushes howler monkeys tamarins and spider monkeys leaf cutter ants have also been observed to disperse seeds and dense seedling carpets form in areas where they dump waste material but most of seedlings die and dispersal by ants is thought to be unimportant in determining long term patterns of recruitment and dispersal seeds that are eaten by monkeys are more likely to germinate than seeds that have not fruit eating bats have also been noted to disperse their seeds this may aid regeneration of forests as they disperse seeds of later successional species while they feed on s amara based on inverse modelling of data from seed traps on bci estimated average dispersal distance for seeds is 39 m studying seedlings and parent trees on bci using dna microsatellites revealed that in fact on average seedlings grow 392 m away from their parents with a standard deviation of 234 m and a range of between 9 m and 1 km in forest there are many seeds and seedlings beneath reproductive females genetic data indicate that seedlings are unlikely to be from nearby adults but rather dispersed there by vertebrates that have fed on one tree and then moved to feed on another defecating while in canopy and depositing seeds physiology various aspects of physiology or s amara have been studied stomatal conductance of leaves an indication of rate at which water evaporates of mature trees at midday range from 200 to 270 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 leaf water potentials at midday range from 0 56 to 1 85 mpa averaging around 1 2 mpa cavitation is widespread in trunk and stomata do not close before cavitation occurs although this would normally be considered deleterious to tree it may buffer leaf water potential and therefore be beneficial stomatal conductance and hydraulic conductance of branches of taller trees 30 m are much higher than in branches of smaller trees 20 m phillips bond and ryan suggested that this is probably due to branches of taller trees having a lower leaf to sapwood ratio than those of small branches dye staining shows that cavitation is common in branches of s amara they concluded that water flux in s amara is controlled by structural leaf area rather than physiological closing stomata means leaves absorb light in active radiation par spectrum at wavelengths between 400 nm and 700 nm with a high efficiency but efficiency decreases at longer wavelengths generally plants absorb par at efficiencies of around 85 higher values found in s amara are thought to be due to high humidity of its habitat reflectance and transmittance of leaves are low at between 400 and 700 nm optical properties and mass of leaves vary depending on their location in forest canopy with leaves becoming thicker and more efficient as their height within canopy increases for their weight however leaves in understory are more efficient at capturing light than leaves in canopy leaf optical properties as recorded from a study at la selva costa rica absorbance 400 700 nm absorbance

phosphate has been found to be higher underneath female individuals than underneath males even though total concentration of phosphate is equal rhoades et al concluded that this difference was due to females changing availability of phosphate rather than females only growing in areas with high phosphate availability this is thought to be caused either by fruit containing high levels of phosphate which would fall off tree and rot or by fruits attracting animals which deposit phosphate beneath females it is also possible that sexes produce different root exudates which affect microbial community in their thereby affecting phosphate availability woody tissues of s amara have been found to respire at a rate of 1 24 mmol m 2 s 1 and this rate of respiration correlates positively with growth rate of stem maintenance respiration was calculated at 31 1 mmol m 3 s 1 and this rate correlated positively with sapwood volume seedling physiology nutrient concentrations in leaves of seedlings nutrient concentration mg g leaf dry weight nitrogen 20 phosphorus 1 potassium 16 calcium 2 magnesium 5 experiments on bci where trenches were dug around seedlings of s amara or where gaps in canopy were made above them show that their relative growth rate can be increased by both this shows that their growth is normally limited by both above ground competition for light and by below ground competition for nutrients and water competition for light is normally more important as shown by growth rate increasing by almost 7 times and mortality decreasing when seedlings were placed in gaps compared to understory when seedlings in gaps had a trench dug round them to prevent below ground competition their growth increased further by 50 demonstrating that in gaps seedlings are limited by below ground competition around seedlings in understory did not significantly increase their growth showing that they are normally only limited by competition for light larger seedlings are more likely to survive dry season on bci than smaller seedlings density dependent inhibition occurs between seedlings they are more likely to survive in areas where fewer seedlings of s amara are growing a study on individuals on bci found that this pattern may be caused by differences in soil biota rather than by insect herbivores or fungal pathogens observations based on distance of seedlings from their parents indicate that janzen connell hypothesis applies to seedlings of s amara they are more likely to survive away from their parents as they escape pests such as herbivores and plant pathogens which are more common underneath parent trees sapling physiology saplings of s amara are light demanding and are found in brighter areas of rainforest compared to elegans and ampla seedlings a study at la selva biological station found leaves weigh approximately 30 g m2 dry weight similar to p elegans but around double weight of l ampla photosynthetic capacity of leaves of s amara is higher than that of other two species averaging around 6 mmol m 1 s 1 dark respiration is on average 0 72 mmol m 1 s 1 higher than that of other two species maximum photosynthetic rate correlates with both stem diameter and vertical growth diffuse light is thought to be more important for seedling growth than another study of saplings at la selva found that they grew 7 cm yr 1 in height and 0 25 mm yr 1 in diameter on average they had nine compound leaves a leaf area index of 0 54 and total surface area of their leaves was 124 cm2 saplings that had lowest leaf area were most likely to die during study and those with a larger leaf area grew faster than other saplings a study of saplings between one and four centimeters in diameter on bci found that growth of saplings did not vary depending on which species grew near them contrary to predictions that density dependence inhibition occurs a model based on these findings predicted that saplings with a diameter of 2 cm are able to grow at a maximum rate of 13 mm yr 1 and that if another tree with a diameter of 10 cm is growing within 5 m of sapling its growth is only reduced to 12 mm yr 1 indicating that they are not affected by crowding trees growing more than 15 m away from a sapling do not affect their growth ecology thumb lantern bug enchophora sanguinea is found preferentially on trunks of s amara lianas are relatively rare on mature 20 cm dbh individuals of s amara compared to other trees on bci with only around 25 having lianas growing on them putz suggested that this may be due to trees having large leaves but mechanism by which this would reduce number of lianas is unknown smaller individuals also have fewer lianas and woody hemi epiphytes than other species of tree in same forests atteva aurea and other members of genus atteva have been recorded to eat new shoot tips of s amara in costa rica larvae of butterfly species feed exclusively on saplings and of s amara two termite species have been observed living on s amara in panama in dead wood and arboreus nesting in a gallery on a branch bullet ants paraponera clavata have been found to nest at base of s amara trees hemiptera enchophora sanguinea has been found preferentially on trunks of s amara uses materials simarouba amara is used locally for producing paper furniture plywood and matches and is also used in construction it is also grown in plantations as its bright and lightweight timber is highly sought after in european markets for use in making fine furniture and veneers wood dries rapidly and is easy to work with normal tools it is creamy white to light yellow in colour with a coarse texture and a straight grain it has to be treated to prevent fungi wood borers and termites from eating it heartwood has a density of 0 35 0 45 g cm3 it has been noted to be one of best species for timber that can be grown in peruvian amazon along with due to its rapid growth characteristics worldwide fund for nature recommend that consumers ensure s amara timber is certified by forest stewardship council so that they do not contribute to deforestation wood shavings of s amara have been used in animal bedding leading to poisoning of horses and dogs medical leaves and bark of s amara have been used as an herbal medicine to treat dysentery diarrhea malaria and other illnesses in areas where it grows in 1713 it was exported to france where it was used to treat dysentery being an effective treatment during epidemics between 1718 and 1725 in 1918 its effectiveness was validated by a study where soldiers in a military hospital were given a tea made of bark to treat amoebic dysentery in a 1944 study merck institute found it was 92 effective at treating intestinal in humans during 1990s scientists demonstrated it could kill most common cause of dysentery entamoeba histolytica and species of salmonella and shigella bacteria that cause diarrhea a greater amount of evidence is required to prove efficacy of simarouba main biologically active compounds found in s amara are a group of triterpenes including and these have been reported to kill protozoa amoeba plasmodium cause of malaria and also cancerous human cells however a celebrity and a doctor have cautioned public against using simarouba as an alternative cancer treatment antimalarial properties were first investigated by scientists in 1947 they found that in chickens 1 mg of bark extract per 1 kg of body weight had strong antimalarial activity in 1997 a patent was filed in united states for using an extract in a skin care product references external
