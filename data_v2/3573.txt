sustains once star power meter is filled at least halfway star power can then be activated by briefly tilting guitar controller vertically or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller activating star power will double scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase rock meter by playing correct notes thus players can strategically use star power to play through difficult

not introduce any other frets to learn but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge player development right thumb 125px controller that was packaged with game an approximately 3 4 scale reproduction of a gibson sg according to rob kay game s lead designer idea of guitar hero was directly inspired by konami s guitar freaks arcade game where player used a guitar shaped controller to interact with game at time guitarfreaks had not seen much exposure in north america redoctane was making dance pads for games like dance dance revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to netflix redoctane s kai and charles huang recognized popularity of guitarfreaks in japan through their rental service and planned to create guitar controllers to bring game to north america huangs raised 1 75 million for effort despite being turned down by some investors who thought idea was too weird greg fischbach one of founders of acclaim entertainment noted regretfully several years later they had passed on guitar hero questioning who s going to buy a peripheral like that huangs approached harmonix who had previously made music video games such as frequency amplitude and karaoke revolution about making a guitar based video game for those controllers with a budget of about one million dollars which kay noted was pretty tiny for a video game two companies worked together to develop guitar hero kay noted that no one had any notions about it being a massive success we all just thought it would be fun to do harmonix s president alex rigopulos also claims that former microsoft vice president of game publishing ed fries indirectly influenced game s creation who had previously told harmonix when they were pitching frequency to microsoft that no music rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it prompting rigopulos to investigate guitar hero opportunity when it arose team quickly recognized that controller really was kind of magic sauce for what we wanted to do they identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made game stand out these aspects included note matching aspect and showmanship created by use of whammy bar and tilting of guitar within game third key aspect was use of star power to provide a little more depth to game some replay value some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting notes harmonix used third party controllers made for guitarfreaks that were already on market for development of game until redoctane had prepared prototypes for guitar hero controller controller initially had pressure sensitive fret buttons to mimic playing of a real guitar but idea was dropped as it made gameplay too complex idea of using whammy bar to boost star power in addition to altering pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before completion of game team had spent precious development time and resources into creating a free style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work feature into existing gameplay gem tracks pattern of notes for a song were developed by a team in harmonix taking usually a day to develop tracks for one song tracks were designed to include key notes to make player feel as if he is a brilliant musician software algorithms were used to assess difficulty of tracks and quality assurance team helped to rebalance tracks for accuracy and difficulty software also allowed harmonix to quickly make changes to set list or to recreate tracks for a song to make sure overall difficulty of game was appropriate at onset of development team did not have any idea of what songs would be present in final game kay noted that we wanted 30 or 40 songs for game and put a hundred on our wish list game was to focus mostly on hard rock songs but team was limited by what could be licensed team also felt morally obligated to include older classic rock songs like ramones i wanna be sedated to younger target audience of game harmonix had to modify track list throughout development as certain songs were introduced or removed based on licensing issues requiring team to repeatedly balance difficulty and popularity of track list wavegroup sound were used to create covers of licensed songs provided in game marcus henderson of band provided many of lead guitar tracks for covers wavegroup sound also went to efforts to try to recreate effects for some songs in case of black sabbaths iron man team learned that vocal effects were created by having ozzy osbourne sing from behind a metal fan team sought out same model of fan through craigslist to generate same effect in game s cover many of bonus songs were from groups that harmonix employees were part of or knew additionally a be a guitar hero contest was held allowing bands to submit their own song to be included in game winning song was cheat on church by graveyard bbq black label song fire it up was included two weeks before game was completed at request of zakk wylde final song list was set very near to shipping date guitar hero started with super basic pong style graphics for game display final game art was led by ryan lesser using art team s involvement in music scene based on experience from frequency and amplitude team realized that people dont necessarily relate to really abstract visuals and included depictions of live performances as previously used in karaoke revolution house of moves were used to assist in creation motion capture for on screen animations appearance of star power was made to resemble electricity both to reflect use of electric guitar as well to conceptually demonstrate excitement of performance and virtual audience guitar hero was initially released to retail stores in a bundle that packaged game disc and a gibson sg guitar controller priced at 69 99 since its release stand alone copies of games and guitar controller have been released including both redoctane and third party controllers from tac and madcatz another controller company that has produced guitar controllers was set to initially be part of game s development creating a version of game for xbox but had to pull out due to a lawsuit by komani madcatz s darrel richardson stated they had to pay 300 000 to get out of their contract with redoctane soundtrack guitar hero features 47

gamerankings and 91 100 on metacritic ign praised fantastic soundtrack and great peripheral further commenting that mini gibson sg controller is what makes guitar hero rather than what breaks it gamespot echoed these sentiments stating guitar hero had a great guitar controller and killer soundtrack and was possibly best rhythm game ever made many reviews praised game s gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through song tier progression and difficulty setting for each song play said game gives bedroom air guitarists a chance to live out their rock n roll fantasies gamespys review commented on length of songs in that once you hit three minute mark or so things start to feel too long eurogamer said lack of international star quality about roster of songs and absence of original artists is perhaps only thing that may detract from package from an importer s perspective and it would have been truly amazing with a better track list shortly after release guitar hero became an
