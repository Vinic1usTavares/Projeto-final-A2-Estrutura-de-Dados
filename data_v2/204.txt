wasp 44 is a g type star in constellation cetus that has jupiter size planet wasp 44b in orbit star is slightly less massive and slightly smaller than sun it is also slightly cooler but is more metal rich star was observed by superwasp an organization in search of planets starting in 2009 manual follow up observations used wasp 44 s spectrum and measurements of its radial velocity led to discovery of transiting planet wasp 44b planet and its star were presented along with wasp 45b and wasp 46b on may 17 2011 by a team of scientists testing idea that hot jupiters tend to have circular orbits an assumption that is made when orbital eccentricity of such planets are not well constrained observational history wasp 44 was observed between july and november 2009 by wasp south a station of superwasp planet searching program based at south african astronomical observatory observations of star revealed a periodic decrease in its brightness wasp south along with superwasp north station at roque de los muchachos observatory on canary islands collected 15 755 photometric observations allowing scientists to produce a more accurate light curve another set of observations yielded a 6 000 point photometric data set but light curve was prepared late and was not considered in discovery paper left thumb south african astronomical observatory base of wasp south station where wasp 44 was first observed in 2010 a european science team investigated star using coralie spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of wasp 44 from spectra radial velocity measurements were extrapolated analysis of collected coralie data ruled out possibility that detected radial velocity was caused by blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star supporting possibility that body orbiting wasp 44 was indeed a planet designated wasp 44b leonhard euler telescope at la silla observatory in chile was used to follow up on discovery circling wasp 44 searching for a point at which planet transited or crossed in front of its host star one transit was detected wasp 44 its recently discovered planet planets orbiting wasp 45 and wasp 46 and a discussion exploring validity of common assumption amongst scientists that closely orbiting hot jupiter planets have highly circular orbits unless proven otherwise were reported in a single discovery paper that was published on may 17 2011 by royal astronomical society paper was submitted to monthly notices of royal astronomical society on may 16 2011 characteristics wasp 44 is a g type star same class of star as sun that is located in cetus constellation wasp 44 has a mass that is 0 951 times that of sun in terms of size wasp 44 has a radius that is 0 927 times that of sun wasp 44 has an effective temperature of 5410 k cooler than sun however star is metal rich with relation to sun its measured metallicity is fe h 0 06 or 1 148 times that amount of iron found in sun wasp 44 s chromosphere outermost layer is not active star also does not rotate at a high velocity star has an apparent magnitude of 12 9 it cannot be seen from earth with naked eye planetary system there is one known planet in orbit of wasp 44 wasp 44b planet is a hot jupiter with a mass of 0 889 jupiters its radius is 1 14 times that of jupiter wasp 44b orbits its host star every 2 4238039 days at a distance 0 03473 au approximately 3 47 mean distance between earth and sun with an orbital inclination of 86 02o wasp 44b has an orbit that exists almost edge on to its host star with respect to earth 44b s orbital eccentricity is fit to 0 036 indicating a mostly circular orbit an analysis of transit timing variations to search for additional planets was negative references category planetary systems category cetus constellation category planetary transit variables category g type main sequence stars category 2mass objects
