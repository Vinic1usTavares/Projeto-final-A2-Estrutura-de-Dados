serbian tradition and a dragon man in bulgarian macedonian and serbian traditions were men believed to have an inborn supernatural ability to protect their estate village or region against destructive weather conditions such as storms hail or torrential rains it was believed that souls of these men could leave their bodies in sleep to intercept and fight with demonic beings imagined as bringers of bad weather having defeated demons and taken away stormy clouds they brought protectors would return into their bodies and wake up tired notions associated with zduhac vetrovnjak and dragon man respectively are not identical dragon man fought against female demons called ala which led hail clouds over fields to destroy crops and consumed fertility of fields zduhaci plural of an area usually fought together against attacking zduhaci of another area who were bringing a storm and hail clouds above their fields victorious zduhaci would loot yield of all agricultural produce from territory of their defeated foes and take it to their own region vetrovnjak recorded in parts of western serbia fought against a bringer of bad weather imagined as a black bird zduhaci are recorded in montenegro

herzegovina part of bosnia and sandzak region of south western serbia a man who was thought to be able to protect his estate village or region from bad weather was called a zduhac or a these names have a number of variants which can be with or without h with v instead of h with or without ending c and with c instead of c kulisic petrovic pantelic 1970 pp 139 41 according to philologist franz miklosich serbian word stuhac is cognate with old slavonic or elements which stem from old greek element miklosich 1886 p 327 latter name is origin of modern greek stikhio stoikheio denoting various kinds of spirits in greek folklore such as those fighting for well being of their village or area against adverse spirits from elsewhere plotnikova 2008 para 10 according to linguists petar and norbert stuhac stems from albanian storm deric 1930 p 48 in any case form zduhac may have resulted from folk etymology through association with serbian duh spirit 1994 p 264 65 notion that human being consists of body and soul is found in traditional slavic culture there was a belief among south slavs that in some people soul could leave body and again return into it radenkovic 1996 pp 12 13 zduhac belonged to such people in serbian tradition it was thought that after a zduhac fell asleep his soul could fly out of his body or go into winds as it was said in montenegro dordevic 1953 pp 237 1901 pp 528 29 in some accounts it exited body in form of a fly zduhac s soul had power to direct motion of winds and clouds if body of sleeping zduhac was rotated so that his head and feet changed places or if he was carried away from where he fell asleep his soul would not be able to return into his body and zduhac would die although zduhaci plural could be women and children most were adult men their supernatural power was thought to be inborn in many regions it was regarded that zduhaci were born with a caul white or red depending on regional belief mother would dry caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by child such as a pouch attached under child s armpit in clan of kuci eastern montenegro mother would preserve caul hiding it from all eyes and hand it to her son when he grew up caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhac if caul was destroyed child s supernatural power would be lost a birthmark of a zduhac in herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm in montenegrin littoral caul played no role in birth of zduhaci who were rather born on certain fridays at a set hour there was also a belief in herzegovina that male children who were conceived on eves of great feast days would become zduhaci dordevic 1953 pp 239 40 a 19th century ethnographic account from eastern herzegovina describes a way through which a man who was not born as a zduhac could become one forty days after he ceased praying to god and washing his face man should go to some level ground before he drew a circle on ground and sat in its centre soon devil would come and ask man whether he was willing to join his army and what form he wanted to be transformed into when man stated desired form devil would turn him into that making him a zduhac in region of semberija northeast bosnia a zduhac could pass his supernatural power on to his son 1974 p 102 appearance of zduhaci was not much different from that of ordinary people but they had some traits that set them apart they were deep sleepers very hard to wake up often drowsy pensive thoughtful and solemn their faces were often puffy eyes shadowy they were wise and shrewd successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems their households were prosperous dordevic 1953 pp 241 42 in semberija zduhaci were said to be good diviners and to be able to communicate with domestic animals clan of from montenegrin littoral claimed that zduhaci could hear any doings anywhere in world if someone stepped on a zduhac s foot they could hear that too kordic 1990 pp 220 21 clan of kuci held that zduhaci were outstanding long jumpers adverse weather such as a storm or hail could devastate crop fields and orchards and thus jeopardize livelihood of farmers in affected area a role of zduhaci according to folk tradition was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates villages or regions to save their crops a zduhac could take storms and hail clouds over territory of another zduhac to destroy its crops other zduhac would fly up to confront bringer of bad weather and there would be a fight between zduhaci dordevic 1953 pp 242 44 they fought alone or in bands composed of individuals from same area thus it was thought that zduhaci from eastern bosnia fought together against those from herzegovina and montenegro zduhaci from sandzak fought jointly against albanian zduhaci on adriatic coast battles were waged between a band of zduhaci from herzegovina serbia montenegro and northern albania on one side and a band of zduhaci from apulia in southeast italy on other side latter were also called transmarine zduhaci as apulia is situated across adriatic sea from montenegro each band had its leader a man named mato 1774 1870 from village of korita in herzegovina was reputed supreme commander of herzegovinian and montenegrin zduhaci dordevic 1953 pp 245 46 he was also a famous seer dordevic 1953 pp 249 50 according to some accounts zduhaci flew and fought mostly in spring when strong winds blew and as held in some regions only during night as recorded in montenegro zduhaci went into winds usually during nativity fast 15 november 24 december when there was not much snow and winds were forceful they also flew frequently from mid february to end of march in some years they were not active at all thumb a stick of luc could be turned into most powerful zduhac weapon if it was charred at both ends zduhaci of a band would leave their bodies in sleep and gather at an appointed place before flying into a battle they used various weapons such as spindles beech buds sharp splinters leaves stalks of straw fluff flakes sand long twigs cornel stones pine cones eggshells and other light objects as believed in herzegovina zduhaci uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them however most powerful zduhac weapon was held to be a stick of luc resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling charred at both ends or any charred splinter of wood a zduhac who was hit with this weapon would surely die people therefore avoided igniting sticks at both ends and they took care that no splinters were left half burned rovinski 1901 pp 530 31 beside weapons each zduhac carried a milk bucket and a peck measure an alternative for latter could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor if a band of zduhaci succeeded to seize peck measures from enemy band they would thereby transfer crop yield from area of their enemies to their own area seizing milk buckets meant that milk yield would be transferred according to clan of kuci zduhaci used their peck measures milk buckets and other containers to grab off overall yield of enemy territory battles of zduhaci were furious they were accompanied by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust dordevic 1953 pp 247 48 in montenegro it was considered dangerous to throw stones in wind because that might knock out an eye of a zduhac who would kill culprit rovinski 1901 p 533 a fighting zduhac was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhac he should hit and not get hit victorious band of zduhaci would loot yield of all agricultural produce from territory of their defeated foes harvest in coming season would thus be excellent for victors and poor for defeated zduhaci after battle soul of zduhac would return into his body and he would wake up weak and exhausted if he was wounded he would be sick for some time afterwards before he recovered or died if his wound was mortal there are records of seriously ill men who claimed that they were wounded in zduhac battles it was held in montenegrin littoral that a mortally wounded zduhac could still recuperate if he revenged himself on his before eighth day of his wound expired pavel rovinski russian philologist and ethnographer recorded a story told to him by a man of clan of ceklin in southern montenegro rovinski also heard a similar story in montenegrin littoral rovinski 1901 pp 531 32 there was a ceklin zduhac who was so beaten by other zduhaci that he had to die and there he was dying various remedies were brought to him but he accepted none because all was in vain finally he had everybody ushered out of his house except for one of his brothers a famous hero all were also driven away from door to prevent eavesdropping then dying man said to his brother i will surely die if i am not substituted for and you can do it and save me if you will have enough strength brother of course promised that and sick man continued you will have to go tonight to mount so and so at three to four hours walking distance from here most of way lying through a dense forest you will come beneath a stair like cliff and stop there and a great fear will seize you to encourage yourself take your two pistols and a knife with silver sheath i will also take a musket added brother and sick man said you may take that too though only as an encouragement as it will be of no use to you but you must have knife i can go without any weapon with a pocket knife if it is against a single and with a weapon i can go against a hundred interrupted brother again take it easy with your boldness resumed sick man and by all means take knife when you come beneath cliff sky will be cloudless lit and there will be a silence in air then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from direction of mount rumija and wind will start to blow wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all sky and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before wind will blow whistle roar and shriek as you have also never heard before hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap and i fear that you may go mad from horror and if you persevere you will see three bulls falling down from cloud on earth a light haired a pied and a dark haired bull latter two will start to beat former which is weakest because it is already wounded make sure to strike two bulls with knife but take care not to cut light haired bull that would be death of me as it would be if two bulls overcame light haired bull having heard all of that brother took two pistols poured more gunpowder and sharpened flints he put pistols into his belt placed knife between them and slung a musket over his shoulder he set forth he passed through dark forest he came beneath stair like cliff moon and stars were shining so it was like a day a silence all around him pleasant he sat down and lit his pipe before long a wisp of cloud showed from direction of mount rumija there came a roar and bluster and everything happened as sick man said his hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head finally three bulls fell down from storm cloud and started to fight all as it was said he stabbed pied bull in neck with knife it staggered and fell light haired bull got encouraged then he stabbed dark haired bull and it slumped light haired was finishing them off with its horns this was not enough for him and fearing that cut bulls could still rise up he kept on striking them with knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies storm cloud suddenly disappeared together with it light haired bull vanished again moon and stars shone again a silence and blessedness he was going back home as if flying when he arrived he found his brother sitting by hearth placing logs on fire healthy as if he had never been sick an interpretation of story about ceklin zduhac is given in an essay by literary theoretician kordic according to him story is a product of symbolic scheme of culture of montenegrin serbs kordic 1990 pp 135 143 story comprises a zduhac narration and a heroic narration kordic 1990 p 129 former is based on mythological beliefs in zduhaci which were strongest in montenegro latter is based on heroic ideology exalting death in battle which was a predominant trait of montenegrin society kordic 1990 pp 184 195 zduhac and famous hero symbolize respectively two systems of montenegrin culture at its beginning story is placed in framework of first system but it is realized with means and on ideological plane of second system kordic 1990 pp 136 37 beaten zduhac who is supposed to die diverges from mythological pattern and he replaces himself with hero kordic 1990 pp 162 63 this results in an ironic twist fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back apparently happy ending degrades zduhac into a subject without identity kordic argues using mostly psychoanalysis that there is a third silent narration in story that of death drive which crumbles other two narrations in a story recorded in area of a zduhac was mortally wounded on mount lovcen in a battle against transmarine zduhaci dying zduhac disclosed way in which he could be saved and one of his relatives acted according to instructions he went by night to a valley where he saw horses oxen rams billy goats men and women he passed by them in total silence before he saw a black ox he struck ox with a wooden bar and animal roared tremendously when he returned home he found zduhac sound and healthy as believed in region of birac eastern bosnia a mortally wounded zduhac could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket and himself with smoke using a spindle to wave smoke toward himself before performing this rite he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhac most zduhaci would reputedly rather die than do that because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaci as thought in herzegovina a man who did not want to be a zduhac anymore should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore dordevic 1953 p 250 zduhaci were regarded as a blessing for their home and village as guardians of prosperity and well being of their region and as good honest just and law obeying people in region of birac zduhaci were said to meet with angels on leaves of high and thick branches they were sometimes thought to have a prophetic gift however a zduhac could ally himself with devil and use his innate power in accordance with devil s directions that zduhac was doomed to turn into a vampire unless he confessed and repented some influential historical persons were believed to have been zduhaci such as warrior and writer marko and petar i petrovic njegos who was prince bishop of montenegro from 1784 to 1830 mahmud bushatli ottoman pasha of skadar in northern albania was reputed a powerful zduhac in montenegro it was claimed that his mother carried him for three years bushatli was defeated and killed by montenegrins under petar i while attempting to subdue them in 1796 since that time crop yield in montenegro and northern albania was allegedly not as high as before bushatli was said to have fought for crop yield against transmarine zduhaci petar i was reported saying of him i regret his death although he was my biggest enemy after bushatli was killed his body was burned according to oral accounts green flames rose from it in south slavic tradition green could be associated with supernatural creatures like witches and dragons radenkovic 1996 pp 305 6 an individual domestic animal could also be regarded as a zduhac such as a shepherd dog ox bellwether horse or billy goat if an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep it was assumed to be a zduhac such an animal was cherished and was not for sale spirit of animal zduhac would leave its body in sleep and fight against enemy zduhaci to protect its own flock or herd only fertility of livestock depended on outcome of battles fought by animal zduhaci they had no bearing on crop yield dordevic 1953 p 244 in region of uzice western serbia it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaci who flew above them in form of big birds a black ox and a three year old rooster defended their village from them especially rooster for which reason he was not killed for food but kept as a home guardian in folk spells for repelling hail clouds in serbia these clouds were called white cattle this could be compared with idea of black ox as a defender from hail tolstoy tolstaya 1981 p 112 in some regions of southern montenegro such as bay of kotor and and in parts of herzegovina a man who acted as a zduhac was called a vjedogonja or dordevic 1953 p 1997 pp 196 97 there was a rule if a child was born with a caul girl would become a witch and boy would become a vjedogonja this could have been prevented by cutting caul on a trough for feeding dogs and throwing it away child would then grow up into an ordinary person while zduhaci and vjedogonje plural protected their community from threats coming from outside witches were enemy within doing harm primarily to their own relatives and friends kulisic petrovic pantelic 1970 p 64 a correspondence between witches and vjedogonje can be seen in a passage from mountain wreath a poetic drama by petar ii petrovic njegos plot of which takes place in 18th century montenegro bog sa nama i a evo si u ka u al u jesen vjedogonja petrovic njegos 1952 p and his angels be with us why here you have dashed o bishop into some confused winds like a witch when she dashes in march or a vjedogonja when he dashes in gloomy autumn a man named vukota said these words to bishop danilo one of main characters of mountain wreath who previously uttered a piercing vision speaking as if he was alone second and third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is to dash into a frenzied countenance meaning to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation petrovic njegos 1952 pp 37 38 174 76 vukota compared bishop danilo s exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body it was thought that witches held an assembly each year on 1 march dordevic 1953 p 28 and vjedogonje mostly flew during long autumn nights especially when strong winds blew after vukota s words bishop danilo started as if from a dream vjedogonje fought in regional bands their weapons being huge boulders or gigantic trees which they uprooted with one hand leaders among them were those who had a tail and were hairy a 19th century ethnographic account describes that when a man regarded as a vjedogonja dies they drive hawthorn spines under his nails and cut tendons beneath his knees with a knife whose sheath is black so that he could not get out of his grave like a vampire karadzic 1867 p 215 petar i petrovic njegos preached among people against superstition he strongly condemned denunciation and persecution of women as witches after one such incident in 1830 in south montenegro petar i wrote an epistle mentioning vjedogonje in a sentence nowhere have i found nor has anyone told me that witches and vjedogonje exist except in blind and sad serbian people because it is blind and believes lies rather than christ s gospel and christ s teachings and commands petrovic njegos 2000 para 41 in folklore of croats of a region in northern dalmatia there were men called vidogoja they were believed to know past and future things people paid them to cure sick which they did by saying prayers and making sign of cross all over patient s body vidogoja were also thought to be able to inflict diseases on people and to have evil eyes they could not fly 1896 p 227 vetrovnjak vilovit and oblacar in region of mount in western serbia man who protected fields of his village from bad weather was called a vetrovnjak name is derived from wind at onset of a storm vetrovnjak would fall into a trance like sleep it was thought that his soul then flew skywards to fight against some black bird which led storm and hail clouds after he woke up he had to rest for some time to restore his physical strength it was believed that a vetrovnjak could take bad clouds over estate of a man with whom he was in a conflict zecevic 1981 p 149 in region of western serbia people told of vilovit men who would disappear at sight of hail clouds reappearing bloody and with torn clothes after storm was over asked where

and blue from blows defenders were victorious and moved storm to a mountain away from their fields glisic 1969 p 74 serbian writer janko veselinovic was well acquainted with folklore of tamnava where he worked as a teacher in a village in his short story published in 1888 an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings including her co villager petar a vetrenjak as soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder petar leaves whatever he may be doing and goes somewhere he runs so fast that no biped can overtake him after he passes cloud he comes back naked and blue as indigo then he has to stay in bed for a week and do you know why he is like that he told me hanged and drowned people from surrounding villages drive clouds toward our village and petar will not let hail beat us he fights with them until he will overpower them or they him petar said we uproot oaks as one would pull onion bulbs from ground and beat each other with them veselinovic 1896 p 20 a vetrenjak from village of had reportedly claimed that he clashed with oxen and rams led by devils whose aim was to discharge hail over his village seeing hail clouds people in tamnava would shout keep your cattle out of our crops thus they addressed hanged and drowned persons who were imagined to fly before clouds and lead them farmers avoided leaving a harrow on field as they thought that hail bringing devils could slam it on head of vetrenjak who defended village people behaved amicably toward vetrenjaks but they warned their children to keep off from them as these men had business with devils in 2004 ethnographers interviewed elderly people in a group of hamlets south west of town of valjevo who defined vetrenjak as a man able to direct movement of clouds when such a man died wind would suddenly start to blow and clouds would loom term vetrenjak also designated a man who could fly invisible which he usually did by night he was born with a caul which was thrown away and eaten by birds 2006 pp 320 21 in folklore of serbs in region of syrmia protection from hail was provided by men called name is derived from oblak cloud oblacar would rush directly beneath a dark cloud as soon as it appeared above fields of his village there he would run to and fro waving his arms or holding a stick raised in direction of cloud he would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched in this way oblacar fought against a gigantic serpentine demon called azdaja which was thought to fly accompanied by its retinue in low dark clouds spewing hail from its broad muzzle if cloud moved away from his village without discharging hail it meant that oblacar had overpowered azdaja and its retinue an oblacar in village of annually received wheat from his co villagers as a reward for his struggle tolstoy tolstaya 1981 pp 106 7 dragon man men who defended their village from bad weather were referred to as dragons in eastern and southern serbia western bulgaria and macedonia

fertility of fields whenever he noticed an ala approaching dragon would fly up into clouds to fight against demon and chase her away he shot fiery arrows and stones at her which produced lightning and thunder trojanovic 1983 p 151 in regions where people believed in zduhaci dragon was a highly regarded mythological being but he was not associated with crops and their protection from demons plotnikova 1998 pp 164 65 similar was case in other than western regions of bulgaria dragon man was believed to act similar to mythological dragon as soon as he saw bad weather approaching which he knew was brought by an ala he would leave whatever he was doing and fly up to confront demon this he did by falling into a deep sleep or entering a state similar to death usually at very spot where he happened to be at that time his soul then left his body in form of a snake or a lizard and soared skywards it was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body battle could last for a whole day or even for several days during which time man lay unconscious sweating profusely from exertion of fight there was a danger that during course of battle ala might approach man s body and harm him which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him or by sticking blade at lying man s head trojanovic 1983 pp 145 1981 p 150 he should not be pushed or moved while in this state if he was not in same position as when he fell asleep his soul would not be able to return into his body and he would die when he woke up after battle with ala he was very tired

guardian ala zecevic 1981 pp 152 53 people interpreted hail ravaging their crops as a defeat of their ala by an ala from elsewhere radenkovic n d para 7 victorious ala would loot crop yield of ravaged

pick cotton spin yarn from it weave a cloth from yarn made a shirt from cloth and finally dress dragon boy in shirt as thought in region of leskovac serbia such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala when three old women spun yarn knitted a shirt and dressed child in it all this had to be done in one day and one night during which time three women should not have spoken a single word a similar custom was recorded in western bulgaria where it was also believed that soul of boy while he slept in his cradle left his body and walked around if he was turned he would die as his soul could not return into his body according to a belief power of dragon boys was greatest at time of their birth younger they were greater power they had in a folk tale from eastern serbia a group of dragons surrounded an ala which broke away and flew into a watermill there was a woman in mill with her baby who was a dragon boy he grabbed a stone and killed ala with it it was recorded in region of

other humans prophet elijah was also regarded as a protector from ale as soon as he spotted an ala consuming fertility of fields he would summon dragons and harness them to his flying chariot they then together attacked demon shooting fiery arrows at her instead of dragons prophet could summon dragon men they would then fall asleep and their souls would rush to thundering clouds to assist

ginzburg 1991 p 211 in sicily women and girls had nocturnal meetings in spirit with so called di women from outside which could be traced back to ancient ecstatic cult of mothers of of cretan origin ginzburg 1991 pp 122 24 were men from ariege in pyrenees who could see and talk to souls of dead ginzburg 1991 p 89 were women and girls in georgia who plunged into a lethargy and travelled in spirit to land of dead to communicate with them ginzburg 1991 p 194 theories on origin zduhaci dragon men and related folkloric figures of europe can be compared with eurasian shamans 2006 pp 216 1993 p 129 e g of lapps as well as shamans of and tungus in siberia ginzburg 1991 pp 170 72 they were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against enemies of their community shamans also fought against each other usually in animal form for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible however for a shaman s soul to leave his body he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming dancing chanting and even taking narcotics all zduhaci had to do was to fall asleep although unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy kordic 1990 pp 76 77 there are detailed and eventful descriptions of journey of shaman s soul but no corresponding accounts exist in case of zduhaci however zduhaci who left their bodies were said to have gone into winds this expression may contain an idea of a journey kordic 1990 p 71 pavel rovinski recorded words he heard from his landlady in montenegro on a windy night in march listen how they sing travellers they have gone high high happy journey to them crucial difference between shamans and their european counterparts lies in fact that ecstasy of former was public while that of latter was always private historian carlo ginzburg asserts that t his divergence stands starkly against a homogeneous background ginzburg regards all of them as mediators with realm of dead who are ambiguous dispensers of prosperity ecstasy represents a temporary death ginzburg 1991 p 186 accounts in which figures fly or fight materially rather than in spirit are attempts to describe an ecstatic experience perceived as absolutely real ginzburg argues adopting a diffusionist approach that shamanistic elements of european folkloric figures have their original source in shamanism of siberian nomads and their diffusion was possibly mediated by scythians ginzburg 1991 pp 212 13 another possibility is that shamanistic beliefs are derived from a common source their nucleus could have developed in a remote past from cultural interactions between proto indo europeans speakers of proto uralic language and ancient populations of caucasus ginzburg 1991 pp 216 17 a third possibility is derivation from structural characteristics of human mind this is suggested by persistence of shamanistic phenomena over a long period and their dispersion over a large area in culturally disparate societies these three possibilities are not mutually exclusive in literature in novel gora by mihailo lalic set in montenegro during second world war there is a negative character kosto nicknamed zduvac a local variant of zduhac kosto is described as an elderly man of great strength he says that when he lived in america italian mafiosi called him il mago magician or sorcerer which he
