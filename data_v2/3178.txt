withdraw twice success of germans defenders in maintaining their hold on airfield except for north end and carpiquet village left canadians in a salient which was counter attacked several times failure of brigade to reach all its objectives led to doubts about fitness of keller for his command although preparations for operation charnwood might have been reason for keller delegating planning
