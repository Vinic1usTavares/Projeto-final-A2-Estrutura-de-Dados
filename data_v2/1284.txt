julie benz reprised her role as rita as a special guest star in a flashback to her and dexter s first date and as a corpse development casting and characterization 200px thumb right julie benz portrayed rita morgan for four seasons of dexter character of rita bennett was originally invented by jeff lindsay for his series of novels about dexter morgan and she is featured in all but final book in series clyde phillips and melissa rosenberg wanted to bring character into television series when casting for tv version dexter julie benz was given a copy of script in 2005 and was asked to audition for part she was surprised because script was one of best pilot scripts she ever read she also read for part of debra and joked that she would have auditioned for dexter s role benz had been a fan of michael c hall from his role in six feet under she said in an interview with vanity fair i was such a fan to point where my cell phone ring was show s theme song i had to change it once i got cast benz performed for four seasons until her character was killed in series rita is presented in series as a loving and caring mother as a result of being abused by her husband rita has no interest in sex which suits asexual dexter perfectly she developed a strong character at beginning of season two producers approached benz about character growth they wanted to make rita stronger and less shattered than she was in first season benz has said that she was very sad to hear that because i loved playing her in season one where she was this very damaged fragile bird who was just struggling so hard to make a better world for her kids but just could not do it death rita s death was alluded to by dexter producers who told media outlets getaway included a series changing twist leading to widespread speculation about it security precautions were taken to prevent finale s secrets from becoming exposed network staff members were forced to sign non disclosure agreements and decoy scripts were drafted and disseminated to protect twist ending in one of alternatives dexter learned about a child murderer escaping from prison and tried to decide whether to join rita on vacation or go after escaped killer nobody but essential cast and staff were allowed on set during filming of episode and scripts and dvds of episode were watermarked before they were taken off set clyde phillips claimed dexter staff did not know how finale would conclude until late in season but he said rita s death began to feel inevitable as story evolved benz said she had been told that lithgow knew about it from beginning of season phillips said staff felt obligated to do more than kill trinity killer in final episode especially because he felt death of third season antagonist played by jimmy smits was not handled as well as we could have writers discussed idea of having debra find out about dexter s secret life but decided they could not anticipate how drastically series would be changed by that benz heard rumors from david zayas that her character would be killed in episode but she was not notified until much later producers met with her day before season finale script was distributed to cast she said it was a tough meeting in a bizarre way it felt like a scene from defending your life benz described death scene as very poetic clyde philips said she wasn t happy she loved being with us we loved having her with us she took it professionally she was greatly disappointed she s a professional she works in television she knew that this was a possibility mystery writer j a wrote in los angeles times yes it s a bit of a shock to discover that some of tv series characters who died last season or season before are back among living between covers of lindsay s new book rita dexter s long suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year s season finale is alive and well and having a baby in dexter is delicious but my advice to readers is this don t quibble get over it after all fiction is an alternate universe to begin with and lindsay s dark comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed reception critical reaction character of rita has been well received by critics who praised benz s portrayal eric goldman of ign has said dexter does a solid job of developing roles of supporting cast with rita deb doakes and laguerta all getting a good amount of development he added there were a couple of forced moments in popping cherry most notably drug dealer who came to rita s house in broad daylight demanding money for her ex husband s debts it was all a bit over top and cliche on other hand it was interesting to note dexter s inaction in that scene making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense even for rita might result in him going too far and revealing what he is jarett wieselman of new york post has said rita always felt like light in that dark show and in beginning rita was vessel through which audience could love dexter ugo com placed rita bennett 7th on a list of top 11 girlfriends on tv zap2it created a poll entitled best mom as part of their greatest tv characters series of polls rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters tv com staff were less appreciative listing her as 7th out of ten most annoying characters on tv they noted that while we mostly love beatific julie benz her complaining character has been reduced to little more than whimpering and murmuring about dexter s commitment to family and summarised with might rita die next week for first time since series began we really feel like we wouldn t miss her rita was killed in fourth season finale getaway this was a subject of controversy since character continuing living in books e writer kristin dos santos called ending horrifying and said this death just might go down as one of most shocking deaths ever on television claire zulkey said that twist ending was intense and teleplay was woven with feature several moments that had led him to expect different conclusions he praised what he expected to be a re set of series after rita s death marcia white of express times declared dexter one of best cable dramas on tv and called final scene between dexter and rita completely shocking mark dawidziak of plain dealer said episode was shocking and suspenseful calling dexter a series that leaves you guessing as
