neilston is a village and parish in east renfrewshire in west central lowlands of scotland it is in levern valley southwest of barrhead south of paisley and south southwest of renfrew at southwestern fringe of greater glasgow conurbation neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5 000 people neilston is mentioned in documents from 12th century when feudal lord robert de croc endowed a chapel to paisley abbey to north neilston parish church a category b listed building is said to be on site of this original chapel and has been at centre of community since 1163 little remains of original structure before industrialisation neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single storey houses many of them thatched some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching flax urbanisation and development of neilston came largely with industrial revolution industrial scale textile processing was introduced to neilston around middle of 18th century with building of several cotton mills neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in 18th century which developed into a spinning and dying industry and continued into early 20th century although neilston is known as a former milling village agriculture has played and continues to play an economic role annual neilston agricultural show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest scotland each spring although heavy industry died out in latter half of 20th century as part of scotland s densely populated central belt neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village supported by its position between paisley and glasgow from roughly 1 000 people in 1800 to 5 168 in 2001 expansion continues due to several new housing developments history local historians have proposed various theories for origin of name neilston although first element is likely to derive from either gaelic forename niall genitive neill or else from french nigel there is disagreement as to whether second element represents english stone or town earliest mention of neilston is in chartulary of paisley abbey which mentions that anglo norman knight robert croc of assigned patronage of to monks of st mirren s in 1163 on condition that masses should be regularly said for benefit of his soul g w s barrow suggested that settlement may be identified with follower of walter fitz alan lord of kyle and strathgryfe and liege lord of robert croc named nigel de cotentin despite this some writers have given etymological explanations which post date 1163 for instance it has been written that neil was a general of king haakon iv of norway who fleeing from battle of largs 1263 was overtaken in this locality and put to death according to custom of age a burial mound was supposedly erected over his grave and locality ultimately received name of general in a similar semi legendary popular etymology neilston s origin was said to derive from a stone erected over grave of a highland chief named neil who was allegedly killed at battle of harlaw 1411 in reign of king james i of scotland before its recorded history began and possibly before its founding territory of what became neilston is known to have formed part of ancient kingdom of strathclyde evidence attests that neilston is much older than its larger neighbour barrhead as first recorded mention of barrhead was almost 600 years after neilston s mention in chartulary of paisley abbey of 1163 chartulary dealt with foundation of clunaic monastery in paisley and its relationship to a chapel in neilston which were both answerable to rome via clunaic movement because of its chapel which later became a parish church neilston was most important settlement in levern valley and much of rural renfrewshire in middle ages neilston s position in barrhead gap a pass linking ayrshire to glasgow gave it strategic importance robert croc may have had a fort or watchtower at coldoun in neilston in 12th century doun is a corruption of dun meaning castle or fort and prefix perhaps implies lack of physical warmth within tower or greeting received by unwelcome guests despite this distinction of local importance neilston remained a scattered community of small dwellings and farms changing only with arrival of industrial revolution in 17th century neilston shared in a national hysteria about witchcraft that plagued scotland in 1650 a number of people from inverkip linwood and neilston were accused of witchcraft however they passed certain tests which would disprove them to be witches in 1697 christian shaw of succeeded in convincing a minister that she was a victim of witchcraft a commission of enquiry which included laird of was appointed to investigate as a result of investigation later known as paisley witch trials four women and three men were arrested and eventually condemned to death and executed at paisley minister of neilston church reverend david brown officiated at hanging he preached to them before execution beseeching them to turn to god god having exercised a great deal of long suffering towards them foundations of a textile industry in neilston were laid by monks of paisley abbey who mastered local woollen trade in middle ages neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in 18th century this developed into a spinning and dying industry and continued into early 20th century bleachfields and textile processing brought rapid socioeconomic growth to village neilston was one of earliest centres of textile manufacture during industrial revolution process of bleaching linens was introduced into neilston in 1765 and a mill in parish was second erected in scotland by 1780 cotton manufacturing and bleaching had become main industry in neilston clear busy waters of river levern being well suited for power and processing in old statistical account of scotland 1792 compiled under direction of sir john sinclair of neilston was noted to have two cotton mills employing together more than 300 people over half of
