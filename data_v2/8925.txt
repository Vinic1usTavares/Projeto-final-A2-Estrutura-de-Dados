operation sandwedge was a proposed clandestine intelligence gathering operation against political enemies of richard nixon presidential administration proposals were put together by h r haldeman john ehrlichman and jack caulfield in 1971 caulfield a former police officer created a plan to target democratic party and anti vietnam war movement inspired by what he believed to be democratic party s employment of a private investigation firm operation was planned to help nixon s 1972 re election campaign operation sandwedge included proposed surveillance of nixon s enemies to gather information on their financial status and sexual activities to be carried out through illegal black bag operations control of sandwedge was passed to g gordon liddy who abandoned it in favor of a strategy of his own devising operation gemstone which detailed a plan to break into democratic party offices in watergate complex liddy s plan eventually led to downfall of nixon s presidency which caulfield believed would have been avoided had sandwedge been acted upon background in 1968 richard nixon united states republican party nominee won presidential election defeating democrat hubert humphrey by seven tenths of a percent of popular vote nixon appointed h r haldeman as his chief of staff this position granted haldeman a relatively large degree of control over activities of presidential administration haldeman had first worked for nixon in 1956 during nixon s successful bid for vice presidency under dwight d eisenhower by 1971 nixon s staff were receiving a cursory intelligence report from haldeman s assistant gordon c strachan strachan s reports essentially collated information about political rallies and campaign groups that had already been gathered by police and federal bureau of investigation prior to this nixon s initial election bid had already involved planting of rumors and false information about his opponents as a dedicated strategy these tactics had been dubbed political hardball by nixon s opposition researcher pat buchanan in august 1971 strachan had convinced jeb stuart magruder a member of committee for re election of president crp campaign group for nixon s re election bid to infiltrate office of edmund muskie muskie was a democratic senator who had been humphrey s 1968 vice presidential candidate and was a front runner for his party s presidential bid for 1972 campaign inception in late 1971 john dean white house counsel pushed to expand existing intelligence program ahead of 1972 re election campaign dean delegated task to jack caulfield a member of his staff who was a former new york police officer according to dean caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics he intended to create a private security company and felt that if nixon cabinet were an early client it would lead to lucrative future clients within private sector fred emery a journalist for times and bbc refutes this claiming in his book watergate corruption fall of richard nixon that idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working nixon and republican party with political donations to re election campaign able to be diverted through company as though they were unrelated transactions john ehrlichman a long time friend of haldeman who had also served as white house counsel had been part of operation s inception at this time he was nixon s domestic affairs assistant ehrlichman was one who had initially hired caulfield in 1969 ehrlichman intended for caulfield to conduct private investigation while undercover as a private sector employee it was caulfield who insisted on working from white house caulfield s work to this end had already resulted in two wiretaps on phone lines one on nixon s brother donald and another on journalist joseph kraft caulfield prepared a twelve page draft proposal detailing an intelligence gathering strategy aimed at opposition democratic party he had worked on this draft for several months and presented it to nixon s staff in september 1971 proposal dubbed operation sandwedge called for a budget of 500 000 primarily to cover private investigative work and security for republican national convention however caulfield intimated privately that it would also include electronic surveillance planned activities investigations and surveillance would in part assess how anti vietnam war movement could damage nixon s campaign nixon s staff also anticipated that democratic campaign would employ services of a private investigation firm led by former department of justice officials who had served under robert f kennedy a democrat and former attorney general caulfield noted that this firm had potential to employ formidable and sophisticated intelligence gathering techniques and sandwedge was his attempt to create a republican counterpart to it plan would involve black bag operations targeting political enemies of campaign electronic surveillance was also an element of proposal with plans to scrutinize private lives of targets including their tax records and sexual habits sandwedge proposal also included a list of people willing to work with caulfield on project these included several investigators and officials of inland revenue and a former sheriff of cook county illinois herb kalmbach nixon s own attorney transferred 50 000 to caulfield at request of john n mitchell mitchell had served as attorney general under nixon s first term and directed 1972 re election campaign caulfield was also given responsibility for salary of tony ulasewicz an operative he planned to use for sandwedge activities however strachan dean and other staff members were frustrated at pace of caulfield s development of project strachan directly questioned whether caulfield was adequately capable for role in a memo dated from october 1971 while haldeman wishing for a project on a larger scale pressed mitchell for a budget of 800 000 for surveillance and miscellaneous activities during this time caulfield recruited james w mccord jr a retired cia officer to protect offices of republican national convention and crp from electronic bugging mccord would later be directly employed by crp from january 1972 caulfield also sent ulasewicz to campaign offices of paul mccloskey in new hampshire mccloskey was a republican congressman for california who was running for party s presidential nomination against nixon on a platform opposing vietnam war he was not regarded as a credible threat to nixon s campaign but had made statements calling for nixon to be impeached in december 1971 ulasewicz as a journalist to interview mccloskey s staff with caulfield dubbing effort a sandwedge engineered penetration cancellation that october a meeting concerning sandwedge was arranged between haldeman mitchell magruder and strachan as a result of this meeting control of operation was passed along to g gordon liddy because mitchell wished to have a lawyer in charge of campaign s intelligence gathering another factor in caulfield s removal from helm was belief of several white house officials including dean that caulfield s irish american non college educated background was at odds with an administration of wasp professional men liddy built upon proposals to devise operation gemstone a more expansive plan of espionage gemstone was an umbrella term for several individual operations each of which expanded upon elements of sandwedge draft or existing crp activities operation diamond covered breaking up protest demonstrations ruby involved undercover infiltration and honeypot traps crystal concerned electronic surveillance and wiretaps and sapphire proposed sabotage of rival political campaigns liddy s initial draft of operation gemstone was deemed too extreme by campaign officials but a scaled down version was later approved in 1972 despite liddy s restructuring of project a request for additional funding for original sandwedge proposal was made by dean in january 1972 although mitchell s rejection of this request signalled project s end liddy s revised gemstone plan included a range of illegal activities including a proposal to break into democratic party offices in watergate complex watergate burglaries were initially assumed to have been part of operation sandwedge and investigation into both burglaries and project led to caulfield s resignation from his nixon appointed position as assistant director of criminal enforcement in bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives aftermath in wake of watergate scandal 69 people were tried for various crimes with 48 of these pleading guilty among those found guilty for covering up affair were haldeman mitchell dean and magruder while liddy was found guilty for his role in break ins all 48 men served time in prison as a result of their convictions caulfield has suggested that sandwedge s cancellation by administration was an error in judgement possibly most monumental of nixon presidency he believed that if had sandwedge been adopted as campaign s strategy there would have been no liddy no hunt no mccord and subsequent watergate scandal would not have occurred speaking of initial proposal dean defended its merits stating that caulfield not plan itself had killed sandwedge
