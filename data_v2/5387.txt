olafr gudrodarson died 1237 also known as olaf black was a thirteenth century king of isles and a member of crovan dynasty he was a son of gudrodr olafsson king of isles and fionnghuala nic lochlainn olafr was a younger son of his father olafr s elder brother rognvaldr probably had a different mother according to chronicle of mann gudrodr appointed olafr as heir since he had been born in lawful wedlock whether or not this is case after gudrodr s death in 1187 islesmen instead appointed rognvaldr as king as he was a capable adult and olafr was a mere child rognvaldr ruled island kingdom for almost forty years during which time half brothers vied for kingship olafr appears to have held authority on island of lewis and harris at some point olafr appears to have confronted rognvaldr for a larger stake in kingdom after which rognvaldr had him seized and imprisoned by king of scotland upon his release in 1214 1215 olafr is stated to have undertaken a pilgrimage to santiago de compostela after which half brothers were reconciled and rognvaldr had olafr married to lauon sister of his own wife in what appears to have been a politically motivated maneuver olafr had his marriage nullified by reginald bishop of isles and proceeded to marry cairistiona a daughter of fearchar mac an tsagairt whilst lauon appears to have been a member of clann somhairle a kindred led by ruaidhri mac raghnaill a man closely aligned with rognvaldr and opposed to scottish crown cairistiona was daughter of a rising scottish magnate in 1223 olafr s marital actions are stated to have precipitated rognvaldr s son gudrodr dond to attack olafr on lewis and harris driving him into ross to safety of his father in law together with pall balkason olafr later defeated gudrodr dond skye following year olafr confronted rognvaldr on mann and two partitioned of kingdom between themselves one of rognvaldr s allied against olafr was alan fitz roland lord of galloway who is recorded to have campaigned in isles against olafr there is reason to suspect that olafr was conversely aligned with alan s opponent in ireland hugh de lacy earl of ulster in 1226 rognvaldr and alan orchestrated marriage of a daughter of rognvaldr to alan s bastard son thomas a union that led islesmen to depose rognvaldr in favour of olafr in 1229 rognvaldr invaded mann and was killed in battle against olafr in 1230 olafr was forced from his kingdom to norway by alan and members of clann somhairle in response to this latest bout of warfare in isles hakon hakonarson king of norway decided to send a royal fleet into isles under command of ospakr an apparent member of clann somhairle when ospakr was slain early in campaign olafr took control of fleet and secured himself on mann at this point kingdom appears to have been partitioned between him and gudrodr dond with latter ruling hebridean portion and olafr ruling mann itself in 1231 after norwegian fleet left isles gudrodr dond was slain and olafr ruled whole kingdom of isles peacefully until his death in 1237 olafr s restoration was seen as a success by norwegians and likely favourably viewed by scots as well olafr was succeeded by his son haraldr in all three of olafr s sons ruled crovan dynasty s island kingdom last of which magnus was also last of dynasty to rule uncertain inheritance olafr was a member of crovan dynasty mcdonald 2007b p 27

acclaimed conclusion of campaign its only lasting achievement was olafr s restoration scots too may have welcomed this outcome considering consolidation of crovan dynasty after years of chaos and

rognvaldr s death certainly recorded history of isles between 1230s and 1240s is remarkably peaceful in comparison to other eras there is evidence to suggest that olafr had a fourth son gudrodr for

lochlann and his supporters are said to have come into conflict with hebridean supporters of haraldr and when latter returned to mann in spring chronicle reports that lochlann fled to wales with all
