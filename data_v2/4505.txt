became gravely ill and his possible death threatened to plunge roman world into chaos again historians generally agree that it is during this time that question of augustus heir became most acute and while augustus had seemed to indicate that agrippa and marcellus would carry on his position in event of his death ambiguity of succession became augustus chief problem southern pp 119 120 in response a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected among them tiberius and his brother drusus in 24 bc at age of seventeen tiberius entered politics under augustus direction receiving position of

have speculated a connection with fact that augustus had adopted julia s sons by agrippa gaius and lucius and seemed to be moving them along same political path that both tiberius and drusus had trodden levick pp 29 tiberius move thus seemed to be an interim solution he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age and then be swept aside promiscuous and very public behavior of his unhappily married wife julia velleius paterculus roman history ii 100 may have also played a part indeed tacitus calls it tiberius intima causa his innermost reason for departing for rhodes and seems to ascribe entire move to a hatred of julia and a longing for vipsania tacitus annals i 53 tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in roman forum and forbidden to see woman he had loved whatever tiberius motives withdrawal was almost disastrous for augustus succession plans gaius and lucius were still in their early teens and augustus now 57 years old had no immediate successor there was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after augustus death nor a guarantee that his family and therefore his family s allies would continue to hold power should position of princeps survive seager 2005 pp 26 somewhat apocryphal stories tell of augustus pleading with tiberius to stay even going so far as to

unjust and criminal tacitus annals i 6 he attributes apparent virtues of tiberius during his early reign to hypocrisy another major recurring theme concerns balance of power between senate and
