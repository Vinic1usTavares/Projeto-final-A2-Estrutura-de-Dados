its end lance armstrong announced that he planned to return to competitive cycling in 2009 after a four year absence as bruyneel was armstrong s team manager for all seven of his tour de france

participated in omloop het volk on march 1 with dmitriy muravyev in 31st their best placed rider sergei ivanov s 7th in amstel gold race proved to be one of team s best results all season as in other spring races in which they competed kuurne brussels kuurne tour of flanders and gent wevelgem they did not have a rider place higher than 13th due in part to ban imposed by amaury sport organisation

with 15 kilometers left to race to win event brajkovic won a sprint over s rigoberto uran for second and reacted as though he won race chris horner was also highly placed in event finishing seventh stage races astana attended tour down under for first time in 2008 as it was first year event was part of uci protour team was not very competitive in event with a fifth place in a sprint finish to stage 2 from aaron kemps as their best stage result they also led teams classification after that stage team s best placed rider in final overall classification was jose luis rubiera ranked 31st team then attended tour of california in february leipheimer was team leader for event as he was defending champion from 2007 with team discovery leipheimer assumed race lead after stage 3 having worked with rider robert gesink to gain time on peloton with gesink claiming stage win and leipheimer overall lead leipheimer padded his lead by winning individual time trial in solvang two days later and held on to win tour itself for second straight year while tour of california was ongoing astana sent another squad to volta ao algarve with tomas vaitkus claiming a win in stage 2 rubiera was victor in early march of queen stage of vuelta a murcia a stage which peloton almost refused to race because of weather and safety conditions thumb alt a cyclist wearing a blue and white jersey with yellow

nice and tirreno adriatico their next stage race was volta ao distrito de santarem a race which neither astana nor discovery channel had participated in year before team did not win any stage though andreas kloden finished on event s final podium in third astana next entered vuelta a castilla y leon with a squad that was thought to greatly outclass squads entered by other teams contador won opening time trial and mountainous fourth stage en route to winning race overall leipheimer also showed well finishing 4 seconds off contador s winning time in time trial and falling only on stage 4 where he rode in support of contador to finish in fourth overall in april team achieved great success in vuelta al pais vasco with contador winning opening stage which had seven categorized climbs and final individual time trial to win race overall just after tour of basque country was presidential cycling tour of turkey an event in which astana won a stage with gregory rast and points classification with assan bazayev later in month team sent a squad headed by leipheimer and chris horner to tour de georgia they did not win any stage but leipheimer took third overall and antonio fourth team was greatly successful at tour de romandie later in month with maxim and kloden both winning stages and kloden race overall in volta a catalunya which was concurrent to giro d italia team did not win any stage with janez brajkovic s second in stage 2 their closest result though they did win teams classification at tour de luxembourg in june rast entered as defending champion and was considered among favorites but team did not win any stage or finish on podium leipheimer won prologue time trial to dauphine libere later in month and wound up finishing third overall in race kloden next took second overall in tour de suisse later in june following month and horner raced as astana though they were only astana riders in event at cascade cycling classic and leipheimer was able to take overall win there largely thanks to a convincing victory in third stage time trial on same day rene won a stage in tour of austria later in month ivanov won tour de wallonie without winning a stage team sent squads to tour de tour de l ain tour of ireland and eneco tour but did not obtain a stage win classification win or podium finish in any of them grand tours giro d italia astana was at first not invited to giro six days before race began rcs sport organizers of giro went back on decision to exclude astana and extended them a late invitation this change of heart was at least partly contingent on contador leipheimer and kloden participating in race having thought for two months prior that they would not compete in giro most of astana s riders had planned to take a break during tour of italy and contador was actually vacationing on a beach when bruyneel called him to tell him team was headed to giro left thumb alt a cyclist in an all pink jersey crouched into an aerodynamic

only fourth in a sprint from assan bazayev in stage 4 and fifth in stage 6 by maxim from a breakaway to show for themselves through nine stages contador and kloden both showed strongly in stage 10 individual time trial with contador missing stage win by just 8 seconds kloden was third 20 seconds off marzio bruseghin s winning time and moving from eighth to fourth in overall classification high mountain stage 14 into italian alps saw contador rise to second overall just five seconds behind race leader gabriele bosisio next day contador finished twelve minutes ahead of bosisio and took race leader s pink jersey his main rival at that point was riccardo ricco who had gained 16 seconds on him that day and was only 33 back overall contador padded his lead over ricco slightly in short time trial in stage 16 and stayed out of trouble in stages 17 and 18 stages where contenders all finished together long and mountainous stage 19 saw ricco and danilo di luca both put time into contador with late attacks but not enough to take jersey from him di luca found himself effected next day losing over five minutes and falling from contention but contador and ricco finished together and were separated by just 4 seconds entering stage 21 time trial ricco was unable to challenge contador in giro s finale finishing 68th on stage and losing close to two minutes to contador who was 11th though neither contador himself nor anyone from team won any stage in giro contador took overall victory in general classification vuelta a espana astana entered vuelta with contador as a big favorite to win overall title and complete career sweep of grand tours astana s vuelta actually began with a disappointment an 8th place finish in stage 1 team time trial which either they or had been thought likeliest to win after staying out of trouble in sprinters stages 2 through 4 leipheimer won stage 5 individual time trial and contador was fourth 49 seconds back of him this gave leipheimer race leader s golden jersey by a margin of 2 seconds over sylvain chavanel it was not a lead that astana intended to defend next day however as chavanel s team drove peloton to catch morning breakaway in stage 6 so chavanel could get bonus seconds in intermediate sprints to take jersey which he did thumb upright alt a cyclist in a gold jersey with blue trim and blue shoes riding down a road with

day was longest in vuelta and contained numerous mountain climbs it was made even more difficult by a consistent downfall of rain and cold temperatures contador and leipheimer both marked competition and finished well on stage third and fifth respectively to maintain their high overall placings leipheimer regained race lead next day essentially by default as alessandro who had won difficult stage 7 quickly faded on stage 8 again astana did not work to keep leipheimer in race lead affording a breakaway that included martinez sufficient time that martinez took golden jersey next day several local newspapers criticized astana for move as and had tried to pull peloton such that astana would have no choice to defend jersey but were unable to force their hand martinez reacted to his assumption of race lead as though it were a gift from his former manager bruyneel following several stages won by sprinters and breakaways next test for riders was legendary alto de el angliru in stage 13 morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes but it was dropped to nothing on ascent of what has been called most difficult climb in all of professional cycling astana and caisse d both had many support riders in leading group going up climb and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either contador or alejandro valverde while isolating competition it was left to leipheimer to pace contador to conclusion as climb reached its hardest part 7 kilometers from finish contador indeed went on to win stage and took race lead as well contador added another stage win next day when only he and leipheimer could respond to repeated attacks of ezequiel and contador won sprint top ten in general classification finished together in next five stages which were mostly friendly to sprinters and breakaways stage 20 was another time trial one with an uphill finish this time trial was won convincingly by leipheimer as only contador and valverde were within a minute of his winning time this ride put leipheimer 46 seconds off contador s time with vuelta s final stage flat and largely ceremonial akin to champs elysees stage in tour de france this stood as final result with contador winning vuelta to complete his career triple he also won combination classification and its white jersey minor controversy followed vuelta contador alleged that leipheimer was not being a team player by seeming to ride stage 20 time trial with aim of winning vuelta after contador had apparently been decided as team s leader though team had not firmly chosen a leader as race began away from competition exclusion from aso races on february 13 it was announced that amaury sport organisation would not invite astana to any of their races that season which included tour de france paris nice and numerous one day races decision was made because of doping perpetrated by astana in its previous seasons chief among these scandals was blood doping perpetrated by alexander vinokourov in 2007 tour de france team reacted with surprise and disappointment particularly since ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed and as a result contador would not be able to defend his tour de france championship dismissal of vladimir gusev thumb upright alt two cyclists one wearing a blue and white jersey with yellow trim and other to his right a black and white jersey with red trim race

internal doping check as part of program run by dr rasmus proprietor of a noted anti doping system previously used by though values did not by themselves confirm doping on gusev s part they were taken as an indication of it firing also caused gusev to be removed from russia s team for 2008 olympic games though he originally intended to sue team in time to still take part in olympics on september 1 gusev began his appeal of firing with case eventually reaching court of arbitration for sport on june 18 2009 cas ruled that astana was in wrong regarding gusev s dismissal and ordered team to pay his lost wages legal fees and compensatory damages return of lance armstrong seven time tour de france winner lance armstrong revealed in an interview with vanity fair magazine published on september 9 that he intended to return to competitive cycling in 2009 after four years of retirement aside from trying to win an eighth tour de france his goal would be to raise public awareness and money for cancer research he would ride for no salary thumb left alt a cyclist in a black jersey with gold trim crouched into an aerodynamic position on his bicycle riding down a road armstrong training for his 2009 comeback at a time trial in new texas on november 1 it was speculated immediately that armstrong would return with team astana as it was now headed by armstrong s sporting director from each of his seven tour de france victories johan bruyneel though spokespeople for team first denied any plans to sign armstrong bruyneel commented two days later during then ongoing vuelta a espana that he had spoken to armstrong about his return and could not imagine him riding for any team but astana on september 24 armstrong signed with astana armstrong s return was not well received by contador who asserted that he had earned right to be a team leader and said he would consider leaving team if he were relegated to a role supporting armstrong team gave contador assurances in offseason that he would remain astana s team leader and contador remained with team for 2009 though controversy over who would in fact be team s leader lasted well into 2009 tour de france season victories date race
