sir henry morgan welsh harri morgan 1635 25 august 1688 was a welsh privateer plantation owner and later lieutenant governor of jamaica from his base in port royal jamaica he raided settlements and shipping on spanish main becoming wealthy as he did so with prize money from raids he purchased three large sugar plantations on island much of morgan s early life is unknown he was born in south wales but it is not known how he made his way to west indies or how he began his career as a privateer he was probably a member of a group of raiders led by sir christopher myngs in early 1660s morgan became a close friend of sir thomas modyford governor of jamaica when diplomatic relations between kingdom of england and spain worsened in 1667 modyford gave morgan a letter of marque a licence to attack and seize spanish vessels morgan subsequently conducted successful and highly lucrative raids on puerto principe now camaguey in modern cuba and porto bello in modern panama in 1668 he sailed for maracaibo and gibraltar both on lake maracaibo in modern day venezuela he raided both cities and stripped them of their wealth before destroying a large spanish squadron as he escaped in 1671 morgan attacked panama city landing on caribbean coast and traversing isthmus before he attacked city which was on pacific coast battle was a rout although privateers profited less than in other raids to appease spanish with whom english had signed a peace treaty morgan was arrested and summoned to london in 1672 but was treated as a hero by general populace and leading figures of government and royalty including charles ii morgan was appointed a knight bachelor in november 1674 and returned to jamaica shortly afterward to serve as territory s lieutenant governor he served on assembly of jamaica until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as governor of jamaica in absence of post holder a memoir published by alexandre exquemelin a former shipmate of morgan s accused privateer of widespread torture and other offences morgan brought a libel suit against book s english publishers and won although black picture exquemelin portrayed of morgan has affected history s view of welshman he died in jamaica on 25 august 1688 his life was romanticised after his death and he became inspiration for pirate themed works of fiction across a range of genres early life henry morgan was born around 1635 in wales either in glamorgan or monmouthshire both locations situated between cardiff and newport historian david williams writing in dictionary of welsh biography observes that attempts to identify his parents and antecedents have all proved unsatisfactory although his will referred to distant relations several sources state morgan s father was robert morgan a farmer zahedieh writing for oxford dictionary of national biography states that details of morgan s early life and career are uncertain although in later life he stated that he had left school early and was much more used to pike than book it is unknown how morgan made his way to caribbean he may have travelled to caribbean as part of army of robert venables sent by oliver cromwell as part of caribbean expedition against spanish in west indies in 1654 or he may have served as an apprentice to a maker of cutlery for three years in exchange for cost of his emigration richard browne who served as surgeon under morgan in 1670 stated that morgan had travelled either as a private gentleman soon after 1655 capture of jamaica by english or he may have been abducted in bristol and transported to barbados where he was sold as a servant in 17th century caribbean offered an opportunity for young men to become rich quickly although significant investment was needed to obtain high returns from sugar export economy other opportunities for financial gain were through trade or plunder of spanish empire much of plunder was from privateering whereby individuals and ships were commissioned by government to attack country s enemies career as a privateer thumb sir christopher myngs under whom morgan served it is probable that in early 1660s morgan was active with a group of privateers led by sir christopher myngs attacking spanish cities and settlements in caribbean and central america in 1663 it is likely that morgan captained one of ships in myngs fleet and took part in attack on santiago de cuba and sack of campeche on yucatan peninsula sir thomas modyford had been appointed governor of jamaica in february 1664 with instructions to limit activities of privateers he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 june 1664 but economic practicalities led to him reversing policy by end of month about 1 500 privateers used jamaica as a base for their activity and brought significant revenue to island as planting community of 5 000 was still new and developing revenue from privateers was needed to avoid economic collapse a privateer was granted a letter of marque which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels normally of a specific country or with conditions attached a portion of all spoils obtained by privateers was given to sovereign or issuing ambassador in august 1665 morgan along with fellow captains john morris and jacob returned to port royal with a large cargo of valuables modyford was impressed enough with spoils to report back to government that central america was place for an attack on spanish indies morgan s activities over following two years are not documented but in early 1666 he was married in port royal to his cousin mary morgan daughter of edward island s deputy governor marriage gave henry access to upper levels of jamaican society couple had no children hostilities between english and dutch in 1664 led to a change in government policy colonial governors were now authorised to issue letters of marque against dutch many of privateers including morgan did not take up letters although an expedition to conquer dutch island of sint eustatius led to death of morgan s father in law who was leading a 600 man force sources differ about morgan s activities in 1666 h r allen in his biography of morgan considers privateer was second in command to captain edward mansvelt mansvelt had been issued a letter of marque for invasion of curacao although he did not attack willemstad main city either after he decided that it was too well defended or that there was insufficient plunder alternatively jan rogozinski and stephan talty in their histories of morgan and piracy record that during year morgan oversaw port royal militia and defence of jamaica fort charles at port royal was partly constructed under his leadership it was around this time that morgan purchased his first plantation on jamaica attacks on puerto principe and porto bello 1667 1668 thumb upright puerto principe being sacked in 1668 in 1667 diplomatic relations between kingdoms of england and spain were worsening and rumours began to circulate in jamaica about a possible spanish invasion modyford authorised privateers to take action against spanish and issued a letter of marque to morgan to draw together english privateers and take prisoners of spanish nation whereby he might inform of intention of that enemy to attack jamaica of which i have frequent and strong advice he was given rank of admiral and in january 1668 assembled 10 ships and 500 men for task he was subsequently joined by 2 more ships and 200 men from tortuga now part of haiti morgan s letter of marque gave him permission to attack spanish ships at sea there was no permission for attacks on land any plunder obtained from attacks would be split between government and owners of ships rented by privateers if privateers stepped outside their official remit and raided a city any resultant plunder would be retained by privateers rogozinski observes that attacks on cities were illegal piracy but extremely profitable although zahedieh records that if morgan was able to provide evidence of a potential spanish attack attacks on cities were justifiable under terms of his commission morgan s initial plan was to attack havana but on discovering it was heavily defended this was changed to puerto principe now camaguey a town inland morgan and his men took town but treasure obtained was less than hoped for according to alexandre exquemelin who sailed with morgan it caused a general resentment and grief to see such a small booty when morgan reported taking of puerto principe to modyford he informed governor that they had evidence that spanish were planning an attack on british territory we found seventy men had been pressed to go against jamaica and considerable forces were expected from vera cruz and and from porto bello and cartagena to rendezvous at st jago of cuba santiago thumb left upright morgan s attack on castillo de san jeronimo porto bello after action one of english privateers quarrelled with one of his french shipmates and stabbed him in back killing him before a riot between french and english sailors could begin morgan arrested english sailor and promised french sailors that man would be hanged on his return to port royal morgan kept his word and sailor was hanged after dividing spoils of conquest of puerto principe morgan announced a plan to attack porto bello now in modern day panama city was third largest and strongest on spanish main and on one of main routes of trade between spanish territories and spain because of value of goods passing through its port porto bello was protected by two castles in harbour and another in town 200 french privateers unhappy with division of treasure and murder of their countryman left morgan s service and returned to tortuga morgan and his ships briefly landed at port royal before leaving for porto bello on 11 july 1668 morgan anchored short of porto bello and transferred his men to 23 canoes which they paddled to within of target they landed and approached first castle from landward side where they arrived half an hour before dawn they took three castles and town quickly privateers lost 18 men with a further 32 wounded zahedieh considers action at porto bello displayed a clever cunning and expert timing which marked morgan s brilliance as a military commander exquemelin wrote that in order to take third castle morgan ordered construction of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast when they were completed he commanded all religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against walls of castle these were forced at head of companies to raise and apply them to walls thus many of religious men and nuns were killed terry in his biography of morgan writes that when a translation of exquemelin s book was published in england morgan sued for libel and won passage about use of nuns and monks as a human shield was retracted from subsequent publications in england thumb morgan with a prisoner morgan and his men remained in porto bello for a month he wrote to don agustin acting president of panama to demand a ransom for city of 350 000 pesos as they stripped city of its wealth it is probable that torture was used on residents to uncover hidden caches of money and jewels zahedieh records that there were no first hand reports from witnesses that confirmed exquemelin s claim of widespread rape and debauchery after an attempt by don agustin to recapture city by force his army of 800 soldiers was repelled by privateers he negotiated a ransom of 100 000 pesos following ransom and plunder of city morgan returned to port royal with between ps70 000 and ps100 000 of money and valuables zahedieh reports that figures were more than agricultural output of jamaica and nearly half barbados s sugar exports each privateer received ps120 equivalent to five or six times average annual earnings of a sailor of time morgan received a five per cent share for his work modyford received a ten per cent share which was price of morgan s letter of marque as morgan had overstepped limits of his commission modyford reported back to london that he had reproved him for his actions although zahedieh observes in britain morgan was widely viewed as a national hero and neither he nor modyford were rebuked for their actions raids on maracaibo and gibraltar 1668 1669 thumb right maracaibo and la ceiba now gibraltar in modern day venezuela morgan did not stay long in port royal and in october 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for ile a vache a small island he used as a rendezvous point his plan was to attack spanish settlement of cartagena de indias richest and most important city on spanish main in december he was joined by a former royal navy frigate oxford which had been sent to port royal to aid in any defence of jamaica modyford sent vessel to morgan who made it his flagship on 2 january 1669 morgan called a council of war for all his captains which took place on oxford a spark in ship s powder magazine destroyed ship and over 200 of its crew morgan and captains seated on one side of table were blown into water and survived four captains on other side of table were all killed loss of oxford meant morgan s flotilla was too small to attempt an attack on cartagena instead he was persuaded by a french captain under his command to repeat actions of pirate francois l olonnais two years previously an attack on maracaibo and gibraltar both on lake maracaibo in modern day venezuela french captain knew approaches to lagoon through a narrow and shallow channel since l olonnais and french captain had visited maracaibo spanish had built san carlos de la barra fortress outside city on approach talty states that fortress was placed in an excellent position to defend town but that spanish had undermanned it leaving only nine men to load and fire fortress s 11 guns under covering cannon fire from privateer s flagship lilly morgan and his men landed on beach and stormed fortification they found it empty when they eventually breached its defences a search soon found that spanish had left a slow burning fuse leading to fort s powder kegs as a trap for buccaneers which morgan extinguished fort s guns were spiked and then buried so they could not be used against privateers when they returned from rest of their mission thumb left san carlos de la barra fortress which guarded entrance to maracaibo morgan arrived at maracaibo to find city largely deserted its residents having been forewarned of his approach by fortress s troops he spent three weeks in city ransacking and plundering what he could privateers searched surrounding jungle to find escapees they and some of remaining occupants were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden satisfied he had stolen all he could he sailed south across lake maracaibo to gibraltar town s occupants refused to surrender and fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure morgan kept his distance he anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted town from landward approach he met scant resistance as many of occupants had fled into surrounding jungle he spent five weeks in gibraltar and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables four days after he left maracaibo morgan returned he was told that a spanish defence squadron armada de barlovento was waiting for him at narrow passage between caribbean and lake maracaibo where san carlos de la barra fortress was sited forces under command of don alonso del campo y espinosa had 126 cannon with which to attack morgan and had re armed san carlos de la barra fortress spaniards had orders to end piracy in caribbean and negotiations between morgan and espinosa continued for a week final offer put by spanish commander was for morgan to leave all their spoils and slaves and to return to jamaica unmolested but no agreement was reached that would allow morgan and his men to pass fleet with their spoils but without attack morgan put spaniards offers to his men who voted instead to fight their way out as they were heavily outgunned one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at espinosa s flagship magdalen would work to this end a crew of 12 prepared a ship that had been seized in gibraltar they disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear to make spaniards believe that vessel was fully crewed to make it look more heavily armed additional portholes were cut in hull and logs placed to resemble cannons barrels of powder were placed in ship and grappling irons laced into ships rigging to catch ropes and sails of magdalen and ensure vessels would become entangled thumb morgan destroys spanish armada de barlovento at lake maracaibo 1669 on 1 may 1669 morgan and his flotilla attacked spanish squadron fire ship plan worked and magdalen was shortly aflame espinosa abandoned his flagship and made his way to fort where he continued to direct events second largest spanish ship soledad tried to move away from burning vessel but a problem with rigging meant they drifted aimlessly privateers boarded ship fixed rigging and claimed craft as plunder third spanish vessel was also sunk by privateers morgan still needed to pass san carlos de la barra fortress but was still out gunned by stronghold which had ability to destroy privateer fleet if it tried to pass privateer decided to negotiate and threatened to sack and burn maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass although espinosa refused to negotiate citizens of maracaibo entered into talks with morgan and agreed to pay him 20 000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave city intact during course of negotiations with morgan had undertaken salvage operations on magdalen and secured 15 000 pesos from wreck before taking any action morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships to ensure that it was not all lost if one ship was sunk it totalled 250 000 pesos and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves morgan observed that espinosa had set his cannon for a landward attack from privateers as they had done previously privateers faked a landing of their forces fort and its battlements were stripped of men as spanish prepared for a night assault from english forces that evening with spanish forces deployed to repel a landing morgan s fleet raised anchor without unfurling their sails fleet moved on tide only raising sail when they had moved level with fortress and morgan and his men made their way back to port royal unscathed zahedieh considers escape showed morgan s characteristic cunning and audacity during his absence from port royal a pro spanish faction had gained ear of king charles ii and english foreign policy had changed accordingly modyford admonished morgan for his action which had gone beyond his commission and revoked letters of marque no official action was taken against any of privateers morgan invested a share of his prize money in an plantation his second such investment attack on panama 1669 1672 thumb upright left morgan before panama 1671 c 1736 engraving used to illustrate captain charles johnson s general history in 1669 mariana queen regent of spain ordered attacks on english shipping in caribbean first action took place in march 1670 when spanish privateers attacked english trade ships in response modyford commissioned morgan to do and perform all manner of exploits which may tend to preservation and quiet of this island by december morgan was sailing toward spanish main with a fleet of over 30 english and french ships carrying a large number of privateers zahedieh observes that army of privateers was largest that had gathered in caribbean at time which was a mark of morgan s renown morgan s first action was to take connected islands of old providence and santa catalina in december 1670 from there his fleet sailed to chagres port from which ships were loaded with goods to transport back to spain morgan took town and occupied fort san lorenzo which he garrisoned to protect his line of retreat on 9 january 1671 with his remaining men he ascended chagres river and headed for old panama city on pacific coast much of journey was on foot through dense rainforests and swamps governor of panama had been forewarned of a potential attack and had sent spanish troops to attack morgan and his men along route privateers transferred to canoes to complete part of journey but were still able to beat off ambushes with ease after three days with river difficult to navigate in places and with jungle thinning out morgan landed his men and travelled overland across remaining part of isthmus privateers arrived at old panama city on 27 january 1671 they camped overnight before attacking following day they were opposed by approximately 1 200 spanish infantry and 400 cavalry most were inexperienced morgan sent a 300 strong party of men down a ravine that led to foot of a small hill on spanish right flank as they disappeared from view spanish front line thought privateers were retreating and left wing broke rank and chased followed by remainder of defending infantry they were met with well organised firing from morgan s main force of troops when party came into view at end of ravine they were charged by spanish cavalry but organised fire destroyed cavalry and party attacked flank of main spanish force in an effort to disorganise morgan s forces governor of panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto battlefield scared by noise of gunfire they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of remaining spanish troops battle was a rout spanish lost between 400 and 500 men against 15 privateers killed thumb upright 1 3 morgan attacking panama 1671 panama s governor had sworn to burn down city if his troops lost to privateers and he had placed barrels of gunpowder around largely wooden buildings these were detonated by captain of artillery after morgan s victory resultant fires lasted until following day only a few stone buildings remained standing afterwards much of panama s wealth was destroyed in conflagration although some had been removed by ships before privateers arrived privateers spent three weeks in panama and plundered what they could from ruins morgan s second in command captain edward collier supervised torture of some of city s residents morgan s fleet surgeon richard browne later wrote that at panama morgan was noble enough to vanquished enemy value of treasure morgan collected during his expedition is disputed talty writes that figures range from 140 000 to 400 000 pesos and that owing to large army morgan assembled prize per man was relatively low causing discontent there were accusations particularly in exquemelin s memoirs that morgan left away with majority of plunder he arrived back in port royal on 12 march to a positive welcome from town s inhabitants following month he made his official report to governing council of jamaica and received their formal thanks and congratulations arrest and release knighthood and governorship 1672 1675 thumb charles ii who ordered morgan s arrest but later knighted him during morgan s absence from jamaica news reached island that england and spain had signed treaty of madrid pact aimed to establish peace in caribbean between two countries it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions historian violet barbour considers it probable that one of spanish conditions was removal of modyford from governorship modyford was arrested and sent to england by sir thomas lynch his recent replacement destruction of panama so soon after signing of treaty led to what allen describes as a crisis in international affairs between england and spain english government heard rumours from their ambassadors in europe that spanish were considering war in an attempt to appease them charles ii and his secretary of state earl of arlington ordered morgan s arrest in april 1672 privateer admiral was returned to london where barbour writes he was handsomely as hero on whom drake s mantle had fallen although some sources state that morgan was also incarcerated in tower of london pope writes that tower records make no mention of his presence there morgan probably remained at liberty throughout his time in london and political mood changed in his favour arlington asked him to write a memorandum for king on how to improve jamaica s defences although there was no court case morgan was never charged with an offence he gave informal evidence to lords of trade and plantations and proved he had no knowledge of treaty of madrid prior to his attack on panama unhappy with lynch s conduct in jamaica king and his advisers decided in january 1674 to replace him with john vaughan 3rd earl of carbery morgan would act as his deputy charles appointed morgan a knight bachelor in november 1674 and two months later morgan and carbery left for jamaica they were accompanied by modyford released from tower of london without charge and made chief justice of jamaica they travelled on board jamaica merchant which held cannon and shot meant to boost port royal s defences ship foundered on rocks of ile a vache and morgan and crew were temporarily stranded on island until picked up by a passing merchant ship in jamaican politics 1675 1688 thumb upright john vaughan 3rd earl of carbery on his arrival in jamaica 12 man assembly of jamaica voted morgan an annual salary of ps600 for his good services to country move angered carbery who did not get on with morgan carbery later complained of his deputy that he was every day more convinced of morgan s imprudence and to have anything to do with civil government carbery also wrote to secretary of state to bemoan morgan s drinking and gaming at taverns of port royal although morgan had been ordered to eradicate piracy from jamaican waters he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains and invested in some of their ships zahedieh estimates that there were 1 200 privateers operating in caribbean at time and port royal was their preferred destination these had a welcome in city if morgan received dues owed to him as morgan was no longer able to issue letters of marque to privateer captains his brother in law robert bindloss directed them to french governor of tortuga to have a letter issued bindloss and morgan received a commission for each one signed in july 1676 carbery called for a hearing against morgan in front of assembly of jamaica accusing him of collaborating with french to attack spanish interests morgan admitted he had met french officials but indicated that this was diplomatic relations rather than anything duplicitous in summer of 1677 lords of trade said they had yet to come to a decision on matter and in early 1678 king and privy council recalled carbery from jamaica leaving morgan as governor for three months in july 1678 charles howard 1st earl of carlisle was appointed governor by late 1670s france became an increasing threat in caribbean and morgan took control of defence of port royal he declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 both during his periods as temporary governor of island because of threat of invasion re built fortifications surrounding town and increased number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in five years up to 1680 in 1670s and 1680s in his capacity as an owner of a large slave plantation morgan led three campaigns against jamaican maroons of juan de morgan achieved some success against maroons who withdrew further into blue mountains where they were able to stay out of reach of morgan and his forces mavis campbell maroons of

pirates criticism of their action in london was fomented by two former governors of jamaica carbery and lynch after lynch paid ps50 000 to charles ii morgan s commissions as lieutenant governor and lieutenant general were revoked and lynch was appointed as island s governor morgan still retained his position on assembly of jamaica morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years he received news of revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of alcohol to point where his health began to suffer lynch removed morgan s supporters from assembly of jamaica by 1683 and in october that year he removed morgan and his brother in law leaving assembly packed with men loyal to him in 1684 lynch died and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend lieutenant general hender molesworth thumb report from london gazette regarding morgan s successful libel action in 1684 an account of morgan s exploits was published by exquemelin in a dutch volume entitled de americaensche zee roovers trans about buccaneers of america morgan took steps to discredit book and successfully brought a libel suit against book s publishers william crooke and thomas malthus in his affidavit he stated that he had against evil deeds piracies and robberies greatest abhorrence and distrust and that for kind of men called buccaneers he always had and still has hatred court found in his favour and book was retracted damages of ps200 were paid to him in december 1687 lynch s permanent replacement arrived in port george morgan s friend from his time in london christopher monck 2nd duke of albemarle he dismissed molesworth and gave morgan an unofficial role as advisor in july 1688 albemarle persuaded king to allow morgan to regain a position on assembly but former privateer was too ill to attend hans sloane albemarle s private physician inspected morgan and diagnosed dropsy he also saw morgan was drinking to excess and ordered him to reduce his alcohol intake which was ignored sloane described his patient as lean sallow coloured his eyes a little yellowish and belly jutting out or prominent he complained to me of want of appetite for victuals he had a kicking to vomit every morning and generally a small looseness attending him and withal is much given to drinking and sitting up late which i supposed had been cause of his present indisposition death and subsequent events morgan died on 25 august 1688 albemarle ordered a state funeral and laid morgan s body at king s house for public to pay respects an amnesty was declared so that pirates and privateers could pay their respects without fear of arrest he was buried at palisadoes cemetery port royal followed by a 22 gun salute from ships moored in harbour morgan was a wealthy man when he died he owned three plantations had 129 slaves and his personal wealth was valued at ps5 263 in his will signed 17 june 1688 he left his jamaican property to his godsons charles byndloss and henry archbold on condition they adopted surname of morgan these were children of his two cousins anna byndloss and johanna archbold to his sister catherine loyd he awarded ps60 per annum from his estate paid into hands of my ever honest thomas morgan of tredegar on 7 june 1692 an earthquake struck port royal about two thirds of town amounting to 33 acres 13 ha sank into kingston harbour immediately after main shock palisadoes cemetery including morgan s grave was one of parts of city to fall into sea his body has never been subsequently located legacy thumb upright left alexandre exquemelin s de americaensche zee roovers 1678 which affected history s view of morgan rogozinski observes that morgan is probably best known pirate because of exquemelin s book although cordingly writes that exquemelin bore a grudge over what he saw was morgan s theft of bounty from panama his experience explains why he painted such a black picture of morgan and portrayed him as a cruel and unscrupulous villain which subsequently affected historians view of morgan allen observes that partly because of exquemelin morgan has not been well served by historians he cites examples of historians whose biographies were so flawed they wrote that morgan either died in london prison or tower of london these included charles leslie a new history of jamaica 1739 alan gardner history of jamaica 1873 hubert bancroft history of central america 1883 and howard pyle s work howard pyle s book of pirates compiled in 1921 exquemelin wrote that morgan s men undertook widespread torture in several of towns they captured according to stephen snelders in his history of piracy spanish reports of morgan s raids do not refer to torture being practiced on residents of porto bello or gibraltar although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in panama historian patrick pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many european countries at time morgan always fought with a commission from governor of jamaica in doing so he was acting as a reserve naval force for english government in defence of jamaica as spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity even if a captain carried letters of marque they considered morgan to be a pirate something he firmly rejected thumb upright rafael sabatini s 1922 novel captain blood is based in large part on morgan s career rogozinski observes that morgan does not appear in later fictional works as much as other pirates because of his ambiguous mixture of charismatic leadership and selfish treachery although his name and persona have featured in literature including rafael sabatini s 1922 novel captain blood and john steinbeck s first novel cup of gold 1929 both of which are based in large part on morgan s career morgan and stories of a hidden haul of treasure also feature to a lesser extent in other works including ian fleming s 1954 novel live and let die and john masefield s 1920 poem captain stratton s fancy screen renditions of his life include captain blood 1935 black swan 1942 blackbeard pirate 1952 morgan pirate 1961 pirates of tortuga 1961 and black corsair 1976 morgan has also been featured in several video games including sid meier s pirates and age of pirates 2 city of abandoned ships in 1944 seagram company started manufacturing captain morgan brand of rum named after privateer in 2001 captain morgan brand was sold to diageo multinational drinks company based in london name of morgan has been attached to local sites in caribbean such as morgan s bridge morgan s pass and morgan s valley in clarendon morgan s harbour hotel and beach club in kingston hotel henry morgan located in roatan honduras port morgan resort located in haiti and captain morgan s retreat and vacation club on ambergris caye belize economist peter leeson believes that pirates and privateers were generally shrewd businessmen far removed from modern romanticised view of them as murderous tyrants anthropologist anne m galvin and historian kris lane separately see morgan as obtaining wealth to become a member of landed gentry galvin wrote that morgan showed social mobility through self interested acts of outlawry political wiles and business acumen glenn blalock writing for american national biography observes that morgan was seen as a hero to many jamaicans and british both for his exploits as a buccaneer and for ensuring jamaica remained a key part of british empire thomas describes morgan as a man of courage determination bravery and charisma he was a planner a brilliant military strategist and intensely loyal to king to england and to jamaica but unlike so many of brethren he was flexible and adaptable able to see that future for jamaica lay not in plunder or pillage but in peaceful trade he was also an adept politician and held office longer than any of governors of his time notes
