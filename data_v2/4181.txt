sydney punchbowls made in china during emperor s reign 1796 1820 over mid qing dynasty are only two known examples of chinese export porcelain hand painted with sydney scenes and dating from macquarie era bowls were procured in canton about three decades after first fleet s arrival at port jackson where british settlement at sydney cove was established in 1788 they also represent trading between australia and china via india at time even though decorated punchbowls were prestigious items used for drinking punch at social gatherings during 18th and 19th centuries it is not known who originally commissioned these bowls or what special occasion they were made for punchbowls are a harlequin pair similar but not exactly matching bowls have been donated independently one to state library of new south wales in 1926 and other to australian national maritime museum anmm in 2006 library bowl is more widely known of pair its earliest provenance places it in england in late 1840s where it is said to originally have been commissioned for william bligh another source suggests henry colden antill it passed through several owners in britain before it was presented to state library museum bowl s first provenance is from england in 1932 and it has been suggested that it was made to order of arthur phillip its whereabouts were unknown until it appeared in newark museum united states in 1988 on loan from peter frelinghuysen jr through donations maritime museum later acquired punchbowl from frelinghuysen punchbowls are of polychrome famille rose with gilding adorned with panoramic views from opposite vantage points of early 19th century sydney combined with traditional chinese porcelain decorations and each features a rare lively tondo grouping of aboriginal figures panoramas are detailed and show a number of landmarks in and around sidney cove at time motifs have probably been taken from artwork by several artists working in australia during 18th and early 19th century history background thumb chinese porcelain sample plate with four patterns for european market via swedish east india company hand painted chinese porcelain dinner wares became height of fashion in europe and north america during 18th century as a way showing off wealth and status in society porcelain was ordered through different east india companies and later independent american traders all western trading companies with ships sailing to china porcelain was decorated with a combination of chinese patterns and western motifs selected by its commissioner chinese manufacturers sent porcelain samples of decorations to their prospective clients in europe and united states and their clients provided porcelain painters in china with paintings drawings or sketches for their orders these dinner wares are categorized into familles french for families mainly by colours they are painted in such as famille verte noire jaune and rose these sets of tableware included all dishes necessary to set a grand table for a gala dinner a 1766 order form from swedish east india company stated that small services contained 224 pieces and a larger service 281 pieces punchbowls however were not included in these sets they were ordered separately as showcase pieces bowls were used to serve hot or cold drinks at special occasions in clubs at social gatherings and in wealthy homes or before or after grand dinners after british settlement at sydney cove was established in 1788 a significant part of chinese porcelain shipped to australia came via british traders living in india operating under licences issued by british east india company who held a commercial monopoly in far east this trade was known as country trade indian ships were called country ships and their captains country captains examination of cargo of ships wrecked during early colonisation of mark 2009 shipwreck cargoes approaches to material culture in australian maritime archaeology historical archaeology 43 3 95 100 show that country trade played an important role in getting supplies including chinese porcelain traded via india often in indian built vessels to early australian colonies two sydney punchbowls are only known examples of chinese export porcelain hand painted with sydney scenes and dating from macquarie era lasting 1810 1821 bowls were procured in china sometime between 1796 and 1820 about three decades after first fleet s arrival at port jackson in sydney cove by 1850 chinese made porcelain imports had been replaced with british transfer printed with decoration of chinese derivation myra 2003 barque eglinton wrecked western australia 1852 special publication 13 australasian institute for maritime archaeology fremantle wa function whilst drinking of punch from punchbowls was an actual social practice of times sydney cove punchbowls were specially commissioned and expensive items which had other purposes such punchbowls were prestigious items owned by individuals of high rank in society such as john hosking sydney s first elected mayor and new york s fourth governor daniel tomkins who also acquired a punchbowl two punchbowls previously owned by hosking are first chinese objects acquired by australiana fund bowls could also have been commissioned as commemorative gifts like 1812 grand lodge of pennsylvania union lodge punchbowl gift and new york city punchbowl presented to city of new york on 4july 1812 it has also been suggested that given aboriginal marriage motif sydney punchbowls may have been a marriage gift punchbowls were also regarded as exotic souvenirs at time it is also possible sydney punchbowls may have had other purposes to promote fledgling settlement and to encourage new settlers in 1820 artist john william lewin s patron merchant alexander riley looking for ways to promote new south wales colony stated it has long been a subject of our consideration in this country that a panorama exhibited in london of town of sydney and surrounding scenery would create much public interest and ultimately be of service to colony this purpose is clearly set forth even in title of william charles wentworth s tome on new south wales which contained engraving of lewin s sydney cove painting full title ends with a particular enumeration of advantages which these colonies offer for emigration and their superiority in many respects over those possessed by united states of america punchbowls were also an opportunity to present art of topographical panoramas in form of a high status object and to portray new colony in a more glamorous way than that of simply a remote convict colony as perceived at time commissioning gilded monogram initials on library punchbowl are perhaps only current clue as to original commissioner of punchbowls initials are difficult to decipher because of partial loss of gilt copperplate script possibilities include hca or ha tca or fca over b several candidates have been suggested including henry 3rd earl of bathurst and sir thomas brisbane new south wales governor in 1821 1825 after lachlan macquarie but most likely is henry colden antill 1779 1852 antill was appointed aide de camp to fifth new south wales governor macquarie who was in office 1810 1821 on his arrival in sydney on 1january 1810 he was promoted to major of brigade in 1811 and retired from british army in 1821 antill settled on land first at near liverpool and then in 1825 on his estate near picton named jarvisfield in honour of macquarie s first wife jane jarvis he was buried at jarvisfield on 14august 1851 antill had subdivided part of estate in 1844 making possible founding of town of picton when state library acquired its punchbowl in 1926 antill family of picton henry s antecedents had no knowledge of punchbowl s provenance 20th century provenance library punchbowl state library s punchbowl was earlier of two to become more widely known it was presented to library by sydney antiques dealer auctioneer and collector william augustus little in november 1926 an event reported in sydney evening news on 3november 1926 punchbowl discovery itself was reported in several australian newspapers earlier in march including sydney morning herald on 4march 1926 with title bookshop find relic of early sydney these newspaper articles state that little bought punchbowl from london antiquarian bookseller francis edwards ltd of 83 marylebone high street and that little subsequently had it appraised by experts from victoria and albert museum v a in february 1926 newspapers report that v a wished to keep bowl articles also state that bowl had paintings of sydney in 1810 executed to order of major antill who was governor macquarie s aide de camp among clientele of francis edwards ltd were some of noted australiana collectors of day including william dixon james edge partington david scott mitchell and mitchell library itself before little s purchase punchbowl had been property of sir timothy augustine coghlan new south wales agent general in london who bought bowl for ps40 in 1923 from one miss hall for his own collection bowl was subsequently in possession of francis edwards ltd before coghlan s unexpected death in london on 1926 coghlan had personally collected bowl from a miss hall at highfield 63 seabrook rd hythe kent england a few months after she had decided to offer bowl to new south wales government for ps50 earlier a visit to miss hall by a sydney schoolteacher jessie stead on 6august 1923 resulted in proposal that bowl ought to be property of city of sydney jessie stead later indicated that she was informed by miss hall that her father had acquired bowl in late 1840s earliest dating for punchbowls provenance and that miss hall believed bowl was commissioned for william bligh new south wales s fourth governor in office 1806 1808 in 2002 state library of new south wales digitised punchbowl images with support of nelson foundation a philanthropic foundation supporting australian arts and bowl became one of 100 extraordinary library objects to be exhibited as part of mitchell library s centenary celebrations in 2010 museum punchbowl second sydney punchbowl had a much more circuitous journey to present bowl first appeared in may 1932 when sir robert witt chairman of british national art collections fund wrote to james macdonald director of art gallery of new south wales inquiring if a sydney museum would be interested in acquiring second punchbowl gallery director referred offer to william herbert ifould principal librarian of public library of new south wales in august 1932 ifould wrote directly to sir robert witt indicating that bowl was not required by library as a very similar one was already held ifould received a reply dated 31october 1932 stating that during intervening months owner of bowl in england whose name was undisclosed had since sold bowl to another undisclosed buyer bowl s subsequent whereabouts was unknown until 1988 in original offer by sir robert who had also co founded courtauld institute of art in london a suggestion was made that this bowl had been made to order of arthur phillip first governor of new south wales in office 1788 1795 who established settlement at sydney cove however no evidence to support this view was given in witt s letter 1988 was bicentenary of non indigenous settlement in australia and as such there was renewed interest in lost second sydney punchbowl bowl eventually turned up in a catalogue for a chinese export porcelain exhibition at newark museum new jersey united states titled chinese export porcelain a loan exhibition from new jersey collections bowl had been lent by peter frelinghuysen jr a former united states congressman in office 1953 1975 discovery was made by terry ingram a sydney journalist specialising in antiques and art who wrote about it in his saleroom column titled newark museum packs aussie punch in australian financial review on 25august 1988 it transpired that in early 1930s bowl was acquired by frelinghuysen s parents in a private negotiation with owner at time national art collections fund was attempting to raise interest from sydney s cultural institutions this discovery drew attention of paul hundley senior curator of australian national maritime museum anmm s usa gallery gallery itself a bicentennial gift of american people to australia in may 2006 anmm announced it had acquired bowl as a part gift from frelinghuysen through american friends of anmm a charitable organisation recognised by us internal revenue service which enabled frelinghuysen to receive appropriate taxation benefits australian financial review reported acquisition in its saleroom column titled museum bowled over on 18may 2006 punchbowl has been on display in museum s usa gallery ever since it also features as one of 100 stories from anmm has digitised images in anmm catalogue and can be viewed on youtube at time anmm acquired punchbowl in 2006 bowl was valued at a330 000 ceramic origin notes accompanying state library s acquisition of its punchbowl indicate that on 1926 william bowyer honey keeper department of ceramics victoria albert museum had appraised this particular punchbowl honey concluded that bowl was made in china during emperor chia ch ing s reign in 1796 1820 in 1757 foreign trade had been restricted to canton chinese exports consisting largely of tea porcelain and silk had to be paid for in silver european and soon american presence was restricted to thirteen factories known as hongs on harbour of canton now known as guangzhou canton hongs themselves are frequently illustrated on punchbowls known as hong bowls whereas portrayal of ports that traded with canton such as sydney and new york are extraordinarily rare canton system lasted until defeat of china s qing dynasty by british empire in first of opium wars in 1842 virtually no chinese export porcelain was produced from 1839 to 1860 because of opium wars canton hong trade was subsequently overshadowed by rise of hong kong as a trading centre territory ceded to british as a consequence of china s military defeats and subsequent establishment of 80 treaty ports along china s coast punchbowls therefore are a product made just before china s eclipse commissioned in canton where they were painted and glazed by chinese ceramic artists unpainted bowls however would have first been manufactured in a town by road from canton where pottery factories have operated for nearly 2 000 years and still do today similarities and differences punchbowls can be considered a harlequin pair as they are similar but not exactly matching they are both chinese ceramics ware of cantonese origin made of clear glaze on hard paste porcelain and painted with polychrome famille rose enamel and gilding they are similar in size each approximately in diameter high and weighing about footring high and in diameter whilst indigenous australian groups painted within inner centre of both bowls are identical outer panoramic views of sydney cove are not library punchbowl has a view from eastern side of sydney cove whilst view on museum bowl is from dawes point on western shore this pairing follows a standard convention in late 18th and early 19th century topographical art of painting two views of same scene from opposite vantage points whilst cantonese ceramic painters would have worked from images of sydney cove and aboriginal group provided by customer commissioning punchbowls border and edge trims were generally left to choice of ceramic painters traditional floral motif of such chinese flowers as chrysanthemums peonies cherry and plum blossom has been applied to internal borders of both bowls in a similar pattern however external borders differ considerably library bowl has a more traditional chinese outer border design in vermilion rose and gilt whilst museum bowl has a trim of looped circles on a cobalt blue ground edged with narrow gold bands there are other differences library bowl has large gilded monogram initials on outside and footring has a single narrow gold band and gilded lower edge however museum bowl has no visible monogram but footring does have view of town of sydney in new south wales lettered in black illustration sources sydney cove sources of two illustrations of sydney cove and aboriginal group are not known ceramic colouring bears a general resemblance to contemporary sydney cove images which implies that an original watercolour or hand coloured engraving was used for copying rather than black and white images in case of library punchbowl depiction of sydney cove is most likely done from an engraving after a now lost drawing by lewin which may date to 1814 this sydney cove engraving appeared as a full page illustration in second edition of a statistical historical and political description of new south wales and its dependent settlements in van diemen s land etc london 1820 by wentworth with a later smaller version as one of ten port jackson harbour views illustrated on map of part of new south wales london 1825 by publisher and engraver joseph cross as australia s first professional artist lewin produced many paintings for macquarie and his senior officers he also made a number of commissions for riley lewin had a close association with antill and both were part of governor macquarie s 50 strong excursion party to inspect land and new road over blue mountains from 25april to 19may 1815 road had been built by convicts in 1814 after first european crossing by gregory blaxland william lawson and wentworth in may 1813 unlike library punchbowl sydney cove image on museum punchbowl is not known in its entirety in any other version so it is assumed that original artwork provided by commissioner to ceramic artists in china has been lost only similar sydney cove view of period is an original watercolour by convict artist joseph lycett which first appeared in an engraved version as page 86 in views in new south wales 1813 1814 and an historical account of colony of nsw 1820 1821 sydney 1819 by soldier james wallis a second engraved version appeared on page 74 of a similar folio edition album of original drawings by captain james wallis and joseph lycett ca 1817 1818 etc by publisher rudolph ackermann in london 1821 however dawes point fortifications designed by convict architect francis greenway and its gun emplacements dominate foreground of both engravings museum punchbowl view pre dates this as it has instead a grassy slope and figures of an aboriginal man and woman in equivalent location lycett version has other major differences including a less extensive vista of eastern side of harbour aboriginal group aboriginal group forms inner centre piece in tondo of both bowls as same image was used for both bowls implication is that chinese ceramic painters were copying from same drawing and finishing them at same place and time image is of a group of four aboriginal men with club shield and spears one woman with a baby on her shoulders standing and turned slightly away from rest of figures and another woman cowed by men this is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony as with museum bowl s sydney cove image no directly related surviving version is known that would have been used by ceramic artists to paint aboriginal group closest match is a drawing after an apparently now lost original sketch by nicolas martin petit artist on 1800 1803 french expedition to australia led by nicolas baudin research made around 2009 2012 indicated that during baudin s expedition a report was prepared for emperor napoleon on feasibility of capturing british colony at sydney cove as this expedition progressed around coastal australia petit began to specialise in drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples french expedition arrived at port jackson on 25april 1802 petit s drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in voyage autour du monde par ordre du roi paris 1825 regarding a voyage around world 1817 1820 led by louis claude de de freycinet
