andy aledort described as pinnacle of hendrix s career and premiere example of his unparalleled genius as a rock guitarist in this performance jimi transcended medium of rock music and set an entirely new standard for potential of electric guitar during song s extended instrumental breaks hendrix created sounds with his guitar that sonically represented warfare including rockets bombs and diving

built around 1964 he thereafter used model during performances and recordings in 1967 he described instrument as best all around guitar for stuff we re doing he praised its bright treble and deep bass sounds with few exceptions hendrix played right handed guitars that were turned upside down and for left hand playing this had an important effect on sound of his guitar because of slant of bridge pickup his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound which was opposite of stratocaster s intended design in addition to hendrix also used fender two different

brought hendrix to england in october 1966 he supplied him with 30 watt burns amps which hendrix thought were too small for his needs after an early london gig when he was unable to use his preferred fender twin he asked about marshall amps that he had noticed other groups using years earlier mitch mitchell had taken drum lessons from amp builder jim marshall and he introduced hendrix to marshall at their initial meeting hendrix bought four speaker cabinets and three 100 watt super lead amplifiers he would grow accustomed to using all three in unison equipment arrived on october 11 1966 and experience used new gear during their first tour marshall amps were well suited for hendrix s needs and they were paramount in evolution of his heavily overdriven sound enabling him to master use of feedback as a musical effect creating what author paul trynka described as a definitive vocabulary for rock guitar hendrix usually turned all of amplifier s control knobs to maximum level which became known as hendrix setting during four years prior to his death he purchased between 50 and 100 marshall amplifiers jim marshall said that he was greatest ambassador his company ever had effects thumb
