hanna barbera children s cartoons canadian cartoonist danny antonucci was bothered by people who thought that animation was only for children prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as lupo butcher and brothers grunt antonucci was later dared to produce a children s cartoon and accepted challenge antonucci drew eds while designing a commercial impressed he spent months designing show and then faxed a one page concept sheet to cartoon network cn and nickelodeon in 1996 both responded quickly with high interest but demanded creative control to which antonucci refused after cn agreed to let antonucci have creative control a deal was made that his studio a k a cartoon would produce series show entered production in 1997 making it cartoon network s first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than hanna barbera as well as first to by pass a seven minute short an advocate of hand drawn animation antonucci wanted ed edd n eddy to be produced in a way akin to cartoons from 1940s to 1970s consequently series was last to use cel animation cels were shipped to korea for creation of initial animation and then later edited back at a k a cartoon however when negatives arrived back from korea they were so dirty a run through digital noise reduction dvnr technology used to clean up dirt and grain digitally as film is transferred to tape was unavoidable antonucci referred to it as a necessary evil because it caused large damage to animation upon seeing harmful effects on pilot percentage of dvnr was to purify colors and avoid affecting image as much as possible episode was directed by antonucci who also co wrote episodes ed touchables with jono howard and nagged to ed with howard and mike kubat both episodes were storyboarded by scott underwood

terrence briggs of animation world magazine wrote a scathing review considering ed edd n eddy worst cartoon network show up to that point and criticising episodes as empty adventures of pure filler with characters that were products from school of acid trip caricature however other reviews were positive after briggs review was published a large number of letters supportive of show were sent to magazine prompting it to take a second look at show with matt shumway and lamont wayne writing a much more positive review calling it a fresh show with very different approaches sarasota herald tribune was highly positive of show and felt that show s lively animation and slapstick humor recalled delight of earlier cartoon era writing in times of old cartoon characters had eyes that bugged out when they drank something unpleasant legs that became whirling circles when they ran and bodies that flattened into pancakes when they crashed into slammed doors well they re ba a a ck herald sun
