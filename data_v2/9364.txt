aem 7 is a twin cab four axle b b electric locomotive built by electro motive division emd and asea between 1978 and 1988 locomotive was a derivative of swedish sj rc4 designed for passenger service in united states primary customer was amtrak which bought 54 for use on northeast corridor and keystone corridor two commuter operators marc and septa also purchased locomotives for a total of 65 amtrak ordered aem 7 after failure of ge e60 locomotive first locomotives entered service in 1980 and were an immediate success ending a decade of uncertainty on northeast corridor in late 1990s amtrak rebuilt 29 of its locomotives from dc to ac traction locomotives continued operating through arrival of final siemens acs 64 in june 2016 marc retired its fleet in april 2017 in favor of siemens chargers and septa retired all seven of its aem 7s in november 2018 in favor of acs 64s background thumb left swedish rc4 imported and repainted in amtrak s livery for evaluation this locomotive performed well and would become basis of aem 7 alt silver locomotive with red and blue stripes amtrak assumed control of almost all private sector intercity passenger rail service in united states on may 1 1971 with a mandate to reverse decades of decline amtrak retained approximately 184 of 440 trains which had run day before to operate these trains amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives electric and diesel and 1190 passenger cars most of which dated from 1940s 1950s operation on electrified portion of northeast corridor was split between budd metroliner electric multiple units and prr gg1 locomotives latter were over 35 years old and restricted to amtrak sought a replacement but no us manufacturer offered an electric passenger locomotive importing and adapting a european locomotive would require a three year lead time with few other options amtrak turned to ge to adapt e60c freight locomotive for passenger service ge delivered two models e60cp and e60ch however locomotives proved unsuitable for speeds above leaving amtrak once again in need of a permanent solution amtrak then examined existing european high speed designs and two were imported for trials in 1976 77 swedish rc4 numbered x995 and french cc 21000 x996 amtrak favored swedish design which became basis for aem 7 design comparison of aem 7 with predecessors aem 7 prr gg1 ge e60 length weight aem 7 was far smaller than its predecessors prr gg1 and ge e60 it measured long by wide and stood tall a decrease in length of over aem 7 s weight was half that of e60cp or gg1 on its introduction it was smallest and lightest high horsepower locomotive in north america budd company manufactured for initial amtrak order austrian firm simmering graz for marc and septa orders reflecting varied electrification schemes on northeast corridor locomotives could operate at three different voltages 11 kv 25 hz ac 12 5 kv 60 hz ac and 25 kv 60 hz a pair of ds 11 two stage pantographs one at each end of locomotive collected power from overhead catenary wire thyristor converters stepped down high voltage ac to provide dc power at a much lower voltage to four traction motors one per axle as built aem 7 was rated at with a starting tractive effort of and a continuous tractive effort of its maximum speed was a separate static converter supplied 500 kw 480 v head end power hep for passenger comfort this was sufficient to supply heating lighting and other electrical needs in 8 10 amfleet cars aem 7ac thumb left no 939 was among 29 units rebuilt as aem 7acs alt silver and blue locomotive rebuilt aem 7acs used ac traction instead of dc traction power modules used water cooled insulated gate bipolar transistor igbt technology and provided about of traction

septa aem 7 no 2301 entering temple university amtrak planned a fleet of 53 locomotives with an estimated cost of 137 5 million limited funding hampered that plan but in september 1977 amtrak proceeded with a plan to buy 30 locomotives for 77 8 million five companies bid on contract general motors electro motive division emd asea morrison knudsen alsthom brown boveri siemens krauss maffei and aeg telefunken krauss maffei amtrak awarded contract to emd asea in january 1978 it ordered 17 more locomotives in february 1980 bringing total to 47 revenue service began on may 9 1980 when no 901 departed washington union station with a metroliner service swedish influence led to nickname meatball after swedish meatballs railfans nicknamed boxy locomotives toasters between 1980 and 1982 47 aem 7s nos 900 946 went into service amtrak retired last of its prr gg1s on may 1 1981 while most of ge e60s were sold to other operators new locomotives swiftly proved themselves car and locomotive cyclopedia stated that no new locomotive since new york central hudson had such an impact on speeds and schedule performance this strong performance led to further orders amtrak added seven more locomotives in 1987 delivered in 1988 for a total of 54 two commuter operators in northeast ordered aem 7s marc ordered four in 1986 for use on its penn line service on northeast corridor between washington d c and perryville maryland southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa ordered seven in 1987 amtrak also used aem 7s to handle keystone service on keystone corridor between harrisburg and philadelphia as budd metroliners displaced from northeast corridor reached end of their service lives refurbishment in 1999 amtrak and alstom began a program for amtrak s aem 7s alstom supplied ac propulsion equipment electrical cabinets transformers hep and cab displays rebuild provided amtrak with locomotives that had improved high end tractive effort and performance with longer trains amtrak workers performed overhauls under alstom supervision at amtrak s shop in wilmington delaware these remanufactured aem 7s were designated aem 7ac between 1999 and 2002 amtrak rebuilt 29 of its aem 7s retirement as locomotives passed 30 years of service their operators made plans for replacements in 2010 amtrak ordered 70 siemens acs 64 locomotives to replace both aem 7s and newer but unreliable bombardier alstom hhp 8s acs 64s began entering revenue service in february 2014 last two active aem 7s nos 942 and 946 made their final run on june 18 2016 on a special farewell excursion that ran between washington d c and philadelphia while amtrak was replacing its aem 7s marc initially decided in 2013 to phase out its electric operations on penn line altogether and retire both its aem 7 and bombardier alstom hhp 8 locomotives but railroad instead started a refurbishment program for its hhp 8s in 2017 first hhp 8 reconditioned under this program had been delivered and was undergoing successful testing marc selected siemens charger diesel locomotive as replacement for its aem 7 fleet in 2015 last of marc aem 7s were retired by april 2017 with chargers expected to enter service by january 2018 septa will continue to use electric traction replacing its seven aem 7s and lone abb alp 44 an improved aem 7 with fifteen acs 64s first septa acs 64 901 entered revenue
