white eared titi plecturocebus donacophilus also known as bolivian titi or bolivian gray titi is a species of titi a type of new world monkey from eastern bolivia and an area of western brazil species has a range that extends east from manique river in beni department bolivia to southern rondonia in brazil southern end of its range includes forests around city of santa cruz de la sierra it is a medium sized monkey with a grey back orange underside and distinctive white ear tufts it has an omnivorous diet eating fruits other plant materials and invertebrates it is predated upon primarily by raptors though felids and other monkey species have been known to attack species it is a monogamous species and lives in small groups of two to seven members consisting of pair and their offspring family group has a home range of and adults have a complex vocal repertoire to maintain their territory it is also known for its characteristic twining of tails when groups are sitting together white eared titis can live for more than 25 years in captivity white eared titi population has a declining trend decline is believed to be mainly caused by human induced habitat loss and degradation despite this international union for conservation of nature iucn classified species as being of least concern in 2008 as it has shown adaptability to habitat disturbance and is found over a wide range taxonomy white eared titi belongs to new world monkey family which contains titis saki monkeys bearded and it is a member of subfamily it was first described as donacophilus in 1836 but was reassessed based on molecular evidence and recombined as a species within genus plecturocebus although exact position of species within genus plecturocebus in p donacophilus group with rio beni titi p modestus rio mayo titi p brothers titi p and white coated titi p pallescens white coated titi has sometimes been considered a subspecies of white eared titi but they are treated as separate species in latest edition of mammal species of world physical description white eared titi is a medium sized primate with grey to orange pelage species does not exhibit sexual dimorphism male s head and body length averages while females average white eared titi s fluffy tail is longer than length of its head and body together it typically has thick fur with a dorsal side and limbs that vary in colour from grey agouti to orange agouti with an orange underside and white ear tufts body weight ranges from around with female generally a little lighter it has dental formula meaning that on each side of jaw it has two incisors one canine tooth three premolars and three molar teeth canine teeth are relatively short when compared with other new world monkeys in captivity white eared titi has been known to live for over 25 years behaviour white eared titi is cryptic diurnal and known to live in small family groups it is a monogamous species that is thought to mate for life and lives in groups that usually consist of two to seven members an adult pair and up to five young multi male groups have also been recorded offspring are carried by male and are always with them except when feeding between ages of two to four years offspring will disperse from natal group with females leaving earlier than males thumb left young are carried during their first few months there is a strong bond between adult mating pair they stay close and carry out activities together either member of pair may follow other and leadership changes through day evidence of strength of pair bond is shown by grooming huddling together with their tails twined nuzzling and gentle grasping titi monkeys are highly territorial and when confronted with another family group both will respond with threatening behaviour males showing increased agitation towards intruding males when not close together pair show a significant amount of distress and agitation titi monkeys are well known for their vocal communication and have a complex repertoire of calls calls can be divided into two categories high pitched quiet calls and low pitched loud calls vocalisations are often combined and repeated to form sequences that are used to indicate distress conflict play bonding disturbance and to strengthen territory high pitched quiet calls are mostly used when monkeys are disturbed but may also be used before or after group calling while foraging or to find other members of group loud low pitched calls are mostly used in long distance group calling their function is to ensure adequate spacing between home ranges of different family groups these vocalisations are known as duets and generally involve male and female if a neighbouring group is within earshot of these calls they will respond with their own duetting thumb upright white eared titi has a complex vocal repertoire white eared titi is arboreal spending most of its time in lower strata of forest it may enter main canopy when travelling longer distances and may also cross small areas of open ground though latter is rare during normal movement through its environment it is quadrupedal and mostly walks clambers and leaps but it can also bound and climb it leaps small distances no more than a few body lengths between trees where vegetation is not thick enough to support its primary forms of locomotion when travelling on ground it is said to use a bounding movement whereby it leaps more than off ground titi monkey prefers branches which are less than in diameter and its tail never touches support it is on ecology there is relatively little known about ecology of white eared titi or even titi monkeys in general and few studies have focused on white eared titi it is diurnal commencing activity around sunrise and continuing until sunset food availability may influence activity times if there is an abundance of food in warmer months when plants are fruiting titi monkeys may start earlier or if there is a lack of food titi monkeys may remain at feeding tree into evening titi monkey usually rests during middle of day and has two main feeding periods in morning and in afternoon it has an increased period of feeding towards end of day in total titi monkey is active for an average of 11 5 hours 2 7 hours of which is spent feeding titi monkeys sleep on branches at least above ground in same manner as resting during day titi monkeys huddle together and twine tails to sleep thumb left when resting as a group white eared titis often twine tails together though there is little published research on diet of white eared titi titi monkeys in general are omnivores that eat fruit leaves insects and seeds they mostly eat leaves especially protein rich young leaves and leaf buds so a significant period of day is spent resting to digest cellulose they consume more than 100 different species of plants and fruit titi monkeys will also eat small insects ants moths butterflies and their cocoons spiders and can catch flying prey if it comes close to them during dry season there is an increased feeding time on leaves and during lactation it is thought insect consumption increases to augment protein content of diet titi monkey may travel between during day and can maintain a home range of during dry season there is less fruit available and therefore less need to travel large distances so day range may only be a third of usual distance its home range is often shared with other primate species including marmosets squirrel monkeys capuchins owl monkeys howler monkeys and spider monkeys it is sometimes chased from feeding sites by larger species and will generally try to avoid other primates habitat and distribution white eared titi is found in tropical humid forests preferring drier regions to more humid ones it is found in riparian zones and gallery forests and is clearly associated with open habitats like grasslands and swampy grasslands it is found in areas with dense vegetation often choosing to inhabit thickest parts of forest species seems to be quite tolerant of habitat disturbance in bolivia white eared titi is found in upper parts of grande and san miguel river basins east of manique river in beni and in forests surrounding city of santa cruz de la sierra its range extends north to southern rondonia in brazil conservation status white eared titi is considered to be of least concern on international union for conservation of nature iucn red list species is not considered threatened due to its adaptability and abundance over a relatively wide range and despite having a decreasing population trend decline is not rapid enough to be placed in a threatened category species is also listed on cites appendix ii white eared titi s main threat is deforestation and habitat loss due to agriculture area of greatest habitat loss is around city of santa cruz de la sierra but it still survives within city limits and on edges of many rural establishments it has few natural predators and is proven to be adaptable to habitat disturbance farmland may surround and isolate areas of titi habitat which occasionally has positive benefits to monkey farmers may prevent hunters on land thereby inadvertently protecting species it also appears that titi monkey can cross open ground between forest fragments and some groups can thrive in disturbed habitats near human activities however fragmented habitats may prevent establishment of new territories and decrease reproductive opportunities forest corridors to connect fragmented forests have been proposed as an effective means to help ensure survival of titi monkey white eared titi is found in beni biological station biosphere reserve and national park in bolivia and benefits from protection these reserves provide references white
