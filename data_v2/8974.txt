lemington power station is a small now defunct coal fired power station located in north east england it is situated on lemington gut a backwater of river tyne at lemington west of newcastle upon tyne station s main building still stands today and is a rare example of an early power station dating from before nationalisation of united kingdom s electrical supply industry station was opened in 1903 with a total generating capacity of 970 kilowatts electricity generated being used to power a tram system and provide local households and streets with electric lighting station ceased generating electricity in 1919 however structure was retained for use as a sub station until 1946 when tram line closed station was partially demolished in 1949 but has since been made a locally listed building and is now owned by construction company construction in march 2012 norland applied to newcastle city council for permission to demolish building on grounds of it being at risk of collapse background in early 1900s an increasing number of areas were being provided with electricity and train and tram lines were being electrified in area around newcastle upon tyne this required opening of power stations at wallsend forth banks and close two supply companies built stations newcastle upon tyne electric supply company nesco to east of newcastle and newcastle and district electric lighting company disco to west disco built a station at lemington in western outskirts of city to provide electricity for a tram line which ran through their supply area from city centre to station was sited amid derelict buildings of tyne iron company s ironworks they had opened in 1797 and closed in 1886 works were largely demolished but some of ironworks buildings and chimneys still stood unused and power station was built amongst them disco opened lemington power station in 1903 design and specification station consists of a parallel boiler house and turbine hall which creates a large double gabled building it is of steel frame construction with brick cladding other features include round headed openings and ridge ventilators this building originally housed station s boilers and turbo generators constructed alongside station was a brick built chimney to remove gasses from boilers station was first brick built power station in north east england with corrugated iron being usual material used prior to this station s boiler house housed three coal fired lancashire boilers each of 200 hp capacity and each with individual economisers these boilers provided steam for two 410 kilowatt kw and one 150 kw direct current parsons turbo generators this gave station a total generating capacity of 970 kw before being used in lemington power station these generators had been used in forth banks power station and in newburn steelworks one of steam turbines from these sets is now on display at electric power and historical museum in yokohama japan after sitting on display in entrance to blyth power station for many years operations power station was well situated for coal deliveries as it was only from lemington staithes staithes marked end of which brought coal from a number of nearby collieries to staithes for export coal was hauled from staithes to power station before being dumped directly into overhead hoppers in boiler house from there it was burned in boilers to provide steam for turbo generators this steam was then cooled after use using condensers water for which was taken from lemington gut this was a backwater of river tyne created when a new channel was cut in 1876 as well as providing power for tram system station was a source of electricity for local homes building of a power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal which was used at time local households gradually switched to new power source a partner in enterprise of lemington power station was sir matthew white ridley who had considerable interests in coal and banking closure and present thumb right remains of lemington power station in may 2003 production of electricity in station ceased in 1919 ushered in by completion of an extension to generating equipment at newburn steelworks building was retained and continued to be used to supply power to tram route by housing a sub station which used rotary converters station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged station continued to operate in this way until 1946 when tram route was closed station s chimney was demolished in 1949 along with remaining structures of tyne iron works which had stood next to power station throughout its operation main turbine and boiler building is now a locally listed building standing today as a monument to important role that tyne and wear played in development of electrical supply building had been considered for more protected listed building status but decision was taken in may 2004 not to promote it other early power stations in area such as those at dunston and wallsend have all been entirely demolished lemington station is partly still standing due to riverside sites becoming less important to industrial development leading to site never being redeveloped large remaining building currently stands in amongst a small industrial estate at foot of nearby lemington glass cone along with neighbouring ironworks site it is owned by norland construction a crane and plant company formerly known as reeds cranes and plant building used as storage for their machinery site is thought to be contaminated with coal products fuels and oils such as pcbs as well as dioxins and in 2003 newcastle city council released plans that they hoped to redevelop site for heritage tourism in future references category coal fired power stations in england category power stations in north east
