consolidate royal power in region well preserved keep described by historian r allen brown as one of most remarkable keeps in england is of a unique design and probably based on byzantine architecture keep still stands among earth covered remains of outer fortifications history 12th century prior to building of orford castle suffolk was dominated by bigod family who held title of earl of norfolk and owned key castles at framlingham bungay walton and thetford pounds p 55 brown 1962 p 191 hugh bigod had been one of a group of dissenting barons during anarchy in reign of king stephen and henry ii wished to re establish royal influence across region pounds p 55 henry confiscated four castles from hugh but returned framlingham and bungay to hugh in 1165 brown 1962 p 191 henry then decided to build his own royal castle at orford near framlingham and construction work began in 1165 concluding in 1173 brown 1962 pp 53 191 orford site was around two miles 3 2 km from sea lying on flat ground with swampy terrain slowly stretching away down to river ore about half a mile 0 8 km away hartshorne p 60 design of keep was unique and has been termed one of most remarkable keeps in england by historian r allen brown brown 1962 pp 52 3 90 foot high 27 metre central tower was circular in cross section with three rectangular clasping towers built out from 49 foot wide 15 metre structure heslop pp 279 289 tower was based on a precise set of proportions its various dimensions following one to root of two ratio found in many english churches of period heslop p 284 much of interior is built with high quality ashlar stonework with broad 5 foot 6 inch wide 1 7 metre staircases heslop p 283 best chambers were designed to catch early morning sun whilst various parts of keep were draught proofed with doors and carefully designed windows heslop pp 283 4 originally roof of keep above upper hall would have formed a domed effect with a tall steeple above that heslop p 293 keep was surrounded by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey these outer defences rather than keep probably represented main defences

palisade and stone bridge cost ps1 413 to build work possibly being conducted by master mason brown 2004 pp 110 1 some of timbers were brought from as far away as scarborough and detailed stonework being carved from limestone from caen in normandy remainder of stone being variously local mudstone and coralline as well as limestone from northamptonshire brown 2004 p 111 suffolk her orf 054 heritage gateway accessed 23 april 2011 design of keep has attracted much historical interest liddiard 2005 p 47 traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that castle was a transitional military design combining both circular features of later castles with square angled buttresses of earlier norman fortifications more recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation liddiard 2005 p 50 design of orford keep is hard to justify in military terms as buttresses created additional blind spots for defenders whilst chambers and staircase in corners weakened walls against attack square norman keeps continued to be built after orford whilst henry ii was aware of fully circular castle designs before building keep a round keep was constructed at new norfolk in 1146 for example liddiard 2005 p 49 historians have therefore questioned to what extent design can be seen as legitimately transitional instead historians now believe that design of orford castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism heslop argues that plain simple elegance of architecture would for mid 12th century nobility have summoned up images of king arthur who was then widely believed to have had roman or greek links heslop p 288 9 banded angular features of keep resembled theodosian walls of constantinople then idealised image of imperial power and keep as a whole including roof may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in constantinople by john ii komnenos heslop p 290 13th to 15th centuries thumb watercolour of orford castle in 1600 by john norden by start of 13th century
