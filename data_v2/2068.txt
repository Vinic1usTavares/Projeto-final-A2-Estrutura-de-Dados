st matthew dating from 1760 by william were at some time moved to st ann s church in city functions church held right to conduct marriages of people throughout manchester not only from within its parish until 1874 despite this there were no such services for first 35 years of its existence perhaps because of continued popularity of collegiate church as a venue for weddings but probably because latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches which effectively doubled cost of being married at st john s rather than at collegiate church later after rights of collegiate church were curtailed some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at st john s in years just before 1874 burials ceased completely in 1900 but there had been very few for some years previously because available space had been exhausted and most graves were full in 1827 church erected a building dedicated as a sunday school this was also used as a day school from 1838 in 1906 around 250 children attended sunday school and church had numerous affiliated groups such as a penny bank and a choral society day school accommodation was at that time condemned by board of education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by board in same year hannah mitchell a suffragette was arrested at day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by winston churchill building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on gartside street in 1910 at a cost of ps4000 this new facility was used only as sunday school because said local clergy board of education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose according to foundation stone of new school building church had operated first sunday school in manchester although shaw attributes that distinction to a mr fildes a methodist whose establishment began operating from a travis street cellar in 1782 shaw says that several other schools preceded that of st john s around 1781 church had been base for one of manchester s eight fire engines clergy a condition imposed by byrom was that he had right to present living first rector john clowes held office for 62 years until his death in 1831 he was commemorated by two stone tablets in church one by either richard or his son erected after his death and one only example of work of john flaxman in

herbert edmonds william cowherd a proponent of teetotalism and vegetarianism was a curate in late 1700s before leaving to establish bible christian church in salford demise by early 1900s graveyard was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse built on quay street site of byrom family residence area had been residential richard cobden was among those who lived nearby and attended church but changed in character during 19th century as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and locale became increasingly a place of business those who did live there or were patients in nearby hospitals were poor and unable to contribute significantly to funds of church and its schools fundraising bazaars were held in 1890s and 1900s at free trade hall in a nearby area that was more salubrious falling attendances due to commercial nature of district and also a sense that there was some redundancy of provision given nearby st matthew s church caused manchester diocese to review status of st john s and its parish in 1920s following an internal review and a public consultation in 1927 it was formally proposed that two parishes should be merged as st matthew s parish diocese preferred to retain st matthew s and demolish st john s at least in part because former was a more recent construction this was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919 when predominantly transient roman catholic population of st matthew s parish was given as a reason to merge it into st john s ecclesiastical commissioners proposed to hand over church site to manchester corporation in 1929 with hope that city would convert it into an open space similar to parsonage gardens manchester guardian had reported a similar proposal to convert bleak expanse of graveyard into an open cultivated space in 1914 church was demolished in 1931 it is commemorated by a stone cross and a plaque states that more than 22 000 bodies lie buried in vicinity among those buried in churchyard are
