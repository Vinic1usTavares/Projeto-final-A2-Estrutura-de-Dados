skydiving scene with performance capture by stunt man greg rementer insert mark kolpack visual effects supervisor for series explained that multiple techniques were used to create effects for climactic skydiving sequence in episode henstridge and dalton were filmed in front of a green screen on wires and or a turntable with sky clouds and ocean added with computer generated imagery two actors were also digitally scanned to produce digital stunt doubles for use in larger scope shots that were not possible with real actors for these shots hannah betts and stuntman greg rementer performed on sony motion capture stage with movements captured through performance capture technology and used to drive digital double performances music for scene where coulson talks to dying diaz composer bear mccreary and series producers wanted to leave scene mostly without music feeling that gregg s performance did enough on its own once coulson confesses that he once died orchestral strings sneak in with an elegant adagio scene ends with a solitary flugel horn solo giving a statement of coulson s musical theme which mccreary felt was reminiscent of a military funeral and highlighted coulson s sense of honor when it is revealed that simmons is infected with virus mccreary felt that most important element of sequence was that relationship between fitz and simmons who had been treated as a single unit up until this episode was at stake mccreary subsequently introduced a fitzsimmons theme starting as a handful of sparse chords that build throughout episode picking up energy and gradually weaving into a definitive theme when characters discover a cure for simmons beats per minute of theme increase to reflect fitz s excitement this is followed by a montage of pair working on cure mccreary noted that montages are often scored with montage music but he felt that focusing on two characters and their relationship was important for sequence and so chose an even faster version of their theme instead marvel cinematic universe tie ins alien helmet that is carrying virus in episode belonged to a chitauri alien race that fought for loki in marvel s avengers

31 critical response eric goldman of ign scored episode an 8 out of 10 praising well needed development of fitz and simmons skydiving scene despite what he calls less than stellar fx and fact that coulson could not save diaz while criticizing amount of mcu connections stating that series is still too tied to prior marvel movie macguffins oliver sava of a v club graded episode a b saying despite my problems with series i still look forward to watching s h i e l d every week it does a good job capturing thrill of big screen on a tv budget dialogue is breezy and cast becomes more appealing with each new episode there s plenty of room for this show to grow but i m not ready to write it off yet alan sepinwall at hitfix called fzzt first installment of s h i e l d to suggest creative team was aware of what s not working even if they couldn t solve every problem in a single installment feeling that episode made several positive steps forward in terms of character development will salmon gave episode 3 5 stars out of 5 for sfx praising performances of henstridge and gregg but calling episode cliched and concluding that by fleshing out characters it does feel like agents of s h i e l d is now more than just a flashy brand extension dan casey writing for nerdist felt episode was most dramatic tense hour of television we ve seen from series stating that one of show s biggest problems has been its general lack of depth particularly in terms of characters and making them feel like real people rather than glossy with a seemingly endless wellspring of one liners and decided that episode made significant steps towards fixing this problem thanks to some wonderful character interactions and an exploration of fitz simmons past james hunt of den of geek said whether this episode continues show s upwards trend that s debatable it could ve been worse but there wasn t leap forward that we saw from episode three to four or four to five i ll say this for an episode it was better than i thought a fitz simmons episode would be that s progress of a sort jim steranko known for his work on nick fury agent of s h i e l d criticized scope and scale of episode but praised character development for coulson feeling it brought his character closer to s h i e l d agents of comics analysis while talking about score of episode composer mccreary noted parallels between firefighter victims who went to new york to help people and ended up contracting an incurable illness that will kill them and plight of first responders to september 11 attacks kevin garcia while writing for observation deck at io9 noted that marvel does have a few significant firefighters most notably although not well remembered are heroes from call of duty who were themselves inspired by real world
