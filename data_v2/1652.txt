nsb di 3 is a class of 35 diesel electric locomotives built by nohab for norwegian state railways nsb class was built between 1954 and 1969 and delivered in two series di 3a and di 3b they are based on electro motive division f7 and are equipped with emd 567 engines they have a distinct bulldog nose and were numbered 602 633 a series and 641 643 b series locomotives had a prime mover that gives a power output of a series has a co co wheel arrangement while b series has a1a a1a b series has higher top speed but lower tractive effort class was dominant locomotive on nsb s unelectrified lines it was ordered as part of company s of services during 1950s and 1960s and was initially used on three mainline routes of bergen dovre and nordland lines in 1960s bergen and dovre lines were electrified and di 3 units transferred to smaller lines such as meraker valdres roros solor and rauma lines they remained in service with nsb until 2001 five years later than planned due to nsb returning their successor di 6 units are still in use by private operator ofotbanen kosovo railways an operator in sicily and norwegian railway museum class is similar to dsb class my class 52 54 cfl class 1600 and mav m61 construction thumb left di 3 626 at bodo station in 1991 first diesel locomotive used by nsb was a single di 1 unit delivered in 1942 it was more cost efficient than steam locomotives used on non electrified lines and in 1945 nsb decided that it would not order more steam locomotives general motors electro motive division emd made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their f7 and nsb agreed to lease a single unit for trial body and mechanical components were built by nohab motors by asea and prime mover by emd while under production in 1954 gm shipped a for trial in norway and sweden it was tested on express train on dovre line on 7 august but proved to have insufficient power causing train to be 20 minutes late trial unit from nohab was delivered on 17 september 1954 first test runs in scheduled service were on nordland line between trondheim and mo i rana in october there were no technical faults until 22 december when a grounding error caused locomotive to be grounded until 17 january in march unit was sent back to nohab and went on a marketing tour that would eventually reach ankara turkey in 1955 thumb left two di 3 units in nsb locomotive returned to norway on 1 july 1955 where it was numbered 602 and put into service on nordland line trials were successful with much higher regularity than steam locomotives di 3 was used eight days in a row and then spent a single day in depot nsb signed an agreement with nohab for delivery of five further locomotives this caused a public debate because domestic supplier thune had offered to build a similar locomotive in cooperation with american locomotive company first delivery was made on 25 april 1957 and order completed by july in march 1957 nsb received permission to buy another eight locomotives delivery started in october and was completed on 1 june 1958 order was supplemented with another six trains with delivery in 1958 finnish state railways vr ordered five units in 1959 but these were cancelled for political reasons units were offered to nsb for a reduced price three were designated di 3b because they had a slight specification variation with a a1a a1a wheel arrangement and higher top speed two units had come short enough in production process that they could be given same specifications as other di 3a units but received a slightly longer body di 3b were given numbers 641 643 for part of 1960 no 623 was leased by nohab and sent on a demonstration tour in eastern europe this resulted in an order from hungarian state railways where it became mav m61 roros line was upgraded and bergen line units transferred to trondheim in 1960 but increased need for hauling forced nsb to not use units on roros line until delivery of next batch of six units in 1965 final delivery of four units was made in 1969 operation thumb nsb di 3 616 at trondheim central station preparing for departure on express train on nordland line in 1986 initial use for di 3 was to operate three non electrified long distance lines of nsb bergen line dovre line and nordland line following delivery of first batch in 1957 they were from 2 june used on dovre line north of otta to trondheim and further north along nordland line to mo i rana stock was sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on nordland line and reduced travel time by one hour from hamar to otta track did not have sufficient permitted axle load from second batch of eight units five were put into service on bergen line rest on dovre and nordland lines necessary upgrades of permitted axle load had been made to dovre line and nordland line and locomotives were in use from hamar to on 30 november nordland line was completed to and full length operated with di 3 first section of bergen line gjovik line and roa honefoss line was electrified in february 1961 this allowed diesel and electric locomotives to haul all trains from oslo to bergen in 1962 nordland line was completed to bodo but increased need for locomotives was more than compensated by electrification of bergen line being extended to al first di 3 ran on roros line in 1964 that had previously been denied due to bridges with insufficient axle load permits in 1965 bergen line was electrified and all but one di 3 was transferred to trondheim a single unit usually no 610 was stationed at finse station as a snowplow along with additional deliveries there were sufficient di 3 units to terminate most steam operations after bergen line was electrified work continued on dovre line section from hamar to otta was finished in 1967 and following year to dombas this allowed locomotives to be transferred to secondary lines with final delivery of last units in 1969 and completion of electrification of dovre line in 1970 final steam locomotive was taken out of service during last half of 1960s di 3 was put into service on rauma line roros line solor line valdres line and meraker line thumb left nsb di 3 633 at fagernes station in 1986 in november 1970 dovre line was electrified and last steam locomotives were retired a long term plan to electrify half lines was finished and for two decades nsb s operations were very stable with no major investments to infrastructure or closing of lines nsb had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed but plans to order additional di 3 was never fulfilled in 1981 nsb took delivery of five di 4 to supplement older units they were mainly used on nordland line and di 3 units were predominantly used on other lines although they continued to operate som trains on nordland line on 1 april 1987 a di 3 612 caught on fire damage was small enough that it could have been repaired but nsb instead decided to put aside unit at time nsb planned to order additional di 4 but these plans were put on hold in 1988 valdres line was closed this was only time a line with di 3 in regular service was closed during 1980s nsb started leasing sj t44 locomotives from sweden to supplement di 3 in 1992 decision was made to order 12 di 6 and 20 di 8 to replace di 3 former was based on di 4 and had twice power of di 3 di 8 was slightly more powerful than di 3 and were intended for freight trains both series were put into service in 1996 but di 6 proved to have so many technical problems that they were returned to siemens in 1998 di 3 units had been set aside and some had been scrapped but return of di 6 forced nsb to put units back into service thumb an ore train of kosovo railways being hauled by no 008 during mid 1990s nsb had initiated a program to replace traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new tilting multiple units this had led to order of sixteen class 73 four car units for three mainline routes on bergen line dovre line and sorland line to supplement this board of nsb decided on 14 november 1996 to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for roros and rauma lines choice fell on class 93 with fifteen units eventually delivered this allowed all passenger trains on lines to either be operated with class 93 be hauled by di 4 last di 3 hauled train ran on 7 january 2001 post nsb with delivery of class 93 nsb started to retire or sell di 3 in november 2001 five units were sold for nok 250 000 each well under market price to new private operator ofotbanen purchase raised controversy because potential operator had offered full market price for trains one year after delivery six of eleven class 93 locomotives were out of order to solve problem nsb had to rent back used di 3 locomotives from ofotbanen nsb had chosen to sell old locomotives for less than market price but ofotbanen demanded that nsb pay entire purchase price for short term rental back four units 619 633 641 and 643 were sold to united nations and was put into service in kosovo in what has since become kosovo railways four units 622 626 630 and 631 were sold to an operator in sicily italy norwegian national rail administration bought one unit 628 for maintenance and has painted it yellow norwegian railway museum in hamar has preserved four units 602 615 616 and 642 of which two 602 and 616 were operated by gm gruppen and one 615 is kept for spare parts nsb has kept one unit as reserve at al station remaining units have been scrapped put aside or sold as spare part units specifications thumb two di 3 units ofotbanen design di 3 was built by och holm of sweden as part of a series of gm emd locomotives in europe they are technically similar to dsb class my of denmark and mav m61 of hungary locomotives are powered by a 16 cylinder emd 16 567 c or e engine that has a power output of at 835 revolutions per minute rpm engines power an emd or d12 generator that feeds six asea or motors on a di 3a di 3b is equipped with four emd d40 or motors this gives a tractive effort of for a series and for b series motors have a power output of maximum speed is for a series and for b series steel bodies are long longer length is for three b series units and two a series locomotives that were made in batch originally intended for vr a series has a co co wheel arrangement while b series has a a1a a1a arrangement where center of three axles on each bogie is unpowered wheels have a wheel diameter and locomotives have a weight of for a series and for b series trains can be run in multiple with di 4 di 6 and di 8 all di 3 engines featured a bulldog nose only locomotive type in norway to do so locomotives were at first delivered in a dark green livery but during 1960s this was changed to red and last delivered units never had a green scheme references bibliography category
