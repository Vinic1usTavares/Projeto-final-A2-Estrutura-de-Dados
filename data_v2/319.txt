middleware engine which was adjusted to suit game s specifications during development team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from final fantasy xi while attempting to create something that stood on its own due to several factors development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on game attempts to bring game to xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with microsoft about use of xbox live after its alpha test and a delayed beta test game went live on remaining active until its servers were closed on at launch game was met with a negative response while graphics and music were praised other aspects were unanimously panned including gameplay interface and general impression of game being unfinished critic and fan backlash caused square enix to

addition builds upon armoury system for disciples of war and magic in exchange for restricting range of abilities from other classes players gain access to powerful skills magic weapons and armor exclusive to job corresponding to that class these jobs based on classic final fantasy character jobs are more suited to party based combat synopsis setting and characters final fantasy xiv takes place in a high fantasy setting main location is eorzea a continent on larger planet hydaelyn this contrasts final fantasy xi which uses one name to refer to entire world and its regions eorzea is broken up among three main powers forest nation of desert based ul dah sultanate and thalassocracy of limsa lominsa eorzea s dominant maritime power other important locations include scholarly city state of sharlayan and garlean empire a hostile northern power with highly developed technology five years prior to start of game garlean empire invaded land of ala but were prevented from conquering eorzea by attacks of ancient dragon and his dragon hordes in response to empire s threat three nations of eorzea reform grand companies comprehensive centers of command which combine cities military and economic assets grand companies attracted people from all walks of life who take up mantle of adventurers player character is a customizable adventurer avatar taken from five main races of eorzea playable races are human like elf like physically imposing diminutive and feline playable and te are gender locked to male and female respectively aside from these races are beastmen tribes who worship ancient gods called primals which require aether rich crystals and whose presence damages planet plot beginning in one of eorzea s three main states player character awakes to echo a power granting them ability to see past adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within nations provoked by garlean presence led by garlean legatus gaius van and beastmen s attempts to hoard crystals and summon their primals eventually a greater threat is brought to attention of nations by sharlayan scholar louisoix another garlean legatus named nael van is using arcane magic and technology to summon dalamud planet s second moon down on eorzea to purge beastmen and primals whom hate as violent pagans with aid of garlean defector cid nan adventurers discover that nael has set up a beacon for summoning dalamud in new fortress of castrum novum while each nation makes individual attempts to storm fortress they are repelled faced with this their leaders form a pact and unite nations under banner of eorzean alliance now united nations aided by adventurers successfully storm castrum novum and destroy beacon nael insanely committed to his plan makes himself into a second beacon though he is defeated by adventurers dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit so louisoix proposes a final desperate plan to summon twelve eorzea s guardian deities and return dalamud into orbit adventurers pray to altars dedicated to twelve across land then rally with armies of eorzean alliance to fight nael s legion on flats predicted impact site of dalamud in midst of battle dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for elder primal bahamut enraged after its imprisonment bahamut begins laying waste to eorzea after attempt to summon twelve fails louisoix uses last of his power to send adventurers into a time rift separating them from flow of time so they can return when eorzea has recovered development thumb upright hiromichi tanaka original producer of final fantasy xiv in 2007 planning for final fantasy xiv began in 2005 four years prior to its official announcement at time it was codenamed while it had been decided within company that mmorpgs would be mainline entries rather than spin offs team was worried that final product would be too radical for main numbered series main staff included multiple developers who had worked on previous entries in final fantasy series producer hiromichi tanaka had acted as original producer for final fantasy xi and been involved in multiple early final fantasy games director komoto was a director for xi and had been among staff of final fantasy ix writer sato had been main scenario writer for xi and akihiko yoshida had previously also been art director for vagrant story and final fantasy xii game s logo and some other artwork was designed by yoshitaka amano game s story primarily written by sato was based around a central narrative complemented by side stories setting and gameplay were decided upon before sato was brought on board with result that she needed to consult rest of team when she wished to use one of eorzea s main locations in a certain way story s main conflict was to be among five main races of eorzea and beastmen with garlean empire acting as a third force placement of garlean empire to northeast of eorzea was not meant to simulate a real world location but naturally ended up there as map of hydaelyn was being created game s logo designed by amano was designed around importance of weapons and concept of a wheel wheel in question was a wheel of adventurers arranged so their backs were exposed and they needed to rely on their comrades and friends for support for his work as art director yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to creating artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded while game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic it was meant to be realistic and encourage exploration at beginning of development team created a detailed profile of hydaelyn including its relation with other planets ecosystems climate and geography this was done to promote a sense of realism alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players careful work was put into topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive after environment was created architectural cultural and religious elements of world were incorporated into environment city and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players game s five playable races were directly based on five initial races from final fantasy xi with design adjustments to reflect new setting developers also created two different tribes as opposed to single tribe set up present in xi characters movements were primarily developed using motion capture though recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive much work was invested in creating emotes character movements chosen by player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in xi to create realistic expressions a character artist manually adjusted faces for each expression for monsters advances in hardware enabled team to create more realistic and detailed character models including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles game s cutscenes were first drafted using a storyboard then when sequence of events had been finalized motion capture was used to create scene in a digitized format lighting and environmental effects were then put in place one of most challenging sequences to create was opening real time cutscene for limsa lominsa story route giant sea serpent s fins were each individually animated game s opening cinematic was produced by visual works square enix s in house cgi development company all in game models were first created in high resolution form using a 3d sculpturing program then readjusted so they could appear in game with a lower polygon count but equivalent graphical quality another large part of creating characters was their accessories to help with this team developed a multi layered development system a technique dubbed polygon shaving was used so two sets of equipment could be designed to look different while using same model data another function dubbed reshaping was used to adjust shapes of equipment and accessories third element dubbed ssd file enabled adjustment of materials equipment was made off so its color and texture could be changed rather than relying on a single design image which would have been impractical for hardware team took basic art and used photoshop to add subtle changes to each it was then passed down to modeling team who used same sculpting process as was used for game s monsters to create high detail models while keeping polygon count low game s engine was crystal tools a specially created middleware engine that was also used in final fantasy xiii so that it would be compatible with game s specifications team customized engine to suit their needs in end game s chosen engine proved unsuitable to needs of game rendering its internal structure broken game s development ended up being beset with multiple problems according to a later postmortem team developing game had an unhealthy obsession of graphical quality over gameplay content that led to other parts of game being neglected reinforced by company s then outdated development methods a cited example of focus on graphics was a flowerpot which had as many polygons and lines of shader code as a player character this high graphical quality meant that compromises needed to be made for example number of players present on screen at any one time needed to be limited to twenty undermining large scale communal appeal of mmorpgs this issue also impacted game s environments to save on memory space while preserving seamless travel team needed to reuse environmental features and textures on a regular basis another problem was that team lacked experience in developing mmorpgs a problem that had also beset final fantasy xi but had been successfully overcome with this in mind team were still using development mindset used during sixth console generation which could not hold up under increased staff and resource needs for seventh generation development a third major reason was company s belief that game s problems could be patched after initial launch compounded by lack of an overall plan for how to deal with them music music for final fantasy xiv was composed by nobuo uematsu a regular contributor to music of final fantasy series originally contracted to create ending theme for xiii uematsu accepted request by xiv team to work on game leaving xiiis theme song to be composed by masashi hamauzu having only contributed a few tunes to final fantasy xi xiv was uematsu s first full time work on an mmorpg despite this he treated as any other project and had considerable creative freedom as team s vision for game had not been finalized for battle themes he used a mix of orchestral and rock pieces he worked on xiv at same time as working on last story a video game from original final fantasy creator hironobu sakaguchi during time xiv was active after initial release other composers including masayoshi soken naoshi mizuta tsuyoshi sekito and ryo yamazaki contributed to score soken acted as game s sound director and would take over as main composer for its relaunch game s theme song answers was composed by uematsu and sung by susan calloway who was specially chosen by uematsu after hearing her rendition of previous final fantasy theme songs multiple albums featuring music from xiv have been released two mini albums final fantasy xiv battle tracks and final fantasy xiv field tracks were released on september 29 2010 a full album final fantasy xiv eorzean frontiers was released on september 1 2012 as both a single album and three mini albums a blu ray album featuring all music from original version of xiv before meteor final fantasy xiv original soundtrack was released on august 14 2013 two weeks prior to its relaunch release xiv was first hinted at 2005 electronic entertainment expo e3 when square enix announced that they were developing a new mmorpg showing it off using a tech demo demo included aesthetic elements similar to xi such as races from vana diel in 2006 rumors emerged that square enix was developing a direct sequel to final fantasy xi but further details remained unknown during next few years contradictory reports were issued as to what platforms game was being developed for platforms listed varied from game being an xbox 360 exclusive to being for playstation platforms to being for xbox 360 playstation 3 ps3 and windows platforms xiv was officially announced at e3 2009 for ps3 then for windows after its official announcement for those platforms it was stated that a port to microsoft hardware was under consideration despite negotiation with microsoft concerning an xbox 360 version of game two companies were unable to agree upon use of xbox live as square enix wanted a shared server across all platforms and microsoft would not give them full access necessary to implement this because of this disagreement and consequent extra manpower needed to develop a version separate from other two platforms development on xbox 360 version was stopped according to yoichi wada then ceo of square enix xiv was being planned as a serious rival to successful western mmorpg world of warcraft game was developed primarily for windows and was then ported across to ps3 xiv was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on windows and ps3 in 2010 but ps3 version was delayed into 2011 this was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make adjustments needed so game could fit within console s limited memory game did not use playonline service used for xi this was explained as being due to marked decrease of content on service instead they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross platform gameplay including use of a universal square enix id that would allow players to play from wherever they left off in october 2009 game s beta release was announced as being only for windows first print runs of ps3 version of final fantasy xiii contained a bonus code for ps3 version of xiv for a special in game item due to earlier recurring issues with related to news updates team decided not to implement forums in original release instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums also because of mistranslation fears dedicated teams in each of game s release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to development team game s first closed alpha test began on march 11 2010 it was available only to veteran players from xi during alpha testing team used player feedback to find out key problems with game such as limitations on graphical adjustments making game run at a slow frame rate open beta test was originally scheduled to begin on august 31 but was indefinitely postponed due to discovery of critical bugs in game beta test eventually went live on september 2 running until game s release later that month it was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during beta period game released on september 30 2010 six months prior to ps3 version s projected release date of march 2011 a collector s edition was released on september 22 allowing owners to log into game from that date collector s edition which was decorated by artwork from amano and yoshida came with bonus items including a dvd featuring a behind scenes documentary a security token a case for game s box and a decorated tumbler game was released with text in japanese english french and german while spoken dialogue in cutscenes was english in all versions reception during its debut week in japan collector s edition reached 2 in pc games charts behind civilization 5 and ahead of starcraft ii wings of liberty in uk charts game debuted at 10 behind multiple other games including f1 2010 1 halo reach 2 civilization 5 4 and prince of persia forgotten sands 7 by november 2010 game had sold 603 000 copies worldwide game received generally negative reviews at release garnering scores of 50 and 49 100 by aggregate sites gamerankings and metacritic respectively computer and video games said eorzea is a beautiful world with huge potential for vast adventures but it s just a shame that this first voyage into it is such a mis step 1up com said that playing final fantasy xiv is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag it can be fun for a while and you can get general idea but you can t appreciate full experience stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue ign said that much of promise of combat system and depth of crafting mechanics are drowned unfortunately under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder experience at nearly every step further stating that while patches might improve experience its state at time of review made it not a world worth visiting gamespot in addition to warning players away from game said that final fantasy xiv is a notable entry to genre but only for what it lacks gametrailers was particularly critical saying that it had been released before it was finished calling it a broken incomplete mess pc gamer called game a shallow slow grind heavy mmo crippled by a horrible interface and nonsensical player limitations gamespy was again highly critical saying that barring a complete overhaul of user interface combat player interaction mechanics progress system and of layout of world itself final fantasy xiv is unlikely to ever be fun eurogamer said that while game would appeal to some players they advised them to wait another six months before even thinking about final fantasy xiv because square enix hasn t yet got its head around its own players critics agreed that game s graphics were good enjoyed uematsu s score and several praised concepts behind job and leveling systems alongside this unanimous criticism was laid against gameplay pace its convoluted interface bugs and glitches and slow pace of story it was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an mmorpg and a mainline entry in final fantasy series later as part of an interview concerning game s later development 1up com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned game into something more playable post release release of game sparked immediate player backlash in addition to its negative critical reception some of controversy was produced by use of gameplay features unusual for genre main complaint by players was user interface followed by problems with performance and aspects of gameplay initial 30 day free trial was extended twice in order to allow players to experience new development team s updates before committing to game in december 2010 it was announced that tanaka and komoto had been removed from their posts as producer and director with tanaka taking full responsibility for game s problems ps3 version was indefinitely delayed from its original march 2011 release date with square enix saying that it would not release game for that platform until it fully met quality standards suitable for final fantasy series subscriptions for windows version were also suspended indefinitely position of producer and director was taken over by naoki yoshida a staff member at square enix who had previously worked on dragon quest series among these were other staff changes komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer akihiko yoshida became lead scenario concept artist hiroshi takai was appointed as lead artist and akihiko matsui became lead combat system designer yoshida s main priority was to make game a playable experience after poor launch and subsequent reaction through subsequent patches to game multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made among most notable were addition of a job system personal chocobos a revamped battle system greater customization options for gear and multiple new dungeons and bosses yoshida also introduced official final fantasy xiv forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions and stated that interacting with and growing closer to community would be a high priority during this period xiv and xi were taken offline to help with energy conservation in aftermath of 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami they went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services due to earthquake a planned and partially developed boss battle with primal titan was cut and replaced by another primal team felt that players might be offended by primal and associate s links with power of earth in this context team could not fully mend game in its existing form as its engine and server structure were already critically flawed this meant that in order to save xiv entire game needed to be rebuilt from ground up decision to launch a new version as a reboot instead of a whole new title was driven by need to regain player trust which was felt would not be done by just scrapping xiv original story planned for xiv was changed to build up towards end of original game s life with new boss battles being introduced leading up to final storyline seventh umbral era storyline was used as a story based reason for radical changes coming to game and its landscape in run up to this reduced subscription fees were reintroduced with special bonuses included for eventual reboot of game and major server merges were carried out to ease transition between versions of game a move which initially provoked a negative reaction for players final revision of game was put out on november 1 2012 after a final in game battle where all xiv players were invited servers were closed down on november 11 legacy flawed release and poor reception of game had a heavy impact on square enix citing xiv among other reasons company reduced its projected income for year by 90 at 2011 tokyo game show wada issued an official apology for quality of game saying that final fantasy brand had been greatly damaged company and development team eventually decided to scrap current version of xiv rebuilding it from ground up this rebooted version initially titled final fantasy xiv 2 0 began development in april 2011 rebooted version was released in 2013 with subtitle a realm reborn and has been positively received by critics and players yoshida commenting in a later interview stated that a realm reborn was just first part of regaining player trust after release of xiv predicting that process would take a long time see also list of square enix video game franchises notes references external links official information site
