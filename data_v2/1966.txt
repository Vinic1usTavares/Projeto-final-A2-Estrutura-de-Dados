history and words bach composed cantata in his second year in leipzig for fourth sunday after easter called cantate prescribed readings for sunday were from epistle of james every good gift comes from father of lights and from gospel of john jesus announcing comforter in his farewell discourses in his second year bach had composed chorale cantatas between first sunday after trinity and palm sunday but for easter returned to cantatas on more varied texts possibly because he lost his librettist between easter and pentecost bach s congregation heard a series of nine cantatas with texts by a new librettist christiana mariana von ziegler as average interval between performances was less than a week they were not only for sundays there were additional ones for ascension day and pentecost bach may have been composed at a correspondingly intense rate although it is not known when he began work on them first of series was bwv 103 followed a week later by es ist euch gut dass ich hingehe it begins with a bass solo as delivering a quotation from gospel a second quotation appears in movement 4 movements 2 and 3 deal with hope for salvation movement 5 is a prayer for guidance until death poet used as closing chorale tenth stanza of paul gerhardt s hymn 1653 expressing faith in god s guidance publication cantata text was published in 1728 in ziegler s first collection version set by bach was slightly different as he shortened text here as in other cantatas by same librettist music survived in a holograph manuscript but was not published until 1876 when cantata appeared in bach gesellschaft s first complete edition of bach s work music structure and scoring bach structured cantata in six movements beginning with a biblical quotation for vox christi jesus speaking a set of aria and recitative is followed by a chorus on another biblical quotation from gospel while an aria leads to closing chorale bach scored work for three vocal soloists alto a tenor t and bass b a four part choir and a baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes d amore oa two violins vl viola va and basso continuo duration of cantata is given as 20 minutes in following table of movements scoring follows neue bach ausgabe keys and time signatures are taken from alfred durr using symbol for common time 4 4 continuo playing throughout is not shown movements cantata presents similarities to one bach wrote previous year for same occasion 1 similarities begin with first movement which like that of previous year s cantata is given to bass as vox christi movement is quotation of verse 7 from gospel beginning it is good for you that i leave for if i did not go comforter would not come to you it is between aria and arioso an oboe d amore as obbligato instrument plays extended melodies voice and oboe share musical material conveying mood of grieving at parting 2 following aria no doubt can disturb me is dominated by a virtuoso solo violin words ich glaube i believe are illustrated by very long notes in voice while an ostinato bass line renders steadfastness in a different way musicologist julian mincham notes that bach uses key f sharp minor selectively often for slowish movements of great expressive force for example for alto aria buss und reu from his st matthew passion 3 a short secco recitative expresses thus your spirit will guide me so that i walk on right path 4 next biblical quotation verse 13 of gospel but when that one spirit of truth shall come he shall lead you into all truth is rendered by choir it is divided in three sections similar to a da capo form all three parts are fugues combined in motet style instruments playing mostly colla parte with voices second section begins for he will not speak of his own accord third section expresses and what is to come he will foretell on a fugue subject similar to first giving movement a feeling of unity 5 last aria what my heart desires from you is accompanied by strings dominated by first violin word herz heart is rendered in sighing motifs intensified by following rests 6 closing chorale your spirit which god sends from heaven leads everything that loves him is a four part setting on melody of bass line is pacing forward constantly recordings selection is taken from listing on bach cantatas website vocal ensembles with one voice per part ovpp and instrumental groups playing period instruments in
