thumb hen ogledd old north c 550 c 650 area marked lleuddiniawn lothian contained region known as eidyn eidyn was region around modern edinburgh in britain s sub roman and early medieval periods approximately 5th 7th centuries it centred on stronghold of din eidyn thought to have been at castle rock now site of edinburgh castle and apparently included much of area below firth of forth it was most important district of brittonic kingdom of gododdin and a significant power in hen ogledd or old north brittonic speaking area of what is now southern scotland and northern england site of din eidyn has been nearly continuously occupied since bronze age serving as a stronghold of votadini during roman era and later principal centre of their successors gododdin kingdom eidyn s importance to hen ogledd is reflected in popularity of medieval poem y gododdin which concerns a war band that gathered there for a raid around ad 600 after years of decline eidyn was conquered by angles in 638 eidyn left a considerable legacy it is source of name of edinburgh in both english and scottish gaelic it also remained prominent in brittonic tradition throughout middle ages y gododdin evidently circulated in multiple manuscripts into 13th century eidyn also features in welsh triads and poetry where it was often remembered as britons northern frontier welsh genealogies of figure clydno eidyn may preserve eidyn s royal pedigree name and location questions of eidyn s name and location are closely linked as it is not entirely clear what area name refers to it certainly included fortress of din eidyn a brittonic name meaning dun or hillfort of eidyn in modern edinburgh place name evidence suggests eidyn spread more widely surviving also in name of carriden from caer eidyn located eighteen miles to west kenneth h jackson argued strongly that eidyn referred exclusively to din eidyn suggesting a different origin for carriden however other scholars such as ifor williams and nora k chadwick argued for caer eidyn etymology and believed that eidyn represented a wider region accepting latter interpretation rachel bromwich wrote that eidyn would have covered much of area south of firth of forth either abutting or possibly including area known as manaw gododdin eidyn is source of name of edinburgh in both english and scottish gaelic angles who conquered area in 7th century replaced brittonic din in din eidyn with old english burh to produce edinburgh similarly name became dun in scottish gaelic origin of name eidyn is not known it may not have been known even in 7th century as both angles and gaels adopted it into their languages more or less phonetically even as they translated term din into their own languages some sources suggest it derives from an old english form referring to edwin of northumbria though modern scholarship refutes this as form eidyn predates edwin eidyn is evidently original form of name though appears in later poetry later welsh sources also refer to lleuddiniawn region now known as lothian celtic scholar john t koch traces these names to god lugus who was especially revered in this area he argues that original form was country of fort of god lugus this name implies existence of a or fort of lugus which koch suggested was an alternate name or epithet of din eidyn history thumb 250px edinburgh castle on castle rock most likely location of din eidyn fortified communities appeared around edinburgh in bronze age and early iron age during britain s early roman era area was recorded as part of territory of votadini votadini were largely independent but subject to roman influence in 2nd century around 143 emperor antoninus pius commenced antonine wall north of votadini and what would become eidyn with its eastern terminus likely at carriden votadini may have become a roman client kingdom tasked with defending border against picts and scots conception of eidyn as britain s northern border against barbarians remained popular for hundreds of years in post roman era votadini polity transitioned into gododdin kingdom eidyn s importance to gododdin and hen ogledd in general is attested in early medieval poem y gododdin work relates that a force of 300 distinguished warriors from across brittonic world assembled at din eidyn for a raid on catraeth probably catterick around ad 600 poem s dense language and convoluted history make it difficult to interpret historical events underlying work according to ifor williams interpretation warriors were summoned by mynydawc eidyn perhaps a gododdin ruler to attack angles holding catraeth warriors feasted for a year before setting out on expedition during which almost all were killed later scholars such as john koch and graham isaac have challenged elements of this interpretation and read mynydawc as a place name referring to a mountain not as a ruler koch suggested that eidyn ruler was or gododdin who are mentioned in text thumb 250px right arthur s seat in edinburgh another possible location for din eidyn in 7th century gododdin kingdom was in decline at this time eidyn may have been a sub kingdom within gododdin and its lords may have controlled only their own territory and not all of gododdin annals of ulster record siege of in year 638 this may refer to final anglian conquest of lothian this is also earliest relatively certain historical reference to eidyn eidyn appears to have remained in anglian hands for most of next three centuries although historical and archaeological evidence is scant and it is unclear if a fortress remained at din eidyn annals of clonmacnoise indicate that aethelstan of england spoiled kingdom of edinburgh in 934 suggesting a fortification of some note existed at that time chronicle of kings of alba says that scots conquered eidyn and its fort under king who ruled from 954 962 around this time a noble estate was built there paving way for royal castle in 11th century din eidyn eidyn s most significant location was stronghold of din eidyn initial iron age settlement at din eidyn was presumably a dun or hill fort remains of such structures exist at arthur s seat and at castle rock now site of edinburgh castle and some other hilltops in area among these archaeologists generally identify castle rock site as din eidyn as evidence indicates it was an important centre continuously from roman times into middle ages archaeological evidence suggests castle rock has been inhabited since bronze age possibly making it oldest site in scotland that has been nearly continuously occupied however earliest evidence suggests site was initially minor compared to other contemporary locations during iron age site was apparently a fortified village though only one of several in edinburgh region its easily defended location appears to have given it an advantage over other nearby sites such as arthur s seat where settlement was evidently unstable and not continuous in roman era site supported a prosperous settlement that likely included a hillfort perhaps featuring a broch roundhouse in this period castle rock was apparently one of major centres of votadini though it was dwarfed by traprain law which was ten times larger in early medieval period din eidyn emerged as principal political centre of gododdin kingdom especially after abandonment of traprain law in early 5th century in 7th century when gododdin kingdom was in decline lords of din eidyn may have only controlled only eidyn district rather than entire gododdin territory following anglian conquest of eidyn din eidyn location remained a fortified settlement of angles and later of scots legacy thumb 150px right a page from y gododdin in book of aneirin eidyn remained prominent in brittonic tradition long
