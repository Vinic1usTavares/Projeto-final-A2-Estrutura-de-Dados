asa gray november 18 1810 january 30 1888 is considered most important american botanist of 19th century his darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species he was also strongly opposed to ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in sense of its not allowing for evolution as he felt evolution was guided by a creator as a professor of botany at harvard university for several decades gray regularly visited and corresponded with many of leading natural scientists of era including charles darwin who held great regard for him gray made several trips to europe to collaborate with leading european scientists of era as well as trips to southern and western united states he also built an extensive network of specimen collectors a prolific writer he was instrumental in unifying taxonomic knowledge of plants of north america of gray s many works on botany most popular was his manual of botany of northern united states from new england to wisconsin and south to ohio and pennsylvania inclusive known today simply as gray s manual gray was sole author of first five editions of book and co author of sixth with botanical illustrations by isaac sprague further editions have been published and it remains a standard in field gray also worked extensively on a phenomenon that is now called asa gray disjunction namely surprising morphological similarities between many eastern asian and eastern north american plants several structures geographic features and plants have been named after gray early life and education gray was born in sauquoit new york on november 18 1810 to moses gray b february 26 1786 then a tanner and roxanna howard gray b march 15 1789 born in back of his father s tannery gray was eldest of their eight children gray s paternal great grandfather had arrived in boston from northern ireland in 1718 gray s scotch irish presbyterian ancestors had moved to new york from massachusetts and vermont after shays rebellion his parents married on july 30 1809 tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn and lumber supply in area had been shrinking so gray s father used his profits to buy farms in area and in about 1823 sold tannery and became a farmer gray was an avid reader even in his youth he completed clinton grammar school from about 1823 to 1825 in those years reading many books from nearby library at hamilton college in 1825 he enrolled at fairfield academy switching to its fairfield medical college also known as medical college of western district of fairfield in autumn 1826 it was during this time that gray began to mount botanical specimens on a trip to new york city he attempted to meet with john torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens but torrey was not home so gray left specimens at torrey s house torrey was so impressed with gray s specimens that he began a correspondence with him gray graduated and became an m d in february 1831 even though he was not yet 21 years of age which was a requirement at time although gray did open a medical office in bridgewater new york where he had served an apprenticeship with doctor john foote trowbridge while he was in medical school he never truly practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany more it was around this time that he began making explorations in new york and new jersey by autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice to devote more time to botany in 1832 he was hired to teach chemistry mineralogy and botany at bartlett s high school in utica new york and at fairfield medical school replacing instructors who had died in mid term agreeing to teach for one year with a break from august to december 1832 gray had to cancel his plans for an expedition to mexico which at time included what is now southwestern united states gray first met torrey in person in september 1832 and they went on an expedition to new jersey after completing his teaching assignment in utica on august 1 1833 gray became an assistant to torrey at college of physicians and surgeons in new york city by this time gray was corresponding and trading specimens with botanists not just in america but also in asia europe and pacific islands gray held a temporary teaching position in 1834 at hamilton college due to funding shortages in 1835 gray was obliged to leave his job as torrey s assistant and in february or march 1836 became curator and librarian at lyceum of natural history in new york now called new york academy of sciences he had an apartment in their new building in manhattan torrey s attempt to get gray a job at princeton university was unsuccessful as were other attempts to find him a position in science despite gray no longer being his assistant torrey and gray became lifelong friends and colleagues torrey s wife eliza torrey had a profound impact upon gray in his manners tastes habits and religious life career thumb gray in 1841 in october 1836 gray was selected to be one of botanists on united states exploring expedition also known as wilkes expedition which was supposed to last three years gray began getting paid well for his work preparing and planning for this expedition even to point of loading supplies onto a ship in new york harbor however expedition was fraught with politics bickering turmoil inefficiency and delays referring to secretary of navy mahlon dickerson gray wrote of abominable management stupidity despite this gray resigned from lyceum in april 1837 to devote his time to preparations by 1838 expedition was in utter turmoil new state of michigan was starting its university and gray applied for a professorship in early 1838 he resigned from wilkes expedition on july 10 1838 on july 17 1838 gray became very first permanent paid professor at newly founded university of michigan although in event he never taught classes his position was also first one devoted solely to botany at any educational institution in america appointed professor of botany and zoology gray was dispatched to europe by regents of university for purpose of purchasing a suitable array of books to form university s library and equipment such as microscopes to aid research botanist charles f jenkins states that main purpose of this trip was to examine american flora in europe s herbariums gray departed on packet ship philadelphia on november 9 1838 sailing through narrows out of new york harbor nine days before his 28th birthday gray and regents were both involved in stocking university library in 1839 regents purchased a complete copy of audubon s birds of america for then extraordinary sum of 970 gray s first stop was in glasgow visiting william hooker who aided and financially supported many botanists including gray on january 16 1839 he arrived in london and stayed until march 14 he then spent time in paris where he collaborated with joseph at jardin des plantes in mid april 1839 he left paris for italy by way of southern france then visiting genoa rome florence venice bologna padua and trieste after italy gray went to vienna austria while in vienna he spent twelve days studying specimen collections and gardens with stephan endlicher who also introduced him to other local botanists in 1840 endlicher became director of botanical garden of university of vienna departing austria gray went to munich zurich and geneva where he met prominent botanist augustin pyramus de candolle who died in 1841 gray continued extensive collaboration with decandolle s son alphonse pyramus de candolle gray returned to germany going to freiburg tubingen dresden halle and then berlin where he stayed for a month while in berlin he spent most of his time in schoneberg where region s botanical gardens were then located gray then returned to london by way of hamburg gray admitted he just managed some of book purchasing and that he delegated actual buying of books to george palmer putnam who was then living in london gray spent a year in europe leaving for america from portsmouth england aboard sailing ship toronto on october 1 1839 and arriving back in new york on november 4 gray together with his agents eventually purchased about 3 700 books for university of michigan library regents at university of michigan were so impressed by gray s work in europe including his spending about 1 500 of his own money on specimen collections that they granted him another year s salary that covered him until summer of 1841 however finances at university were so bad that they asked him to resign in april 1840 thumb shortia galacifolia which gray named while he was in paris at jardin des plantes gray saw an unnamed dried specimen collected by andre michaux and named it shortia galacifolia he spent considerable time and effort over next 38 years looking for a specimen in wild first such expedition was in late june to late july 1841 to an area near jefferson ashe county north carolina his further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful including one in 1876 in may 1877 a north carolina herb collector found a specimen but did not know what it was eighteen months later collector sent it to joseph whipple congdon who contacted gray telling gray that he felt he had found shortia gray was ecstatic to confirm this when he saw specimen in october 1878 in spring 1879 gray led an expedition in which collector helped to spot where s galacifolia had been found gray never saw species in wild in bloom but made a final trip to this region in 1884 harvard professor both gray and torrey were elected to american academy of arts and sciences in december 1841 gray never returned to teach a course at michigan in 1833 dr joshua fisher a resident of beverly massachusetts and a harvard university alumnus bequeathed 20 000 to harvard to endow a chair in natural history university allowed proceeds to accumulate until it could fund a full year s salary for a professor because of this and a few problems in finding a suitable professor this chair was not filled until it was formally offered to gray on march 26 1842 offer was 1 000 year salary teaching duties limited to only botany and being superintendent of harvard s botanic garden while salary was low teaching limitation rare for time allowed him plenty of time to do research and work in botanic garden after an exchange of letters gray accepted this appointment as fisher professor of natural history at harvard formal appointment was made april 30 1842 gray arrived at harvard on july 22 1842 and began his duties in september he did not have to teach in fall of 1842 but began in spring 1843 first classes he had taught in nine years early in his years at harvard gray had to borrow money from his father soon he was able to repay his father and help his family by supplementing his income giving lectures outside of harvard including at lowell institute gray was considered a weak lecturer but because of his expert knowledge he was highly regarded by his peers his skills were better suited to teaching advanced rather than introductory classes he also gained renown for his textbooks and high quality illustrations gray moved into what became known as asa gray house in botanic garden in summer of 1844 it had been built in 1810 for william dandridge peck and later occupied by thomas nuttall as demands of teaching collecting selling specimens taking care of herbarium and writing books increased and he himself was not a good illustrator gray found it necessary to hire a botanical sprague who illustrated much of gray s works for decades to come by june 1848 many of specimens from wilkes expedition had been damaged or lost many were still not classified or published as mismanagement and bungling that had plagued expedition before it ever departed continued while on a trip to washington d c that month with his new bride gray was hired to study botanical specimens for five years this included a year in europe with his wife using facilities at herbariums in europe mr and mrs gray departed for england on june 11 1850 they spent summer traveling to belgium switzerland germany and netherlands gray then set down to work on expedition s plant sheets at estate of botanist george bentham whom he had met eleven years earlier and then with william henry harvey in ireland gray returned to england and settled into a routine at royal botanic gardens kew couple was back in america on september 4 1851 in meantime a dispute had arisen between wilkes and team of torrey and gray about format of books resulting from expedition gray almost hired his father in law to break contract this dispute largely centered on use of latin and english wilkes wanted a literal latin to english translation while torrey and gray wanted a looser one because they felt that technical english terms were equally incomprehensible to public much of work was stymied or burned in fires in 1855 torrey and gray contributed a report on botany of expedition to volume ii of reports of explorations and surveys to ascertain most practicable and economical route for a railroad from mississippi river to pacific ocean known as pacific railroad surveys executive document no 91 cong 2nd sess reports of explorations and surveys to ascertain most practicable and economical route for a railroad from mississippi river to pacific ocean volume ii 1855 a o p nicholson printer report included a catalogue of plants collected along with 10 black and white plates for illustration during late summer of 1855 gray made his third trip to europe this was an emergency trip to bring his ill brother in law home from paris gray spent only three weeks in london and paris and on way back he read newly published geographie botanique by alphonse decandolle this was a ground breaking book that for first time brought together large mass of data being collected by expeditions of time natural sciences had become highly specialized yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed way they were all upon a geologic scale gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus despite gray constantly seeking collectors and people to help him with harvard herbarium in first fifteen years he was at harvard no graduate entered botany as a career this changed in 1858 with arrival of daniel cady eaton who had graduated from yale university in 1857 and came to harvard to study with gray eaton later returned to yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium just as gray did at harvard daniel eaton was grandson of amos eaton whose textbooks gray had studied during his college days eaton influenced teaching style of gray and both required practical work of their students gray retained fisher post until 1873 while living in asa gray house in 1859 gray was elected a foreign member of royal swedish academy of sciences national academy of sciences was created by congress on march 3 1863 and he was one of original 50 members in 1864 gray donated 200 000 plant specimens and 2 200 books to harvard with condition that herbarium and garden be built this effectively created botany department at harvard and gray herbarium was named after him he was president of american association for advancement of science in 1872 and of american academy of arts and sciences 1863 1873 gray was also a regent at smithsonian institution in 1874 1888 and a foreign member of royal society of london in 1873 thumb suksdorfia violacea type species of its genus elements of botany 1836 an introductory textbook was first of gray s many works in this book gray espoused idea that botany was useful not only to medicine but also to farmers gray and torrey published flora of north america together in 1838 by mid 1850s demands of teaching research gardening collecting and corresponding had become so great and he had become so influential that gray wrote two high school level texts in late 1850s first lessons in botany and vegetable physiology 1857 and how plants grow a simple introduction to structural botany 1858 publishers pressured gray to make these two books non technical enough so that high school students and non scientists could understand them as with most scientists in american academic institutions gray found it difficult to concentrate purely on research gray met physician and botanist george engelmann in early 1840s and they remained friends and colleagues until engelmann died in 1884 torrey was an early american supporter of natural system of classification which relies upon geography and a plant s entire structure and as his assistant gray was a proponent of this system too this contrasts with linnaeus artificial classification which was designed for ease of use and focused on readily observed aspects of a plant particularly differences in flowers amos eaton was also a proponent of artificial system gray was so impressed with wilhelm nikolaus suksdorf a largely self taught immigrant from germany who specialized in flora of pacific northwest that he had suksdorf come to harvard to be his assistant and named genus suksdorfia after him gray was a leading opponent of scientific lazzaroni a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted american academia to mimic autocratic academic structures of european universities a large percentage of original 50 members of national academy of sciences were lazzaroni members american academy of arts and sciences was opposed to national academy and collectively elected gray and his friend colleague and fellow charles darwin supporter william barton rogers to national academy rogers founded massachusetts institute of technology this is one of areas where gray and his friend and colleague louis agassiz were in disagreement agassiz was a member of lazzaroni group agassiz had come to lecture at lowell institute in 1846 and got hired by harvard in 1847 gray befriended him way he had been befriended during his trip to europe gray abhorred slavery in his view science proved unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring i e all members of a species are connected genetically he also felt christianity taught unity of man he was not an abolitionist feeling it was more important to preserve union yet he also felt if south persevered in conflict every slave should be set free by use of more force if necessary however he was not sure what should be done with freed slaves this was another area where gray and agassiz disagreed agassiz felt each race had different origins thumb upright photograph by john adams whipple 1864 during american civil war gray was a steadfast supporter of north and republican party about february months before war started gray lost part of his left thumb just above base of nail in an accident in garden despite now being 50 years old he regretted that this accident ended his fighting days after hostilities began he joined a company that guarded massachusetts state arsenal in cambridge he also bought war bonds was surprised more people did not do likewise and supported a 5 tax to support war gray regretted not having children because he had no son to send to war gray considered abraham lincoln as a second george washington because of way he managed to preserve union during war he also predicted that fate of slavery depended upon length and bitterness of war and longer it lasted more disastrous it would be for south as a corollary he felt that if south had given up early in war they would have had a chance of preserving slavery longer regarding his botanical endeavors war sundered his supply of information and specimens from south even southern botanists who supported north such as alvan wentworth chapman and thomas peters were soon forced to cease communications with gray it was during war that gray first began to think of retiring from his professorial duties so he could concentrate on completing flora of north america harvard was able to secure substantial new funding for its botanical programs in years after war but gray encountered significant trouble finding a suitable replacement for his professorial duties american university system had failed to train replacements for its professors only harvard and yale had botany programs and in war and pre war years there had been few botany students however after war there was an upswing in numbers of botany students gray was grooming horace mann jr as his replacement but he died of tuberculosis at age of 24 in november 1868 growing weary of his workload gray and his wife departed on a trip to britain egypt for three months and switzerland in september 1868 it was during winter spent in egypt that gray first grew his white beard they returned in autumn 1869 in early 1872 gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself he proposed only looking after herbarium and writing books in exchange for rent of house in which he and his wife lived on university grounds due to way finances of funding sources were handled and lack of a replacement gray was unable to resign at that time in late 1872 charles sprague sargent was appointed director of botanic garden newly constructed arnold arboretum and new botany related buildings this freed up much of gray s time also late in 1872 ignatius sargent charles father and horatio hollis both agreed to donate 500 yearly each to support gray so that he could devote undivided attention to completing flora of north america this is what finally allowed gray to resign his professorship and devote all his time to research and writing harvard had so much trouble finding a replacement for gray that they considered hiring a european but they found an american and hired george lincoln goodale in late 1872 goodale had a medical degree from harvard and a solid knowledge of botany by late june 1873 goodale had enough experience that gray was excited to pronounce he had taught his last class william gilson farlow also had a medical degree from harvard and had studied botany he became gray s assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in europe for a few years he returned to harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor sereno watson began helping gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became herbarium curator reorganization of botany at harvard in early 1870s was a major accomplishment of gray s asa gray disjunction gray worked extensively on a phenomenon that is now called asa gray disjunction namely surprising morphological similarities between many eastern asian and eastern north american plants in fact gray felt flora of eastern north america is more similar to flora of japan than it is to flora of western north america but more recent studies have shown this is not so while gray was not first botanist to notice this it was first noticed in early 18thcentury beginning in early 1840s he brought scientific focus to issue he was first scientist in world to possess requisite knowledge set to do so as he had intimate knowledge of northeast and southeast united states as well as eastern to several contacts he had there phenomenon involves about and is not limited to plants but also includes fungi arachnids millipedes insects and freshwater fishes it was believed that each pair of species might be international sister species but it is now known that this is not generally case species involved are less closely related to one another today botanists suggest three possible causes for observed morphological similarity which probably developed at different times and via different pathways species pairs are 1 products of similar environmental conditions in separate locations 2 relics of species that were formerly widely distributed but diversified later 3 not as morphologically similar as was previously believed gray s work in this area gave significant support to darwin s theory of evolution and is one of hallmarks of gray s career in 1880 david p penhallow was accepted by gray as a research assistant penhallow aided in gray s work regarding distribution of northern hemisphere plants and in 1882 gray recommended penhallow as a lecturer to sir john dawson of mcgill university in montreal quebec canada later career despite no longer having burden of his professorial and garden duties by late 1870s burden of maintaining himself as pillar of american botany prevented gray from progress he desired on flora of north america follow on to flora of north america this burden consisted of fact that other scientists often only accepted gray s word on a botanical matter and number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly numbers had to be assigned to them collectors needed to be corresponded with and preliminary papers had to be published by early 1880s gray s home was center of everything to do with botany in america every aspiring botanist came to see him even if just to look at him through his window after turning over his non research duties to sargent goodale farlow and watson gray concentrated more on research and writing especially on plant taxonomy as well as lecturing around country largely promoting darwinian ideas many of his lectures during this time were given at yale divinity school liberty hyde bailey worked as gray s herbarium assistant for two years during 1883 1884 in spring 1887 gray and his wife made their last trip to europe this one for six months from april october primarily to see hooker gray received following advanced degrees honorary degree of master of arts 1844 and doctor of laws 1875 from harvard and doctor of laws from hamilton college new york 1860 mcgill university 1884 and university of michigan 1887 research regarding american west thumb left aesculus discolor by gray from plates prepared between years 1849 and 1859 to accompany a report on forest trees of north america prior to 1840 besides what he had discovered during his trip to europe gray s knowledge of flora of american west was limited to what he could learn from edwin james who had been on expedition to west of major stephen harriman long and from thomas nuttall who had been on an expedition to pacific coast with nathaniel jarvis wyeth in latter half of 1840 gray met german american botanist and physician george engelmann in new york city engelmann took frequent trips to explore american west and northern mexico two remained close friends and botanical collaborators engelmann would send specimens to gray who would classify them and act as a sales agent their collaborations greatly enhanced botanical knowledge of those areas another german american botanist ferdinand lindheimer collaborated with both engelmann and gray focusing on collecting plants in texas hoping to find specimens with no latin names another long term and productive collaboration was with charles wright who collected in texas and new mexico on two separate expeditions in 1849 and 1851 1852 these trips resulted in publication of two volume plantae in 1852 1853 thumb right hymenoxys owl s claws an example of plummera named by gray gray traveled to american west on two separate occasions first in 1872 by train and then again with joseph dalton hooker son of william hooker in 1877 his wife accompanied him on both trips both times his goal was botanical research and he avidly collected plant specimens to bring back with him to harvard on his second trip through american west he and hooker reportedly collected over 1 000 specimens gray s and hooker s research was reported in their joint 1880 publication vegetation of rocky mountain region and a comparison with that of other parts of world which appeared in volume six of hayden s bulletin of united states geological and geophysical survey of territories on both trips he climbed grays peak one of colorado s many fourteeners his wife climbed grays peak with him in 1872 this mountain was named after gray by botanist and explorer of rocky mountains charles christopher parry prior to 1870s collecting in western part of country required slow horses wagons and often military escorts but by this time permanent settlements and railroads resulted in so many specimens coming in that gray alone could not keep up with them one of post war collectors who worked extensively with gray was john gill lemmon husband of fellow botanist sara plummer lemmon gray named a new genus plummera now called hymenoxys in sara s honor relationship with darwin thumb gray in 1867 gray and joseph dalton hooker went to visit richard owen at london s hunterian museum in january 1839 gray met charles darwin during lunch that day at kew gardens apparently introduced by hooker darwin found a kindred spirit in gray as they both had an empirical approach to science and first wrote to him in april 1855 during 1855 1881 they exchanged about 300 letters darwin then wrote to gray requesting information about distribution of various species of american flowers which gray provided and which was helpful for development of darwin s theory this was beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence gray darwin and hooker became lifelong friends and colleagues and gray and hooker conducted research on darwin s behalf in 1877 on their rocky mountain expedition after hooker returned to england and reported to darwin on their adventure darwin wrote back to gray i have just heard prodigies of your strength activity that you run up a mountain like a cat before 1846 gray had been firmly opposed to idea of transmutation of species in which simpler forms naturally become more complex over time including via hybridization by early 1850s gray had clearly defined his concept that species is basic unit of taxonomy this was partly result of 1831 1836 voyage during which darwin discovered differentiation of species among various galapagos islands local geography could produce variances like in galapagos and hawaii which gray did not get to study in depth as he had wanted gray was insistent that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species that like begat like this concept was critical to darwin s theories gray was also strongly opposed to ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in sense of its not allowing for evolution when darwin received alfred russel wallace s paper that described natural selection hooker and charles lyell arranged for a joint reading of papers by darwin and wallace to linnean society on july 1 1858 since darwin had nothing prepared reading included excerpts from his 1844 essay and from a letter he had sent to asa gray in july 1857 outlining his theory on origin of species by that time darwin had begun writing his book on origin of species correspondence with gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing darwin s intellectual priority with respect to theory of evolution by natural selection neither darwin nor wallace attended meeting papers were published by society as on tendency of species to form varieties and on perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection by summer 1859 it was obvious to gray and others working with darwin that on origin of species would be a ground breaking book darwin published on origin of species on november 24 1859 first printing was 1 250 copies with some having been sent to america via ship one of those was for gray gray s copy arrived just before christmas and he read it between christmas and new year s since there was no international copyright law at time gray worked to protect book from publishing piracy according to american law at time a copyright could only be secured by an american edition being published by an american citizen and royalties were not required to be paid to author gray arranged first american edition of on origin of species and was able to negotiate royalties on darwin s behalf gray took a 5 royalty from publisher and darwin was so grateful for gray s efforts that he offered gray some of his royalties darwin held gray in high esteem he dedicated his book forms of flowers 1877 to gray and he wrote in 1881 there is hardly any one in world whose approbation i value more highly than i do yours seeing unity we perceive in nature and law in universe regarding all species he felt that they not only had a creator but have a governor gray and agassiz strongly disagreed agassiz was adamantly opposed to idea of evolution whereas gray was a staunch supporter believing in theistic evolution as debate raged over darwin s theories rift between gray and agassiz grew deeper and they were estranged by december 1863 when gray was elected president of american academy of arts and sciences which also marked agassiz increasing isolation within scientific community gray showed little interest in scientific politics and resigned from national academy of sciences in 1867 in late 1866 agassiz apologized to gray and two were at least civil to one another again gray considered by darwin to be his friend and best advocate also attempted to convince darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life and to return to his faith gray saw nature as filled with unmistakable and irresistible indications of design and argued that god himself is very last irreducible causal factor and hence source of all evolutionary change darwin agreed that his theories were not at all necessarily atheistical but was unable to share gray s belief i feel most deeply that whole subject is too profound for human intellect a dog might as well speculate on mind of newton he wrote gray was a christian but he was a staunch supporter of darwin in america he collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book darwiniana 1876 these essays argued for a conciliation between darwinian evolution and tenets of theism at a time when many on both sides perceived two as mutually exclusive gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to theological view and study of harmonies between mind and nature and thought it most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in nature would be realized through natural agencies result of all this is that gray distanced himself from social darwinism gray is a critical link in history of american intellectualism and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment thereby providing a way for believers in creationism to consider darwin s ideas in 1868 gray had a year s leave of absence and visited darwin in first time they had met since they started their correspondence darwin had gray in mind when he wrote it seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist an evolutionist darwin dedicated his 1877 book different forms of flowers on plants of same species to gray as a small tribute of respect and affection one area where darwin and gray disagreed was darwin s theory of pangenesis grays traveled to europe again during 1880 1881 including a final visit to down house darwin s home he spent a year in europe this time studying darwin died in 1882 personal life gray became engaged to jane lathrop loring of boston in may 1847 two of gray s younger brothers george and joseph were students at harvard in late 1840s and lived with gray during his junior year george caught typhoid fever in late 1847 and died on january 9 1848 in loring house in boston this is part of reason gray s marriage was delayed from fall 1847 to spring 1848 gray and jane loring married on may 4 1848 her parents were charles greely loring a member of harvard corporation and a lawyer and anna pierce brace loring her family was unitarian like most faculty and staff of harvard at time both of them kept to their separate religious denominations yet seem to have had no difficulties over it they had no children jane gray accompanied her husband on most of his expeditions gray was a devout presbyterian and was a member of first church in cambridge a congregational church where he served as a deacon he was also an ardent empiricist in tradition of john locke and john stuart mill when congregation moved into its present building in 1872 at street gray planted two kentucky trees in front of church they stood until october 2014 death on monday november 28 1887 gray s hand and arm became paralyzed while he was coming down stairs for breakfast even though paralysis worsened he was able to address two letters on thursday he lost ability to speak in a steady rhythm he lay speechless and quiet for two months and died on january 30 1888 he was buried at mount auburn cemetery he did not want anything fancy on his gravestone so his wife had it engraved with a cross and asa gray 1810 1888 cemetery s asa gray garden with a central fountain and numerous unusual tree varieties is named in his honor legacy thumb grave in mount auburn cemetery life work in addition to asa gray disjunction one of gray s greatest achievements was vast network of scientists he built who all communicated with one another and exchanged ideas he is considered preeminent american botanist of 19thcentury on gray s 75th birthday botanists led by editors of botanical gazette presented gray with a silver vase with inscription 1810 november eighteenth 1885 asa gray in token of universal esteem of american botanists an accompanying silver salver had inscription bearing greetings of one hundred and eighty botanists of north america to asa gray on his 75th birthday nov 18 1885 also received on his 75th birthday was a poem by james russell lowell just fate prolong his life well spent whose indefatigable hours have been as innocent and fragrant as his flowers namesakes grayanotoxin is named
