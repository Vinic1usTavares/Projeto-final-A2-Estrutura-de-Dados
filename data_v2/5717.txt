lily family liliaceae consists of about 254 genera and about known species of flowering plants within order liliales they are monocotyledonous perennial herbaceous often bulbous geophytes plants in this family have evolved with a fair amount of morphological diversity despite genetic similarity common characteristics include large flowers with parts arranged in threes with six colored or patterned petaloid tepals undifferentiated petals and sepals arranged in two whorls six stamens and a superior ovary leaves are linear in shape with their veins usually arranged parallel to edges single and arranged alternating on stem or in a rosette at base most species are grown from bulbs although some have rhizomes first described in 1789 lily family became a paraphyletic catch all wastebasket group of petaloid monocots that did not fit into other families and included a great number of genera now included in other families and in some cases in other orders consequently many sources and descriptions labelled liliaceae deal with broader sense of family family evolved approximately 52 million years ago during late cretaceous to early paleogene eras liliaceae are widely distributed mainly in temperate regions of northern hemisphere and flowers are insect pollinated many liliaceae are important ornamental plants widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets a number of liliaceae genera are popular cultivated plants in private and public spaces lilies and tulips in particular have had considerable symbolic and decorative value and appear frequently in paintings and decorative arts they are also an economically important product most of their genera lilium in particular face considerable herbivory pressure from deer in some areas both wild and domestic description diversity of characteristics complicates any description of liliaceae morphology and confused taxonomic classification for centuries diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance as some members emerged from shaded areas and adapted to a more open environment see evolution general liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous perennial herbaceous bulbous or rhizomatous in case of medeoleae flowering plants with simple trichomes root hairs and contractile roots flowers may be arranged inflorescence along stem developing from base or as a single flower at tip of stem or as a cluster of flowers they contain both male androecium and female gynoecium characteristics and are symmetric radially but sometimes as a mirror image most flowers are large and colourful except for medeoleae both petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups whorls of petals that are often striped or multi coloured and produce nectar at their bases stamens are usually in two groups of three trimerous and pollen has a single groove monosulcate ovary is placed above attachment of other parts superior there are three fused carpels with one to three chambers locules a single style and a three lobed stigma embryo sac is of fritillaria type fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule but occasionally a berry medeoleae which is dispersed by animals leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to edges arranged singly and alternating on stem but may form a rosette at base of stem specific inflorescence usually indeterminate lacking terminal flower as a raceme lilium sometimes reduced to a single terminal flower tulipa when multiple blooms flowers are arranged in a cluster or rarely are gagea or a spike flowers hermaphroditic actinomorphic radially symmetric or slightly zygomorphic bilaterally symmetric pedicellate on a short secondary stem generally large and showy but may be inconspicuous medeoleae bracts may bracteate or may not be present perianth is undifferentiated perigonium and two whorled formed from six tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts trimerous each although scoliopus has only three petals free from other parts but overlapping tepals are usually petaloid petal like and free with lines striate or marks in other colors or shades perianth is either homochlamydeous all tepals equal e g fritillaria or two separate and different whorls e g calochortus and may be united into a tube nectar is produced in nectaries at base of tepals androecium six stamens in two trimerous whorls with free filaments usually fused to tepals and outer whorl of stamens opposite outer tepals and inner whorl opposite inner tepals although scoliopus has three stamens opposite outer tepals attachment of anthers to filaments may be either to surface or pseudo basifixed surrounding filament tip but not adnate that is not fused and longitudinally and are dehiscing away from center pollen is usually monosulcate single groove but may be lacking aperture clintonia some tulipa spp or operculate lidded fritillaria some tulipa spp and reticulate net patterned erythronium fritillaria gagea lilium tulipa gynoecium superior ovary with fused carpels with three connate fused carpels and is trilocular three locules or chambers or unilocular single locule as in scoliopus and medeola there is a single style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less elongated along style there are numerous anatropous curved ovules which display axile placentation parietal in scoliopus and medeola usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium embryo sac megagametophyte varies by genera but is mainly e g fritillaria embryo sacs in which three of four megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus are referred to as fritillaria type a characteristic shared by all core liliales fruit a capsule that is usually loculicidal splitting along locules as in lilioideae but occasionally splitting between them along separating septa in and wind dispersed although medeoleae form berries seeds may be flat oblong angular ellipsoid or globose spherical or compressed with a well developed epidermis exterior may be smooth or roughened with a wing or raphe ridge aril or one to two tails rarely hairy but may be dull or shiny and lack of a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as allioideae that were previously included in this family and striate parallel longitudinally ridged in hilum scar is generally inconspicuous separate testa and tegmen seed coat itself may be thin like cork or hard or brittle endosperm is abundant cartilaginous fleshy or horny and contains oils and but not starch non farinaceous its cells are polyploid triploid or depending on embryo sac type embryo is small usually less than one quarter of seed volume axile radially sectioned linear longer than broad or rarely rudimentary tiny relative to endosperm depending on placentation type and straight bent curved or curled at upper end leaves simple entire smooth and even linear oval to filiform thread like mostly with parallel veins but occasionally net veined they are alternate single and alternating direction and spiral but may be whorled three or more attached at one node e g lilium fritillaria arranged along aerial stem or sheathed in a basal rosette they are rarely stem attached before apex and lack aerial stem is unbranched genome liliaceae include species with largest genome size within angiosperms fritillaria 1c 127 4 pg while tricyrtis is as small as 4 25 pg chromosome numbers vary by genus some genera like calochortus x 6 10 prosartes 6 8 9 11 scoliopus 7 8 streptopus 8 27 and tricyrtis 12 13 have a small and variable number of chromosomes while subfamily lilioideae have a larger and more stable chromosome number 12 as have medeoleae 7 phytochemistry seeds contain saponins but no calcium oxalate crystals chelidonic acid unlike asparagales or cysteine derived sulphur compounds allyl sulphides another distinguishing feature from characteristic odour of allioideae fritillaria in particular contains steroidal alkaloids of and solanum type and alkaloids have been isolated from some fritillaria species tulipa contains an see also toxicology characteristics often vary by habitat between shade dwelling genera such as prosartes tricyrtis cardiocrinum clintonia medeola prosartes and scoliopus and sun loving genera shade dwelling genera usually have broader leaves with smooth edges and net venation and fleshy fruits berries with animal dispersed seeds rhizomes and small inconspicuous flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow parallel veined leaves capsular fruits with wind dispersed seeds bulbs and large visually conspicuous flowers see also evolution taxonomy taxonomy of liliaceae has a very complex history family was first described in eighteenth century and over time many other genera were added until it became one of largest of monocotyledon families and also extremely diverse modern taxonomic systems such as apg which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology have redistributed many of these genera resulting in relatively small family that is currently recognised consequently there are many different accounts of liliaceae in literature and older uses of term occur commonly to distinguish between them latin terms sensu lato and sensu stricto are frequently used together with their abbreviations s l and s s to denote broader or stricter sense of circumscription respectively e g liliaceae s s history family liliaceae was described by michel adanson in 1763 and formally named by antoine laurent de jussieu in 1789 jussieu defined this grouping as having a calyx of six equal colored parts six stamens a superior ovary single style and a trilocular three chambered capsule by 1845 john lindley first english unhappily acknowledged great diversity in circumscription of family and that it had expanded vastly with many subdivisions as he saw it liliaceae were already paraphyletic catch all being all liliales not included in other orders but hoped that future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better he recognized 133 genera and 1200 species by time of next major british classification that of bentham and hooker in 1883 published in latin several of lindley s other families had already been absorbed into liliaceae over time family became increasingly broad and somewhat arbitrarily defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary eventually coming to encompass about 300 genera and 4 500 species within order liliales under cronquist system 1981 cronquist merged liliaceae with amaryllidaceae making this one of largest monocotyledon families many other botanists echoed lindley s earlier concerns about phylogeny of liliaceae but various schemes to divide family gained little traction dahlgren 1985 suggested there were in fact forty not one families distributed over three orders predominantly liliales and asparagales in context of a general review of classification of angiosperms liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of flowering plants as elaborated by angiosperm phylogeny group 1998 modern apg classification and phylogeny angiosperm phylogeny group apg made rapid progress in establishing a modern monophyletic classification of flowering plants by 2009 despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly genetic homogeneity for family liliaceae their morphology remains diverse and there exists within liliaceae clade or grouping a number of subclades subgroups particularly enigmatic were clintonia medeola scoliopus and tricyrtis of fifteen genera within liliaceae ten genera of lilioideae subfamily form one morphological group that is characterised by contractile bulbs and roots and a fritillaria type embryo sac megagametophyte with four megaspores within lilioideae clintonia and closely related medeola form a subclade and are now considered a separate tribe medeoleae other major grouping consists of five genera constituting streptopoideae including scoliopus and calochortoideae including tricyrtis subfamilies characterised by creeping rhizomes styles which are divided at their apices and by megagametophyte development of polygonum type a simple megaspore and triploid endosperm embryo sac evolution and biogeography development of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy suggested liliales formed some of earliest monocots molecular analysis indicates that divergence amongst liliales probably occurred around 82 million years ago closest sister family to liliaceae are with liliaceae separating 52 million years ago liliaceae thus arose during late maastrichtian cretaceous to early paleocene paleogene periods major evolutionary clades include lilieae lilium fritillaria nomocharis cardiocrinum notholirion from himalayas about 12 mya and erythronium tulipa gagea from east asia at about same time medeoleae clintonia and medeola may have appeared in north america but were subsequently dispersed as may have streptopoideae and calochortoideae liliaceae fossils have been dated to paleogene and cretaceous eras in antarctic liliaceae probably arose as shade plants with subsequent evolution to open areas including deciduous forest in more open autumnal period but then a return of some species e g cardiocrinum this was accompanied by a shift from rhizomes to bulbs to more showy flowers production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel veined leaves again some reversal to broader reticulate veined leaves occurred e g cardiocrinum subdivisions and genera suprageneric subdivisions due to diversity of originally broadly defined liliaceae s l many attempts have been made to form suprageneric classifications e g subfamilies and tribes classifications published since use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of liliaceae liliaceae s s angiosperm phylogeny website apweb recognizes three subfamilies one of which is divided into two tribes genera various authorities e g itis 16 grin 27 wcsp ncbi delta differ on exact number of genera included in liliaceae s s but generally there

and tulipa 75 species all within tribe lilieae etymology and pronunciation name liliaceae comes to international scientific vocabulary from new latin from lilium type genus a standardized suffix for plant family names in modern taxonomy genus name comes from classical latin word lilium lily which in turn came from greek distribution and habitat liliaceae are widely distributed but mainly in temperate regions of northern hemisphere centre of diversity is from southwest asia to china their distribution is diverse mainly in plains steppes and alpine meadows but also in deciduous forests mediterranean scrub and arctic tundra tulipa and gagea provide examples of ornamental types representing continental zones turanian region characterised by cessation of underground growth at high temperatures in early summer and requiring low winter temperatures for spring flowering while some genera are shade dwelling such as medeoleae and streptopoideae tricyrtis and cardiocrinum others prefer a more open habitat ecology liliaceae are ecologically diverse species of liliaceae bloom at various times from spring to late summer colorful flowers produce large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract insects which pollinate them particularly bees and wasps butterflies and moths seeds are dispersed by wind and water some species e g scoliopus erythronium and gagea have seeds with an aril structure that are dispersed by ants proliferation of deer populations in many areas due to human factors such as elimination of their animal predators and introduction to alien environments is placing considerable herbivory pressure on many of family s species fences as high as 8 feet may be required to prevent them from consuming plants an impractical solution for most wild areas those of lilium genus are particularly palatable while species in fritillaria are repellant pests and predators thumb left 140px scarlet lily beetle lilioceris lilii thumb left 140px 17th century painting of affected tulipa semper augustus showing breaking liliaceae are subject to a wide variety of diseases and pests including insects such as thrips aphids beetles and flies also fungi viruses and vertebrate animals such as mice and deer an important horticultural and garden pest is scarlet lily beetle japanese red lily beetle lilioceris lilii and other lilioceris species which attack fritillaria and lilium lilium species may be food plants for cosmia moth a major pest of tulips is fungus botrytis tulipae both lilium and tulipa are susceptible to a group of five viruses of family specifically potyvirus named for potato virus y group which includes tulip breaking virus and lily streak virus lily mottle virus resulting in breaking of color of flowers viruses are transmitted by aphids this breaking effect was of economic importance during tulip mania of seventeenth century because it appeared to be producing new varieties in modern times tulip breeders have produced varieties that mimic effect of virus without being infected one of these varieties is known as rembrandt after dutch artist of that name contemporary tulip owners commonly had rembrandt and other artists paint their flowers to preserve them for posterity hence broken tulips were known as rembrandt tulips at that time another modern variety is princess irene one of tulip breaking viruses is also named rembrandt tulip breaking virus cultivation floriculture many species of lilieae in genera tulipa fritillaria lilium and erythronium and calochortoideae calochortus and tricyrtis are grown as ornamental plants worldwide within these genera a wide range of cultivars have been developed by breeding and hybridisation they are generally used in outdoor gardens and other displays although in common with many bulbous flowering plants they are often induced to bloom indoors particularly during winter months they also form a significant part of cut flower market in particular tulipa and lilium tulips tulips have been cultivated since at least tenth century in persia tulip production has two main markets cut flowers and bulb latter are used in turn to meet demand for bulbs for parks gardens and home use and secondly to provide necessary bulbs for cut flower production international trade in cut flowers has an approximate total value of 11 billion euros which provides an indication of economic importance of this activity main producer of tulip bulbs is netherlands a country that accounts for 87 of global cultivated area with approximately 12 000 hectares other leading producers include japan france and poland approximately ten other countries produce commercial tulips largely for domestic market by contrast netherlands is leading international producer to extent of 4 billion bulbs per annum of these 53 are used for cut flower market and remainder for dry bulb market of cut flowers 57 are used for domestic market in netherlands and remainder exported original tulipa species can be obtained for ornamental purposes such as tulipa and tulipa these are referred to as species or botanical tulips and tend to be smaller plants but better at than cultivated forms breeding programs have produced a wide range of tulip types enabling blooming through a much longer season by creating early mid and late spring varieties fourteen distinct types are available in addition to botanical tulips including lily flowered fringed viridiflora and rembrandt in addition to blooming season tulip varieties differ in shape and height and exhibit a wide range of colours both pure and in combination lilies largest area of production is also netherland with 76 of global cultivated area followed by france chile japan united states new zealand and australia approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether about half of commercial production is for cut flowers many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying domestic market netherland produces about 2 200 million lily bulbs annually of which 96 is used domestically and remainder exported principally within european union one particularly important crop is production of lilium longiflorum whose white flowers are associated with purity and easter although many lilium species such as lilium martagon and lilium candidum can be obtained commercially majority of commercially available lilies represent products of a very diverse hybridisation program which has resulted in a separate horticultural classification including such groupings as asian oriental and in addition to a very wide variety of heights lilies can be obtained in many colours and combinations of colours and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn because of history of liliaceae many species such as bugle lily that were previously classified in this family bear name lily but are neither part of genus lilium or family liliaceae other a variety of fritillaria species are used as early spring ornamental flowers these vary from large fritillaria imperialis crown imperial available in a number of colours such as yellow or orange to relatively tiny species such as fritillaria meleagris or fritillaria uva vulpis with their chequered patterns erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is pagoda with its sulphur yellow flowers calochortus mariposa lily may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars propagation thumb left 140px bulbils in leaf axils of lilium thumb left 140px seeds of liliaceae species methods of propagation include both sexual and asexual reproduction commercial cultivars are usually sterile sexual reproduction seeds can be used for propagation of plant or to create hybrids and can take five to eight years to produce flowering plants since interspecific cross pollination occurs overlapping wild populations can create natural hybrids asexual reproduction bulb offsets daughter bulbs that form on mother bulb and can be detached micropropagation techniques including tissue culture bulbils which are adventitious bulbs formed on parent plant s stem scaling and twin scaling used to increase production in slower growing varieties in which multiple whole scales are detached from a single bulb bulb offsets and tissue culture produce genetic clones of parent plant and thus maintaining genetic integrity of cultivars bulb offsets usually require at least a year before flowering commercially plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell toxicology while members of liliaceae s s have been used as food sources in humans bulbs of some species are poisonous to household pets bulb toxicosis if eaten and may cause serious complications such as renal failure in cats from lilies particularly lilium longiflorum easter lily dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression most fritillaria e g fritillaria imperialis fritillaria meleagris bulbs contain poisonous neurotoxic alkaloids such as which may be deadly if ingested in quantity while other species such as fritillaria and fritillaria affinis are edible tulips can cause skin irritation due to presence of and which are also found in flowers leaves and stems of fritillaria these are also toxic to a variety of animals uses fritillaria extracts are used in traditional chinese medicine under name chuan bei mu and in latin bulbus bulbs of fritillaria have been used as and expectorants lilium bulbs particularly lanzhou lily lilium davidii are used as food in china and other parts of asia during world war ii starvation conditions in netherlands hunger winter 1944 led to using tulipa bulbs as food calochortus bulbs were eaten by native americans and by mormon settlers in utah during starvation other members of family used for food include clintonia leaves medeola roots erythronium corms and fritillaria bulbs culture lilies type genus lily lilium has a long history in literature and art and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name and a floral emblem particularly of france fleur de lis cultivation of lilies has been described since at least ninth century when charlemagne ordered it to be grown at his imperial palaces however name lily has historically been applied to a wide variety of plants other than genus lilium lily appears in ancient literature associated with both sovereignty and virginal innocence and is mentioned on a number of occasions in bible such as description in solomon s song of songs 2 1 2 i am a rose of sharon a lily of valleys like a lily among thorns is my darling among young women or gospel of mathew 6 28 consider lilies of field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin to represent beauty artistic representations can be found as far back as frescos from second century bc at and knossos early christian churches such as that of basilica of sant apollinare in classe were sometimes decorated with lilies while predominantly depicted as white those seen at akrotiri are red lilies white lily has long been seen as a symbol of purity coming to be associated with virgin mary in middle ages from which came name madonna lily lilium candidum a well known example is leonardo da vinci s annunciation 1472 1475 in which archangel gabriel bears a madonna lily other symbolic meanings include glory love and birth fleur de lis thumb 80px left symbolic fleur de lis stylised lily or fleur de lis lily flower has long been associated with royalty although it may originally have been derived from form of an iris it has also been associated with head of a spear its three parts have been associated with three classes of mediaeval society or alternatively faith wisdom and chivalry whatever its exact derivation it has come to be associated with france and french monarchy since earliest frankish kings consequently it became incorporated into not only french heraldry but also that of many heraldic devices in jurisdictions where there had been historic french influence such as quebec and new orleans in modern times it appears in many forms symbolic and decorative and can be used on compasses to indicate direction north as well as scouting movement tulips thumb 180px allah hagia sophia istanbul thumb left 140px ceramic dish iznik ca 1600 with tulips roses and hyacinths tulips tulipa also have a long cultural tradition particularly in islamic world persian word for tulips laleh was borrowed into turkish and arabic as lale in arabic letters lale is written with same letters as allah and is used to denote god symbolically tulips became widely used in decorative motifs on tiles fabrics and ceramics in islamic art and ottoman empire in particular and were revered in poetry such as that of omar in twelfth century tulips were an essential part of gardens of persia having been cultivated from steppes as seljuks oghuz turkic leaders originated from steppes moved to persia and then west they took tulips with them to turkey where many escaped cultivation and became naturalised today there are a number of places in turkey called with tulips tulips first appeared in decorative arts in turkey in thirteenth century and flourished under ottomans in particular in royal palaces and was adopted by as their symbol further species were collected from persia and spreading ottoman empire saw to it that tulip culture also spread by sixteenth century it was a national symbol hence designation tulip era by which time they were becoming of economic importance by 1562 tulip trade had reached europe with first shipment to antwerp where they were mistaken for vegetables although they had been cultivated in portugal since 1530 and first appeared in illustration in 1559 and first tulip flowers were seen in netherlands in 1625 tulips spread rapidly across europe in seventeenth century and became an important trading item initially in france before concentrating in netherlands eventually speculative trading in tulips became so intense as to cause a financial bubble which eventually collapsed a period known as tulip mania from 1634 to 1637 similar to ottoman empire s tulip era nevertheless since then tulip has become indelibly associated with netherlands and all things dutch it was during this period that a ceramic vase for growing tulips indoors was devised and golden age of dutch painting was replete with images of tulips although tulip festivals are held around world in spring most famous of these is display at keukenhof one of better known novels on tulips is black tulip by alexandre dumas pere in 1850 dealing with a contest to grow a black tulip in late seventeenth century haarlem other
