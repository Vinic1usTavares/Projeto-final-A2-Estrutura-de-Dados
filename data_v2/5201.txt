dan dugan born march 20 1943 is an american audio engineer inventor and nature sounds recordist he was first person in regional theatre to be called a sound designer and he developed first effective automatic microphone mixer automixer dugan s sound design work was acknowledged in 2003 with a distinguished career award by united states institute for theatre technology in his youth dugan was fascinated by technical aspects of theatre he worked as a lighting designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967 dugan became interested in achieving automatic adjustment of sound controls after a frustrating experience staging musical hair his first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console this proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications each of dugan s subsequent automixer models has been of type dugan first recorded sounds in late 1960s to augment his sound designs he continued making recordings concentrating on capturing sounds of nature dugan records outdoors in a variety of locations including national parks and nature preserves he has assisted in research related to harmful effects of human generated sound in nature dugan is a co founder and current secretary of people for legal and nonsectarian schools plans a california non profit organization incorporated in 1997 early career daniel w dugan was born in los angeles california on march 20 1943 after his father u s navy commander p f dugan had been activated for service in pacific war dan dugan was raised in san diego where his parents took him to old globe theatre and summer musicals at ford bowl he always wanted to go backstage to see lighting control equipment as a young man he sang bass in church choir in san diego bach chorus in choral workshops under roger wagner at san diego state university and in madrigal groups for dancing on green an elizabethan era folk dancing event held in front of old globe dugan obtained a four year scholarship to university of san francisco and majored in physics and math he dropped out in 1963 to pursue stagecraft specifically lighting design his early lighting designs include ones for san diego national shakespeare festival at old globe theatre san diego opera and actor s workshop in san francisco sound design thumb left 1978 dugan prepares sound design materials in a dressing room at old globe theatre in san diego dugan changed from lighting design to sound design in 1967 state of sound design at time was mostly occasional sound effects performed live or played back on record players or tape machines dugan s first efforts in sound involved designing sound solutions for shakespeare festival in san diego and for american conservatory theatre act in san francisco dugan s complex and atmospheric theatrical soundscapes led to a new title during act s 1968 69 season he was first regional theatre person to be called a sound designer in 1959 in london dan collison was first given sound effects billing near level of lighting designer and in 1961 jack mann was credited as sound designer for a broadway production he presented a paper about his sound design to audio engineering society aes at their 37th convention and his paper was published in journal of audio engineering society in december 1969 dugan described a system in which signals from three stereo tape players were routed to ten loudspeaker zones in theater dugan designed sound for three regional productions of hair musical ones in chicago las vegas and toronto chicago production ran in 1969 and 1970 at blackstone theatre operated at that time by shubert organization dugan was able to design sound but not allowed to operate mixing console because he was not in stagehands union international alliance of theatrical stage employees iatse when mondavi founded mondavi summer music festival in 1969 at robert mondavi winery primarily featuring jazz artists dugan supplied sound services at outdoor venue in napa california he recorded independent record albums including kate wolf s first two back roads 1976 and lines on paper 1977 and designed sound for sacramento music circus dugan occasionally delivered speeches at conferences of united states institute for theatre technology usitt in 1980s and 1990s in 2003 usitt honored dugan with harold burris meyer distinguished career in sound design award given for a lifetime spent establishing field of sound design for performing arts as both artist and innovator in audio engineering and technology previous winners of award were abe jacob john bracewell charlie richmond and tony meola automixer while designing sound for musical hair dugan began to appreciate human operator s inability to act quickly enough to control multiple microphones he saw show s audio mixing person working rotary knobs for 16 area mics 9 hand mics and 10 mics in band dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless it was getting some worthwhile signal more than just room ambiance his frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by voltage controlled amplifiers vcas finally developing dugan music system shown to aes at their 49th convention held in new york in 1974 this system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby total gain was divided between all active microphones microphones were continuously and automatically adjusted by a set of vcas to bring each microphone up or down in mix based on how much signal it was sending relative to signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from other microphones dugan s patent application for a control apparatus for sound reinforcement systems was accepted and published on june 4 1974 this was first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm basis for all of dugan s later systems thumb dugan tests nine model a automixers ca 1980 though algorithm was good reference microphone was an unpredictable variable it had practical placement problems if it was near audience audience noise would skew algorithm if placed backstage crew and equipment noises could be a factor thus dugan music system was not immediately developed into a product dugan studied problem researching alternative solutions in 1975 dugan filed a patent for dugan speech system and in 1976 produced 60 copies of what he named dugan model a automixer with serial number 1 a unit dugan fabricated by hand was installed in conference room of bell labs by harvey fletcher significantly external microphone reference of dugan music system was replaced by a reference composed of total signal received from all of active microphones dugan described process some three decades later thumb left dugan holds his yamaha dugan my16 card 2011 and to his left are earlier automixer models dugan licensed this more practical system to altec who produced 4 and 8 channel automixers for commercial installations such as hotels conference rooms courtrooms and city council chambers dugan speech system was first commercially successful automixing algorithm over next 15 years other manufacturers designed competing automixers and market segment was born in late 1980s dugan developed a gain limiting improvement to automixing algorithm dugan gain limiting system was patented in september 1989 and presented to 87th aes convention in october dugan described for aes his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console operated by a person to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less reverberation and noise more focus on desired sound eliminating mixing engineer s problem of too slow human reaction time gain limiting system provided smooth continuous control over equivalent number of open microphones nom that automixer would send at its outputs nom could be set anywhere between 1 and 10 with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback in presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers an embodiment of dugan s three patents was produced as model d automatic mixing controller a 3u rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other model ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously thumb generations of dugan s automixers dugan s original 1974 patent expired in 1991 and dugan speech system patent in 1993 other manufacturers began to sell automixers incorporating dugan algorithm in 1996 dugan produced model d 1 an automixer for speech only applications model d 2 returned to having applicability for both speech and music as did model d 3 in 1997 dugan licensed his system to protech audio of indian lake new york yielding protech 2000 model series in september 2006 dugan produced model e e standing for economy this half rack sized automixer was much smaller and less expensive than previous ones it could be linked with another model e to control up to 16 channels two units could be mounted side by side in only 1u of rack space model e s popularity came with many critical requests for features and in may 2008 model e 1 was introduced an incremental improvement to replace model e it allowed adat interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console helpful with yamaha mackie and other digital audio gear containing adat inputs and outputs its user interface was a simple web browser page accessible by computer connected with category 5 cable in february 2011 dugan demonstrated an automixer card marketed by yamaha to plug into accessory slot of a yamaha digital mixer such as or this card dugan my16 could mix up to 16 channels of microphone inputs assigned to selected inserts in mixer s graphic user interface like model e 1 automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface allowing remote control with an ipad touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network dugan algorithm moved inside yamaha s ql of mixers in march 2014 as an option on graphic equalizer processing page this internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones nature sounds thumb upright 6 left hosting a tech talk for nature sounds dugan made his first sound effects recordings to augment his theatrical sound designs as he grew more interested in field recording he was attracted to sounds found in pristine natural settings environments without human noise a board member and webmaster of nature sounds society dugan has conducted equipment training sessions since 1994 and has given talks about his experiences in nature recording he has traveled to new zealand in pursuit of recordings but mainly devotes himself to u s national parks and monuments such as yosemite and muir woods other national parks and monuments at which he has recorded sound include joshua tree pinnacles lassen volcanic yellowstone haleakala olympic zion bryce canyon kings canyon sequoia and lava beds thumb recording in field wearing a vest with attached microphones protected by furry windscreens dugan and his wife sharon perry nature sounds society chair recorded dawn chorus of cathedral grove in muir woods once each month for a year he has partnered with national park service and california library of natural sounds to document various sounds heard in u s parks regarding his reasons for doing so dugan wrote in 2008 in 2006 dugan assisted a group of researchers studying soundscapes and human use at muir woods researchers presented their findings at northeastern recreation research symposium produced by united states forest service a work titled from landscapes to soundscapes understanding and managing natural quiet in national parks they concluded that human generated noise is a potentially important indicator of quality of soundscapes in parks plans inc in 1998 an organization he co founded people for legal and nonsectarian schools plans inc filed a federal lawsuit against sacramento city unified school district and twin ridges elementary school district in california arguing that their waldorf methods inspired schools violated first and fourteenth amendments of united states constitution and article ix of california constitution complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief plans inc v sacramento city unified school district and twin ridges elementary school district filed u s district court eastern district of california no civ s 98 266 filed 2 11 98 dugan participated in court proceedings after years of litigation 9th circuit court dismissed case on its merits in 2012 as co founder and secretary of plans dugan has given media interviews and was quoted in book flickering mind false promise of technology in classroom and how learning can be saved he said waldorf schools are faith based and draw from an educational theory that is frozen in 1925
