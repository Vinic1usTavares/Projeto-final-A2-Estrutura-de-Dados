2015 pacific hurricane season is second most active pacific hurricane season on record with 26 named storms only behind 1992 season a record tying 16 of those storms became hurricanes and a record 11 storms further intensified into major hurricanes throughout season central pacific portion of northeast pacific ocean between international date line and 140th meridian west had its most active year on record with 16 tropical cyclones forming in or entering basin moreover season was third most active season in terms of accumulated cyclone energy amassing a total of 287 units season officially started on may 15 in eastern pacific and on june 1 in central pacific they both ended on november 30 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in northeast pacific basin however formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of year this was shown when a tropical depression formed on december 31 above average activity during season was attributed in part to very strong 2014 16 el nino event season featured several long tracking and powerful storms although land impacts were often minimal in june hurricane blanca an early season category 4 hurricane killed four people due to rough seas hurricane carlos caused minor damage while passing a short distance off coast of mexico in july remnants of hurricane dolores brought record rainfall to southern california killing one and causing losses worth over 50 million on august 29 three category 4 hurricanes kilo ignacio jimena were all active simultaneously in pacific east of international date line for first time in recorded history in september moisture from hurricane linda contributed to storms that killed 21 people in utah later that month hurricane marty inflicted 30 million in damage to southwestern coast of mexico in october hurricane patricia became most intense hurricane ever recorded in western hemisphere with a central pressure of 872 mbar hpa 25 75 inhg and 1 minute sustained winds of 215 mph 345 km h after also becoming strongest landfalling pacific hurricane on record patricia claimed 13 lives and was responsible for 463 million in damage season s activity continued into november when hurricane sandra became strongest pacific hurricane ever recorded in that month damage across basin reached 566 million 2015 usd while 45 people were killed by

summary thumb 260px map of sea surface temperature sst anomalies in pacific ocean on october 15 showing well above normal ssts east of international date line 180deg accumulated cyclone energy ace index for season was 160 4225 units in eastern pacific and 126 535 units in central pacific total ace for northeast pacific basin in 2015 amounted to 286 9575 units ace is a rough measure of energy generated by a tropical cyclone over its lifespan and is calculated every six hours when tropical cyclone has sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph 63 km h therefore more intense and longer lived tropical cyclones will generate more ace overall 31 tropical cyclones formed of which 26 reached tropical storm intensity and were named a total of 16 of these storms became hurricanes and a record breaking 11 became major hurricanes these values make 2015 season second most active on record central pacific meanwhile had its most active year on record with 16 tropical cyclones forming in or entering basin easily surpassing old record of 11 set in 1992 and 1994 season officially began on may 15 in eastern pacific and on june 1 in central pacific season ended officially on november 30 though a tropical depression formed well after that on december 31 well above average activity levels were largely attributed to strong 2014 16 el nino event which brought anomalously high sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear to western parts of basin in fact for region between 116th meridian west and international date line sea surface temperatures from july to october averaged highest value on record since reliable data records began in 1979 around hawaii sea surface temperatures were 0 9 degc 1 6 degf higher than at any point during past 60 years wind shear in region was also at its lowest on record during that period existence of a large region of rising air over basin during much of season a feature typical of el nino events further facilitated development and intensification of season s numerous tropical cyclones thumb left 350px hurricanes kilo left ignacio center and jimena right all at major hurricane intensity spanning central and eastern pacific basins on august 30 season started off with three successive hurricanes with andres and blanca both reaching category 4 status on june 3 blanca became both earliest second hurricane and second major hurricane in basin since reliable records began in 1971 and became earliest instance of a landfall on baja california peninsula ten days later carlos became second earliest third hurricane on record after about a month of inactivity eight systems formed in july including five from july 8 12 ela became earliest named storm to form in central pacific within bounds of official season and along with iune and halola marked first month in satellite era where three tropical cyclones were observed in central pacific six more systems formed in an active august early on august 30 hurricanes kilo ignacio and jimena intensified into category 4 hurricanes this was first time in historical record that three or more major hurricanes existed simultaneously in pacific east of international date line and that two or more major hurricanes existed simultaneously in central pacific september saw formation of five systems excluding kevin which was named in september but formed on august 31 three systems linda sixteen e and marty affected mexico with first two also bringing floods to southwestern united states flood event caused by linda in utah was also state s deadliest october saw another five systems with formation of oho on october 3 2015 season surpassed 1992 and 1994 as most active year on record in central pacific during october 18 19 olaf became southernmost forming hurricane and major hurricane in eastern pacific olaf later became first system on record to cross from eastern pacific into central pacific and then back into eastern pacific while still a tropical cyclone patricia became strongest hurricane in basin on october 23 when its pressure fell to 892 mbar hpa 26 34 inhg breaking previous record of 902 mbar hpa 26 64 inhg set by 1997 s hurricane linda patricia subsequently became strongest tropical cyclone on record in western hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure with a central pressure of 872 mbar hpa 25 75 inhg this value was also second lowest globally behind typhoon tip of 1979 which had a central pressure of 870 mbar hpa 25 69 inhg additionally its maximum sustained winds of 215 mph 345 km h were strongest ever reliably recorded or estimated anywhere globally patricia later became strongest pacific hurricane to strike mexico after making landfall in jalisco as a strong category 4 hurricane following month tied for most active november with development of two systems rick and sandra sandra subsequently strengthened into a major hurricane bringing season total to a record 11 its peak winds of 150 mph 240 km h and minimum central pressure of 934 mbar hpa 27 58 inhg surpassed hurricane kenneth of 2011 for strongest november pacific hurricane in terms of both sustained winds and central pressure despite official end of season on november 30 anomalously favorable conditions in central pacific gave rise to final storm of season tropical depression nine c which formed on december 31 and dissipated late same day this marked latest end to a pacific hurricane season on record systems hurricane andres on may 23 national hurricane center nhc began monitoring potential for tropical cyclogenesis well south of mexico over following days a broad low pressure area formed three days later steadily organizing to become tropical depression one e at 06 00 utc on may 28 with an increase in spiral banding and an expanding central dense overcast depression was upgraded to tropical storm andres six hours later directed west northwest and eventually northwest by a subtropical ridge over mexico cyclone quickly organized and became a hurricane on may 29 a spurt of intensification saw andres strengthen into a strong category 2 hurricane late next day andres s intensification trend leveled off thereafter due to an eyewall replacement cycle and a brief increase in vertical wind shear but andres still managed to reach major hurricane status early on may 31 becoming one of only five major hurricanes during month of may although forecasts did not indicate additional strengthening andres began a period of rapid deepening following day as wind shear decreased intensifying into a category 4 hurricane at 00 00 utc on june 1 andres reached its peak intensity six hours later with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph 230 km h and a minimum pressure of 937 mbar hpa 27 67 inhg thereafter system moved west northwestwards over cooler waters and into a more stable environment which led to a swift weakening trend andres fell below hurricane strength on morning of june 2 and weakened into a tropical storm a day later further weakening ensued as convection around andres s center dissipated and nhc declared andres a remnant low on june 4 moisture extending from remnants of andres brought light rain to parts of southwest united states with phoenix arizona having measurable precipitation on june 5 for first time since records began in 1896 this moisture further extended into colorado resulting in scattered severe thunderstorms hurricane blanca a tropical wave first monitored by nhc late on may 27 spawned a weak low pressure area well south of acapulco mexico two days later plagued by strong upper level winds from hurricane andres disturbance slowly organized into season s second tropical depression at 12 00 utc on may 31 and further into tropical storm blanca on following day moving little within a weak steering regime cyclone began to rapidly deepen by june 2 as conditions aloft became more favorable following appearance of a pinhole eye blanca became a major hurricane at 12 00 utc on june 3 shortly thereafter blanca reached its peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 145 mph 230 km h and a pressure of 936 mbar hpa 27 64 inhg tremendous upwelling of cooler waters with some areas falling from resulted in weakening early on june 4 a concurrent eyewall replacement cycle spurred further weakening and blanca degraded to category 1 status by june 5 next day a shifting ridge steered blanca northwest back over warm waters allowing blanca to quickly reintensify to a secondary peak of 130 mph 215 km h however as blanca tracked poleward waters beneath cyclone cooled yet again prompting a quick weakening trend after weakening to a tropical storm on june 7 blanca made landfall around 12 00 utc on june 8 near puerto cortes with winds of 45 mph 75 km h and became earliest instance of a landfall in baja california peninsula since records began in 1949 swiftly weakening over land blanca degenerated to a remnant low on june 9 and dissipated shortly after on june 3 precautionary alerts were raised across southern baja california peninsula and much of western mexico due to potential impacts from hurricane a collective 3 300 troops from mexican army and navy were deployed to baja california sur to ensure safety of residents although blanca remained far from jalisco large swells and rip currents produced by hurricane claimed four lives across baja california sur high winds downed power lines and left 104 106 residents without electricity however around 90 percent of outages were fixed within 12 hours of storm remnants of blanca later brought much needed rain to parts of southwestern united states daily rainfall records were broken in several areas though accumulations were generally less than some flooding took place in santa barbara county california flash floods across nevada inundated homes and roads and also caused minor damage to landscaping in new mexico strong thunderstorms brought hail of up to in diameter and spawned a brief ef0 tornado near headquarters damage across california amounted to 68 000 while damage across nevada totaled 46 000 damage in new mexico reached 20 000 additionally on june 10 some of blanca s moisture moved north and brought light showers to san francisco bay area hurricane carlos in early june a kelvin wave interacted with a few tropical waves to south of mexico system gradually organized and was designated as a tropical depression on june 10 while situated about south southeast of puerto escondido oaxaca drifting slowly northwestward depression was upgraded further to tropical storm intensity although persistent wind shear and dry air hampered intensification early on carlos strengthened into a hurricane on june 13 after moving into more favorable conditions however return of dry air and upwelling caused storm to deteriorate into a tropical storm paralleling mexican coast carlos regained hurricane intensity on june 15 and peaked with sustained winds of 90 mph 150 km h and a pressure of 978 mbar hpa 28 88 inhg next day wind shear and dry air afterwards caused carlos to rapidly weaken falling to tropical storm intensity on june 17 and degenerating into a remnant low pressure area hours later carlos formation prompted coastal authorities to enact precautionary measures along states deemed at risk in guerrero 507 shelters were opened nhc also issued several tropical cyclone warnings and watches between june 11 and june 17 from jalisco to guerrero rough seas along shore generated by hurricane caused widespread damage twelve ships including a yacht worth 11 million pesos us 717 000 sunk in playa manzanillo harbor waves along with heavy rain inflicted at least 5 million pesos us 326 000 of damage on michoacan s coastal installations strong winds produced by passing storm also downed trees power poles and billboards especially in acapulco there 16 homes were swept away by waves tropical storm ela a tropical wave crossing eastern pacific spawned a low pressure area on july 3 system gradually organized amid persistent wind shear and on july 8 system intensified into tropical depression four e just before it entered area of responsibility of central pacific hurricane center cphc on july 9 depression intensified into a tropical storm as it tracked to northwest and was named ela by cphc ela intensified slightly to reach its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph 75 km h and a pressure of 1002 mbar hpa 29 59 inhg however strong wind shear prevented ela from intensifying further by removing thunderstorms from circulation center and eventually causing it to gradually weaken ela was downgraded to a depression on july 10 and not long after declared a remnant low well east of hawaiian islands ela is one of just six tropical cyclones to form as a depression in eastern pacific basin but not be named until entering central pacific others are lala li iniki and lana it would be succeeded by hurricane ulika a year later it is also fourth earliest storm to form during calendar year in central pacific after and hali of 1992 as well as pali of 2016 tropical storm halola a monsoon trough building across pacific ocean spawned a large ill defined circulation well southwest of hawaii on july 3 circulation organized slightly and began to detach from monsoon trough on july 6 but further development was halted for a while as an upper level anticyclone imparted strong wind shear over system anticyclone moved away on july 9 allowing low level circulation to move under persistent convection to northwest as thunderstorm activity expanded in coverage system was declared tropical depression one c by cphc at 06 00 utc on july 10 moving westwards under influence a strong ridge to north depression slowly strengthened into tropical storm halola early on july 11 after intensifying to reach winds of 60 mph 95 km h a slight increase in wind shear prevented further strengthening maintaining that intensity halola crossed international date line into western pacific basin late on july 12 and entered area of responsibility of japan meteorological agency tropical storm iune a weak low pressure area was first identified in monsoon trough southeast of hawaii on july 2 it drifted west northwest gradually becoming better defined as thunderstorm activity increased and it separated from monsoon trough by 06 00 utc on july 10 there was sufficient organization to declare it a tropical depression small size of cyclone made it especially susceptible to moderate upper level winds and it failed to intensify to tropical storm iune until 18 00 utc on july 11 when deep convection persisted near center no further intensification occurred amid light southerly wind shear and iune weakened to a tropical depression around 18 00 utc on july 12 as it moved west southwest after being devoid of thunderstorm activity for 18 hours storm degenerated to a remnant low by 12 00 utc next day post tropical cyclone moved west across central pacific before finally dissipating around 12 00 utc on july 17 hurricane dolores a westward moving tropical wave crossed central america and entered eastern pacific on july 9 on july 11 system was declared tropical depression five e while located roughly 345 mi 555 km south southeast of acapulco mexico amid moderate northwesterly wind shear depression gradually strengthened into tropical storm dolores and reached hurricane status on july 13 as dolores moved roughly parallel to coast of mexico shear over system decreased allowing for a burst of rapid intensification dolores peaked as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph 215 km h and a minimum pressure of 946 mbar hpa 27 94 inhg early on july 15 however as dolores approached socorro island cyclone underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and began to steadily weaken storm remained potent though as it passed socorro island with an automated weather station on island recording sustained hurricane force winds despite completing cycle on july 16 dolores had moved over cooler sea surface temperatures and hence continued its weakening trend by morning of july 17 dolores had deteriorated to a tropical storm and eventually degenerated into a post tropical remnant low about 300 mi 480 km west of baja california coast next day remnant low slowly curved southwards and dissipated on july 22 well west of san diego california moisture extending from storm s remnants brought record rains and thunderstorms to southern california record monthly rainfall totals include in san diego in los angeles and in paso robles in foothills and mountains of east san diego county rainfall exceeded this had effect of helping firefighters contain north fire but also resulted in debris flows and rock slides that damaged about 90 homes and submerged cars san diego river reached levels of just below flood stage and overflowed its banks in a few areas flash flooding occurred in moreno valley perris and la mesa while a microburst occurred in a haboob was also recorded in anza borrego desert state park strong winds blew over a semi truck as well as power poles and lines on interstate 40 near california nevada border obstructing road in both directions and causing 75 000 in damage in kern county a 62 year old man was killed by a lightning strike a bridge along interstate 10 near desert center was washed out injuring one damage to bridge was placed at 50 million another road was washed out by flash flooding this time along state route 78 southwest of cibola arizona with damage totaling 50 000 hail size of golf balls was recorded in bear valley alpine county damaging a police vehicle losses across california reached 50 477 million tropical storm enrique a tropical wave about 1 150 mi 1 850 km southwest of tip of baja california peninsula spawned a broad low pressure area on july 10 low s circulation became increasingly well defined as tropical wave moved away from system leading to classification of tropical depression six e at 12 00 utc on july 12 gradually organizing as it crawled west northwestwards depression intensified to become tropical storm enrique 18 hours later despite being situated in a generally favorable environment dry air to northwest of enrique entrained into its circulation causing system to struggle to intensify eventually system reached its peak intensity late on july 14 with 50 mph 85 km h winds and a minimum pressure of 1 000 mbar hpa 29 53 inhg thereafter increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear threatened to expose low level circulation and enrique started to weaken on july 15 despite moving over cooler waters enrique maintained its intensity over next two days as it began to slow down and turn to southwest under influence of hurricane dolores to its east during afternoon of july 17 enrique weakened to a tropical depression and degenerated to a remnant low next day remnants curved back to east over next few days dissipating entirely well west of baja california peninsula by july 22 tropical storm felicia a westward tracking tropical wave moved off africa on july 7 crossing into east pacific nine days later disturbance was initially disorganized with a broad elongated circulation and intermittent convection by 06 00 utc on july 23 however it acquired sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression about 430 mi 695 km southwest of baja california six hours later depression intensified into tropical storm felicia and attained peak intensity with winds of 40 mph 65 km h and a pressure of 1004 mbar hpa 29 65 inhg negative effects of shear dry air and cooler waters began to affect felicia almost immediately and cyclone weakened to a tropical depression by 00 00 utc on july 24 all associated convection with storm dissipated by 18 00 utc that day marking felicia s degeneration into a remnant low 545 mi 880 km west of southern tip of baja california low turned west and southwest prior to opening into a trough on july 28 tropical depression eight e a tropical wave accompanied by showers and thunderstorms entered eastern pacific ocean on july 19 tracking steadily westwards wave formed a low pressure area in middle of eastern pacific on july 27 turning slightly to west northwest low slowly intensified into tropical depression eight e six hours later however strong north northwesterly wind shear prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm as eight e moved into a drier environment it failed to sustain deep convection near its center and eventually degenerated into a remnant low late on july 29 eight e s remnants continued tracking in a westward direction and opened up into a trough by august 1 well east southeast of hawaii hurricane guillermo a tropical disturbance well south of baja california peninsula gained enough organization to be declared tropical depression nine e on july 29 located in an environment of low wind shear high sea surface temperatures and abundant moisture conditions were very favorable for strengthening allowing nine e to intensify into tropical storm guillermo just six hours later continuing to quickly intensify while tracking steadily west northwestwards guillermo became a hurricane only 36 hours after its formation and eventually reached peak intensity with winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a pressure of 967 mbar hpa 28 56 inhg a strong category 2 hurricane guillermo weakened slightly afterwards but remained at category 2 strength as it crossed 140degw into central pacific late on august 1 however as guillermo neared hawaii increasing southwesterly wind shear began to weaken cyclone and guillermo eventually degraded to a tropical storm on august 3 wobbling towards west northwest following a break in subtropical ridge guillermo weakened further to a tropical depression on august 7 located 90 mi 150 km north of maui not long after guillermo degenerated to a post tropical low and dissipated altogether by august 9 on august 6 some of guillermo s moisture was brought to northern california and san francisco bay area by jet stream bringing rare dry lightning storms to those areas during night hurricane hilda a tropical wave behind guillermo spawned a well defined low pressure area well to west of mexico which became tropical depression ten e on august 5 depression intensified into tropical storm hilda next day amid moderate northeasterly wind shear and warm waters hilda gradually strengthened into a hurricane on august 7 while moving steadily westwards rapid intensification ensued thereafter as shear diminished and a small inner core developed and hilda became a major hurricane just before entering central pacific continuing to rapidly intensify hilda eventually reached its peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane late on august 8 possessing 145 mph 230 km h sustained winds and a minimum pressure of 937 mbar hpa 27 67 inhg hilda then moved over slightly cooler waters and into a drier environment resulting in a weakening trend that saw hilda drop below major hurricane status late on august 9 next two days saw hilda turn to northwest and slow down while rounding southwestern part of a subtropical ridge weakening continued and accelerated on august 10 11 as subtropical jet stream over hawaii inflicted strong wind shear over hilda exposing low level circulation under influence of both strong westerly jet stream and easterly trade winds hilda became almost stationary as it rapidly dropped below hurricane strength on august 12 convection over hilda mostly dissipated by august 13 and shallower system began to track to west southwest hilda degenerated to a remnant low south of hawaii by august 14 after bringing heavy rain to big island tropical depression eleven e a broad low pressure area around 485 mi 780 km south southwest of cabo san lucas organized into tropical depression eleven e on august 16 moving on a northwesterly to west northwesterly path cyclone failed to intensify due to its large circulation and entered an area of unfavorable conditions late on august 17 southeasterly shear dry air entrainment and cooler waters caused depression to lose its deep convection and eventually degenerate into a remnant low by august 18 low turned to north northwest and dissipated two days later around 980 mi 1 575 km west of punta eugenia hurricane loke a low level trough developed along intertropical convergence zone southeast of hawaii on august 13 it merged with remnants of hurricane hilda into monsoon trough by august 18 and continued west with intermittent bursts of convection one such burst detached a well defined circulation from monsoon trough and pulled it northeastwards leading to formation of a tropical depression by 00 00 utc on august 21 which became tropical storm loke later that day a nearby upper level trough restricted outflow of storm shortly after formation causing it to briefly weaken to a tropical depression early on august 22 while it moved in an undulating fashion however as loke accelerated to northeast with trough positioned to northwest upper level environment became more favorable and system regained tropical storm strength early on august 23 developing a cloud filled eye loke reached hurricane intensity around 18 00 utc on august 24 simultaneously peaking with winds of 75 mph 120 km h and a pressure of 985 mbar hpa 29 09 inhg afterwards loke was once again hindered by aforementioned nearby trough which served to impart strong wind shear over system and pull it to north cyclone weakened to a tropical storm late on august 25 as it underwent extratropical transition before it was rapidly drawn northwestwards into circulation of a large extratropical low formerly typhoon by 00 00 utc on august 27 hurricane kilo disturbance that would become kilo was first noticed by cphc within a trough on august 17 located 1 150 mi 1 850 km southeast of big island of hawaii disturbance produced intermittent thunderstorm activity as it exited trough on august 19 20 a mid level ridge steered disturbance west northwestwards while imparting easterly wind shear over system serving to prevent disturbance from organizing eventually shear decreased as ridge weakened and disturbance became a tropical depression with convection near center of circulation on august 22 during next two days depression turned to northwest and then north around western end of weakening ridge all while remaining rather weak and disorganized on august 26 however development of a new ridge directed depression towards southwest and caused remaining wind shear to decrease this led to depression intensifying into tropical storm kilo at 18 00 utc as system approached johnston atoll tropical storm warnings were issued for atoll as kilo passed within 35 mi 55 km to north at around 00 00 utc on august 28 amid high sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear kilo began to quickly strengthen while being steered westwards by a mid level ridge attaining hurricane status on august 29 over next 24 hours kilo rapidly deepened into a category 4 hurricane with winds nearly doubling from 75 mph 120 km h to 140 mph 220 km h kilo reached its peak intensity at end of this strengthening phase with central pressure dropping to 940 mbar hpa 27 76 inhg around this time kilo was one of three hurricanes at category 4 intensity spanning eastern and central pacific basins first such occurrence in recorded history thereafter a slight weakening trend took place with kilo dropping to category 3 status late on august 30 turning to northwest through a break in ridge kilo maintained its intensity over next couple of days as it approached international date line between 12 00 utc and 18 00 utc on september 1 kilo crossed date line and entered jurisdiction of japan meteorological agency simultaneously becoming a typhoon kilo continued on as a tropical cyclone until september 10 when it dissipated near western kuril islands of alaska having traversed over 4 000 mi 6 400 km from its genesis point south of hawaii islands hurricane ignacio on august 25 a low pressure system organized into tropical depression twelve e before strengthening into tropical storm ignacio later that day ignacio initially moved west northwest posing a threat to hawaii on august 26 ignacio became a hurricane while continuing its trek towards hawaii over next few days ignacio struggled to intensify while being impacted by moderate wind shear as wind shear relaxed ignacio was able to quickly intensify to major hurricane status on august 29 at this time big island of hawaii was placed under a tropical storm watch as island began feeling effects of high surf ignacio continued to rapidly intensify as it turned to northwest and away from hawaii attaining peak intensity at category 4 status with winds of 145 mph 230 km h and a minimum central pressure of 942 mbar hpa 27 82 inhg on august 30 ignacio was also one of three simultaneous category 4 pacific hurricanes east of international date line along with kilo and jimena first such occurrence in recorded history after peaking in intensity ignacio began weakening as southwesterly wind shear increased system weakened to tropical storm strength at midnight on september 2 well north of hawaii but was soon able to reattain hurricane status while passing over anomalously warm waters and experiencing a brief respite in wind shear continuing to track northwards over decreasing sea surface temperatures ignacio weakened to a tropical storm for last time on september 3 and became post tropical late next day remnants of ignacio continued north across pacific before turning to east northeast towards western canada on september 6 on september 8 extratropical remnants of ignacio were absorbed by a cold front hundreds of miles south of alaska hurricane jimena a westward moving low pressure area organized into a tropical depression on august 26 around 735 mi 1 185 km southwest of manzanillo mexico moving over very warm waters and located in an environment of low wind shear and abundant moisture depression steadily strengthened becoming tropical storm jimena on august 27 jimena soon developed a tight inner core with radius of maximum winds extending just 40 mi 65 km from center this allowed jimena to explosively deepen over next two days over a 48 hour period its winds increased by 115 mph 185 km h at 06 00 utc on august 29 jimena reached its peak intensity as a strong category 4 hurricane possessing winds of 155 mph 250 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 932 mbar hpa 27 52 inhg soon after jimena turned to west northwest and underwent an eyewall replacement cycle despite weakening slightly jimena remained at category 4 status thus becoming one of three simultaneous category 4 pacific hurricanes east of international date line on august 30 first such occurrence of its kind on august 30 jimena completed eyewall replacement cycle and quickly regained 150 mph 240 km h winds this time with a larger eye of 40 45 mi 65 75 km diameter however upwelling of cooler waters beneath hurricane and entrainment of mid level dry air into circulation as well as a second eyewall replacement cycle resulted in a steady weakening beginning late on august 31 next day jimena crossed 140degw as a category 3 hurricane and entered jurisdiction of cphc jimena continued to weaken slowly amid cooling sea surface temperatures and increasing westerly wind shear eventually degrading below hurricane status on september 5 curving to northwest bursts of convection maintained jimena as a tropical storm in spite of westerly wind shear in excess of 25 mph 35 km h causing low level circulation center to be exposed eventually on september 9 jimena weakened to a tropical depression as it turned west southwestwards towards hawaiian islands succumbing to strong shear jimena degenerated into a remnant low just before 00 00 utc on september 10 roughly 230 mi 370 km north of hawaiian islands while passing north of hawaiian islands on september 11 remnants of jimena diverted winds to blow from southeast bringing humid air and atmospheric instability to east facing slopes of ko range on oahu this generated prolonged heavy rains that led to localized flash floods made worse by saturated soils from earlier rainfall events flood advisories were issued early on september 11 and were cancelled next morning flooding from waikane stream forced kamehameha highway to close for a few hours reopening only in evening a peak rainfall total on oahu of was recorded at tropical storm kevin a tropical wave crossed central america on august 25 although it initially only produced transient bursts of convection slow organization of feature led to formation of a tropical depression by 18 00 utc on august 31 while located well south of baja california steered northwest and north northwest cyclone intensified into tropical storm kevin by 18 00 utc next day while being plagued by moderate wind shear after reaching peak intensity with winds of 60 mph 95 km h and a pressure of 998 mbar hpa 29 47 inhg on september 3 a further increase in upper level winds caused low and mid level circulations to become displaced devoid of deep convection kevin degenerated to a remnant low by 12 00 utc on september 5 remnant circulation drifted northwest and dissipated following day hurricane linda early in september a cluster of clouds began to organize becoming tropical depression fifteen e at 18 00 utc on september 5 next day depression organized enough to be classified as a tropical storm and was given name linda nascent system rapidly strengthened as it moved on a northwestward course with large amounts of deep convection forming around center just 12 hours after becoming a tropical storm linda reached hurricane status and on september 7 system became a category 2 hurricane linda s strengthening stalled thereafter as wind shear increased slightly and dry air intruded on linda s inner core next day however linda again quickly intensified this time to a strong category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph 205 km h and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar hpa 28 05 inhg from september 9 onward linda rapidly weakened as it moved into an area of dry stable air and decreasing water temperatures becoming a remnant low less than a week after forming linda s remnants slowed as they turned to west northwest and then back to east before dissipating on september 14 copious amounts of water vapor pulled north from linda brought thunderstorms to portions of california beginning september 10 flooding and rock slides prompted numerous road closures one person drowned in san bernardino national forest remnant moisture from linda with a weak cold front also caused record heavy rainfall in los angeles on september 15 with three swift water rescues and roughly of rain across los angeles basin losses in state reached 2 1 million moisture from linda also catalyzed formation of scattered thunderstorms across utah on september 14 giving rise to two major flash flood incidents that became deadliest flood event in utah s history with 21 people killed first flash flood occurring near hildale swept away two vehicles carrying a total of 16 people while they were watching rising floodwaters killing 13 of them another death occurred when a man was swept away by floodwaters while traversing remote dirt roads second flash flood occurred in keyhole canyon at zion national park causing seven within area to perish damage totals in washington county utah reached 750 000 while downstream flooding caused a further 500 000 of damage in colorado city arizona thunderstorms also caused some scattered damage across arizona with losses reaching 206 000 according to san jose state university linda s remnants might have contributed to severity of valley fire tropical storm malia a trough formed near eastern reaches of central pacific on september 9 it moved swiftly westward and slowly organized into a tropical depression around 18 00 utc on september 18 as deep convection formed near its center nascent cyclone moved northeast after formation steered between a ridge to its northeast and a trough to its northwest strong upper level winds plagued system throughout its duration but depression nonetheless intensified into tropical storm malia around 00 00 utc on september 21 and attained peak intensity with winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a pressure of 992 mbar hpa 29 29 inhg twelve hours later malia turned northwest under increasing influence from upper trough which simultaneously increased wind shear over cyclone after lacking deep convection for several hours storm degenerated to a remnant low by 18 00 utc on september 22 post tropical cyclone moved north before being absorbed by an extratropical low over north central pacific next day tropical depression sixteen e a tropical wave gained enough organization to be declared tropical depression sixteen e on september 20 located in an environment of strong southerly shear depression failed to intensify into a tropical storm next day heavily sheared system made landfall on baja california then on isla tiburon and finally in sonora mexico it dissipated just hours later with its remnants going on to affect parts of arizona and new mexico widespread heavy rains in baja california and sonora caused heavy flooding preliminary damage estimates in el fuerte sinaloa reached 300 million pesos us 17 7 million remnant low brought considerable moisture to desert southwest and later combined with other systems to produce flooding across great plains and upper midwest in arizona severe thunderstorms occurred in graham and pima counties resulting in 7 000 in property damage rainfall near safford totaled up to while hail and winds gusting to were recorded at davis monthan air force base in addition an ef0 tornado briefly touched down in adjacent cochise county flash floods near quartzsite forced closure of arizona state route 95 and caused 5 000 in damage while flooding in scottsdale caused 25 000 in damage meanwhile in new mexico rainfall in roswell reached one person drowned along rio grande in new mexico in albuquerque thunderstorms downed trees and flooded several streets property damage in new mexico reached 85 000 tropical storm niala on september 20 a tropical disturbance was identified southeast of hawaii moving westward south of subtropical ridge disturbance slowly organized and became tropical depression six c on september 25 system was upgraded into tropical storm niala soon after as it headed west northwest towards hawaii prompting issuance of a tropical storm watch for big island despite moving over very warm waters a mid to upper level low pressure system well northeast of hawaiian islands inflicted moderate wind shear over niala causing it to struggle to intensify eventually at 18 00 utc on september 26 niala achieved peak intensity with winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a central pressure of 992 mbar hpa 29 29 inhg detrimental effects of wind shear soon began to show as niala slowed and turned westwards away from hawaii with low level circulation becoming exposed as thunderstorms were sheared to east on september 28 niala weakened to a tropical depression and became a post tropical low by september 29 shallow remnant cyclone turned to southwest under influence of low level trade winds dissipating by october 1 hurricane marty a tropical wave northern portion of which led to formation of atlantic s tropical depression nine emerged off western coast of africa on september 10 steered steadily westward wave entered east pacific where deep convection coalesced around a well defined center this led to formation of a tropical depression about 335 mi 535 km southwest of acapulco mexico by 18 00 utc on september 26 depression intensified into tropical storm marty six hours later as it drifted north amid an environment conducive for strengthening marty reached hurricane intensity at 12 00 utc on september 28 and attained peak intensity with winds of 80 mph 130 km h and a pressure of 987 mbar hpa 29 15 inhg shortly thereafter wind shear abruptly increased following peak intensity causing cyclone to weaken quickly it was downgraded to a tropical storm at 06 00 utc on september 29 and degenerated into a remnant low a day later low eventually dissipated south of mexico coastline on october 4 heavy rains and flooding from remnants of marty rendered 35 000 people homeless in sonora flooding in guaymas damaged 800 homes and 400 vehicles three people sustained injuries damage in city reached 500 million pesos us 30 million rains from marty also caused several landslides in guerrero as well as flooding that damaged 300 homes west of acapulco and injured two hurricane oho in an uncommon occurrence characteristic of el nino years a slow moving disturbance detached from a monsoon trough southeast of hawaii and became tropical depression seven c on october 3 system became tropical storm oho shortly after as it tracked to east northeast under southwesterly wind shear oho failed to intensify over next day or so while moving erratically eventually settling on a generally northeastward path on october 5 convection finally began to cover low level circulation center allowing oho to strengthen following further improvement of storm s structure as seen on infrared and microwave satellite imagery cphc declared oho a hurricane at 12 00 utc on october 6 accelerating northeastwards oho reached peak intensity as a strong category 2 hurricane on october 7 with winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a minimum pressure of 957 mbar hpa 28 26 inhg immediately after combination of southwesterly wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures caused oho to begin a weakening trend oho transitioned to an extratropical cyclone by 12 00 utc on october 8 as its winds dropped below hurricane force extratropical remnant of oho later regained hurricane force winds due to strong baroclinicity before moving over alaska in a weakened state on october 10 and dissipating a few hours later tropical depression eight c on september 30 a tropical disturbance developed from a monsoon trough well east of international date line at that time system was about 1 035 mi 1 665 km southwest of hawaii slowly organizing over next few days cphc started to issue advisories on system on october 3 and designated it as tropical depression eight c shortly after however increasing southerly wind shear prevented storm from intensifying to a tropical storm and caused its convection to collapse with low level circulation being displaced to south of quickly dissipating convection cphc issued its final advisory on next day eight c s remnants slowly drifted west northwestward crossing date line on october 6 and dissipating a few hours later japan meteorological agency however maintained remnant system as a tropical depression when it crossed date line tropical storm nora a tropical wave departed coast of africa on september 19 eventually crossing central america on october 3 it organized once in eastern pacific becoming a tropical depression around 12 00 utc on october 9 and intensifying into tropical storm nora 12 hours later moving along a west to west northwest track cyclone entered central pacific on october 11 where favorable environmental conditions allowed it to peak with winds of 70 mph 110 km h and a minimum pressure of 993 mbar hpa 29 32 inhg just shy of hurricane strength upper level winds soon became hostile causing system to weaken to a tropical depression early on october 14 degenerate to a remnant low late next day and ultimately dissipate just southeast of hawaii around 00 00 utc on october 16 remnants of nora brought heavy rains to windward slopes of hawaiian islands on october 16 17 rainfall totals of caused minor flooding on big island oahu and maui on big island excessive surface runoff briefly forced closure of a portion of highway 19 hurricane olaf a broad low pressure area formed well south of mexico late on october 9 at first it showed some signs of organization but convection associated with system soon diminished as it tracked steadily westwards eventually system reorganized and by october 15 it had gained enough organization to be designated as tropical depression nineteen e depression organized very slowly due to its elongated circulation and only became a tropical storm two days later upon which nhc named it olaf soon after olaf began to rapidly intensify amid very favorable environmental conditions and became a hurricane on october 18 with hints of an eye starting to appear within a small central dense overcast located at just 9 it broke record for lowest latitude hurricane formation in eastern pacific basin since reliable records began in 1971 olaf s intensification rate increased further overnight and next day olaf became a major hurricane with a well defined pinhole eye at 9 it broke record for lowest latitude major hurricane formation in eastern pacific basin as well six hours later olaf was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane eighth of season moving west northwestwards olaf reached peak intensity with 150 mph 240 km h winds and a pressure of 938 mbar hpa 27 70 inhg just as it crossed into central pacific basin after maintaining peak intensity for 12 hours olaf weakened to category 3 status as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and encountered some dry mid level air although eye reappeared on satellite as eyewall cycle completed another one began while northwesterly wind shear increased causing olaf to weaken below major hurricane status while being pulled to north by a passing trough however olaf s northward movement resulted in a respite in shear allowing olaf to reintensify to a secondary peak intensity of 120 mph 195 km h on october 23 next day decreasing sea surface temperatures and another increase in wind shear finally began to weaken storm for good despite maintaining a ragged eye until october 25 a further increase in wind shear from an approaching trough caused olaf to weaken to a tropical storm while accelerating it to east on october 26 olaf re entered eastern pacific becoming first storm on record to cross into central pacific and turn back into eastern pacific while still a tropical cyclone last of olaf s deep convection continued to be sheared away and system became post tropical on october 27 while still producing gale force winds olaf s shallow remnants gradually weakened and turned back to southwest before dissipating on october 28 hurricane patricia tropical depression twenty e formed from a broad low pressure area off southwestern coast of mexico on october 20 it only slowly intensified at first becoming tropical storm patricia later that day entering an atmosphere highly conducive to rapid deepening on october 21 patricia organized rapidly and became a hurricane late that day on october 22 explosive intensification occurred and in only 24 hours patricia became a category 5 hurricane with 175 mph 280 km h winds intensification rate rivaled those of hurricane linda in 1997 and hurricane wilma in 2005 patricia subsequently attained winds of 215 mph 345 km h and a central pressure of 872 mbar hpa 25 75 inhg becoming strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in western hemisphere surpassing both previous central pressure record set by hurricane wilma and previous 1 minute sustained wind record set by hurricane allen afterwards as it approached and later passed over western mexico patricia weakened even more rapidly than it intensified just 30 hours after peaking in intensity it was downgraded to a remnant low at 18 00 utc on october 24 however patricia s landfall near jalisco as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 150 mph 240 km h was still sufficient to qualify as strongest landfall by any pacific hurricane precursor disturbance to patricia brought heavy rain to central america and parts of mexico from october 18 20 approximately 223 000 people were affected by flooding and six were killed four in el salvador one in guatemala and one in nicaragua damage in chetumal mexico reached 1 4 billion pesos us 85 3 million as a tropical cyclone patricia caused severe impacts when it made landfall in jalisco mexico killing six and causing at least 5 4 billion pesos us 325 million in damage an additional fatality occurred during evacuations in jalisco in zapata and villages most badly affected by patricia violent winds tore off roofs toppled concrete power poles and transmission lines and defoliated trees hillsides were left barren and most small structures were severely damaged or completely destroyed mexico s agricultural sector also suffered with 42 000 ha 100 000 ac of crops affected by patricia of which 15 000 ha 37 000 ac were deemed a total loss papaya banana and plantain crops took most damage low death toll despite patricia s landfall intensity was credited to hurricane s small size low population density of landfall area as well as effective evacuations remnants of patricia s upper level circulation later produced rains in south texas causing flash floods that left 52 5 million in damage tropical storm rick a tropical wave moved off western coast of africa on november 3 entering east pacific roughly two weeks later disturbance encountered a persistent area of convection in intertropical convergence zone eventually coalescing into a tropical depression by 12 00 utc on november 18 while located 715 mi 1 150 km south southeast of southern tip of baja california plagued by moderate southeasterly wind shear depression slowly intensified into tropical storm rick and simultaneously attained peak intensity with winds of 40 mph 65 km h and a pressure of 1002 mbar hpa 29 59 inhg by 12 00 utc on november 19 cyclone failed to intensify further as it tracked west northwest within a dry environment weakening to a tropical depression by 06 00 utc on november 22 and further degenerating into a remnant low 12 hours later low tracked northwest and eventually southwest prior to dissipating early on november 26 hurricane sandra a tropical wave that emerged off west coast of africa on november 6 entered eastern pacific on november 21 system organized and was classified as a tropical depression on november 23 well south of mexico environmental conditions including high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear were highly conducive to intensification and storm quickly organized becoming tropical storm sandra early on november 25 a small central dense overcast developed atop storm and sandra reached hurricane status early on november 25 after consolidation of an eye hurricane achieved its peak as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 150 mph 240 km h and a pressure of 934 mbar hpa 27 58 inhg early on november 26 this made sandra strongest november hurricane on record in northeastern pacific surpassing hurricane kenneth in 2011 thereafter increasing shear degraded hurricane s structure and weakening ensued rapid weakening took place on november 27 and sandra s circulation became devoid of convection as it diminished to a tropical storm that evening cyclone degenerated into a remnant low soon thereafter and ultimately dissipated just off coast of sinaloa mexico on november 29 as precursor to sandra traversed central america it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides four people died in various incidents related to system three in el salvador and one in honduras initially expecting a landfalling storm officials in northwestern mexico prepared equipment for power outages closed schools and evacuated 180 residents sandra s effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this though overall impacts were limited tropical depression nine c despite official end of hurricane season about a month prior a westerly wind burst in equatorial waters of central pacific led to development of a tropical disturbance on december 27 moving slowly eastward disturbance stayed in an environment with anomalously high sea surface temperatures and ample ocean heat content associated with ongoing el nino event allowing thunderstorms in system to develop and persist turning northwards system formed a closed low level circulation and continued to slowly organize at 00 00 utc on december 31 tropical depression nine c formed at a very low latitude of 2 2degn moving slowly westwards nine c never reached tropical storm strength due to its proximity to equator and presence of 20 knot vertical wind shear over system leaving 2015 season one storm shy of record from 1992 as convection in and around depression was rapidly sheared to west depression was unable to support itself and was downgraded into a remnant low at 00 00 utc on january 1 2016 marking latest end to a pacific hurricane season on record remnant low dissipated later that day storm names following names were used to name storms that formed in eastern pacific ocean within national hurricane center s area of responsibility during 2015 this is same list used in 2009 season andres blanca carlos dolores enrique felicia guillermo jimena kevin linda marty nora olaf sandra for storms that form in central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility encompassing area between 140degw and international date line all names are used in a series of four rotating lists next nine names that were slated for use are shown below eight of these names were used throughout course of season this season has seen more named storms that formed in central pacific basin than any other season on record ela halola iune kilo loke malia niala oho operationally kilo was thought to have formed on august 20 and hence received a name before loke which formed on august 21 kilo s date of formation was shifted to august 22 after post storm analysis retirement on april 25 2016 at 38th session of ra iv hurricane committee world meteorological organization officially retired name patricia due to its extreme intensity and amount of damage and deaths that it caused and it will not be used again for another pacific hurricane patricia will be replaced with pamela for 2021 pacific hurricane season season effects this is a table of all storms that have formed in 2015 pacific hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s denoted in parentheses damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect
