epoch marine basalts and interbedded sediments in forearc of cascadia subduction zone this forms basement rock under western oregon and washington and southern tip of vancouver island it is now fragmented into siletz and crescent terranes portion of siletzia under oregon and southeastern washington leaving out olympic peninsula and vancouver island has also been called willamette plate and see fig 11 p 3772 siletzia corresponds geographically to coast range volcanic province or coast range basalts but is distinguished from slightly younger basalts that erupted after siletzia accreted to continent and differ in chemical composition siletzia basalts are tholeiitic a characteristic of mantle derived magma erupted from a spreading ridge between plates of oceanic crust younger basalts are alkalic or calc alkaline characteristic of magmas derived from a subduction zone this change of composition reflects a change from marine to continental volcanism that becomes evident around 48 to 42 ma millions of years ago and is attributed to accretion of siletzia against north american continent authors have differed as to which formations are siletzian for a recent categorization see various theories have been proposed to account for volume and diversity of siletzian magmatism as well as approximately 75deg of rotation but evidence is insufficient to determine siletzia s origin question remains open accretion of siletzia against north american continent approximately 50 million years ago contemporaneous with initiation of bend in hawaiian emperor seamount chain was a major tectonic event associated with a reorganization of earth s tectonic plates this is believed to have a caused a shift in subduction zone termination of laramide orogeny that was uplifting rocky mountains and major changes in tectonic and volcanic activity across much of western north america exposures and discovery rock of siletzia has been exposed in various places by tectonic uplift as around periphery of olympic mountains anticlinal folding such as black hills and willapa hills in southwestern washington and onto other formations along various faults in central and southern oregon these exposures have been variously named metchosin formation of vancouver island crescent formation black hills and willapa hills volcanics of washington and siletz river volcanics and roseburg formation of oregon see map grays river volcanics of washington and tillamook volcanics of oregon are now considered post siletz elsewhere siletzia is covered by younger volcanic and sedimentary deposits discovery of siletzia began in 1906 with arnold s description and naming of a small exposure on north side of olympic peninsula near port crescent though this exposure is small he recognized as very likely that much more of it was buried under younger deposits with recognition that similar rock exposed at other outcrops is part of same formation name crescent formation is now generally applied to all early and middle eocene basalts on olympic peninsula and puget lowland metchosin formation at southern tip of vancouver island was described in a series of reports 1910 1912 1913 1917 by clapp who recognized it as correlative with crescent formation on other side of strait of juan de fuca weaver recognized that these metchosin volcanics included various eocene basalts in western washington and oregon coast range as far south as klamath mountains siletz river volcanics was described in 1948 by snavely and baldwin after exposures near siletz river oregon originally named siletz river volcanic series by renamed by and roseburg and related formations in southern oregon described in various reports from 1960s on siletzia was coined in 1979 by irving to describe full extent of these eocene basalts and interbedded sedimentary formations extent map shows exposures black and inferred near surface extent pink of siletzia latter being what can be detected in upper crust by aeromagnetic gravitational or seismological studies there are only two exposed contacts of siletzia with older pre cenozoic north american basement one is near roseburg oregon where it is thrust against formations of klamath mountains discussed below other is along leech river fault on southern end of vancouver island where it has pushed pre cenozoic pacific rim formation beneath terrane everywhere else contact between siletzia and rest of continent is concealed under younger deposits especially cascade range volcanics contact around olympic mountains is actually bottom contact with underlying oceanic sediments tilted up by uplift of olympics and exposed by erosion of about 10 to 12 km of overlying deposits location of near surface contact between crescent formation and pre cenozoic metamorphic basement of continent what has been termed coast range boundary fault crbf is largely uncertain leech river fault extends southeast past victoria b c to cross strait of juan de fuca possibly connecting with southeast striking southern whidbey island fault leech river fault crbf has also been aligned with possible faults in discovery bay and puget sound see puget sound faults but evidence is rather against these possibilities e g see and this extends to rattlesnake mountain fault zone some 25 kilometers east of seattle which is believed to be western edge of pre cenozoic basement however gravity data indicates that at this latitude crescent formation at least near surface extends no further east than seattle further south near mount st helens is a similar situation where st helens fault zone is believed to be eastern edge of crescent formation but pre cenozoic continental basement is near mount rainier separating these is marine sedimentary formation known as southern washington cascades conductor swcc it is possible that it was deposited over a fragment of siletzia or not oldest parts of swcc likely predate siletzia and nature and location of contact between these two formations is unknown in central oregon siletzia forms a platform on which older now defunct volcanoes of western cascades rest younger high cascades to east are believed to rest on sediments that accumulated in basin between siletzia and continent in southern oregon siletzia has been thrust against mesozoic klamath mountains of southern oregon along klamath blue mountain lineament kbml near roseburg this contact is exposed at wild safari fault where late jurassic dothan formation has been thrust over roseburg formation and figure 2 p 31 off coast of southern oregon western edge of siletzia is eocene fulmar fault and fig 64 this is a strike slip fault where part of siletzia has been split off missing piece may be yakutat terrane now at head of gulf of alaska further north terrane boundary is believed to come ashore near columbia river used seismic data to build a three dimensional image of siletzia beneath washington including inferred western boundary way crescent formation wraps around olympic mountains oly on map may reflect oroclinal bending as a result of being crushed against vancouver island it has also been attributed to loss of deposits originally overlying olympics prior to their uplift resembling a dome where top and western end has been removed siletzia s actual thickness and estimates of that thickness vary under oregon siletz terrane appears to extend 25 to possibly 35 km into trough between subducting juan de fuca plate and edge of continent where it is slipping over sediments accumulated in bottom of trough say 27 5 km crescent terrane under washington is believed to be thinner from as little as 12 and 22 km under western and eastern ends of strait of juan de fuca but possibly as much as 20 and 35 km thick composition various formations of siletzia are characterized as marine tholeiitic pillow basalts and volcanic breccia often interbedded with sedimentary layers of continental origin lying on oceanic crust these are usually capped by a layer of alkalic volcanics deposited and following sources all this suggests these formations were initially deposited in an oceanic environment possibly as seamounts or an island arc a more detailed description of siletz river volcanics can be found in and of crescent formation in on olympic peninsula blue mountain unit at base of crescent formation includes sediments including large boulders of quartz diorite of continental origin suggesting that continent was close by other sediments were eroded from pre cenozoic rock of vancouver island and northern cascade range at southern end are sediments derived from klamath mountains while sand of overlying tyee formation has an isotopic composition corresponding to rock of idaho batholith age eruption of siletzia basalts has been placed roughly in late paleocene through mid eocene more specific dates have been difficult to obtain and somewhat variable early k ar potassium argon and 40ar 39ar argon argon radiometric dating by duncan gave dates of 57 and 62 ma million years ago to northern and southern ends and a date of 49 ma for grays river volcanics near center of siletzia this is suggestive of a spreading ridge as previously noted by and has been a strong constraint on models of how siletzia formed other researchers have since found younger dates 50 48 ma for crescent basalts removing much of age symmetry variations in geochemical alteration may also have skewed results dating from 2010 based on 40ar 39ar u pb uranium lead and shows a narrower range of ages from 56 ma in south to 50 or 49 ma in north abstract abstract subsequent high precision u pb dates from northern siletzia show a narrowly constrained age of 51 ma for metchosin complex on vancouver island of particular interest is somewhat broader range of approximately 53 to 48 ma for crescent formation basalts on east side of olympic peninsula that overlie blue mountain unit reliably dated at 48 ma or younger calculated a maximal depositional age of about 48 7 ma while report four ages ranging from 44 7 ma to 47 8 ma this structural relationship was previously understood as showing that siletzia or at least its northern end was built on continental margin it is now argued that unconformity of ages can be explained by blue mountain unit being thrust under siletzia some time after 44 5 ma and shows that was not necessarily emplaced along continental margin size siletzia is massive over 400 miles 600 kilometers long almost half that much across and likely further at depth original deposits were from 16 to 35 kilometers thick weaver reckoning a minimal thickness of only 3 000 feet still estimated nearly 10 000 cubic miles of rock he put total volume to be as great if not greater than better known columbia river basalts quoted in snavely et al recognizing at least 10 000 feet of thickness and as much as 20 000 feet under eruptive centers estimated volume to be in excess of 50 000 cubic miles over 200 000 km3 estimated around 250 000 km3 about 60 000 cubic miles which exceeds volume of most continental rift zones and some flood basalt provinces a recent estimate put volume at 2 million cubic km abstract paleorotation thumb upright 1 34 oregon rotation rotation of siletzia green about a northern pivot point klamath mountains blue rotated with siletzia having been formerly adjacent to blue mountains also blue and also since rotated near idaho batholith right edge red dashed line is olympic wallowa lineament original image courtesy of william r dickinson when lava solidifies and cools it retains an imprint of earth s magnetic field thus recording how it was oriented measurements of such paleomagnetic fields in oregon coast range show rotations of 46 to 75deg all of it following presumed accretion to continent alternately formation of siletz terrane at about 50 ma these rotations are all clockwise and show a strong correlation with age of rock about one and a half degrees of rotation per million years these paleomagnetic rotations and other evidence show that siletzia or part of it constituting siletz terrane sz on map above from klamath mountains to columbia river has rotated clockwise as a single coherent block other possible rotation mechanisms are discussed by see also did siletzia pivot about its northern end or southern end this question has attracted considerable attention with evidence long suggesting a northern pivot second model of as elaborated by several objections to a northern pivot were made by who favored an initial phase of rotation with a southern pivot p 2960 some apparent palinspastic conflicts involving clarno formation of north central oregon appear to have been resolved by a major problem for a southern pivot is that it implies rotation during accretion while most studies indicate that most or all of rotation occurred after presumed accretion a key piece of evidence is that crescent formation is laid over sediments blue mountain unit derived from continent including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old this was previously interpreted as requiring crescent formation to have formed close to continent see also and however new high precision u pb dating shows that overlying basalts are older and therefore blue mountain unit was not overlaid by basalts but thrust under them at a later date such under thrusting implies that northern end of siletzia was initially further away from continent and permits radial motion about a more southerly or more easterly pivot near washington oregon border as recently suggested this model has siletzia forming on continental margin along what is now olympic wallowa lineament owl a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance with southern end of siletzia and klamath mountains joined to siletzia near idaho batholith in central idaho further evidence for this comes from sand of tyee formation that overlie roseburg formation not only does this sand have same isotopic composition of rock in idaho batholith and of sand now coursing down snake and columbia rivers but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source this implies that tyee formation was much closer to idaho batholith when it was deposited and subsequently rotated away geodetic surveys show that region continues to rotate likely as a result of extension of basin and range province and asthenospheric flow around southern edge of subducting juan de fuca plate north of columbia river matters are more complicated first in southwestern washington there is only half as much rotation as seen in rocks of similar age in oregon this is basis for believing crescent terrane has broken from siletz terrane perhaps because they formed on different oceanic plates and undergone a different rotational history second in washington there is more variation in amount of rotation and more faulting which has led to a speculation that crescent terrane has broken up into eight or nine crustal blocks at bremerton on east side of olympics measured rotations are less and within statistical error bounds of being zero while further north near port townsend rotation is slightly counter clockwise on vancouver island are counter clockwise and other evidence shows that tip of island has been bent presumably as a result of collision of siletzia northwestern tip of olympic peninsula also shows counter clockwise rotation of around 45 degrees this raises a question of how much of arcuate shape of crescent formation is due to loss of material from center after uplift by olympic mountains and how much reflects oroclinal bending origin siletzia s origin is not yet determined and as of 2017 remains controversial has previously said it lacks a definite answer theories are still being developed and even details theories depend on have remained enigmatic following are several of most notable models models of how siletzia formed are of two general types call these seamount interpretation and marginal basin interpretation count only three general models restricting first to hotspot volcanism on a spreading ridge and counting slab windows as a third model provide an updated summary 1 formation well offshore possibly as seamounts like hawaiian emperor seamount chain or a hotspot at a spreading ridge like iceland and then accretion to continent 2 formation inshore on or near continental margin perhaps as a result of extension or of a slab window all current models then have siletzia rifting away from continental edge about a northern pivot some early models had siletzia rotating into continent about a southern pivot accretion therefore being culmination of rotation southern pivot seems to be largely abandoned in part because various studies e g show most of rotation was post accretion these classes of models have been classified as either accreted or rifted but this is inaccurate as inshore formation can still involve accretion and all offshore accretion models using a northern pivot imply rifting studies of siletzia s origins have generally focused on accounting for two principal observations large paleorotation described above and voluminous output over 50 000 cubic miles exceeding volume of most continental rift zones and some flood basalt provinces accounting for observed volumes of basalt requires an enhanced magmatic source for which most models invoke either presence of yellowstone hotspot or slab windows latter would have resulted from subduction of farallon kula or possibly farallon resurrection spreading ridge relation with kula farallon spreading ridge is an important element in all models though its location through that epoch is not well determined show uncertainty in position of k f ridge at 65 ma as anywhere from mexico to queen charlotte islands see also figure 1 in showing k f ridge alternately near washington or near anchorage simpson cox 1977 two models seeking to explain observed clockwise paleorotation and noting that siletzia appeared to have rotated as a rigid block proposed two models first was rotation about a southern pivot in contact with klamath mountains this has various problems especially because at northern end sediments and even boulders from continent are found at base of crescent formation showing that it was near continent from beginning in second model subsequently refined by siletzia was originally adjacent to olympic wallowa lineament then rifted from continent and rotated about a northern pivot near olympic peninsula because sediments also show klamaths in close contact from start this requires klamaths to have moved with siletzia originally there were conflicts in understanding of when klamaths moved and with age and amount of rotation of clarno formation in central oregon these were largely cleared up in a study of clarno formation by and illustrated with a palinspastic reconstruction as of 38 ma offshore model a captured island chain an early and widely cited paper by drawing on features of fairly new theory of plate tectonics exemplifies off shore or seamount type of models it featured a set of radiometrically determined k ar and 40ar 39ar ages that were younger in center for grays river volcanics and older at ends this symmetric age progression strongly suggested pattern seen at spreading ridges where older rock is carried away on both sides from where new rock erupts duncan considered five models but none involving rifting or ridge subduction favoring one where a hotspot presumably yellowstone hotspot intersected farallon kula spreading ridge such as at iceland to generate a chain of islands these islands were then accreted to continent as underlying oceanic crust was subducted this study has been criticized on multiple grounds particularly regarding ages duncan himself noted that measurement of northern ages may have been affected by loss of argon due to low grade metamorphism and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed on basis of geochemistry that grays river volcanics followed siletzia eruptions and substantially younger at 42 to 37 ma and thus are not representative of initial phase of siletz magmatism recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression range of original ages was also a problem as rate of kula farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts much longer than observed and too far away from continent to explain continentally derived sediments this objection is attenuated somewhat in that newer ages show a smaller range of ages see also inshore models various models have siletzia forming inshore on or near continental margin while all current models have siletzia rifting away from continent after accretion or formation a subclass of rifted models consider rifting to have caused siletzia eruptions proposed that siletzia basalts might have leaked through transform faults perpendicular to a spreading ridge during changes in direction of tectonic plates size of these eruptions and their location in this region is attributed to proximity to yellowstone hotspot this leaky transform theory seems to be largely rejected likely because plate motion model it was based on was shown to be faulty wells et al alternately suggested that as a terrane at margin of continent was pushed over yellowstone hotspot it was rifted away from continent by upwelling magma which then formed siletzia basalts this idea was further developed by who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction or by kinematic effects as kula farallon ridge migrated along continental margin one such effect is formation of a slab window or slab gap which would allow increased upwelling of magma slab windows that spreading ridges could be subducted was recognized early in development of plate tectonic theory but there was little consideration of ensuing effects in 1980s came realization that magma welling up from asthenosphere through subducted ridge would not reach seawater and thus not be quenched to form rock and close gap continued spreading would lead to a widening gap or window in subducting plate through which there could be increased flow of magma implications of this for siletzia were first shown by and following pioneering work by subsequently identified fan shaped wake of volcanics of distinctive geochemistry left by widening kula farallon slab window across northeastern washington and into idaho showed that most of eocene and subsequent magmatism from alaska to oregon is explainable in terms of ridge subduction and slab window tectonics their model has northern part of resurrection plate separating at about 47 ma to form plate that is a slab window and a single subducted ridge can give rise to multiple slab windows can provide adequate magmatism without having to invoke a hotspot mantle plume so much so that it has been suggested that yellowstone hotspot may have been initiated by a slab window see also mantle plumes and slab windows both feature voluminous magmatism main difference is that slab windows would form only where spreading ridge is subducted this implies formation at continental margin and then rifting in manner of second class of models gulf of alaska any model of origin of siletzia must account for interactions with plate boundaries that were being subducted under north america through eocene early studies were plagued by indeterminate locations for these boundaries particularly of kula farallon k f spreading ridge basalts at head of gulf of alaska along alaska panhandle have ages and compositions corresponding to siletz volcanics suggesting that k f ridge was offshore of yukon at same time it was offshore of washington this can be resolved by assuming that by about 56 ma eastern part of kula plate had broken away to form resurrection plate with new kula resurrection k r spreading ridge running up gulf of alaska towards kodiak island and former k f now r f ridge reaching washington see figure 1 in subduction of this plate under western canada was rapid and it disappeared entirely with subduction of k r ridge about 50 ma this scenario then permits rapid transport north of crustal blocks such as yakutat terrane now lying southeast of cordova at head of gulf of alaska paleomagnetic evidence indicates it was formed at a latitude corresponding to oregon or northern california see also similarly certain schists on island are believed to have been contiguous with leech river schists leech river complex on vancouver island around 50 ma and subsequently transported northward with other elements of chugach prince william terrane and figure 4 after accretion 50 42 ma whether formed far offshore as seamounts or close inshore by a slab window siletzian basalts were laid down on a subducting oceanic plate siletz terrane on farallon plate and crescent terrane most likely on adjoining resurrection plate previously broken away from kula plate which had previously broken away from farallon plate in both cases siletzia mass was drawn toward subduction zone which possibly ran diagonally across what is now washington approximately at position of olympic wallowa lineament figure 5 see also this would be challis subduction zone but there is some question about it see however siletzia was too big to be subducted and it accreted to continent accretion is sometimes called docking but is more akin to a collision various peripheral structures are first folded or crushed then main structures are deformed when they come into contact and various parts get pushed over other parts all this playing out over several million years to extent that accretion of siletzia to north america can be given a definite date most studies give it as about 50 ma some early studies e g dated accretion as late as 42 ma a recent study suggests it may have been as early as 55 ma this date has added significance as it is also start of a change in direction of pacific plate as seen in bend in hawaiian emperor seamount chain and also a change in pacific northwest from compressional to extensional tectonics this may also be when last of resurrection plate was subducted under british columbia initiation of north striking right lateral straight creek fault at 48 ma likely resulted from strain accumulated during accretion of siletzia as siletzia accreted it also jammed existing subduction zone halting subduction of farallon plate this terminated laramide orogeny that had been uplifting rocky mountains and triggered ignimbrite sweep a wave of large volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western north america between 20 and 50 ma this undoubtedly affected enigmatic and controversial challis arc stretching from southeastern british columbia to idaho batholith roughly parallel with olympic wallowa lineament but details of this are unknown subduction having ceased at existing zone eventually further to west as current cascadia subduction zone how this happened does not seem to be detailed anywhere but figure 5 of suggests that new subduction zone may have simply unzipped from old zone starting from south volcanism from new subduction zone such as grays river volcanics and northcraft volcanics reached surface about 42 ma thereby initiating rise of ancestral cascade range several other significant events occurred around 42 ma including cessation of metamorphism of leech river schists resulting from metchosin crescent formation being thrust under vancouver island and end of strike slip motion on straight creek fault these may reflect last movement of siletzia relative to north america on a broader scale there was a change in absolute direction of pacific plate marked by end of bend in hawaiian emperor seamount chain and a change in convergence of kula plate with north american plate as subduction waned so did force that had clamped siletzia against continent and tectonic regime shifted from compressional to extensional deposition of sand from then proximal idaho batholith into tyee formation in southern oregon may have continued as late as 46 5 ma but was interrupted when siletzia rifted from continent and began rotating away as explained earlier it appears rotation was about a northern pole what initiated rifting is unknown suggested that as continent overrode yellowstone hotspot upwelling plume tore away a previously accreted terrane suggested a change in rate at which plates were converging or kinematic effects such as a slab window from passage of kula farallon ridge or resurrection farallon ridge see
