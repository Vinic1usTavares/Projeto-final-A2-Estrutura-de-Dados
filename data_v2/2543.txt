players to perform players are also able to chat with each other during a game development theme hospital took over two years to develop idea came from peter molyneux and journalist james leach who explored possibility of other theme games while discussing theme park leach suggested a hospital and molyneux was enthusiastic about idea development began when designer mark webley selected theme hospital from a list of possible games put together by molyneux and webley along with artist gary carr visited royal surrey county hospital great ormond street hospital and frimley park hospital for research and inspiration carr was initially displeased at prospect of working on theme hospital he had previously left bullfrog to work for bitmap brothers because he did not have faith in theme park he chose to return based on his belief that he would work on dungeon keeper which he was eager to do initially theme hospital was to feature real diseases but these were replaced with fictional comedic afflictions as it was decided that game s maladies should not be too realistic team were faced with dilemma of having to make hospital fun and interesting as webley stated that theme parks are colourful compared to hospitals and carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that it was hard to tell what each machine does it was during a hospital visit after witnessing an operation that they were ordered out of because they were distracting surgeon that they came up with idea of using made up illnesses and cures carr considered death quite sad and believed that illness was not a popular subject he stated that using made up illnesses gave them creative freedom which he believed was essential webley said that carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful according to carr team were aiming for humour rather than gore during initial stages of programming bullfrog hired james leach who wrote game s text and came up with diseases molyneux was not directly involved in game s production as he was then working on dungeon keeper graphic design was decided to be modelled from those of cartoons and a goal was to have two thousand character animations another artist was hired to complete graphics on time and team ultimately ended up with four manual p 39 fellow artist andy bass had difficulty getting kit kat graphics correct he said they did not have right colour so carr tweaked palette bass modelled vending machine that would use kit kat graphics and used 3d studio to render it into game palette which he then edited using deluxe paint by spring 1996 around half of illnesses and animations were complete introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete and programming of management system was almost finished by early 1997 all that was left was refining difficulty levels game deviates from nhs model webley and carr decided that players should think of hospital as a business with profit highly important team who worked in offices near royal surrey county hospital drew some inspirations from theme park and borrowed a great deal of code webley explained that this was an obvious starting point as he had been a programmer on theme park and that systems had been rewritten by time theme hospital was complete a program which facilitated animation was built upon by webley who dubbed it complex engine there were not many meetings and webley took team to pub weekly with a list of tasks to perform webley explained that way team worked meant that only they could perform their assigned duties otherwise they would not get done effectively giving members ownership of their parts of game it was during one such meeting that team realised game was complete disease called king complex was to be called elvis impersonator but elvis s estate owned rights bloaty head was based on an allergic reaction molyneux had when his face became an alarming size according to leach volume of work was small a big problem was that team had too many ideas and insufficient time to implement them all for example other diseases were planned one of these was animal magnetism which would see patients with attached animals which would have to be cut away another idea that was not implemented was possibility of four separate in game eras futuristic mediaeval victorian and modern game was originally to have players begin in mediaeval zone and progress to more modern ones by may 1996 idea of other time periods had been deemed prohibitive due to amount of graphics required carr later stated that game did not need other eras and that team was small enough to make things up as they went along carr was also afraid that if they had produced a design document electronic arts would have considered omission of other eras feature cutting an idea that molyneux pushed webley s team to implement was a screen that enabled players to mix coloured chemicals to apply them to diseases accessibility was also a concern for team with so many options it was felt that players could treat game like work tester jon rennie simplified game from original design webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial theme hospital was released on 28 march 1997 although it was previously due for release in november 1996 and is part of bullfrog s designer series game attracted some controversy from nhs managers houses of parliament and daily telegraph who published an article criticising game as sick and said that british medical association was using it to train management staff nhs argued that game mocked hospital management webley was invited to appear on a local radio station he did not consider game to make light of real world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones theme hospital was a commercial success which surprised bullfrog and electronic arts it repeatedly appeared in top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies in 2014 molyneux stated that he wanted game to make a comeback and described theme hospital as a great game that i and many people remember original releases cover art used a green cross on a white background which bullfrog did not have right to use artwork was mistakenly approved because it was faxed in black and white and had to be recalled later releases changed cross to a star despite its rejection cross version is available in more recent formats sound music and sound effects were produced by russell shaw and adrian moore moore used sound forge to develop sound effects some such as snooker balls were taken directly from its library and others including treatment machines were created by mixing sounds together some machine sounds were created by mixing sounds of electric egg mixer with that of a hydraulic lifter farting sounds were recorded when moore was working with bands including t pau prefab sprout and seal at a recording studio he did so as a joke but they were useful for theme hospital ports and re releases a playstation port of theme hospital was developed by krisalis software and released by electronic arts in 1998 playstation version was released as a download on
