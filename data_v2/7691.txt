to do farmer on halloween her father to amuse her picks a pumpkin that she selects and fashions a jack o lantern out of it her new toy pleases child immensely and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie so it is natural that she should be thinking about two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep perhaps that was why queen of fairies came to

perfectly glorious time but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life but it consoled her somewhat to have them for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening and perhaps fairies will ask her to attend another party later if they do she has decided that pumpkin and dollie must have their shares of good

columbia canada by province theatre moving picture world gave it minor praise and short summary of film but it does not evaluate or describe special camera effects used to produce film reviewer states to see doll and pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes little girl to whom they belong surprise good times they have with fairy s help will long remain in her memory even though it is only a dream new york dramatic mirror was critical of production stating this sounds as if it ought to be very clever but aside from work of little heroine and dance of fairies it is entirely uninspired it needs a drastic application of imagination broad idea is excellent but details of management indicate impoverished resources when aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment but this film doesn t get away from stolid realities for example nobody could imagine anything more earthly than outside of house from which little girl escaped with fairy queen and her comrades that should have been treated fancifully events pictured don t amount to anything there is a sameness about them nothing surprising happens and not very much that is pretty worst of all is poetry which is interpolated to explain narrative that is beyond criticism thanhouser company has missed good opportunities in this film strange inclusion of question mark after poetry is not a note by bowers for it was actually written into review itself in edition though no other review mentions poetry see also list of american films of 1910 references category 1910 films
