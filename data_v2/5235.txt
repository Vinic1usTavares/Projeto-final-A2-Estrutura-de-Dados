girls join together and sing all i want is something new something i can hold on to i don t wanna talk i just wanna dance baby let it drop catch me if you can it ends with group shouting boy you better watch your back cause we re leaders of pack a reviewer for heat notice similarities to david guetta productions and compared it to songs by nicki minaj and lady gaga michael cragg of guardian compared verse s structure to one of sexy no no no 2007 and thought that something new echoed group s previous single something kinda ooooh 2006 not only because of title but it also has same slightly demented feel to it all distorted backing vocals strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit most critics also had a similar perception to cragg regarding song s odd structure which is noted as typical and group s signature style reception critical response according to a metro publication something new had a generally positive reaction from fans susana novo vasquez of huffington post stated that indisputable team of xenomania girls aloud have been ones to set trends over years for others to follow adding that song continues down that path vasquez continued saying that group returned into a moment where pop scene isn t same as when they left but thought that they were doing it in a very intelligent way by adopting some of calvin harris electronic massive sound that is current right now yet creating an intricate song structure robert copsey of digital spy said that like most girls aloud singles a few listens are required to get our heads around it copsey criticized distorted vocals and fact that there probably won t be a full album of new tracks to accompany it but admitted that it sounds modern enough for today s charts without compromising their signature sound and praised its massive chorus douglas wolk of pitchfork media thought that track is a game approximation of girls aloud of seven years ago while bbc music reviewer ian wade concluded that as its title suggests something new is just that a fanfare like call to arms announcing group s return phill of state said that with song girls aloud have managed to maintain quality they had prior to release of ten and commented that other three new songs are nowhere near up to same standard idolator blogger sam lansky commented that for fans something new is a welcome relief to have an injection of fresh energy into stagnant girl group scene and concluded that given that this may be group s final single before disbanding for good they re certainly going out on a high note with a track that feels quintessentially aloud but retooled for 2012 rebecca twomey of marie claire said that group is on key with current trend for dance music with their new song while noting that they have clearly taken inspiration from cheryl s call my name katy brand of daily telegraph was critical towards song brand said that lyrics are usual post spice fare but commented that images weren t quite matching words i was hearing battle cry of enraged queens who will be oppressed no longer i was watching five young women wearing identical orange mini dresses strutting up and down in perfect synchronicity like catwalk models in 2013 it was nominated for popjustice ps20 music prize chart performance something new debuted and peaked at number two on uk singles chart with
