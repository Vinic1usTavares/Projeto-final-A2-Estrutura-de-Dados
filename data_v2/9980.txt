kepler 9 is a sunlike star in constellation lyra its planetary system discovered by kepler mission in 2010 was first detected with transit method found to contain multiple planets nomenclature and history kepler 9 was named for kepler mission a project headed by nasa that was designed to search for earth like planets unlike stars such as aldebaran or sirius kepler 9 does not have a colloquial name in june 2010 some 43 days after kepler came online its operating scientists submitted a list of over 700 exoplanet candidates for review of those five were originally suspected to have more than one planet kepler 9 was one of multiplanetary systems it was identified as such when scientists noticed significant variations in time intervals at which kepler 9 was transited kepler 9 holds first multiplanetary system discovered using transit method it is also first planetary system where transiting planets were confirmed through transit timing variations method allowing to calculate masses of planets discovery of planets was announced on august 26 2010 characteristics kepler 9 is located in constellation lyra that lies some 620 parsecs away from earth with a mass of and a radius of kepler 9 is almost exactly same size and width of sun being only 7 more massive and 2 wider kepler 9 has an effective temperature of 5777 61 k as compared to sun s at 5778 k and is approximately 32 more metal rich in terms of iron than sun kepler 9 is younger than sun and is estimated to be one billion years old planetary system thumb 250px light curves of transiting planets of kepler 9 there are three confirmed planets all in direct orbit outer two planets kepler 9b inner one and kepler 9c outer one are low density gas giants that are respectively 25 and 17 mass of jupiter and around 80 radius of jupiter both planets have a density less than that of water similar to saturn innermost planet kepler 9d is a super earth with a radius that is 1 64 times that of earth http www kepler nasa gov mission discoveries orbiting star every 1 6 days it is estimated that there is a 0 59 chance that discoveries are false from kepler 9d closest to star to kepler 9b second from star ratio of their orbits is 1 12 however ratio of orbits of two outer planets is 1 2 a relationship known as a mean motion resonance kepler 9b and kepler 9c are first transiting planets detected in such an orbital configuration resonance causes orbital speeds of each planet to change and thus causes transit times of two planets to oscillate period of kepler 9b is increasing by 4 minutes per orbit while that of kepler 9c is decreasing by 39 minutes per orbit these orbital changes allowed masses of planets a parameter not normally obtainable via transit method to be estimated using a dynamical model mass estimates were further refined using radial velocity measurements obtained with hires instrument of keck 1 telescope kepler 9b and 9c are thought to have formed beyond frost line they are then thought to have migrated inward due to interactions with remains of protoplanetary disk they would have been captured into orbital resonance during this migration see also list of extrasolar planets kepler mission references external links keith cooper 26 august 2010 kepler finds first double planet transiting system astronomy now accessed 7 september 2010 category planetary systems with three confirmed planets category lyra constellation 9 category planetary transit variables category g type main sequence stars
