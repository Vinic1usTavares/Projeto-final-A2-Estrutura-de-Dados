remix of hello good morning new remix replaces t i s vocals with a new verse from eminem d l chandler from mtv said slim shady s humorous verses sound right at home over producer danja s club ready banger critical reception in a review by usa today hello good morning was picked out as one of best three songs on last train to paris nick levine of digital spy gave song three out of five stars in his review for song stating that although dirty money promised a new sound song sounded like timba pop albeit one with a better than average hook he continued in diddy s final minute rap it s a reminder of how he jump started his journey towards a reported 300m fortune and a butler called fonzworth bentley matt from above beyond said it was danja produced beat and t i feature that make song good fraser mcalpine of bbc music said diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some kanye style he s quite good at it too adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings there s a middle bit and it s like nothing else in song it sounds more like someone doing i ve lost my keys song just before they leave house in morning odd thing is that it was left in there i mean if minimal is your bag surely that d be first bit to cut he awarded in four out of five stars becky bain of idolator was also positive about song saying lyrically and stylistically it s a pretty standard club track over various synth beats song covers usual topics hot girls dancing crowds waiting to have fun and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week but honestly we re just overjoyed this song isn t just a thinly veiled four minute commercial for any one of diddy s various products however nicki escudero of phoenix new times said that although song was good for what it is it lacked substance now that diddy dirty money has had success with a superficial track about money sex and cheating here s hoping group will release a deeper song about something more meaningful unfortunately hope can only go so far meanwhile michael cragg from guardians music blog commented that uk remix featuring skepta salvages what would otherwise be a boring diddy track thankfully uk grime king skepta has rescued song by pushing diddy to periphery his flow consists of going uh skepta and spelling out d i d d y setting off a smorgasbord of sonic explosions tightening whole thing up and making it sound a lot darker and more thrilling than a host of us producers could manage skepta also drops following immortal line in first verse i like tea but i don t like crumpets a man after my own heart chart performance two weeks after diddy dirty money s appearance on american idol hello good morning debuted on u s hot digital songs chart at no 17 and single
