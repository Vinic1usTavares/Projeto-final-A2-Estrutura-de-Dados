south park s attempt to replace kenny mccormick before ultimately reintroducing character into series in conclusion of her review vanderwerff praised quagmire s monologue commenting it s certainly amusing that show is spending all of this time tearing down one character who s a mouthpiece for creator ahsan haque of ign criticized episode for its execution stating auditioning friends to replace cleveland seemed like a better idea on paper haque praised quagmire s tirade against brian however as completely unexpected and mildly amusing but ultimately gave episode a 6 4 out of 10 in a subsequent review of family guy s eighth season ramsey isler of ign listed jerome is new black as remarkably unfunny with lazy and unoriginal writing references external links category 2009 american
