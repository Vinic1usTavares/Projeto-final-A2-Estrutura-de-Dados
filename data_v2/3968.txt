1912 atlantic hurricane season featured first recorded major hurricane category 3 or higher on modern day saffir simpson scale in month of november there were eleven tropical cyclones seven of which became tropical storms four of those strengthened into hurricanes and one reached major hurricane intensity season s first cyclone developed on april 4 while final dissipated on november 21 season s most intense and most devastating tropical cyclone was final storm known as jamaica hurricane it produced heavy rainfall on jamaica leading to at least 100 fatalities and about 1 5 million 1912 usd in damage storm was also blamed for five deaths in cuba other tropical cyclones that left notable impact include fourth and sixth hurricanes former brought rough seas and storm surge to portions of gulf coast of united states leaving locally severe damage particularly in mobile alabama and pensacola florida totaling about 39 000 one fatality occurred after a barge capsized sixth hurricane brought rough seas and heavy precipitation to northeastern mexico and south texas with flooding reported inland storm left 15 deaths and about 28 000 in damage overall tropical cyclones of this season collectively caused at least 122 fatalities and just under 1 6 million in damage season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 57 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces systems tropical storm one on june 7 ships in gulf of mexico reported a low pressure area with a closed circulation about southeast of port eads louisiana initially storm moved slowly southeastward before turning west southwestward late on june 8 strengthening slightly cyclone turned to northwest by june 11 around 12 00 utc on following day a ship observed a barometric pressure of lowest known in relation to storm based on this maximum sustained winds were estimated at 70 mph 110 km h early on june 13 storm curved northeastward and made landfall near franklin louisiana around 05 00 utc system slowly weakened and emerged into atlantic ocean from outer banks of north carolina while still at tropical storm intensity by 12 00 utc on june 16 cyclone weakened to a tropical depression about 24 hours later depression dissipated about north of bermuda in louisiana heavy rainfall resulted in some flooding in inland areas precipitation in georgia and south carolina caused rivers to approach or reach flood stage necessitating a flood stage warning at cheraw south carolina along pee dee river there pee dee river crested at about above flood stage some locations in eastern north carolina reported strong winds particularly at fayetteville where there was a severe local storm tropical storm two a ship initially encountered this storm about north northeast of san salvador island in bahamas on july 12 storm initially moved northwestward and strengthened slowly early on july 14 cyclone turned west northwestward later that day a ship recorded a barometric pressure of which was lowest pressure in relation to cyclone around 12 00 utc on july 15 system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h based on an observation from savannah georgia about three hours later storm made landfall near darien georgia cyclone slowly weakened inland and fell to tropical depression status by 12 00 utc on july 16 about twenty four hours it dissipated over mississippi prior to storm s landfall northeast storm warnings were issued from jacksonville florida to charleston south carolina at tybee island in georgia strong winds and abnormally high tides were reported in savannah a wind speed of was reported storm resulted in minimal damage tropical storm three a tropical depression formed about east southeast of ocean city maryland early on september 2 depression drifted southward and reached tropical storm intensity later that day based on observations from ships on september 3 cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of storm then began moving southwestward at a faster pace late on september 5 cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and curved west southwestward shortly after 06 00 utc on september 6 system made landfall near midway georgia with winds of 35 mph 55 km h about 12 hours later depression dissipated over southwest georgia strongest wind speed associated with storm was in charleston south carolina hurricane four a trough of low pressure in northeastern gulf of mexico developed into a tropical depression about 60 mi 100 km west southwest of cedar key florida on september 10 shortly thereafter depression intensified into a tropical storm moving generally westward storm intensified into a category 1 hurricane on modern day saffir simpson scale early on september 12 cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph 150 km h at 00 00 utc on september 13 observed by a ship around this time hurricane began to curve northwestward while approaching gulf coast of united states system weakened at 08 00 utc on september 14 hurricane made landfall near pascagoula mississippi with winds of 75 mph 120 km h a barometric pressure of was observed at landfall lowest known in relation to cyclone system quickly weakened to a tropical storm just four hours after landfall early on september 15 storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over tennessee in florida precursor to hurricane brought heavy rainfall to tampa with falling there between september 7 and september 10 hundreds of homes and numerous acres of agricultural lands were flooded throughout area many streets were washed out disrupting street car service and commuting in pensacola abnormally high tides caused severe damage wharves and small buildings used for storing fishing equipment washed away about 20 barges were beached strewing timber across beach service via louisville and nashville railroad was briefly interrupted due to timber on a railroad bridge wind damage was relatively minor a dance pavilion on santa rosa island was partially deroofed as was a hotel damage in pensacola reached approximately 25 000 1912 usd in alabama city of mobile in particular suffered impact from storm some ships and vessels capsized in mobile bay and mobile river including a 2 000 barge drowning a watchman winds destroyed a church though wind damage was otherwise limited to downed street signs and fences overall hurricane caused 39 000 in damage hurricane five in late september a cold front moved into gulf of mexico by october 3 a low pressure associated with front developed initially extratropical low moved east northeastward and crossed florida on october 4 after entering atlantic early on october 5 low began strengthening and soon reached equivalency in intensity to a tropical storm around 00 00 utc on october 6 system transitioned into a tropical cyclone while situated about southeast of cape fear in north carolina already a strong tropical storm cyclone intensified into a hurricane about six hours later late on october 6 a vessel observed a barometric pressure of lowest in relation to stop based on this it is estimated that hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph 150 km h storm then began to execute a small cyclonic loop which continued until early on october 8 by then cyclone was moving eastward and weakened to a tropical storm around 00 00 utc on october 9 about 24 hours later system weakened to a tropical depression at 18 00 utc on october 10 depression dissipated about northeast of bermuda despite remaining well offshore during its tropical cyclone stage a wind speed of was observed at cape hatteras north carolina hurricane six observations from ships first indicated presence of a tropical storm to southeast of cayman islands on october 11 moving west northwestward storm strengthened steadily reaching winds of 70 mph 110 km h before making landfall near cancun quintana roo early on october 13 system weakened slightly over land and while situated in gulf of mexico just

developed into a tropical storm by 06 00 utc on november 11 initially storm moved slowly northwestward before eventually curving north northeastward late on november 13 cyclone intensified into a hurricane based on a ship report slow intensification took place after classification as a hurricane though after recurving toward northeastward storm began to quicken in strengthening early on november 17 hurricane reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 115 mph 185 km h it continued north northeastward and made landfall near negril jamaica around 12 00 utc at south negril point a barometric pressure of was observed lowest known in relation to storm storm weakened after landfall and trend continued after reentry into caribbean sea on november 20 hurricane weakened to a tropical storm north of jamaica system then westward across caribbean before dissipating on november 22 about southwest of grand cayman heavy rainfall was reported in jamaica several bridges were severely damaged in northern and eastern portions of island strong winds generated by storm destroyed approximately 25 of banana trees while telegraph lines were downed in a number of places railway lines were

homes were destroyed while 5 000 buildings were damaged or demolished about 100 fatalities and 1 5 million in damage occurred in jamaica extensive flooding and five fatalities occurred in cuba in guantanamo bay area other systems in addition to seven tropical storms four tropical depressions developed and remained below tropical storm intensity first formed from an extratropical cyclone well to southwest of azores on april 4 depression moved southwestward until being by a frontal boundary on april 6 by september 25 another tropical depression developed from a formerly extratropical cyclone about halfway between bermuda and azores however on september 27 depression lost tropical characteristics again next tropical depression formed on october 17 to southeast of bermuda moving generally northwestward depression transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by october 21 final non developing depression formed from an extratropical cyclone to west of canary islands on november 7 depression tracked generally westward before being absorbed by a frontal system on november 11 see also list of tropical cyclones atlantic hurricane season references external links monthly weather
