warsaw is capital of poland before war about 380 000 jews lived there about one quarter of population upon german invasion in september 1939 jews began to be subject to anti jewish laws in 1941 they were forced to move to warsaw ghetto which contained as many as 460 000 people in only 2 4 of city s area official food ration was only 180 calories per person daily although being caught on aryan side of city was an offense punishable by death people survived by smuggling and running illegal workshops in mid 1942 most of jews in warsaw ghetto were deported to treblinka extermination camp in january 1943 when germans resumed deportations jewish combat organization staged armed resistance jews began to dig bunkers and smuggle weapons into ghetto on 19 april 1943 about 2 000 soldiers under command of ss and police leader jurgen stroop entered ghetto with tanks in order to liquidate ghetto they expected to quickly defeat poorly armed jewish insurgents but instead warsaw ghetto uprising largest act of jewish resistance against holocaust dragged on for four weeks germans had to set ghetto on fire pump poison gas into bunkers and blast jews out of their positions in order to march them to umschlagplatz and deport them to majdanek and treblinka according to united states holocaust memorial museum t his seemingly hopeless struggle became one of most significant occurrences in history of jewish people during suppression of uprising stroop sent daily communiques to higher ss and police leader friedrich wilhelm kruger in krakow propaganda company 689 and franz konrad took photographs to document events selected photographs and communiques were compiled along with a summary of german actions as stroop report a personal souvenir for heinrich himmler report was intended to promote stroop s efficiency as a commander and excuse his failure to clear ghetto quickly report memorialized supposed heroism of ss men who participated in suppression of uprising especially sixteen who were killed by jewish fighters more than 7 000 jews were shot during uprising vast majority noncombatants original title of report was jewish quarter of warsaw is no more reflecting nazi propaganda report dehumanized jews describing them as bandits lice or rats and their deportation and murder as a cleansing action instead of being killed or murdered jews were destroyed three copies of report were made for himmler kruger and stroop one copy of stroop report is held by institute of national remembrance ipn in warsaw another copy was entered into evidence at nuremberg trials although photograph was not ultimately shown to court that copy is held by united states national archives and records administration nara photograph photograph was taken during warsaw ghetto uprising between 19 april and 16 may in warsaw ghetto an internet forum discussion on commuter railway association for defending remnant of warsaw cautiously identified location as 34 from similarities in architectural details especially these claims are discussed in a 2018 polish language book 43 now 43 by magdalena and marcin dziedzic photographer was either franz konrad or a member of propaganda company 689 albert cusian erhard josef and arthur grimm served as photographers in propaganda company 689 cusian may have claimed to have taken photograph on trial in poland konrad claimed to have taken photographs during uprising only so that he could complain about stroop s brutality to adolf hitler court did not accept this claim convicted of personally murdering seven jews and deporting a thousand others to death camps konrad was sentenced to death and executed in 1952 photograph depicts a group of jewish men women and children who have been forced out of a bunker by armed german soldiers original caption was forcibly pulled out of bunkers most of jews are wearing ragged clothing and have few personal possessions after being removed from bunker they were marched to umschlagplatz for deportation to an extermination camp in center of photograph is a small boy wearing a newsboy cap and knee length socks who appears six or seven years old he holds his hands up in surrender as ss rottenfuhrer josef blosche holds a submachine gun pointing downwards in his direction photograph contains many opposites as richard raskin put it ss vs jews perpetrators vs victims military vs civilians power vs helplessness threatening hands on weapons vs empty hands raised in surrender steel helmets vs bare headedness or soft caps smugness vs fear security vs doom men vs women and children according to frederic rousseau stroop probably chose to include photograph in report because it showed his ability to overcome judeo christian morality and attack innocent women and children identification boy there are several individuals who have been claimed to be boy in photo but his identity remains unclear he was probably younger than ten because he was not wearing a star of david armband dr lucjan dobroszycki a historian employed by institute for jewish research who has studied photograph stated that this photograph of most dramatic event of holocaust requires a greater level of responsibility from historians than almost any other i t is too holy to let people do with it what they want artur dab siemiatek born in lowicz in 1935 was first proposed as subject of photo in 1950 siemiatek was from a well off family and his father was a member of judenrat in lowicz ghetto liquidated to warsaw in 1941 jadwiga a cousin of siemiatek and resident of warsaw and her husband fled to soviet union in september 1939 they survived holocaust and signed affidavits that siemiatek was boy in photo in 1970s in 1999 a 95 year old man named avrahim zelinwarger told ghetto fighters house in israel that boy in photo was his son levi born in 1932 avrahim escaped to soviet union in 1940 but his wife chana who would be woman in photograph son and daughter are all believed to have been killed during holocaust richard raskin personally doubted zelinwarger claim because of lack of resemblance between levi and boy in photograph an anonymous holocaust survivor told jewish chronicle in 1978 that he was boy in photograph but because he said that photograph was taken in 1941 and other details do not match his claim has been dismissed thumb nussbaum s 1945 passport photograph chaim nussbaum de fr 1936 2012 was born in tel aviv but his family returned to poland before war he lived in hiding on aryan side of warsaw since he and his family had valid palestinian visas they fell into hotel polski trap in which germans promised safe passage out of occupied europe liberated by american troops at bergen belsen concentration camp in 1945 nussbaum stated in 1982 that he had been arrested in front of hotel polski on 13 july 1943 and forced to raise his arms as depicted although some jewish organizations uncritically accepted this claim at time it was made it is not possible that nussbaum was boy in photo nussbaum himself never claimed to be certain about identification saying i think it s me but i can t honestly swear to it a million and a half jewish children were told to raise their hands dobroszycki pointed out discrepancies between nussbaum s claim and what is known about photograph all images in stroop report are believed to have been taken inside warsaw ghetto while hotel polski is not in ghetto hotel polski roundups occurred in a courtyard while photograph depicts a street most of jews in photograph are wearing heavy clothing which suggests that photograph was not taken in july they are wearing armbands that they would not have worn while in hiding on aryan side of city germans are wearing combat uniforms which they would not have needed at hotel polski roundups furthermore nussbaum was arrested more than a month after stroop report was delivered to himmler a comparison with nussbaum s 1945 photograph by forensic anthropologist k r burns of university of georgia revealed that nussbaum had detached earlobes unlike boy in photograph other individuals woman emerging from building directly behind boy was golda stawarowska according to stawarowska s granddaughter golda boy with white bag over his shoulder was identified as ahron leo or photograph number from gdansk by his sister hana same person was also identified as harry haim polish american holocaust survivor esther lamet said that small girl on extreme left foreground was her niece channa hanka lamet or hannah 1937 1943 who was murdered at majdanek woman wearing scarf would then be hanka s mother matylda goldfinger lamet or lamet goldfinger married to lamet family was from warsaw thumb left upright 0 6 blosche in photograph only identification that is certain is that of rottenfuhrer josef blosche ss man aiming mp 28 submachine gun at boy blosche was born in sudetenland in 1912 and served in einsatzgruppen and he was a policeman employed at warsaw ghetto during uprising marek edelman testified that blosche murdered jews as part of his daily routine and he was known to have committed violence against children and pregnant women due to his performance during suppression of warsaw ghetto uprising blosche was awarded war merit cross 2nd class with swords blosche appears in several of photographs in stroop report during his trial in east germany photographs were used as circumstantial evidence for prosecution he was convicted of murder of at least 2 000 people and executed in 1969 of photograph blosche stated legacy thumb nara print has sepia toning preserved in many digital reproductions upright 1 25 thumb warsaw print was developed differently than nara print resulting in less contrast but it shows detail in places where other print is bleached out upright 1 25 photograph was not well known until 1970s perhaps because most countries preferred to celebrate resistance to nazism rather than anonymous victims in 1969 it appeared on cover of english edition of work yellow star in 2016 time magazine listed it as one of 100 most influential photographs of all time stating that it had an evidentiary impact exceeding that of many other searing images produced during holocaust child has come to represent face of 6 million defenseless jews killed by nazis several books have been written about photograph including a child at gunpoint a case study in life of a photo by richard raskin boy a holocaust story by dan porat and l enfant juif de varsovie histoire d une photographie by frederic rousseau photograph is perceived quite differently by ss man who took it and other observers in raskin s words one set of men saw in that photograph heroic soldiers combating humanity s dregs while vast majority of mankind sees here gross inhumanity of man according to eva fogelman photograph has promoted myth that jews went passively like sheep to slaughter image has been used in some controversial artwork juxtaposing warsaw ghetto uprising with second intifada in gaza which some argue is tantamount to holocaust trivialization in legacy of abused children from poland to palestine by british israeli artist alan schechner a camera zooms in on boy in photo who is holding a different photograph of a child in gaza being carried by idf soldiers schechner stated that he did not intend to compare holocaust with israeli palestinian conflict but merely illustrate suffering of children because of cycle of violence in which trauma causes victims to become abusers a different approach was used by norman finkelstein in a photo essay titled deutschland uber alles also juxtaposing warsaw photograph with images of palestinian suffering subtitle read in all caps grandchildren of holocaust survivors are doing to palestinians exactly what was done to them by nazi germany holocaust survivor and artist samuel bak has created a series of more than a hundred paintings inspired by photograph as well as by his own experiences and memory of a lost childhood friend in these works boy s extended arms are often depicted with a crucifixion theme or with boy seen as a part of an imagined monument both nara and ipn describe image as in public domain however in 1990s corbis corporation acquired photograph from archive and licensed three versions of it charging commercial rates for its usage getty images which acquired corbis license rights in 2016 continues to offer it for sale providing a copy of it with a copyright claim watermark as a sample references notes citations further reading category children
