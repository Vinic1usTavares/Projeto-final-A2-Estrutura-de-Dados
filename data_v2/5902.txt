military career of benedict arnold from 1777 to 1779 was marked by two important events in his career in july 1777 arnold was assigned to continental army s northern department where he played pivotal roles in bringing about failure of british brigadier barry st leger s siege of fort stanwix and american success in battles of saratoga which fundamentally altered course of war after convalescing following significant injuries to his leg sustained at saratoga arnold was given military command of philadelphia after british withdrawal in 1778 there arnold became embroiled in political and legal wrangling with enemies in congress army and pennsylvania and philadelphia governments that undoubtedly contributed to his decision to change sides in 1779 he began secret negotiations with british that culminated in a plot to surrender west point plot was exposed in september 1780 following which arnold fled to british occupied new york city background benedict arnold was born in 1741 family in port city of norwich in british colony of connecticut brandt 1994 p 4 6 he was interested in military affairs from an early age serving briefly without seeing action in colonial militia during french and indian war in 1757 flexner 1953 p 8 he embarked on a career as a businessman first opening a shop in new haven and then engaging in overseas trade he owned and operated ships sailing to west indies new france and europe flexner 1953 p 13 when british parliament began to impose taxes on its colonies arnold s businesses began to be affected by them and he eventually joined opposition to those measures randall 1990 p 49 53 in 1767 he married a local woman with whom he had three children one of whom died in infancy brandt 1994 p 14randall 1990 p 62 she died in 1775 and arnold left his children under care of his sister hannah at his home in new haven early american revolutionary war activity arnold had distinguished himself early in war participating in capture of fort ticonderoga in may 1775 and then boldly leading a raid on fort saint jean near montreal randall 1990 pp 78 132 he then led a small army from cambridge massachusetts to quebec city on an expedition through wilderness of present day maine where he was wounded in climactic battle of quebec on december 31 1775 he then presided over an ineffectual siege of quebec until april 1776 when he took over military command of montreal randall 1990 pp 131 228 he directed american retreat from there on arrival of british reinforcements and his forces formed rear guard of retreating continental army as it headed south toward ticonderoga arnold then organized defense of lake champlain and led continental navy fleet that was defeated in october 1776 battle of valcour island randall 1990 pp 228 320 during these actions arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within army power structure and in congress he had established decent relationships with george washington commander of army as well as philip schuyler and horatio gates both of whom had command of army s northern department during 1775 and 1776 randall 1990 pp 318 323 however an acrimonious dispute with moses hazen commander of 2nd canadian regiment boiled over into a court martial of hazen at ticonderoga during summer of 1776 only action by gates then his superior at ticonderoga prevented his own arrest on countercharges levelled by hazen randall 1990 pp 262 264 he had also had disagreements with john brown and james easton two lower level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part brown was particularly vicious publishing a handbill that claimed of arnold money is this man s god and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country howe 1848 pp 4 6 eastern department defense of rhode island following defeat on lake champlain arnold accompanied major general horatio gates as he led a portion of army at ticonderoga south to assist general washington in defense of new jersey randall 1990 pp 321 323 on december 7 1776 a large british force under lieutenant general henry clinton occupied newport rhode island randall 1990 p 325 in response washington ordered arnold to go back to new england to raise militia and coordinate defense of rhode island arnold was made deputy commander of eastern department of continental army under major general joseph spencer and left washington s camp in pennsylvania on december 22 martin 1997 p 292 arnold who had not seen his family for over a year spent a week visiting with them in new haven during which he successfully urged washington and henry knox army s chief of artillery to raise an artillery regiment for john lamb and oswald two connecticut men who had served with him on expedition to quebec randall 1990 p 324 he arrived at providence on january 12 1777 to lead defense against british at newport there were 4 000 rhode island militia mobilized and both governor and arnold s commander general spencer were itching to drive british out of newport arnold developed a plan for driving british from newport but found that militia were so poorly equipped and supplied that offensive operations were in his view ill advised martin 1997 p 301 in february 1777 arnold met and seriously courted daughter of a well known boston loyalist betsy deblois described as belle of boston heavenly miss deblois refused his repeated proposals likely because she was only fifteen brandt 1994 p 116 when he returned to providence he learned that he was one of several officers that had been passed over for promotion to major general by congress reasons for this were largely political in nature but it is unlikely that his prospects were helped by horatio gates delivery of a petition by john brown making many accusations against arnold just one month before congress took up matter martin 1997 p 306 gates was apparently upset that washington had given rhode island command to arnold and now viewed him as a competitor for promotion and choice of assignments palmer 2006 p 189 thumb right upright general horatio gates was first supportive of arnold but came to see him as a competitor for promotion and glory it was not unusual in military establishments of time that individuals passed over for promotion were expected to resign so arnold on march 12 wrote to washington offering his resignation or alternatively asking for a court of inquiry washington refused his offer to resign and wrote to members of congress in an attempt to correct situation noting that two or three other very good officers might be lost if they persisted in making politically motivated promotions brandt 1994 p 118 after washington wrote arnold explaining to him that rejection was due to how congress had allocated promotions to states and connecticut already had its quota of major generals arnold persisted in seeking some sort of inquiry and complained in a letter to general gates that no gentleman who has any regard for his reputation will risk it with a body of men who seem to be governed by whim and caprice and that he felt unmerited injury my countrymen have done me randall 1990 p 331 tryon s danbury raid after plans were shelved to attack british at newport arnold left for philadelphia to meet with continental congress and washington over his future he stopped in new haven to visit his family once again and assisted his friend colonel lamb in hunting down loyalists in area a courier notified him on april 26 that a british force 2 000 strong under major general william tryon last british governor of new york had landed at fairfield connecticut tryon marched his force inland to danbury a major supply depot for continental army driving away few defenders he ordered destruction of stores and a number of properties belonging to patriot supporters randall 1990 p 332 thumb left upright general david wooster died of wounds sustained in battle of ridgefield arnold and major general david wooster who had overall command of connecticut s defense forces and was also in new haven hurriedly recruited about 100 volunteers locally they then headed for redding muster point specified by militia major general gold s silliman who oversaw fairfield county s defenses bailey 1896 p 61 silliman had mustered a force of 500 volunteers from eastern connecticut ward 1952 p 494 under wooster s direction arnold and his fellow officers moved their small force toward danbury so they could intercept and harass british as they returned to their ships wooster divided force with arnold and silliman leading 400 men to village of ridgefield connecticut to block british march while he led 200 men to harass british rear guard by 11 am on april 27 wooster s column had caught up with and engaged tryon s rear guard in two brief skirmishes wooster was mortally wounded but action delayed british long enough for arnold and silliman to establish a crude breastwork just north of ridgefield bailey 1896 pp 76 78 in ensuing battle militia companies put up stiff resistance before they were flanked and driven off arnold s horse was shot and when it went down his leg was pinned under it arnold was very nearly bayoneted by a british soldier but shot him with a pistol and managed to get away with a minor wound to his left leg bailey 1896 p 78 british camped for night near ridgefield and then proceeded on toward coast harassed by militia all way arnold and silliman rallied their troops which grew to include continental army and artillery units as well as militia units from further afield arnold eventually established a fairly strong position on campo hill in present day westport connecticut near beach where british expected to embark bailey 1896 p 79 british managed to elude his attempt to entrap them and drove off many of militia with their field artillery before embarking on their ships and sailing back to new york during final skirmishing arnold had a second horse shot out under him ward 1952 p 495 when congress learned of action on may 2 it finally promoted arnold to major general although his seniority of rank was behind those promoted in february randall 1990 p 334 after danbury raid arnold continued his journey to philadelphia stopping to meet with washington at morristown new jersey during this time he learned of publication of brown s pamphlet and insisted to washington that his name had to be cleared arnold s lobbying paid off and even opponents of traditional promotion schemes including john adams came to realize that arnold was being unjustly treated randall 1990 p 336 after a lengthy hearing before board of war on may 21 in which arnold s actions and financial accounts in quebec campaign were scrutinized board completely exonerated him issuing a statement that it was satisfied with arnold s character and conduct so cruelly and in brown s publication randall 1990 p 338 however it took no steps to restore his seniority thumb right upright john adams was opposed to promotion of officers without congressional approval a stance that affected arnold s promotion seniority issue had annoyed not just arnold but also john stark nathanael greene john sullivan and henry knox stark resigned his commission as brigadier after congress offered a major general s commission to a french soldier of fortune philippe de coudray and other three complained loudly over matter congress passed over his petition for restoration of seniority and deliberately snubbed him for consultation on defense of philadelphia in favor of pennsylvania native thomas mifflin one of generals promoted ahead of him martin 1997 p 333 arnold tendered his resignation to congress on july 11 randall 1990 p 339 however washington had written congress day before informing them that a british army under general john burgoyne had captured fort ticonderoga and recommending in glowing terms that arnold be sent north to assist in defense of hudson river valley given washington s strong support arnold asked that his resignation be shelved and he left philadelphia for north randall 1990 p 342 in a vote on august 8 congress voted against restoring arnold s seniority next day it offered a major general s commission to marquis de lafayette then just nineteen years old randall 1990 p 343 stanwix and saratoga when arnold arrived in continental army camp on upper hudson river in mid july major general schuyler was leading forces there schuyler placed arnold in command of army s advance guards at fort edward it was during this time that jane mccrea fiancee of a loyalist fighting with burgoyne s army was slain by burgoyne s indian auxiliaries this event was widely retold and embellished with lurid details and is said to have contributed to patriot recruiting efforts martin 1997 pp 350 352 in following weeks schuyler s army retreated before burgoyne s advance until it reached mohawk river south of stillwater on august 18 martin 1997 p 353 relief of fort stanwix in early august schuyler dispatched arnold and 900 men to relieve garrison at fort stanwix on upper mohawk which had been placed under siege by a british indian force led by brigadier barry st leger martin 1997 pp 362 363 arnold marched along mohawk to fort dayton which he reached on august 20 there he attempted to recruit additional militia to enlarge relief force but was unsuccessful local militia had suffered grievously in bloody battle of oriskany that ended first attempt to relieve siege martin 1997 pp 364 365 thumb left upright george washington consistently supported arnold uncomfortable with number of troops available to him arnold opted for a deception to sow trouble in s camp outside fort stanwix a number of loyalists had been arrested near fort dayton including one hon yost schuyler hon yost suffered from some form of mental illness which while looked down on by europeans was seen by many indians as a touch of great spirit arnold convinced hon yost to spread rumors that large numbers of americans under command of dark eagle were about to descend on st leger s camp pancake 1977 p 145 hon yost s good conduct was assured by holding hostage his brother who was also among arrested nickerson 1967 p 273 arnold s stratagem apparently worked st leger recorded on august 21 that arnold was advancing by rapid and forced marches with 3 000 men and indians of st leger s expedition who made up majority of his force abandoned siege next day martin 1997 p 366 as a result st leger lifted siege and began journey back to montreal arnold did march to stanwix arriving after st leger had left detachments sent by arnold to chase after him spotted his boats on lake oneida martin 1997 pp 366 2002 pp 260 261 saratoga after leaving reinforcements with fort stanwix garrison arnold returned to stillwater where general gates had taken over command from schuyler arnold had learned of gates assumption of command while he was at fort dayton he wrote a somewhat perfunctory congratulatory to gates when he heard of american victory in battle of bennington but a somewhat warmer letter he wrote to schuyler at same time somehow fell into gates hands gates provided a snub of sorts when he reported to congress on relief of stanwix and action at bennington and failed to mention arnold s role he did specifically mention stark and seth warner principal commanders at bennington in his dispatch washington was more forthcoming with praise recognizing that approach of general arnold with his detachment played a key role in relief of stanwix martin 1997 pp 367 368 on his return to gates camp arnold learned of congressional decision to not restore his seniority he then annoyed gates by taking on as aides several men who had been on schuyler s staff including henry brockholst livingston two men also disagreed on strategy arnold argued in councils in favor of drawing burgoyne into battle while gates preferred to establish a strong line of defense and wait for burgoyne s assault martin 1997 p 370 relations between men deteriorated further when gates effectively overrode brigade assignments he had asked arnold to make and were not helped by gates adjutant james wilkinson arnold characterized scheming wilkinson as a designing villain wilkinson is reported to have regularly cast aspersions on arnold and his staff to gates martin 1997 p 371 thumb right upright james wilkinson was one of gates aides who spoke poorly of arnold this friction between two men and their respective camps boiled over after september 19 battle of freeman s farm in that battle arnold was forceful in wanting to move troops out of strong american fortifications to head off a flanking maneuver gates grudgingly allowed this and arnold s troops sent out to counter british advance precipitated battle martin 1997 pp 387 391 it has been widely recounted in histories of this battle that general arnold was on field directing some of action however john luzader a former park historian at saratoga national historical park carefully documents evolution of this story and believes it is without foundation in contemporary materials and that arnold remained at gates headquarters receiving news and dispatching orders through messengers arnold biographer james kirby martin however disagrees with luzader arguing that arnold played a more active role at freeman s farm by directing patriot troops into position and possibly leading some charges before being ordered back to headquarters by gates battle was technically a british victory as they gained field of battle however they suffered significant casualties that they could ill afford american army s strong position was not assaulted and american casualties were comparatively modest ketchum 1997 p 368 according to richard varick a former schuyler aide and no friend of gates general seemed to be piqued at performance of arnold s division in battle and henry brockholst livingston wrote that arnold was life and soul of troops and that he had confidence and affection of his officers and soldiers martin 1997 p 384 an officer unconnected to either camp commented that arnold had won admiration of whole army and that idea that gates had squandered an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow on british was widely held by officers thumb left a 19th century engraving depicting arnold at battle of bemis heights 2nd saratoga gates camp then engaged in a series of actions that arnold perceived to be an attack james wilkinson wrote a letter to general arthur st clair in philadelphia in which he implied not only that arnold was not involved in battle but that he was an impediment to gates gates official report to congress notably made no mention of arnold morgan or other officers involved in leading action and specifically mentioned arnold s nemesis john brown who had made an attack against fort ticonderoga day before battle martin 1997 pp 385 386 a decision by gates concerning morgan s unit then caused relationships between gates and arnold to break down completely morgan s unit had technically been under gates command but it had operated in battle under arnold s division and his direction gates formally realigned units to reiterate that morgan reported to him and not arnold martin 1997 p 385 ensuing discussion between gates and arnold on september 22 escalated into a shouting match and ended with gates relieving arnold of his command arnold requested a pass to rejoin washington s army which he was given ketchum 1997 p 386 however for unknown reasons he decided to stay in camp a common account of a memorial signed by gates field commanders encouraging him to stay has no basis in documentary record luzader 2008 p 271 it is known that brigadier enoch poor who had been critical of arnold during court martial at ticonderoga and other officers openly considered idea martin 1997 p 390 this support for arnold may have played a role in his announcement on september 26 that he was staying in camp even though his differences with gates had not been resolved martin 1997 p 391 when general burgoyne made a reconnaissance in force of american left on october 7 this began a series of actions that precipitated battle of bemis heights according to conventional histories gates now in command of american left ordered troops out to meet them ketchum 1997 pp 391 394 at a critical point in battle arnold who may have been drinking left his tent mounted a horse and rode off to battlefield this chronology is based on reports of action most of which were recorded many years later after arnold s treason a letter brought to light in 2015 and written by an adjutant at arnold s headquarters tells a different story indicating that arnold requested and received permission from gates to lead men out into field rallying what had been his troops in first battle arnold led them in a furious assault against two redoubts on british right martin 1997 pp 396 398 in this phase of battle one of redoubts was taken and arnold s horse and leg were shot when horse went down arnold s leg was shattered in several places martin 1997 p 400 battle was a resounding victory for americans burgoyne began a retreat but was quickly surrounded by militia companies that streamed into area and surrendered on october 17 martin 1997 p 405 thumb right general john burgoyne credited arnold with american victory gates could not ignore arnold s role in second battle since news of arnold s injuries traveled quickly he limited acknowledgement of arnold s participation to leading of a gallant assault on redoubt palmer 2006 p 255 much to arnold s disgust gates himself was lauded by congress and awarded a gold medal burgoyne on other hand claimed that arnold was responsible for his defeat congress did finally vote to restore arnold s seniority however arnold interpreted manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong palmer 2006 p 256 arnold s contribution to victory at saratoga is commemorated by boot monument in saratoga national historical park donated by civil war general john watts de peyster it shows a boot with spurs and stars of a major general it stands at spot where arnold was shot on october 7 charging

gardner following saratoga arnold was taken to an albany hospital to recover from wounds he had received in battle his left leg was ruined but arnold would not allow it to be amputated several agonizing months of recovery left it 2 inches 5 cm shorter than right brandt 1994 pp 141 143 after several months in albany he was transferred to middletown connecticut where he could be nearer his children while recuperating there he sent two more entreaties to betsy deblois first she answered with a firm refusal and second went unanswered brandt 1994 p 144 when he was well enough to travel he departed connecticut for valley forge where he arrived on may 20 1778 to boisterous applause of troops he had commanded at saratoga brandt 1994 pp 145 146 there he participated with many other soldiers in first recorded oath of allegiance as a sign of loyalty to united states brandt 1994 p 147 as british planned to withdraw from philadelphia in june 1778 washington appointed arnold to take military command of city after british retreat brandt 1994 p 146 even before americans reoccupied philadelphia arnold began scheming to capitalize financially on change in power there engaging in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war related supply movements and benefiting from protection of his authority while these schemes were not necessarily illegal ethics involved were seen as highly dubious at time some of his schemes were frustrated by actions of highly partisan patriots including politically powerful joseph reed these business dealings required capital which arnold often borrowed arnold furthered his debts by living extravagantly occupying penn mansion and throwing parties for high society complicating situation was fact that arnold was administratively trapped between relatively powerful pennsylvania government and congress which was often forced to bow to populous state s demands in order to achieve its aims brandt 1994 pp 148 153 reed and others amassed a series of irregularities in arnold s official actions and open war of words erupted between arnold and reed and his supporters by february 1779 a variety of charges had been publicly made that he was abusing his power brandt 1994 pp 160 161 he demanded a full court martial writing to washington in may having become a cripple in service of my country i little expected to meet such ungrateful returns martin p 428 court martial was postponed it would not be held until december 1779 once more leaving arnold frustrated and angry at congress for its inaction brandt 1994 pp 169 170

during british occupation of philadelphia edward shippen biography peggy and arnold married on april 8 1779 randall 1990 p 448 peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across battle lines in spite of military bans on communication with enemy randall 1990 p 455 some of this communication was effected through services of joseph stansbury a philadelphia merchant randall 1990 p 456 sometime early in may 1779 arnold met with stansbury stansbury whose testimony before a british commission apparently erroneously placed date in june said that after meeting with arnold i went secretly to new york with a tender of arnold s services to sir henry clinton randall 1990 pp 456 457 this was start of a series of negotiations between arnold and sir henry s chief spy very same major andre that had courted peggy martin 1997 p 428 between july and october 1779 two negotiated over terms of arnold s change to british side while arnold provided british with information on troop locations and strengths as well as locations of supply depots randall 1990 pp 474 477 court martial court martial to consider charges against arnold began meeting in december 1779

randall 1990 pp 486 492 arnold worked over next few months to publicize this fact however in early april just one week after washington congratulated arnold on may 19 birth of his son edward shippen arnold washington published a formal rebuke of arnold s behavior randall 1990 pp 492 494 shortly after washington s rebuke a congressional inquiry into his expenditures concluded that arnold had failed to fully account for his expenditures incurred during quebec invasion it concluded that he owed congress some ps1 000 largely because he was unable to document his expenses a significant number of necessary documents were lost during retreat from quebec once again frustrated by congress arnold resigned his military command of philadelphia in late april randall 1990 pp 497 499 later action
