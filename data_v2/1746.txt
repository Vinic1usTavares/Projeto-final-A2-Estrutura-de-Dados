thumb giovanni da verrazano cellere codex officially del viaggio del verrazzano nobile fiorentino al di francesco i ri de francia nel 1524 all america also morgan ms ma 776 is one of three surviving copies of a manuscript originally created in 1524 this manuscript was a letter sent by giovanni da verrazzano 1481 1528 to king francis i of france describing former s navigation of east coast of united states verrazzano was an italian who lived in france and he undertook his voyage in francis service king prompted by french mercantile community charged verrazzano to discover whether there was a direct passage from atlantic to china and japan these were important trading partners particularly in silks and spices for most european nations codex is considered by scholars to be most important of three copies although there is debate as to how much weight should be given to some of detail it provides over twelve pages codex describes how verrazzano sailed due west from madeira in december 1523 and in little more than a month had arrived at north carolina from there they journeyed south towards florida this direction was not without danger as florida represented northerly point of spanish empire and spanish warships patrolled sea verrazzano then turned northwards again and hugging coast passed virginia new jersey and eventually new york where he anchored in what is now new york harbour he then continued north around new england to newfoundland where with provisions running low he turned eastwards verrazzano and crew returned to dieppe in july 1524 codex describes verrazzano s journey in a far greater degree of detail than other versions of his letter which may be because it was originally transcribed by verrazzano s brother and then further annotated by verrazzano himself it was sent via a series of letters to colleagues of verrazzano in france and then to italy where it then remained undiscovered in a viterbo library until early twentieth century until its discovery there had been some doubt as to whether verrazzano had ever made voyage at all background thumb upright 1 3 left girolamo de verrazzano s 1529 map of his brother giovanni s 1524 voyage along

thirty years three major european powers british portuguese and spanish investigated new continent claiming land for their respective monarchs when possible a few years after columbus john cabot had made multiple voyages to newfoundland in service of english king henry vii in september 1522 sebastiano made first circumnavigation of globe and in following year king of france francis i was persuaded to despatch an expedition this was under command of florentine explorer and humanist giovanni da verrazzano verrazzano was tasked with discovering a westward passage to china which would enable traders to avoid treacherous straits of this was goal columbus had originally set out to achieve over 30 years earlier lyon was hub of france s silk industry and a newer shorter such passage would protect and increase their lucrative trade with cathay francis was a willing backer although no royal commission survives for expedition he was frustrated that portugal spain and papacy had effectively divided globe as they knew it between them france had a particularly bitter commercial rivalry with portugal which repeatedly led to armed clashes in areas where their mutual interests overlapped such as brazilian and west african coasts on other hand francis wanted portugal s assistance in war in italy more immediately his financial situation sufficiently precarious to make an expedition worthwhile provided it discovered a source of new wealth for france it has been suggested that verrazzano too was intending to profit personally from his voyage of discovery lyonnais mercantile community was almost exclusively florentine refn so important were florentine merchants in lyon that they were known as florentine nation in city lawrence wroth has described how they held control among many grants of privileges made them over certain business operations of city among them la charge de les de lettres venus de pais et ceux que l on essentially they controlled distribution of mail entering and leaving lyon group note like verrazzano and effectively formed an expatriate community records dating from march previous year suggest that together verrazzano and these merchants had formed a syndicate at expedition s planning stage this was intended to divide both investment and profit from voyage between them they are described as tous french for all florentine merchants verrazzano left france with a ship provided and paid for by king a 100 ton caravel called le dauphine he had a crew of 50 men materiel and provisions sufficient for eight months at sea in december 1523 verrazzano chose a course across mid atlantic perhaps aware that by now lucas vasquez de ayllon had mapped area as far north as 33deg 30 and that ponce de lyon had extended spanish influence from south america up to florida this course ensured him best chance of discovering a western passage while avoiding spanish fleet after forty days sailing they reached and landed just north of cape fear near myrtle grove sound north carolina verrazzano named this new continent francesca after his king he knew he had not reached china as he described it as a new land which had not been seen before by any man either ancient or modern codex thumb upright alt king francis i of france portrait of verrazzano s patron francis i of france 1494 1547 by jean clouet c 1530 discovery cellere codex is a manuscript attributed to verrazzano held in library of count guido of cellere in 1908 after which it is named it was discovered by italian scholar alessandro bacchiani in 1908 who published a critical edition following year it was originally written on 8 july 1524 and addressed to a business associate of gerolamo bonacorso ruscellay written in verrazzano s native italian that first draft was transcribed multiple times into french for king it is unique among surviving copies in being annotated by verrazzano himself these annotations are considerable and they both expand on context of events codex describes and provide detailed minutiae about them it is likely that many other versions of letter were written for convenience of scribe before translating although they appear not to have survived annotated codex appears to have been given to either leonardo or sartini merchants and then forwarded to a roman banker bonacorso ruscellay who was a relative of verrazzano s within thirty years it was in possession of noted italian antiquarian paolo giovi and eventually resurfaced hundreds of years later in cellere library bacchiani s version was subsequently translated into french in 1933 and again in 1946 most recent translation was in 1956 director of pierpont library frederick b adams jr decided to definitively publish library s codex complete with transcription translation appendices and footnotes adams appointed library s consultant lawrence c wroth to undertake work and it was eventually published in 1970 wroth s book utilised and printed 1956 translation of codex reliance historians of period have sometimes placed upon it seymour i schwartz for example has described it as holding a nuclear position in twentieth century scholarship has been criticised in some quarters one modern italian scholar luca codignola has blamed this phenomenon on a dearth of contemporary sources other than codex and has condemned what he identifies as a tendency to take manuscript at face value treating it as a sort of sixteenth century encyclopaedia scholars were already aware of two other copies of verrazzano s letter in existence although codex is generally considered best quality version i n p stokes as part of his six volume iconography of manhattan island described codex as an accurate and full embodiment of verrazzano s famous lost letter to king further it was one of most important documents dealing with topography of north east coast of united states particularly manhattan island which had been up until verrazzano s arrival undiscovered it has been described as most significant and definitive document of verrazano s voyage on account of its semi autobiographic nature cellere codex was written before verrazano sent his king francis i an official report but after he had returned from new world verrazzano devoted about one third of codex to natives he found on new continent especially their appearance customs and society other areas of particular interest were landscape including climate and vegetation in its various forms it is only primary source historians possess regarding verrazzano s 1524 navigation of north east and american historian lawrence c wroth called it earliest geographical topological and ethnological survey stretching from newfoundland to florida indeed degree to which historians have relied on codex as informing them evidentially on subjects as diverse as flora fauna navigation vegetation patterns aboriginal relations native food very wholesome and native boats a single log carrying between 10 and 15 men of around to long description all three surviving copies of verrazzano s letter appear to be based upon three separate originals codex was titled a discourse upon indies when it was first transcribed for public consumption by giovanni ramusio official cosmographer of venetian republic it consists of 12 numbered sheets of italian paper with text on both sides measuring x it is written in cursive court hand of period probably that of a secretary it is copiously annotated with marginalia at least 26 times in a different more hurried hand to prose this has left ink blots and erasures over pages historian bernard hoffman has described what he sees verrazzano s text as illustrating about him verrazzano s writing in codex has been interpreted in different ways two recent scholars have praised verrazzano s prose john allen has called verrazzano s landscape descriptions as lyric while theodore described him as viewing french territorial expansion through lens of renaissance it was an eclectic courtly language and literature margaret on other hand has highlighted author s detachment from his subject she particularly notices it in his description of their failed kidnapping of a young woman and successful kidnap of boy what is most striking about this description she suggests is way it conveys natives terror in same tone as that in which it praises material richness of place a photographic facsimile of original document was created and published in 1916 by phelps stokes and this was accompanied by a translation of codex by edward hall cellere codex is now held by morgan library and museum in manhattan as ms ma 776 voyage description codex states at very beginning how king francis instructions were to discover new lands and especially a new route to cathay it begins by describing verrazzano s departure from france with four ships of which two were lost almost immediately in a storm remaining two dauphine and le normandie had to turn back to brittany where after a brief period interfering with spanish shipping off coast dauphine sailed alone to madeira verrazzano left in great secrecy from porto santo in far west of island on 17 january 1524 somewhere in atlantic he encountered a violent storm which raged for sixteen hours verrazzano attributed ship s survival to divine intervention and its own seaworthiness he travelled westwards along 32nd parallel approximately 150 miles north of columbus route and eventually sighting a new land never before seen by anyone landed at cape fear codex describes how he sailed south to florida in search of a harbour finding none he returned to cape fear and disembarked making their first steps upon new continent a few days later dauphine sailed again this time north easterly always within sight of coastline passing north carolina and georgia this area verrazzano named selva di lauri and campo di or forest of laurels and field of cedars french next passed virginia maryland delaware new jersey on a sea characterised by enormous waves where he recorded seeing navesink highlands which he called little mountain by sea they next came to new york which he named nova gallia latin for little france and rhode island coastlands here he temporarily set aside his cautious practice of always dropping anchor off shore in open waters and sailed straight into what was probably narragansett bay here he noted its good defensive position and potential it possessed for coastal fortifications he described staten island and brooklyn as two small but prominent hills either side of a very wide river dauphine then tracked coast of new england where in casco bay maine they first met natives who were by then experienced in trading with europeans codex reveals verrazzano s disapproval of these natives bad manners as he saw it because they were often exhibiting their bare behinds and laughing immoderately thumb verrazzano s route in 1524 alt map of verrazzano s route to and from america left from there they travelled up to nova scotia and newfoundland which codex calls dauphine had returned to dieppe by early july 1524 however codignola notes that although most places can be generally identified narrative of journey is vague at best and there are some areas such as chesapeake bay and bay of fundy which it has been asserted he could not have missed yet go unmentioned altogether chesapeake bay it has been noted is wide but inexplicably considering his quest for a passageway through americas he did not enter if however verrazzano did indeed miss sighting these places it may indicate that his attention to land generally was distracted possibly by increasingly poor weather conditions verrazzano gave opposing weather as a reason for not landing on an island slightly later in voyage verrazzano navigated mouth of delaware river and named it he did not phelps stokes noted name hudson river merely describing it as a very great river martha s vineyard he termed aloysia codex is also only version of verrazzano s letter to contain a reference to false sea imaginary isthmus of verrazzano which is unmentioned on any other contemporary maps of his voyage this is described in codex as an isthmus one mile wide and about two hundred miles long and which verrazano annotates as being so long they could see eastern sea from ship i e pacific ocean and which they thought stretched around tip of india china and cathay american academic thomas suarez has discussed verrazzano s reaction to discovering supposed isthmus as bizarre after claiming to have unearthed holy grail of navigators verrazzano apparently made no attempt to cross isthmus either on land or through any of inlets he reported inlets which one of his longboats would have had little difficulty maneuvering nor does verrazzano appear to have made an attempt to return to his promising isthmus particularly as it would have been impossible for him to have not seen gaps from which fresh water flowed and which therefore could have theoretically provided passage westwards that he was looking for travelling approximately miles northwards verrazzano sent a landing party ashore at around what is now worcester county maryland or accomac county virginia due to what he called beauty of trees describing coast as very green and forested but without harbours he named country arcadia while ashore french kidnapped a native boy another miles north brought dauphine to sandy hook new jersey they soon came to a wide river between two prominent hills and took a small boat up river to a densely populated land at that point river widened to a lake verrazzano named one of peaks king francis had been count of angouleme before ascending to throne in 1515 and other he named santa margarita after king s sister margaret of valois he named other headlands after members of french nobility such as duc d alencon seigneur de duc de vendome and comte de st pol verrazzano and his crew had discovered new york harbour they dropped anchor at what is now called narrows after which event verrazano narrows bridge was named lake he saw was actually upper new york bay but they did not sail far enough up river for this to become apparent he described many new yorkers they saw as dressed in birds feathers of various colours and they came toward us joyfully uttering loud cries of wonderment it is likely that verrazzano would have stayed longer but a storm blew up in harbour and after only a day dauphine was forced to retreat further out to sea at which point verrazzano decided to continue his navigation northwards greatly to our regret wrote verrazzano as region was he believed not without things of value verrazzano continued to rhode island where they stopped at newport and then sailed another miles which brought them to cape cod this was a particularly dangerous region for explorers and schwartz notes irony in verrazzano s naming area after intensely disliked papal official francesco final leg of journey took them to newfoundland or what he termed land which britons once found which lies in 50 degrees which took him to cape breton and nova scotia aftermath immediate public response to verrazzano s return to france in 1525 seems to have been that his voyage had been a failure and that closest he had come to mineral booty were sweet potatoes whose colour it was hoped might be regarded as proof of copper deposits verrazzano probably intended to return to explore east coast further but by time he returned to france political situation had changed drastically french fortunes were falling in italian wars and francis already south of dieppe in blois was personally travelling there to oversee a renewed campaign verrazzano despatched a report from dieppe knecht posits that king may not have found time to read verrazano s report or even to meet navigator in lyon where king had reached by 7 august verrazzano himself was persuaded otherwise and reported that new world which above i have described is connected together not adjoining asia or africa which i know to be a certainty codex is verrazzano continued most accurate and most valuable of all early coastal voyages that has come down to us it also led to creation of what would be definitive map of world gerolamo s map of 1529 and lok map of 1582 robertus de bailly used gerolamo s map as basis for his 1530 globe and all of them included verrazzano s imaginary isthmus verrazzano s voyage with all its descriptive and cartographical errors was still important for both explorers and mapmakers as it effectively filled in a gap between what spanish had discovered in south and what english had towards canada codex report after it was disseminated through navigational and cartographic communities bolstered growing conviction among best english and french geographers that north america was a separate continent and that a solid land mass connected la florida of spanish to newfoundland in north verrazzano also provided provenance and justification for french activities in americas until end of century french diplomacy defended various actions of french sailors whether corsairs or fishermen with reference to 1524 voyage until codex was discovered nineteenth century historians had no proof that verrazzano had ever made his voyage in 1524 as no other record of it was found to exist in either french or italian archives until then there was some doubt among scholars as to whether his voyage had taken place at all nineteenth century antiquarian buckingham smith denounced entire voyage as a fabrication and h c murphy plausibly argued that not only had verrazzano never reached america but that letter of 8 july 1524 was not even his they believed instead that verrazzano was instead a corsair named jean florin florentine this historiographical dispute was known as verrazzano controversy it was considered at least possible that verrazzano s letter was a fraud and one which had had active participation of king francis francis intention it was suggested was to allow him to lay claim to country without need to fund an expensive exploration american antiquarian society for example stated at their 1876 agm that time seems not yet to have arrived when this society should attempt a judicial decision upon claims made in behalf of john verrazzano to distinction of being discoverer of a large portion of north american coast in response nation wrote same year that controversy could not be over because there were still archives to search documents to compare statements to verify or impugn and that suggestions that verrazzano had not made voyages as claimed were based solely on assumptions by his critics french cartographic scholar marcel noted that in light of modern scholarship criticisms of smith and murphy whose books nobody now reads have been discounted and codex is seen as just latest and best piece of evidence for verrazzano s 1524 navigation for which evidence was already firm notes references bibliography category 1524 books
