sovershenny was one of 18 officially known as project 7u built for soviet navy during late 1930s although she began construction as a project 7 sovershenny was completed in 1941 to modified project 7u design ship struck a mine while running her acceptance trials in september while under repair in november she was hit by two bombs that virtually wrecked her soviets subsequently disarmed her repairs resumed in early 1942 until sovershenny was sunk by an artillery shell in june her wreck was scrapped in late 1945 design and description originally built as a gnevny class ship sovershenny and her sister ships were completed to modified project 7u design after joseph stalin general secretary of communist party of soviet union ordered that latter be built with their boilers arranged en echelon instead of linked as in gnevnys so that a ship could still move with one or two boilers disabled rohwer monakov p 52 balakin p 8 like gnevnys project 7u destroyers had an overall length of and a beam of but they had a reduced draft of at deep load ships were slightly overweight displacing at standard load and at deep load crew complement of storozhevoy class numbered 207 in peacetime but this increased to 271 in wartime as more personnel were needed to operate additional equipment balakin pp 30 44 yakubov worth p 101 each ship had a pair of geared steam turbines each driving one propeller rated to produce using steam from four water tube boilers which designers expected would exceed speed of project 7s because there was additional steam available sovershenny reached in trials variations in fuel oil capacity meant that range of project 7us varied from at yakubov worth pp 101 106 107 project 7u class ships mounted four b 13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of superstructure anti aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34 k anti aircraft aa guns in single mounts and three 21 k aa guns hill p 42 as well as four dk or dshk machine guns they carried six torpedo tubes in two rotating triple mounts amidships ships could also carry a maximum of 58 to 96 mines and 30 depth charges they were fitted with a set of mars hydrophones for anti submarine work although these were useless at speeds over yakubov worth pp 101 105 106 construction and career sovershenny was laid down at shipyard no 200 named after 61 communards in nikolayev as yard number 1073 on 17 september 1936 as a gnevny class destroyer with name balakin p 9 she was relaid down as a project 7u destroyer in 1938 and launched on 25 february 1939 balakin p 11 after launching she was transferred to shipyard no 201 sergo ordzhonikidze in sevastopol as yard number 245 for completion ship was renamed sovershenny on 25 september 1940 and was 90 complete when germans invaded soviet union on 22 june 1941 operation barbarossa rohwer monakov p 234 she began acceptance trials during september while conducting trials off chersonesus on 30 september day slated for her official acceptance by navy balakin pp 126 127 she accidentally entered a soviet minefield at 16 42 ship struck a mine that blew a hole in her hull which flooded both forward boiler rooms and forward engine room in addition to starting a fire in one of forward boiler rooms destroyer lost power and took on of water after an attempt by rescue tug to pump out flooded compartments sovershenny was towed into shallows of bay for night due to fears of her sinking from loss of reserve buoyancy on next morning pontoons were placed under hull and she was towed back to sevastopol being placed in a floating dock to patch hole in her hull on 2 october destroyer was subsequently transferred to drydock of shipyard no 201 platonov p 219 yakubov worth p 113 thumb a 130 mm gun from sovershenny used by a battery on malakhov kurgan during an attack by german aircraft on 12 november destroyer was struck by two bombs during a raid by heinkel he 111s of first group of kampfgeschwader 27 i kg 27 and junkers ju 88s of kg 51 forczyk pp 81 82 bombs broke back already weakened by mine explosion and started extensive fires fueled by remaining oil in her tanks which burned out her stern they also damaged drydock so that it flooded and water gave ship a 25deg list two days later she was struck by a pair of artillery shells sovershenny was disarmed in early december and her main guns were used to form a coastal artillery battery platonov pp 219 220 rohwer p 114 yakubov worth pp 113 114 positioned on malakhov kurgan and manned by 65 of her sailors forczyk p 121 drydock was repaired and drained on 20 february 1942 after which repairs resumed which reconstructed her hull in two months sovershenny was removed from drydock in early may and moored in bay for completion but in early june she was damaged by several near misses from bombs and another landed in a boiler room explosion of a german heavy artillery shell near a starboard boiler room on 15 june holed ship causing flooding that tugboats failed to pump out and sovershenny sank with only her forward superstructure after end of war her wreck was refloated by an emergency rescue detachment of black sea fleet on 28 october 1945 she was deemed irreparable and struck from soviet navy on 27 december of that year being sent to sevastopol base at inkerman for scrapping yakubov worth p p 357 notes citations sources further
