right thumb narrows bridge right thumb narrows bridge is made up of two road bridges and a railway bridge narrows bridge is a freeway and railway crossing of swan river in perth western australia made up of two road bridges and a railway bridge constructed at a part of river known as narrows located between mill point and point lewis it connects mitchell and kwinana freeways linking city s northern and southern suburbs original road bridge was opened in 1959 and was largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in world construction of northern interchange for this bridge necessitated reclamation of a large amount of land from river bridge formed part of kwinana freeway which originally ran for only to canning bridge over following decades freeway system was expanded to north and south greatly increasing volume of traffic using bridge as a result in 2001 a second road bridge was opened to west of original bridge and in 2005 railway bridge was constructed in gap between two traffic bridges passenger trains first traversed narrows in 2007 with opening of mandurah railway line first road bridge 1959 thumb right original narrows bridge under construction thumb narrows bridge under construction close distance between mill point and point lewis at foot of mount eliza meant site was suggested as a suitable location for a bridge as early as 1849 a bridge was proposed for site in 1899 but its expected cost of ps13 000 was deemed too high preliminary planning for a bridge at site finally began in 1947 but was suspended so that a replacement for causeway could be built at island at city s eastern end gregory p 107 new causeway bridges were opened in 1952 and by 1954 traffic using them to enter city had doubled renewing calls for a bridge at narrows site investigations for bridge began in august 1954 bridge was proposed for narrows site by town planning commission under chairmanship of harold boas chosen site drew public protest on basis that bridge would spoil view to and from city also residents of wealthy mill point area were angry that they would have a major highway running beside their houses site also necessitated reclamation of of land from mounts bay for bridge approach and interchange this land reclamation which started in october 1954 saw addition of of sand much of which was dredged from melville water state started saving for new bridge in september 1954 and construction of bridge was approved by hawke state labor government in november 1954 before hepburn stephenson metropolitan roads plan had been finalised such was urgency of a new traffic link gregory p 106 construction of bridge was subsequently endorsed in 1955 hepburn stephenson plan which later developed into metropolitan region scheme river bed at site of proposed bridge was not ideal for bridge building with soft mud extending down as deep as with sand beds below that going a further down narrows opening p 33 ernie godfrey a bridge engineer with main roads department travelled overseas to inspect bridges in similar geological locations and to source a designer for proposed bridge design contract for bridge was won by british engineering firm maunsell co construction on road system began in 1956 and contract for construction of bridge was signed by commissioner of main roads j digby leach on 16 march 1957 bridge was built by danish firm christiani and nielsen in conjunction with western australian engineering firm j o clough son leif ott nilsen oversaw construction on behalf of christiani and nielsen narrows opening p 31 first timber pile for temporary staging for construction was driven at noon on 8 june 1957 narrows opening p 34 first permanent pile for bridge was driven home on 18 august 1957 work on bridge s precast concrete beams began in september 1957 and first of these was lifted into place by gantry crane in february 1958 last river pile was driven home in november 1958 and final concrete beam was lowered into position in june 1959 during construction on 10 february 1959 john tonkin then deputy premier and minister for works announced that new bridge was to be named golden west bridge however golden west was also name for a popular soft drink proposal encountered scorn from commentators and was quietly dropped gregory p 108 bridge cost ps1 5 million as part of a wider road system costing ps3 5 million narrows opening p 25 construction of bridge took 2 years and 5 months it was officially opened by governor charles gairdner on 13 november 1959 he unveiled a plaque on bridge together with premier sir david brand commissioner of main roads j digby leach and works minister wild gairdner was also first person to drive across new bridge it was hoped at this stage that debt raised to pay for bridge would be repaid by government within 12 months bridge formed part of new kwinana freeway which originally ran from narrows to canning highway narrows opening p 27 this was described as most modern highway in western australia with a speed limit of bridge was also largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in world at time of its opening anon 1959 world s largest precast prestressed concrete bridge completed roads and road construction v 37 n 444 pp 364 367 design bridge was jointly designed by engineering firm g maunsell partners and architects william halford partners prestressed concrete design was relatively new for western australia where road bridges had traditionally been built from timber frameworks bridge is arched along its length with a vertical curve of up to 4 grade unusually soft soil conditions at site forced use of 160 gambia piles for bridge s foundations named after country in which they were first used diameter piles have steel shells and conical noses hollow piles were driven by a drop hammer falling within them then when they had sufficient resistance to driving they were filled with reinforced concrete piles support two river piers two shore piers and two abutments bridge s support columns on piers were designed in a triangular form larger at top than at bottom each carrying two of bridge s beams so as to not completely obstruct view through bridge s piers these columns support bridge s five spans a central span of two flanking spans of each and two smaller spans of at each end passing over roadways bridge has eight parallel lines of beams each line of beams consists of two cantilever spans long suspended between shore and river piers a central suspended span long between two river piers and two spans suspended over roadways at either end suspended between beams of bridge were of water mains pipes and of gas and drainage pipes footpaths wide on either side of bridge were formed by concrete cast in situ and cantilevered out from adjacent beams these footpaths were separated from roadway and bridge s edge by lightweight aluminium balustrades and safety fences installed by narrows opening p 29 street lights were integrated into safety fence deck of bridge was formed by pre casting individual concrete units on southern river shore then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in river units were then structurally joined by strands of high tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack these pre stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks at ends of spans new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6 000 cars per hour in each direction narrows opening p 30 over a total of six traffic lanes post completion history strengthening works were carried out on bridge by structural systems ltd in 1996 also in 1996 decorative night lighting was installed on each side of bridge bridge was entered on state s heritage register on 8 january 1999 and was named a national engineering landmark by institution of engineers australia in november 1999 opening of southern regions of perth to easier cbd access changed nature of metropolitan area prompting dramatic population growth south of river this led to increased traffic on bridge causing regular traffic jams in peak hour over years governments suggested various ideas to reduce traffic using bridge including introducing congestion pricing similar to that used in singapore charging vehicles to enter central business district during peak periods government also encouraged voluntary car sharing these efforts were largely unsuccessful and by 1990s bridge had become city s worst traffic bottleneck despite addition of an extra traffic lane bringing total number of lanes to seven second road bridge 2001 plans for a second narrows bridge were mooted during 1970s but did not eventuate by 1998 original bridge was carrying 155 000 vehicles per day with an average of 2 700 cars per lane between 7 30 am and 8 30 am and was thought to be busiest section of freeway in australia this quantity of traffic far outstripped expected capacity of bridge when it opened in 1959 in 1998 road planners most favoured solution to traffic problem was to widen existing bridge by building a smaller second traffic bridge just west of it and joining their decks to form a contiguous roadway this would increase number of traffic lanes from seven to ten widening was expected to cost 50 million a plan to widen narrows bridge was announced on 13 april 1998 by court liberal state government 70 million plan would involve addition of four extra traffic lanes and was part of a 230 million package upgrading and extending southern end of kwinana freeway alannah mctiernan then opposition transport spokesperson attacked plan saying that government should instead build a railway to rockingham instead of widening existing structure minister for transport eric charlton on 15 july 1998 approved construction of a separate second road bridge alongside original narrows bridge this solution would cost 15 million less due to new building techniques and would be less disruptive to traffic on existing bridge construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because foundations of any new structure might settle in soft river bed at a different rate from existing bridge under plan there would be six lanes on each bridge including a bus lane on each new bridge would run parallel to original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of and was designed to look largely same as original main roads called for tenders for bridge widening in july 1998 and on 7 march 1999 it was announced that building contract had been awarded to leighton contractors negotiated contract price was reduced to 49 million owing to construction method proposed by leighton designers were connell wagner bridge was constructed by incremental launching technique with segments pre cast on both shores and pushed out into place as construction progressed bridge was divided into two strips lengthways with eastern half launched separately from western half and two decks were later joined at bridge s centre line first of twelve segments was launched in february 2000 as it was being launched bridge rested on temporary piles only after structure was fully launched were these piles removed and bridge allowed to rest on its permanent supports construction required driving of around 250 steel piles first was driven on 10 august 1999 construction of second bridge was interrupted several times by strikes see e g as well as by an algal bloom in swan river bridge was finally opened to traffic on 26 february 2001 and officially opened by new transport minister alannah mctiernan a strident critic of project on 30 may 2001 bridge had originally been planned to be opened in august 2000 and was expected to carry 80 000 cars per day new traffic bridge carried six lanes of traffic including one bus lane and original bridge was modified at this time to carry six traffic lanes as designed railway bridge 2005 during construction of second road bridge construction of a railway through perth s southern suburbs to rockingham and mandurah became a political issue see e g incumbent liberal state government proposed building a railway from kenwick to connect to kwinana freeway running in centre of freeway for only part of its journey labor opposition instead wanted to build railway across narrows bridge and down most of length of freeway after labor party won 2001 state election it reversed previous government s position and started planning for installation of railway tracks across narrows bridge construction of a third bridge was needed due to lack of previous planning provisions when second bridge was constructed leighton constructions won contract to build freeway stage of railway line and set about constructing a narrow southbound railway bridge in gap between existing road bridges designers of package e of southern suburbs railway which included narrows rail bridge were coffey geosciences and wyche consulting eastern side of existing northbound 2001 bridge was also strengthened to accommodate northbound railway track construction was due to start in july 2005 and completion was expected by december 2005 first passengers traversed narrows on 23 december 2007 with opening of mandurah railway line railway bridge deck was made from nine steel girders each weighing up to and up to long these girders were built in kwinana brought to site by road and lowered into position with
