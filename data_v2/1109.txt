1997 p 93 sinclair 2004 p 33 producer richard stannard was originally at studio to meet pop star jason donovan but he ended up in showcase after hearing melanie brown as she went charging across corridor stannard recalls sinclair 2004 pp 40 41 more than anything they just made me laugh i couldn t believe i d walked into this situation you didn t care if they were in time with dance steps or whether one was overweight or one wasn t as good as others it was something more it just made you feel happy like great pop records stannard stayed after everyone had left showcase to talk to group he then reported back to his songwriter partner matt rowe that he had found pop group of their dreams in january 1995 chris herbert booked group s first professional songwriting session with producers at strongroom in curtain road east london rowe remember feeling similarly to stannard when he first met group i love them immediately they were like no one i d met before really session was productive as duo seemed to get along with group together they discussed about songwriting process and what they wanted to do with record in her autobiography brown recalled that duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate spirit of five loud girls into great pop music brown 2002 p 175 writing and inspiration 2 become 1 was co written by spice girls along with partners richard stannard and matthew rowe stannard and rowe also co produced track after writing more uptempo dance based songs such as wannabe group and two producers decided to write a slow ballad but as group were writing song they realised that it was a bit too slushy so it was decided to address importance of contraception with lyrics be a little bit wiser baby put it on put it on song was inspired by special relationship that was developing between geri halliwell and rowe sinclair 2004 pp 42 43 brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting when he rowe and geri started making eyes at each other i knew what was going on even though they denied it i knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me brown 2002 p 176 stannard commented about fondness between halliwell and rowe i don t want to get into side of things they were very close they clicked and i think lyrics in 2 become 1 came from that especially first verse which they wrote together spanish version group recorded a spanish version of song written by them rowe stannard and n mano title was 2 become 1 spanish version although title is loosely translated in one line of song uno los dos it was released as eleventh track of their debut album spice in latin america south africa in a special re edition of album in spain and as one of tracks of 2 become 1 maxi single in us a spanglish edit that traded verses between english and spanish versions was created by dj mike rizzo and production director bill schultz for new york based radio wktu composition 2 become 1 is a pop ballad with r b influences written in key of f major it is set in time signature of common time and moves at a slow tempo of 72 beats per minute spice girls 2008 pp 43 47 song is constructed in a verse chorus form and its instrumentation comes from a guitar an electronic keyboard and string instruments song opens with an instrumental introduction with a chord progression of em add9 d f g am7 that is also used during

second three verses were sung by chisholm halliwell and bunton respectively final verse sung by bunton and bridges sung by brown in final versions of song brown sang second verse instead of beckham

become so strong that they practically become one entity through act of sexual intercourse spice girls 1997 pp 38 39 apart from sexual connotations there is an aspirational undercurrent to lyrics and like many of their subsequent songs desire is explicitly linked to ambition free your mind of doubt and danger be for real don t be a stranger we can achieve it we can achieve it two different versions of song each with different lyrics were recorded in album version second line of second verse any deal that we endeavour boys and girls feel good together was changed in single version to

in a review of group s debut album spice dev sherlock of yahoo music radio called it a glossy ballad that would do mariah carey proud whitney pastorek of entertainment weekly said that song is too

spice girls featured in new york city with fast moving cars and multi coloured lights around them music video for 2 become 1 was directed on 5 6 november 1996 by big tv in a two day shoot located at a studio in old compton street london cinematographer stephen keith roach who worked in other music videos such as jamiroquai s virtual insanity and u2 s discotheque was in charge of photography shoot involved group dressed in winter coats wandering around studio against a green screen interspersed with close up camera angles so that backdrop could be superimposed later brown 2002 p 240 halliwell 1999 p 249 to achieve effect of wind rippling through their hair group was required to lip synch song in double time while wind machines were blowing on them synopsis music video features group wandering around times square in new york city with fast moving cars appearing around multi coloured lights they appear in various places around city either alone with one other member or as a quintet video is intercut with scenes of lovers experiencing moments of togetherness and closes with a deer wandering streets such a scene according to group s first official book girl power gave them a running gag all throughout shoot whenever anyone made a mistake it was oh deer sometimes closing scene would not be shown on television due to song fading out to an instrumental which lasts for 40 seconds in same book victoria beckham wrote about shoot i think 2 become 1 is my favourite video it was really different to other videos shot entirely in studio with high technology and loads of effects it was really weird having to sing passionately into camera i was feeling a right mug in front of all those people singing wanna make love to ya baby live performances right thumb 245px spice
