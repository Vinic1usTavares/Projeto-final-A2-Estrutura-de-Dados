likely a republican while others feel she is a democrat alessandra stanley of new york times notes that meyer s party affiliation is unknown because show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology james poniewozik of time explains ambiguity as follows veep is almost all politics and almost no political issues robert lloyd of los angeles times explains lack of need for party affiliations or even political ideology in a similar manner saying that veep is less a show about politics than about politicking in an interview with new yorker radio hour julia louis dreyfus suggested that meyer s associated political party is intentionally left unknown to audience louis dreyfus later elaborated selina meyer s politics are all about her and staying alive she will hold any

group does behind closed doors after public speeches about ceaseless platitudes variety television critic brian lowry describes meyer as easily flustered foul mouthed saying that her over reliance on profanity is a comedic crutch david renshaw of guardian describes meyer as a perfect combination of ineptness and amorality t a frank of new republic says that in season 1 she is completely ignored by president and dismissed by congress as she endures repeated indignities with a high degree of cynicism according to frank meyer slowly gains some respect and power but it is not without effort entertainment weekly ken tucker noted that premise of a politician without influence striving for it suited itself well to a comedy and that her frequent cursing should not have been much of an issue given that it was an hbo production laura bennett of new republic states that in season 1 meyer is a hapless buffoon her hair and running in circles who endures marginalization and irrelevance but in
