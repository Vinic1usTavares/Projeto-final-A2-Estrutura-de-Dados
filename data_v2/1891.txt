nimrod built in united kingdom by ferranti for 1951 festival of britain was an early computer custom built to play nim inspired by earlier nimatron twelve by nine by five foot 3 7 by 2 7 by 1 5 metre computer designed by john makepeace bennett and built by engineer raymond stuart williams allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of nim against an artificial intelligence player pressed buttons on a raised panel corresponding with lights on machine to select their moves and nimrod moved afterward with its calculations represented by more lights speed of nimrod s calculations could be slowed down to allow presenter to demonstrate exactly what computer was doing with more lights showing state of calculations nimrod was intended to demonstrate ferranti s computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain though festival attendees were more interested in playing game than logic behind it after its initial exhibition in may nimrod was shown for three weeks in october 1951 at berlin industrial show before being dismantled game of nim running on nimrod is a candidate for one of first video games as it was one of first computer games to have any sort of visual display of game it appeared only four years after 1947 invention of cathode ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display and one year after bertie brain a computer similar to nimrod which played tic tac toe at 1950 canadian national exhibition nimrod s use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real time visual graphics however much less moving graphics does not meet some definitions of a video game development in summer of 1951 united kingdom held festival of britain a national exhibition held throughout uk to promote british contribution to science technology industrial design architecture and arts and to commemorate centenary of 1851 great exhibition british engineering firm and nascent computer developer ferranti promised to develop an exhibit for festival in late 1950 john makepeace bennett an australian employee of firm and recent ph d graduate from university of cambridge proposed that company create a computer that could play game of nim in nim players take turns removing at least one object from a set of objects with goal of being player who removes last object gameplay options can be modeled mathematically bennett s suggestion was supposedly inspired by an earlier nim playing machine nimatron which had been displayed in 1940 at new york world s fair nimatron machine had been designed by edward condon and constructed by westinghouse electric from electromechanical relays and had weighed over a ton although bennett s suggestion was a game his goal was to show off computer s ability to do mathematical calculations as nim is based on mathematical principles and thus showcase ferranti s computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain ferranti began work on building computer on 1 december 1950 with engineer raymond stuart williams adapting design by bennett into a working machine development was completed by 12 april 1951 resulting in a device twelve feet wide nine feet deep and five feet tall majority of volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and light bulbs that displayed state of game with actual computer taking up no more than two percent of total volume of machine nimrod took form of a large box with panels of lights with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with lights which in turn represented objects player could remove player would sit at stand and press buttons to make their moves while one panel of lights showed state of game and another showed computer s calculations during its move computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds slowing down so that demonstrator could describe exactly what computer was doing in real time a visual guide attached to nimrod explained what computer was doing during its turn as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by lights signs stating which player s turn it was and whether one or other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay presentation thumb diagram of machine on 5 may 1951 nimrod computer was presented at festival as nimrod digital computer advertised as faster than thought and an electronic brain it exclusively played game of nim moves were made by players seated at raised stand with demonstrator sitting on other side between stand and computer nimrod could play either traditional or reverse form of game a short guidebook was sold to visitors for one shilling and sixpence explaining how computers worked how nimrod worked and advertising ferranti s other developments it explained that use of a game to demonstrate power of machine did not mean that it was meant for entertainment and compared mathematical underpinnings of nim with modeling economics of countries players of nimrod during festival included computer science pioneer alan turing although it was intended as a technology demonstration most of onlookers at festival of britain were more interested in playing game than in programming and engineering logic behind it bennett claimed that most of public were quite happy to gawk at flashing lights and be impressed bbc radio journalist paul jennings claimed that all of festival attendees came to a standstill upon reaching frightful tremendous gray refrigerator after festival nimrod was showcased for three weeks in october at berlin industrial show where it also drew crowds including west germany economics minister ludwig erhard afterwards however as it had served its purpose nimrod was dismantled as nimrod was not intended as an entertainment product it was not followed up by any future games and ferranti continued its work on designing general purpose computers nimrod was created only four years after 1947 invention of cathode ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game and one year after a similar purpose built game playing machine bertie brain first computer based game to feature a visual display of any sort nimrod is considered under some definitions one of first video games possibly second while definitions vary prior cathode ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game and while nimrod and bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer software based tic tac toe game oxo and a draughts program by christopher strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs references external links nimrod computer category 1951 video games category early british computers
