event show was reviewed by two contributors of canadian online explorer s slam sports jason clevett and kenai andrews with andrews providing a live attendance review clevett rated entire event a 3 out of 10 which was lower than 7 out of 10 given to 2007 edition by chris sokol 7 out of 10 was also given to 2009 edition by bob kapur bound for glory iv also received a 7 out of 10 by chris sokol and bryan sokol compared to rival world wrestling entertainment s wwe unforgiven ppv event on september 7 unforgiven performed better as it received a 7 out of 10 from matt bishop clevett also rated matches out of 10 with his highest rating going to ladder of love match which he gave an 8 out of 10 main event received a 6 out of 10 mixed martial arts bout was given a 0 out of 10 x division championship match got a 7 out of 10 while world tag team match received a 5 out of 10 thumb 250px right shiek abdul bashir s pictured entrance at no surrender received criticism in reviews of event alt daivari holding tna x division championship in front of a crowd overall clevett was disappointed by event making several comments regarding quality of show in his closing comments clevett wrote that he once considered himself a huge wrestling fan but shows like tonight make him question his dedication anymore before revealing that he wanted his money and three hours back when discussing a j styles versus frank trigg encounter clevett stated that chant this is b s should never ever be heard during an a j styles match man is far too talented to ever have fans react in such a manner however that is exactly what crowd at gm place in oshawa ontario chanted during his mma bout with frank trigg tna s pay per view debut in canada was one of weakest shows in recent memory overwhelmed by horrible overbooking by tna that once again proves that they do not know what their fanbase wants for x division championship contest clevett discussed various issues such as bashir s entrance music and match quality i watched this show with a friend who moved here from u s and we shared our disgust with bashir s theme music opening with sound of a plane crashing tna has probably lost a few viewers at that lame attempt to garner heat however he felt match was a highlight of show with some fast paced solid wrestling but that it lost a rating point for lousy finish he also believed ladder of love match was another highlight of show despite terrible angle that has surrounded feud between two over socal val he said two competitors busted their asses but that match should have been showcased in new jersey last month in front of lethal s hometown crowd at hard justice ppv event however he gave credit to two involved for coming up with some incredibly creative spots that got crowd to cheer and chant this is awesome despite ladder match genre having become rather tired and overdone regarding world tag team match clevett thought it should have been held off a month since it really doesn t mean much so soon after title change however he felt four men worked hard and it was a decent tag match but by this point show wasn t salvageable as for main event he commented that match itself was solid but felt like all three men were going through motions since three have wrestled each other so many times in past year it doesn t feel fresh or exciting he also said he could not remember many specifics of match and considering talent level that is surprising he also expressed his disappointment in finish that he tried to remember last time a tna main event ended without some kind of interference guitar shot or overbooking but he could not andrews discussed experience of witnessing show live along with crowd reaction during his review he did not give any event or match ratings but did provide comments on quality of event andrews mentioned that tna president dixie carter was present earnestly signed autographs and interacting with fans in pre amble which he said they seemed to love mingling with her and her eyes beamed when told slam wrestling was present covering show he stated crowd anticipation was decent with many fans looking forward to four ways to glory but wondering if booker t would show due to hurricane ike making landfall in houston texas booker s hometown with no announcement being made to arena crowd about booker t being there one way or another also that energy through most of show had an ordinary quality bobbing unevenly between good and bland sting s opening promo were greeted warmly and curry man s comical segments with christy hemme tickled crowd they also gushed over petey williams and his maple leaf muscle sic people and taylor wilde and jay lethal versus sonjay dutt ladder match andrews said crowd came alive and actively participated throughout those matches with energy level being high conversely he stated that odb and kong s match was a slow paced affair and beer money inc lax tag team title match was notable only for james storm and jacqueline s coherent performances given their injuries at tna london house show night before mixed martial arts bout annoyed action hungry fans not wanting to endure chess style patience that mma can be known for it was probably a harsh reaction as extremely small vocal minority thought mma choreography was well done mimicking a good blend of both men trying to impose their style on other ultimately that opinion was squashed symbolized by styles beating trigg with a kendo stick after match he felt that booker t s absence seemed to dampen any mystique four ways to glory had going for it with main event being lacklustre sic despite christian cage s entrance maintaining aura of grand spectacle everyone was hoping match would be he said it still a solid match put on by combatants but one that was very familiar prompting one fan to coin bout 3 hard way even jeff jarrett s run in couldn t get a notable rise out of crowd not bad and not great however he stated that it was hard to ignore grumblings about main event in tunnels and down athol st he concluded his review by writing that card from a ringside experience perspective was hurt by ordinary main event turning a possibly good and memorable show into an average one wade keller of pro wrestling torch newsletter rated matches out of five stars in his review of show for main event keller gave it 3 1 4 stars and said it was a good match and that booking made sense within tna s style but it s yet another example of a match ending only after obvious outside interference as for styles versus trigg bout keller did not give it a rating and did not comment on quality of match instead focused on feed interruption stating that brief image of naked women will be talked about for years as one of funniest blunders on pro wrestling ppv and not so funny for parents watching with their kids he gave world tag team championship match 1 1 4 stars calling it a basic match with nothing wrong with it despite being late it felt like a match to cool down crowd after ladder match with another finish that conditioned viewers to never consider a pinfall attempt a serious potential finish until there s some sort of interference such as powder from jackie this time ladder of love match was given 3 3 4 stars with keller saying it was a really good ladder match with competitors managing to really innovate and not rely on standard ladder spots we ve seen so often before but that finish made no sense that val would save lethal seconds before turning on him it s one of those things that s done for drama that doesn t seem least bit realistic lastly keller discussed x division championship match which he gave 2 1 2 stars and also commented on bashir s entrance music calling it among most promoting tactics in history believing it was beyond words how absolutely disgusting it is also saying that it is type of thing that should put a risk their deals with spike tv and it s that bad coming three days after anniversary makes it worse but it really isn t acceptable on any day aftermath thumb left 350px sting went on to win tna world heavyweight championship at bound for glory iv alt sting entering arena
