held up kampung boy as standard to which their country s animators should aspire and academics in cultural studies regarded series as a method of using modern technologies and cultural practices to preserve malaysian history origins in 1979 autobiographical graphic novel kampung boy was published story of a young malay boy s childhood in a kampung village proved to be a commercial and critical success establishing its author lat as most renowned cartoonist in malaysia kampung boys success prompted lat to consider using other media to reach out to masses seeds for animated adaptation of kampung boy were sown in 1993 in a conversation between lat and ananda krishman founder of measat broadcast network systems western and japanese cartoons flooded local television channels during 1990s and lat decried those productions for violence and jokes that he considered unsuitable for malaysia and its youths recognising that younger generation preferred colourful animations over static black and white drawings lat was keen for a local animated series to promote local values among malaysian children after krishnan s company offered lat financial support to start an animation project cartoonist began plans to adapt his trademark comic to television screen production lat imagined several stories he wished to see in animated form and then looked abroad for help producing them lacewood studio in ottawa canada was in charge of animating pilot episode world sports and entertainment of los angeles was involved as well norman singer organised production and gerald tripp helped lat to write script production was responsible for animating another five episodes however krishman and lat were disappointed with results which had taken two years of work to produce they thought pilot was slow moving lat believed lacewood had accommodated him too often during production accepting his input without question they failed to inform him that although a slow pace worked for static cartoon drawings a good animation was often lively fast moving full of action and fantasy in 1995 lat and krishman engaged matinee entertainment to complete project and lat started to fly back and forth between kuala lumpur and los angeles to work closely with matinee s employees his experience with matinee s team of writers and animators was positive they were more proactive than lacewood s brainstorming his ideas and turning them into viable scripts and storyboards director frank saperstein performed final edit polishing up scripts lat however had final say with regards to cultural depictions overriding several suggestions such as characters kissing in front of others and use of western street slang as these were unpalatable to malaysian public he also enforced accuracy in depictions of objects such as bullock carts noting that american artists thought malaysian carts were identical to their mexican counterparts storyboards were translated into animations by philippine animation studios incorporated in manila lat again took several trips this time to philippines to advise animators and ensure that everything was depicted accurately once animation had been completed prints were sent to vietnam for processing finally films were delivered to krishnan s studio in kuala lumpur for voice recording in english and bahasa malaysia like lat saperstein flew back and forth among involved countries to coordinate efforts and make sure production standards never dropped saperstein s efforts for his first 12 episodes were enough to convince lat to continue working with matinee for project entire project took four years to complete each episode cost approximately 350 000 united states dollars approximately 1 million malaysian ringgit partly funded by measat and took four to five months to produce pilot was shown over tv1 on 10 february 1997 and series began its broadcast over astro ria two and a half years later kinder channel germany and teletoon canada broadcast series after buying rights through london based distributor and series has been broadcast in more than 60 countries since its first airing in malaysia measat expected to recover their investment in approximately 10 years although kampung boy originated in malaysia most of its production took place abroad it was local in concept but could be construed as a foreign production in terms of animation this led to laments that had malaysian studios been hired to participate in animation work country s industry would have benefited by learning from foreign animation expertise and methodology characters protagonist of series is a nine year old boy named mat who typically wears a sarong and a white singlet sporting a broad nose small eyes and untidy black hair short and rounded boy resembles his creator lat as a child mat has a younger sister ana and they live in a house with their father and mother yap and yah respectively their nuclear family structure is predominant in village yap s mother opah does not live with them but is often seen in their house also frequently appearing are mat s buddies bo and tak whose names are components of malay word botak bald two are styled after comic characters of traditional wayang kulit shadow play bo is more intelligent of pair while tak has a tendency to be a show off other supporting characters include normah a girl formerly from city and mrs hew mat s teacher malay and english voices of characters were dubbed by malaysian voice actors child actors were employed for younger roles however mat ana bo and tak were voiced by actors who were in their early twenties certain actors had task of voicing multiple roles for example voice director was responsible for speaking roles of mrs hew and yah initially voice talents were hired in los angeles to dub english version but they kept slipping into a jamaican accent although this soundtrack was not used in series producers felt it was too funny to waste and included it in making of kampung boy which was broadcast a week before start of series setting whereas kampung boy comic book was based on life in 1950s its animation spin off was set in 1990s although scenery and details are exaggerated animation is accurate in its depiction of malaysian village and life of its inhabitants dr rohani hashim of universiti sains malaysia s school of communication called series a detailed recreation of a rural malay childhood layout of mat s village and style of its houses are patterned after those in rural areas of perak malaysia clusters of houses line a river which provides water for villagers needs children play in surrounding jungle while adults toil in fields and commute to city to work saperstein directed use of warm and soft colours in series this colour scheme was modelled after that of winnie pooh bestowing a soft cuddly feel according to far eastern economic review journalist s to animation much of show s visuals followed lat s art style outlines are drawn in bold manner making objects stand out from background an effect particularly aided by rich use of brown green and yellow as primary colours last two colours are heavily used in depictions of nature contrasting well with each other and separating background from middle ground aside from being main colour for houses brown is used as skin tone of characters drawn with short and round shapes mat and his fellow malays are highlighted with bright colours themes and hallmarks kampung boys episodes follow a structure reminiscent of hollywood cartoons each episode contains two separate stories whose themes interweave each other as show switches between scenes of two stories by end of episode two threads are resolved by a common idea generally one story focuses on kampung children and other on adults creators of kampung boy refrained from copying ideas commonly found in western and japanese cartoons other malaysian animations produced since 1990s have not been as meticulously faithful to portraying images and themes familiar to locals for example sang 1996 protagonist bears a striking resemblance to doraemon and bear and bee in dan 2002 play out antics similar to those of tom and jerry lat s close involvement with project kept its portrayals faithful to malaysian culture kampung life in animation features true blue malaysian elements such as supernatural superstitions or female vampires monkeys trained to pluck coconuts and traditions that are forgotten in transition from rural to urban living cartoon series explores ideas through activities of characters especially their interactions with one another rohani classified genre of show as comedy drama according to her main theme in kampung boy is nostalgia carrying lat s intention to portray rural childhood as a much more interesting and creative experience than growing up in an urban environment several episodes champion kampung way of life in antara between champions or friends mat and his friends defeat a city football soccer team because of their toughness bred from doing hard work in village manusia smart like a flying fox suggests that unpolluted environment of kampung promotes upbringing of a healthier and more intelligent child normah arrives from city in mat main wayang shadow knows and although she disdains kampung initially she is won over by villagers tenderness toward her intrusion of modern technology and attitudes into this idyllic kampung way of life is also a main topic in series several episodes introduce electrical appliances and ideas associated with urban lifestyles to villagers for example convenience of motor cars versus traditional use of bullock carts is debated by characters in naik keretaku dad s driving test despite show s support of kampung lifestyle it portrays aspects of modern living in a positive light as well opah an old woman is depicted as a capable modern woman proficient in driving a van and fixing televisions city is characterized as a gateway to a range of cultures and ideas that are not found in a malaysian rural village as illustrated in encounter and formation of a friendship between mat and a chinese boy in naik keretaku series also explores changes in malaysian rural society that had taken place during 1950s to 1990s for example through flashbacks yah kami gone with kahwin displays traditional marriage customs that are no longer practiced by urban dwellers family ties are shown to be strong in rural community family members show close attention and concern to one another conversely those who immersed themselves in city life are depicted to have lost their communal bonds although mat s family is depicted to follow rules of malay patriarchal society modern values are in its portrayal yap does not leave responsibilities of child rearing all to yah he takes care of ana while she watches over mat although series presents female characters as housewives it makes point in nasib si gadis desa it s a girl s life that traditional family role of malay woman is as equal and valuable as man s episode also mentions achievements of women in careers such as space exploration and science overall rohani said lat s cartoon series was subtly recording a story of rapidly vanishing malay tradition and innocence while advising viewers to consider societal changes around them according to her cartoonist s concern was to inspire audience to consider pace of urbanisation and to realise that adoption or rejection of new values is a common decision by them show in her opinion suggests that changes should be carefully examined and adopted only if beneficial to society furthermore adoption of new ideas and culture should be a gradual process and changes tailored accordingly to society reception legacy and achievements kampung boy was submitted to 1999 annecy international animated film festival in france one of its episodes oh tok won best animation for a television series of 13 minutes and more episode was about a spooky banyan tree that became object of mat s fear because of local contents in animation and nostalgic appeal of kampung lifestyle malaysian comics scholar expected success for kampung boy in his country 26 episode series was popular with young and received positive reviews for technical details and content it has also attracted criticism for similarities to united states cartoon series simpsons audiences noticed that mat s malaysian family was similar in several ways to bart simpson s dysfunctional american family similarly some critics pointed out that english spoken in kampung boy is substantially different from malaysian english which is heavily influenced by british english reporter daryl goh perceived an american accent to english language voices lat explained that producers had to tone down use of traditional malay customs locales and language to market series to a wider global audience rohani found decision regrettable it made animation less than an authentic malay product animation was regarded by dr paulette dellios of bond university s school of humanities and social sciences as a cultural artefact a reminder and preservation of a country s old way of life created and produced by an international team and displayed via modern technologies to world according to rohani kampung boy was a record of malay traditions and transitions experienced by rural community during 1950s to 1990s among several malaysian animations that used local settings lat s series was in veteran film director hassan abdul s view best in portraying country s culture and traditions hassan also said that success in marketing series overseas made kampung boy benchmark for malaysia s animation industry references
