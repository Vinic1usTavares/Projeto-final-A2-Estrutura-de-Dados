human brain is central organ of human nervous system and with spinal cord makes up central nervous system brain consists of cerebrum brainstem and cerebellum it controls most of activities of body processing integrating and coordinating information it receives from sense organs and making decisions as to instructions sent to rest of body brain is contained in and protected by skull bones of head cerebrum is largest part of human brain it is divided into two cerebral hemispheres cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter covering core of white matter cortex is split into neocortex and much smaller allocortex neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers while allocortex has three or four each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes frontal temporal parietal and occipital lobes frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self control planning reasoning and abstract thought while occipital lobe is dedicated to vision within each lobe cortical areas are associated with specific functions such as sensory motor and association regions although left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function some functions are associated with one side such as language in left and visual spatial ability in right hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts largest being corpus callosum cerebrum is connected by brainstem to spinal cord brainstem consists of midbrain pons and medulla oblongata cerebellum is connected to brainstem by pairs of tracts within cerebrum is ventricular system consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated underneath cerebral cortex are several important structures including thalamus pineal gland hypothalamus pituitary gland and limbic structures including amygdala and hippocampus claustrum various nuclei of basal ganglia basal forebrain structures and three circumventricular organs cells of brain include neurons and supportive glial cells there are more than 86 billion neurons in brain and a more or less equal number of other cells brain activity is made possible by interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses neurons connect to form neural pathways neural circuits and elaborate network systems whole circuitry is driven by process of neurotransmission brain is protected by skull suspended in cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from bloodstream by blood brain barrier however brain is still susceptible to damage disease and infection damage can be caused by trauma or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders such as parkinson s disease including alzheimer s disease and multiple sclerosis psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia and clinical depression are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions brain can also be site of tumours both benign and malignant these mostly originate from other sites in body study of anatomy of brain is neuroanatomy while study of its function is neuroscience a number of techniques are used to study brain specimens from other animals which may be examined microscopically have traditionally provided much information medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography eeg recordings are important in studying brain medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into function of each part of brain brain research has evolved over time with philosophical experimental and theoretical phases next phase has been predicted to be one of simulating brain activity in culture philosophy of mind has for centuries attempted to address question of nature of consciousness and mind body problem pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise personality attributes to regions of cortex in 19th century in science fiction brain transplants are imagined in tales such as 1942 donovan s brain structure thumb human brain sagittal section gross anatomy adult human brain weighs on average about which is about 2 of total body weight with a volume of around 1260 cm3 in men and 1130 cm3 in women there is substantial individual variation with standard reference range for men being and for women neurological differences between sexes have not been shown to correlate in any simple way with iq or other measures of cognitive performance cerebrum consisting of cerebral hemispheres forms largest part of brain and overlies other brain structures outer region of hemispheres cerebral cortex is grey matter consisting of cortical layers of neurons each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe and occipital lobe three other lobes are included by some sources which are a central lobe a limbic lobe and an insular lobe central lobe comprises gyrus and gyrus and is included since it forms a distinct functional role brainstem resembling a stalk attaches to and leaves cerebrum at start of midbrain area brainstem includes midbrain pons and medulla oblongata behind brainstem is cerebellum cerebrum brainstem cerebellum and spinal cord are covered by three membranes called meninges membranes are tough dura mater middle arachnoid mater and more delicate inner pia mater between arachnoid mater and pia mater is subarachnoid space and subarachnoid cisterns which contain cerebrospinal fluid outermost membrane of cerebral cortex is basement membrane of pia mater called glia limitans and is an important part of blood brain barrier living brain is very soft having a gel like consistency similar to soft tofu cortical layers of neurons constitute much of cerebral grey matter while deeper subcortical regions of myelinated axons make up white matter white matter of brain makes up about half of total brain volume cerebrum thumb major gyri and sulci on lateral surface of cortex thumb lobes of brain cerebrum is largest part of brain and is divided into nearly symmetrical left and right hemispheres by a deep groove longitudinal fissure asymmetry between lobes is noted as a hemispheres are connected by five that span longitudinal fissure largest of these is corpus callosum each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four main lobes frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe and occipital lobe named according to skull bones that overlie them each lobe is associated with one or two specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them surface of brain is folded into ridges gyri and grooves sulci many of which are named usually according to their position such as frontal gyrus of frontal lobe or central sulcus separating central regions of hemispheres there are many small variations in secondary and tertiary folds outer part of cerebrum is cerebral cortex made up of grey matter arranged in layers it is thick and deeply folded to give a convoluted appearance beneath cortex is cerebral white matter largest part of cerebral cortex is neocortex which has six neuronal layers rest of cortex is of allocortex which has three or four layers cortex is mapped by divisions into about fifty different functional areas known as brodmann s areas these areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope cortex is divided into two main functional areas a motor cortex and a sensory cortex primary motor cortex which sends axons down to motor neurons in brainstem and spinal cord occupies rear portion of frontal lobe directly in front of somatosensory area primary sensory areas receive signals from sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in thalamus primary sensory areas include visual cortex of occipital lobe auditory cortex in parts of temporal lobe and insular cortex and somatosensory cortex in parietal lobe remaining parts of cortex are called association areas these areas receive input from sensory areas and lower parts of brain and are involved in complex cognitive processes of perception thought and decision making principles of anatomy and physiology 12th edition page 519 main functions of frontal lobe are to control attention abstract thinking behaviour problem solving tasks and physical reactions and personality occipital lobe is smallest lobe its main functions are visual reception visual spatial processing movement and colour recognition there is a smaller occipital lobule in lobe known as temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories language and some hearing and speech thumb upright cortical folds and white matter in horizontal bisection of head cerebrum contains ventricles where cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated below corpus callosum is septum a membrane that separates lateral ventricles beneath lateral ventricles is thalamus and to front and below this is hypothalamus hypothalamus leads on to pituitary gland at back of thalamus is brainstem basal ganglia also called basal nuclei are a set of structures deep within hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation largest component is striatum others are globus pallidus substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus part of dorsal striatum putamen and globus pallidus lie separated from lateral ventricles and thalamus by internal capsule whereas caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts lateral ventricles on their outer sides at deepest part of lateral sulcus between insular cortex and striatum is a thin neuronal sheet called claustrum below and in front of striatum are a number of basal forebrain structures these include nucleus accumbens nucleus basalis diagonal band of broca substantia and medial septal nucleus these structures are important in producing neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is then distributed widely throughout brain basal forebrain in particular nucleus basalis is considered to be major cholinergic output of central nervous system to striatum and neocortex cerebellum thumb upright human brain viewed from below showing cerebellum and brainstem cerebellum is divided into an anterior lobe a posterior lobe and flocculonodular lobe anterior and posterior lobes are connected in middle by vermis compared to cerebral cortex cerebellum has a much thinner outer cortex that is narrowly furrowed into numerous curved transverse fissures viewed from underneath between two lobes is third lobe flocculonodular lobe cerebellum rests at back of cranial cavity lying beneath occipital lobes and is separated from these by cerebellar tentorium a sheet of fibre it is connected to midbrain of brainstem by superior cerebellar peduncles to pons by middle cerebellar peduncles and to medulla by inferior cerebellar peduncles cerebellum consists of an inner medulla of white matter and an outer cortex of richly folded grey matter cerebellum s anterior and posterior lobes appear to play a role in coordination and smoothing of complex motor movements and flocculonodular lobe in maintenance of balance although debate exists as to its cognitive behavioural and motor functions brainstem brainstem lies beneath cerebrum and consists of midbrain pons and medulla it lies in back part of skull resting on part of base known as and ends at foramen magnum a large opening in occipital bone brainstem continues below this as spinal cord protected by vertebral column ten of twelve pairs of cranial nerves emerge directly from brainstem brainstem also contains many cranial nerve nuclei and nuclei of peripheral nerves as well as nuclei involved in regulation of many essential processes including breathing control of eye movements and balance reticular formation a network of nuclei of ill defined formation is present within and along length of brainstem many nerve tracts which transmit information to and from cerebral cortex to rest of body pass through brainstem microanatomy human brain is primarily composed of neurons glial cells neural stem cells and blood vessels types of neuron include interneurons pyramidal cells including betz cells motor neurons upper and lower motor neurons and cerebellar purkinje cells betz cells are largest cells by size of cell body in nervous system adult human brain is estimated to contain 86 8 billion neurons with a roughly equal number 85 10 billion of non neuronal cells out of these neurons 16 billion 19 are located in cerebral cortex and 69 billion 80 are in cerebellum types of glial cell are astrocytes including bergmann glia oligodendrocytes ependymal cells including radial glial cells microglia and a subtype of progenitor cells astrocytes are largest of glial cells they are stellate cells with many processes radiating from their cell bodies some of these processes end as perivascular end feet on capillary walls glia limitans of cortex is made up of astrocyte foot processes that serve in part to contain cells of brain mast cells are white blood cells that interact in neuroimmune system in brain mast cells in central nervous system are present in a number of structures including meninges they mediate neuroimmune responses in inflammatory conditions and help to maintain blood brain barrier particularly in brain regions where barrier is absent mast cells serve same general functions in body and central nervous system such as effecting or regulating allergic responses innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation mast cells serve as main effector cell through which pathogens can affect biochemical signaling that takes place between gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system some 400 genes are shown to be brain specific in all neurons is expressed and in pyramidal neurons and are also expressed essential for biosynthesis of neurotransmitter gaba is expressed in interneurons proteins expressed in glial cells are astrocyte markers gfap and myelin basic protein and transcription factor are expressed in oligodendrocytes cerebrospinal fluid thumb cerebrospinal fluid circulates in spaces around and within brain cerebrospinal fluid is a clear colourless fluid that circulates around brain in subarachnoid space in ventricular system and in central canal of spinal cord it also fills some gaps in subarachnoid space known as subarachnoid cisterns four ventricles two lateral a third and a fourth ventricle all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid third ventricle lies in midline and is connected to lateral ventricles a single duct cerebral aqueduct between pons and cerebellum connects third ventricle to fourth ventricle three separate openings middle and two lateral apertures drain cerebrospinal fluid from fourth ventricle to cisterna magna one of major cisterns from here cerebrospinal fluid circulates around brain and spinal cord in subarachnoid space between arachnoid mater and pia mater at any one time there is about of cerebrospinal fluid most within subarachnoid space it is constantly being regenerated and absorbed and is replaced about once every 5 6 hours a glymphatic system has been described as lymphatic drainage system of brain brain wide glymphatic pathway includes drainage routes from cerebrospinal fluid and from meningeal lymphatic vessels that are associated with dural sinuses and run alongside cerebral blood vessels pathway drains interstitial fluid from tissue of brain blood supply thumb upright two circulations joining at circle of willis thumb diagram showing features of cerebral outer membranes and supply of blood vessels internal carotid arteries supply oxygenated blood to front of brain and vertebral arteries supply blood to back of brain these two circulations join together in circle of willis a ring of connected arteries that lies in cistern between midbrain and pons internal carotid arteries are branches of common carotid arteries they enter cranium through carotid canal travel through cavernous sinus and enter subarachnoid space they then enter circle of willis with two branches anterior cerebral arteries emerging these branches travel forward and then upward along longitudinal fissure and supply front and midline parts of brain one or more small anterior communicating arteries join two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches internal carotid arteries continue forward as middle cerebral arteries they travel sideways along sphenoid bone of eye socket then upwards through insula cortex where final branches arise middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length vertebral arteries emerge as branches of left and right subclavian arteries they travel upward through transverse foramina which are spaces in cervical vertebrae each side enters cranial cavity through foramen magnum along corresponding side of medulla they give off one of three cerebellar branches vertebral arteries join in front of middle part of medulla to form larger basilar artery which sends multiple branches to supply medulla and pons and two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches finally basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries these travel outwards around superior cerebellar peduncles and along top of cerebellar tentorium where it sends branches to supply temporal and occipital lobes each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with internal carotid arteries blood drainage cerebral veins drain deoxygenated blood from brain brain has two main networks of veins an exterior or superficial network on surface of cerebrum that has three branches and an interior network these two networks communicate via anastomosing joining veins veins of brain drain into larger cavities of dural venous sinuses usually situated between dura mater and covering of skull blood from cerebellum and midbrain drains into great cerebral vein blood from medulla and pons of brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage either into spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins blood in deep part of brain drains through a venous plexus into cavernous sinus at front and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at sides and inferior sagittal sinus at back blood drains from outer brain into large superior sagittal sinus which rests in midline on top of brain blood from here joins with blood from straight sinus at confluence of sinuses blood from here drains into left and right transverse sinuses these then drain into sigmoid sinuses which receive blood from cavernous sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses sigmoid drains into large internal jugular veins blood brain barrier larger arteries throughout brain supply blood to smaller capillaries these smallest of blood vessels in brain are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to same degree as they do in other capillaries thereby creating blood brain barrier play a major role in formation of tight junctions barrier is less permeable to larger molecules but is still permeable to water carbon dioxide oxygen and most fat soluble substances including anaesthetics and alcohol blood brain barrier is not present in circumventricular are structures in brain that may need to respond to changes in body as pineal gland area and some areas of hypothalamus there is a similar blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier which serves same purpose as blood brain barrier but facilitates transport of different substances into brain due to distinct structural characteristics between two barrier systems development thumb neurulation and neural crest cells thumb alt simple drawing of lateral view of three primary vesicle stage of three to four week old embryo shown in different colors and five secondary vesicle stage of five week old embryo shown in different colors and a lateral view of this primary and secondary vesicle stages of development in early embryo to fifth week thumb alt very simple drawing of front end of a human embryo showing each vesicle of developing brain in a different color brain of a human embryo in sixth week of development at beginning of third week of development embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called neural plate by fourth week of development neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end these swellings are known as primary brain vesicles and represent beginnings of forebrain midbrain and hindbrain neural crest cells derived from ectoderm populate lateral edges of plate at neural folds in fourth neurulation neural folds close to form neural tube bringing together neural crest cells at neural crest neural crest runs length of tube with cranial neural crest cells at cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at tail cells detach from crest and migrate in a head to tail wave inside tube cells at cephalic end give rise to brain and cells at caudal end give rise to spinal cord tube flexes as it grows forming crescent shaped cerebral hemispheres at head cerebral hemispheres first appear on day 32 early in fourth week cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure this flexed part becomes forebrain prosencephalon adjoining curving part becomes midbrain mesencephalon and part caudal to flexure becomes hindbrain rhombencephalon these areas are formed as swellings known as three primary brain vesicles in fifth week of development five secondary brain vesicles have formed forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon telencephalon gives rise to cerebral cortex basal ganglia and related structures diencephalon gives rise to thalamus and hypothalamus hindbrain also splits into two areas metencephalon and myelencephalon metencephalon gives rise to cerebellum and pons myelencephalon gives rise to medulla oblongata also during fifth week brain divides into repeating segments called in hindbrain these are known as a characteristic of brain is cortical folding known as gyrification for just over five months of prenatal development cortex is smooth by gestational age of 24 weeks wrinkled morphology showing fissures that begin to mark out lobes of brain is evident why cortex wrinkles and folds is not well understood but gyrification has been linked to intelligence and neurological disorders and a number of gyrification theories have been proposed these theories include those based on mechanical buckling axonal tension and differential tangential expansion what is clear is that gyrification is not a random process but rather a complex developmentally predetermined process which generates patterns of folds that are consistent between individuals and most species first groove to appear in fourth month is lateral cerebral fossa expanding caudal end of hemisphere has to curve over in a forward direction to fit into restricted space this covers fossa and turns it into a much deeper ridge known as lateral sulcus and this marks out temporal lobe by sixth month other sulci have formed that demarcate frontal parietal and occipital lobes a gene present in human genome may play a major role in gyrification and encephalisation function thumb motor and sensory regions of brain motor control frontal lobe is involved in reasoning motor control emotion and language it contains motor cortex which is involved in planning and coordinating movement prefrontal cortex which is responsible for higher level cognitive functioning and broca s area which is essential for language production motor system of brain is responsible for generation and control of movement generated movements pass from brain through nerves to motor neurons in body which control action of muscles corticospinal tract carries movements from brain through spinal cord to torso and limbs cranial nerves carry movements related to eyes mouth and face gross movement such as locomotion and movement of arms and legs is generated in motor cortex divided into three parts primary motor cortex found in prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to movement of different body parts these movements are supported and regulated by two other areas lying anterior to primary motor cortex premotor area and supplementary motor area hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts allowing finer movement this has been visualised in a motor homunculus impulses generated from motor cortex travel along corticospinal tract along front of medulla and cross over at medullary pyramids these then travel down spinal cord with most connecting to interneurons in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within grey matter that then transmit impulse to move to muscles themselves cerebellum and basal ganglia play a role in fine complex and coordinated muscle movements connections between cortex and basal ganglia control muscle tone posture and movement initiation and are referred to as extrapyramidal system sensory thumb cortical areas thumb upright routing of neural signals from two eyes to brain sensory nervous system is involved with reception and processing of sensory information this information is received through cranial nerves through tracts in spinal cord and directly at centres of brain exposed to blood brain also receives and interprets information from special senses of vision smell hearing and taste mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated from skin brain receives information about fine touch pressure pain vibration and temperature from joints brain receives information about joint position sensory cortex is found just near motor cortex and like motor cortex has areas related to sensation from different body parts sensation collected by a sensory receptor on skin is changed to a nerve signal that is passed up a series of neurons through tracts in spinal cord dorsal column medial pathway contains information about fine touch vibration and position of joints pathway fibers travel up back part of spinal cord to back part of medulla where they connect with second order neurons that immediately send fibers across midline these fibers then travel upwards into ventrobasal complex in thalamus where they connect with third order neurons which send fibers up to sensory cortex tract carries information about pain temperature and gross touch pathway fibers travel up spinal cord and connect with second order neurons in reticular formation of brainstem for pain and temperature and also terminate at ventrobasal complex of for gross touch vision is generated by light that hits retina of eye photoreceptors in retina sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that is sent to visual cortex in occipital lobe visual signals leave retinas through optic nerves optic nerve fibers from retinas nasal halves cross to opposite sides joining fibers from temporal halves of opposite retinas to form optic tracts arrangements of eyes optics and visual pathways mean vision from left visual field is received by right half of each retina is processed by right visual cortex and vice versa optic tract fibers reach brain at lateral geniculate nucleus and travel through optic radiation to reach visual cortex hearing and balance are both generated in inner ear sound results in vibrations of ossicles which continue finally to hearing organ and change in balance results in movement of liquids within inner ear this creates a nerve signal that passes through vestibulocochlear nerve from here it passes through to cochlear nuclei superior nucleus medial geniculate nucleus and finally auditory radiation to auditory cortex sense of smell is generated by receptor cells in epithelium of olfactory mucosa in nasal cavity this information passes via olfactory nerve which goes into skull through a relatively permeable part this nerve transmits to neural circuitry of olfactory bulb from where information is passed to olfactory cortex taste is generated from receptors on tongue and passed along facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into solitary nucleus in brainstem some taste information is also passed from pharynx into this area via vagus nerve information is then passed from here through thalamus into gustatory cortex regulation autonomic functions of brain include regulation or rhythmic control of heart rate and rate of breathing and maintaining homeostasis blood pressure and heart rate are influenced by vasomotor centre of medulla which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest it does this by influencing sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via vagus nerve information about blood pressure is generated by in aortic bodies in aortic arch and passed to brain along afferent fibres of vagus nerve information about pressure changes in carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with glossopharyngeal nerve this information travels up to solitary nucleus in medulla signals from here influence vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly brain controls rate of breathing mainly by respiratory centres in medulla and pons respiratory centres control respiration by generating motor signals that are passed down spinal cord along nerve to diaphragm and other muscles of respiration this is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to centres there are four respiratory centres three with a more clearly defined function and an apneustic centre with a less clear function in medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from body also in medulla ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion in pons centre influences duration of each breath and apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and ph information about blood oxygen carbon dioxide and ph levels are also sensed on walls of arteries in peripheral chemoreceptors of aortic and carotid bodies this information is passed via vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to respiratory centres high carbon dioxide an acidic ph or low oxygen stimulate respiratory centres desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in lungs which when activated prevent lungs from by transmitting information to respiratory centres via vagus nerve hypothalamus in diencephalon is involved in regulating many functions of body functions include neuroendocrine regulation regulation of circadian rhythm control of autonomic nervous system and regulation of fluid and food intake circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in hypothalamus anterior hypothalamus includes suprachiasmatic nucleus and nucleus which through gene expression cycles generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock in circadian day an rhythm takes control of sleeping pattern sleep is an essential requirement for body and brain and allows closing down and resting of body s systems there are also findings that suggest that daily build up of toxins in brain are removed during sleep whilst awake brain consumes a fifth of body s total energy needs sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for restoration of energy giving atp effects of sleep deprivation show absolute need for sleep lateral hypothalamus contains neurons that control appetite and arousal through their projections to ascending reticular activating system hypothalamus controls pituitary gland through release of peptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin as well as dopamine into median eminence through autonomic projections hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure heart rate breathing sweating and other homeostatic mechanisms hypothalamus also plays a role in thermal regulation and when stimulated by immune system is capable of generating a fever hypothalamus is influenced by kidneys when blood pressure falls released by kidneys stimulates a need to drink hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals and hormone release by digestive system language thumb broca s area and wernicke s area are linked by arcuate fasciculus while language functions were traditionally thought to be localized to wernicke s area and broca s area it is now mostly accepted that a wider network of cortical regions contributes to language functions study on how language is represented processed and acquired by brain is called which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics lateralisation cerebrum has a contralateral organisation with each hemisphere of brain interacting primarily with one half of body left side of brain interacts with right side of body and vice versa developmental cause for this is uncertain motor connections from brain to spinal cord and sensory connections from spinal cord to brain both cross sides in brainstem visual input follows a more complex rule optic nerves from two eyes come together at a point called optic chiasm and half of fibres from each nerve split off to join other result is that connections from left half of retina in both eyes go to left side of brain whereas connections from right half of retina go to right side of brain because each half of retina receives light coming from opposite half of visual field functional consequence is that visual input from left side of world goes to right side of brain and vice versa thus right side of brain receives somatosensory input from left side of body and visual input from left side of visual field left and right sides of brain appear symmetrical but they function asymmetrically for example counterpart of left hemisphere motor area controlling right hand is right hemisphere area controlling left hand there are however several important exceptions involving language and spatial cognition left frontal lobe is dominant for language if a key language area in left hemisphere is damaged it can leave victim unable to speak or understand whereas equivalent damage to right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills a substantial part of current understanding of interactions between two hemispheres has come from study of split brain patients people who underwent surgical of corpus callosum in an attempt to reduce severity of epileptic seizures these patients do not show unusual behaviour that is immediately obvious but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in same body with right hand taking an action and then left hand undoing it these patients when briefly shown a picture on right side of point of visual fixation are able to describe it verbally but when picture is shown on left are unable to describe it but may be able to give an indication with left hand of nature of object shown emotion emotions are generally defined as two step processes involving followed by psychological feelings appraisal expression autonomic responses and action tendencies attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial some research found no evidence for specific locations corresponding to emotions but instead found circuitry involved in general emotional processes amygdala orbitofrontal cortex mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex appeared to be involved in generating emotions while weaker evidence was found for ventral tegmental area ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience others however have found evidence of activation of specific regions such as basal ganglia in happiness cingulate cortex in sadness and amygdala in fear cognition brain is responsible for cognition which functions through numerous processes and executive functions figure 4 executive functions and related terms executive functions include ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory ability to think about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control and ability to determine relevance of information or appropriateness of an action higher order executive functions require simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions and include planning and fluid intelligence i e reasoning and problem solving prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in mediating executive functions planning involves activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc anterior cingulate cortex angular prefrontal cortex right prefrontal cortex and gyrus working memory manipulation involves dlpfc inferior frontal gyrus and areas of parietal cortex inhibitory control involves multiple areas of prefrontal cortex as well as caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus physiology neurotransmission brain activity is made possible by interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets a neuron consists of a cell body axon and dendrites dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in form of signals from axon terminals of other neurons signals received may cause neuron to initiate an action potential an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse which is sent along its axon to axon terminal to connect with dendrites or with cell body of another neuron an action potential is initiated at initial segment of an axon which contains a specialized complex of proteins when an action potential reaches axon terminal it triggers release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on target cell these chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine serotonin gaba glutamate and acetylcholine gaba is major inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain and glutamate is major excitatory neurotransmitter neurons link at synapses to form neural pathways neural circuits and large elaborate network systems such as salience network and default mode network and activity between them is driven by process of neurotransmission metabolism thumb upright alt a flat oval object is surrounded by blue object is largely green yellow but contains a dark red patch at one end and a number of blue patches pet image of human brain showing energy consumption brain consumes up to 20 of energy used by human body more than any other organ in humans blood glucose is primary source of energy for most cells and is critical for normal function in a number of tissues including brain human brain consumes approximately 60 of blood glucose in fasted sedentary individuals brain metabolism normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source but during times of low glucose such as fasting endurance exercise or limited carbohydrate intake brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose brain can also utilize lactate during exercise brain stores glucose in form of glycogen albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in liver or skeletal muscle long chain fatty acids cannot cross blood brain barrier but liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies however short chain fatty acids e g butyric acid propionic acid and acetic acid and medium chain fatty acids acid and heptanoic acid can cross blood brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells although human brain represents only 2 of body weight it receives 15 of cardiac output 20 of total body oxygen consumption and 25 of total body glucose utilization brain mostly uses glucose for energy and deprivation of glucose as can happen in hypoglycemia can result in loss of consciousness energy consumption of brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this fact forms basis for functional brain imaging methods pet and fmri these functional imaging techniques provide a three dimensional image of metabolic activity function of sleep is not fully understood however there is evidence that sleep enhances clearance of metabolic waste products some of which are potentially neurotoxic from brain and may also permit repair evidence suggests that increased clearance of metabolic waste during sleep occurs via increased functioning of glymphatic system sleep may also have an effect on cognitive function by weakening unnecessary connections research brain is not fully understood and research is ongoing neuroscientists along with researchers from allied disciplines study how human brain works boundaries between specialties of neuroscience neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience neuroscience research has expanded considerably in recent decades decade of brain an initiative of united states government in 1990s is considered to have marked much of this increase in research and was followed in 2013 by brain initiative human connectome project was a five year study launched in 2009 to analyse anatomical and functional connections of parts of brain and has provided much data methods information about structure and function of human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods including animals and humans information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about function of parts of brain and effects of brain damage neuroimaging is used to visualise brain and record brain activity electrophysiology is used to measure record and monitor electrical activity of cortex measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas or of activity of a single neuron an electroencephalogram can record electrical activity of cortex using electrodes placed non on scalp invasive measures include electrocorticography which uses electrodes placed directly on exposed surface of brain this method is used in cortical stimulation mapping used in study of relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function by using much smaller single unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution this has enabled linking of brain activity to behaviour and creation of neuronal maps development of cerebral has opened ways for studying growth of brain and of cortex and for understanding disease development offering further implications for therapeutic applications imaging functional neuroimaging techniques show changes in brain activity that relate to function of specific brain areas one technique is functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri which has advantages over earlier methods of spect and pet of not needing use of radioactive materials and of offering a higher resolution another technique is functional near infrared spectroscopy these methods rely on response that shows changes in brain activity in relation to changes in blood flow useful in mapping functions to brain areas resting state fmri looks at interaction of brain regions whilst brain is not performing a specific task this is also used to show default mode network any electrical current generates a magnetic field neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields and in functional magnetoencephalography current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution uses mri and image analysis to create 3d images of nerve tracts of brain give a graphical representation of neural connections of brain differences in brain structure can be measured in some disorders notably schizophrenia and dementia different biological approaches using imaging have given more insight for example into disorders of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder a key source of information about function of brain regions is effects of damage to them advances in neuroimaging have enabled objective insights into mental disorders leading to faster diagnosis more accurate prognosis and better monitoring gene and protein expression bioinformatics is a field of study that includes creation and advancement of databases and computational and statistical techniques that can be used in studies of human brain particularly in areas of gene and protein expression bioinformatics and studies in genomics and functional genomics generated need for dna annotation a transcriptome technology identifying genes their locations and functions is a major database as of 2017 just under 20 000 protein coding genes are seen to be expressed in human and some 400 of these genes are brain specific data that has been provided on gene expression in brain has fuelled further research into a number of disorders long term use of alcohol for example has shown altered gene expression in brain and cell type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder these changes have been noted in synaptic transcriptome in prefrontal cortex and are seen as a factor causing drive to alcohol dependence and also to other substance abuses other related studies have also shown evidence of synaptic alterations and their loss in ageing brain changes in gene expression alter levels of proteins in various neural pathways and this has been shown to be evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss this dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission and subsequent cognitive decline and disease clinical significance injury injury to brain can manifest in many ways traumatic brain injury for example received in contact sport after a fall or a traffic or work accident can be associated with both immediate and longer term problems immediate problems may include bleeding within brain this may compress brain tissue or damage its blood supply bruising to brain may occur bruising may cause widespread damage to nerve tracts that can lead to a condition of diffuse axonal injury a fractured skull injury to a particular area deafness and concussion are also possible immediate developments in addition to site of injury opposite side of brain may be affected termed a contrecoup injury longer term issues that may develop include posttraumatic stress disorder and hydrocephalus chronic traumatic encephalopathy can develop following multiple head injuries disease neurodegenerative diseases result in progressive damage to different parts of brain s function and worsen with age common examples include dementia such as alzheimer s disease alcoholic dementia or vascular dementia parkinson s disease and other rarer infectious genetic or metabolic causes such as huntington s disease motor neuron diseases hiv dementia syphilis related dementia and wilson s disease neurodegenerative diseases can affect different parts of brain and can affect movement memory and cognition brain although protected by blood brain barrier can be affected by infections including viruses bacteria and fungi infection may be of meninges meningitis brain matter encephalitis or within brain matter such as a cerebral abscess rare prion diseases including creutzfeldt jakob disease and its variant and kuru may also affect brain tumours brain tumours can be either benign or cancerous most malignant tumours arise from another part of body most commonly from lung breast and skin cancers of brain tissue can also occur and originate from any tissue in and around brain meningioma cancer of meninges around brain is more common than cancers of brain tissue cancers within brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position with symptoms including headache and nausea or gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing swallowing talking or as a change of mood cancers are in general investigated through use of ct scans and mri scans a variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for cause of cancer and evaluate type and stage of cancer corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease swelling of brain tissue around a tumour surgery may be considered however given complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable mental disorders mental disorders such as depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder posttraumatic stress disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder tourette syndrome and addiction are known to relate to functioning of brain treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy psychiatry social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals epilepsy epileptic seizures are thought to relate to abnormal electrical activity seizure activity can manifest as absence of consciousness focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech or be generalized in nature status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 5 minutes seizures have a large number of causes however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found in a person with epilepsy risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness drug and alcohol intake and stress seizures may be assessed using blood tests eeg and various medical imaging techniques based on medical history and exam findings in addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures congenital some brain disorders such as tay sachs disease are congenital and linked to genetic and chromosomal mutations a rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as is characterised by lack of or inadequacy of cortical folding normal development of brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies teratogens infectious diseases and by use of recreational drugs including alcohol which may result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders stroke thumb upright ct scan of a cerebral hemorrhage showing an intraparenchymal bleed bottom arrow with surrounding edema top arrow a stroke is a decrease in blood supply to an area of brain causing cell death and brain injury this can lead to a wide range of symptoms including fast symptoms of facial droop arm weakness and speech difficulties including with speaking and finding words or forming sentences symptoms relate to function of affected area of brain and can point to likely site and cause of stroke difficulties with movement speech or sight usually relate to cerebrum whereas imbalance double vision vertigo and symptoms affecting more than one side of body usually relate to brainstem or cerebellum most strokes result from loss of blood supply typically because of an embolus rupture of a fatty plaque causing thrombus or narrowing of small arteries strokes can also result from bleeding within brain transient ischaemic attacks are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours investigation into stroke will involve a medical examination including a neurological examination and taking of a medical history focusing on duration of symptoms and risk factors including high blood pressure atrial fibrillation and smoking further investigation is needed in younger patients an ecg and may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of carotid arteries an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within heart diseases of heart valves or presence of a patent foramen ovale blood tests are routinely done as part of workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile some treatments for stroke are time critical these include clot dissolution or surgical removal of a clot for ischaemic strokes and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes as stroke is time critical hospitals and even pre hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations usually a ct scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a ct or mr angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply brain mri scans not as widely available may be able to demonstrate affected area of brain more accurately particularly with ischaemic stroke having experienced a stroke a person may be admitted to a stroke unit and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes including ongoing anticoagulation such as aspirin or clopidogrel and lipid lowering drugs a multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists physiotherapists occupational therapists and psychologists plays a large role in supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation a history of stroke increases risk of developing dementia by around 70 and recent stroke increases risk by around 120 brain death brain death refers to an irreversible total loss of brain function this is characterised by coma loss of reflexes and however declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted in some countries there is also a defined syndrome of brainstem death declaration of brain death can have profound implications as declaration under principle of medical futility will be associated with withdrawal of life support and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients families when brain death is suspected reversible differential diagnoses such as electrolyte neurological and drug related cognitive suppression need to be excluded testing for reflexes can be of help in decision as can absence of response and breathing clinical observations including a total lack of responsiveness a known diagnosis and neural imaging evidence may all play a role in decision to pronounce brain death society and culture is study of relationship between culture and brain it explores how brain gives rise to culture and how culture influences brain development cultural differences and their relation to brain development and structure are researched in different fields mind thumb right upright skull of phineas gage with path of iron rod that passed through it without killing him but altering his cognition case helped to convince people that mental functions were localized in brain philosophy of mind studies such issues as problem of understanding consciousness and mind body problem relationship between brain and mind is a significant challenge both philosophically and scientifically this is because of difficulty in explaining how mental activities such as thoughts and emotions can be implemented by physical structures such as neurons and synapses or by any other type of physical mechanism this difficulty was expressed by gottfried leibniz in analogy known as leibniz s mill doubt about possibility of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove rene descartes and most other philosophers along with him to dualism belief that mind is to some degree independent of brain there has always however been a strong argument in opposite direction there is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of or injuries to brain for example by drugs or by lesions respectively can affect mind in potent and intimate ways in 19th century case of phineas gage a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain convinced both researchers and public that cognitive functions were localised in brain following this line of thinking a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists believing that mental phenomena are ultimately result of or reducible to physical phenomena schwartz j h appendix d consciousness and neurobiology of twenty first century in kandel e r schwartz j h jessell t m 2000 principles of neural science 4th edition brain size size of brain and a person s intelligence are not strongly related studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations averaging around 0 3 to 0 4 between brain volume and iq most consistent associations are observed within frontal temporal and parietal lobes hippocampi and cerebellum but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in iq which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real world performance other animals including whales and elephants have larger brains than humans however when brain to body mass ratio is taken into account human brain is almost twice as large as that of a bottlenose dolphin and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee however a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence very small animals have high ratios and has largest quotient of any mammal in popular culture thumb upright phrenology summarized in an 1883 chart research has disproved some common misconceptions about brain these include both ancient and modern myths it is not true that neurons are not replaced after age of two nor that only ten per cent of brain is used popular culture has also oversimplified lateralisation of brain suggesting that functions are completely specific to one side of brain or other akio mori coined term game brain for supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed brain s pre frontal region and impaired expression of emotion and creativity historically brain featured in popular culture through phrenology a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to different regions of cortex cortex remains important in popular culture as covered in books and satire brain features in science fiction with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs beings with features like partly artificial brains cyborgs and space in astronautics september 1960 by manfred e and

history early history thumb right upright 1 0 hieroglyph for word brain c 1700 bc edwin smith papyrus an ancient egyptian medical treatise written in 17th century bc contains earliest recorded reference to brain hieroglyph for brain occurring eight times in this papyrus describes symptoms diagnosis and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to head papyrus mentions external surface of brain effects of injury including seizures and aphasia meninges and cerebrospinal fluid in fifth century bc of croton in magna grecia first considered brain to be seat of mind also in fifth century bc in athens unknown author of on sacred disease a medical treatise which is part of hippocratic corpus and traditionally attributed to hippocrates believed brain to be seat of intelligence aristotle in his biology initially believed heart to be seat of intelligence and saw brain as a cooling mechanism for blood he reasoned that humans are more rational than beasts because among other reasons they have a larger brain to cool their hot bloodedness aristotle did describe meninges and distinguished between cerebrum and cerebellum von staden p 157 of chalcedon in fourth and third centuries bc distinguished cerebrum and cerebellum and provided first clear description of ventricles and with of ceos experimented on living brains their works are now mostly lost and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources some of their discoveries had to be re discovered a millennium after their deaths anatomist physician galen in second century ad during time of roman empire dissected brains of sheep monkeys dogs and pigs he concluded that as cerebellum was denser than brain it must control muscles while as cerebrum was soft it must be where senses were processed galen further theorized that brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through ventricles renaissance in 1316 mondino de s began modern study of brain anatomy niccolo massa discovered in 1536 that ventricles were filled with fluid archangelo piccolomini of rome was first to distinguish between cerebrum and cerebral cortex in 1543 andreas vesalius published his seven volume de humani corporis fabrica seventh book covered brain and eye with detailed images of ventricles cranial nerves pituitary gland meninges structures of eye vascular supply to brain and spinal cord and an image of peripheral nerves vesalius rejected common belief that ventricles were responsible for brain function arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans but no true intelligence rene descartes proposed theory of dualism to tackle issue of brain s relation to mind he suggested that pineal gland was where mind interacted with body serving as seat of soul and as connection through which animal spirits passed from blood into brain this dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore relationship between anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy thomas willis is considered a second pioneer in study of neurology and brain science he wrote cerebri in 1664 followed by cerebral pathology in 1667 in these he described structure of cerebellum ventricles cerebral hemispheres brainstem and cranial nerves studied its blood supply and proposed functions associated with different areas of brain circle of willis was named after his investigations into blood supply of brain and he was first to use word neurology willis removed brain from body when examining it and rejected commonly held view that cortex only consisted of blood vessels and view of last two millennia that cortex was only incidentally important in middle of 19th century emil du bois reymond and hermann von helmholtz were able to use a to show that electrical impulses passed at measurable speeds along nerves refuting view of their teacher johannes peter muller that nerve impulse was a vital function that could not be measured richard caton in 1875 demonstrated electrical impulses in cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys in 1820s jean pierre pioneered experimental method of damaging specific parts of animal brains describing effects on movement and behavior modern period studies of brain became more sophisticated with use of microscope and development of a silver staining method by camillo golgi during 1880s this was able to show intricate structures of single neurons this was used by santiago ramon y cajal and led to formation of neuron doctrine then revolutionary hypothesis that neuron is functional unit of brain he used microscopy to uncover many cell types and proposed functions for cells he saw for this golgi and cajal are considered founders of twentieth century neuroscience both sharing nobel prize in 1906 for their studies and discoveries in this field charles sherrington published his influential 1906 work integrative action of nervous system examining function of reflexes evolutionary development of nervous system functional specialisation of brain and layout and cellular function of central nervous system john farquhar fulton founded journal of neurophysiology and published first comprehensive textbook on physiology of nervous system during 1938 neuroscience during twentieth century began to be recognised as a distinct unified academic discipline with david rioch francis o schmitt and stephen playing critical roles in establishing field rioch originated integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at walter reed army institute of research starting in 1950s during same period schmitt established neuroscience research program an inter university and international organisation bringing together biology medicine psychological and behavioural sciences word neuroscience itself arises from this program paul broca associated regions of brain with specific functions in particular language in broca s area following work on brain damaged patients principles of neural science 4th ed eric r kandel james h schwartz thomas m jessel eds mcgraw hill new york ny 2000 john jackson described function of motor cortex by watching progression of epileptic seizures through body carl wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production brodmann divided regions of brain based on appearance of cells by 1950 sherrington and maclean had identified many of brainstem and limbic system functions capacity of brain to re organise and change with age and a recognised critical development period were attributed to neuroplasticity pioneered by margaret kennard who experimented on monkeys during 1930 40s harvey cushing 1869 1939 is recognised as first proficient brain surgeon in world in 1937 walter dandy began practice of vascular neurosurgery by performing first surgical clipping of an intracranial aneurysm comparative anatomy human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains many of its features are common to all mammalian brains most notably a six layered cerebral cortex and a set of associated structures including hippocampus and amygdala cortex is proportionally larger in humans than in many other mammals humans have more association cortex sensory and motor parts than smaller mammals such as rat and cat as a primate brain human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex in proportion to body size than most mammals and a highly developed visual system as a hominid brain human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to brain of a typical monkey sequence of human evolution from australopithecus four million years ago to homo sapiens modern humans was marked by a steady increase in brain size as brain size increased this altered size and shape of skull from about 600 cm3 in homo to an average of about 1520 cm3 in homo neanderthalensis differences in dna gene expression and gene environment interactions help explain differences
