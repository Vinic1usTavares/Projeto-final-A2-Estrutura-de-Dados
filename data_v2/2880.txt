tropical storm bret was deadliest natural disaster in venezuela since 1967 caracas earthquake third tropical cyclone of 1993 atlantic hurricane season bret formed on august 4 from a westward moving african tropical wave bret would later peak as a 60 mph 95 km h tropical storm as it neared trinidad it took an extremely southerly course through caribbean passing over coasts of venezuela and colombia high terrain in northern parts of those countries severely disrupted circulation of storm and bret had weakened to a tropical depression before emerging over extreme southwestern caribbean sea there it restrengthened to a tropical storm and made landfall in nicaragua on august 10 dissipating soon after bret s remnants reached pacific ocean where they ultimately became hurricane greg though bret was only a weak tropical storm it caused extreme flooding and nearly 200 deaths as it moved through south america mostly in venezuela first tropical storm to strike country in 100 years bret deluged northern regions with of rainfall capital caracas received of rain over just seven hours resulting in widespread mudslides in hills around city that buried houses and carried away cars there were 173 deaths in country and damage was estimated at us 25 million 1993 usd volunteers and firefighters helped storm victims cope with damage and workers cleared roads to restore transportation outside of venezuela bret first affected trinidad and tobago causing minor flooding and power outages it passed just south of curacao where storm damaged coral reef and roofs of 17 homes storm later brushed northern colombia killing one person there before hitting central america in nicaragua bret killed 31 people and left us 3 million in damage with many coastal towns isolated by floods there was one death in neighboring costa rica and seven in honduras all due to flooding in central america damage was compounded by hurricane gert moving through region in early september meteorological history tropical storm bret originated from a tropical wave a westward tracking low pressure area that crossed coast of africa on august 1 1993 throughout its journey across open atlantic wave retained an impressive cloud structure with an area of deep convection by august 4 associated thunderstorm activity consolidated and organized into curved rainbands national hurricane center nhc noting improving structure and sufficient support from dvorak intensity estimates reassessed wave as a tropical depression at 12 00 utc that day third such system of annual hurricane season at time of its classification it was located along 10th parallel north over central atlantic about 1 150 mi 1 850 km west southwest of cape verde islands with a very resilient high pressure area to its north depression continued moving due west at an unusually low latitude for most of its existence system gradually organized due to low wind shear after outflow increased and circulation became better established nhc upgraded depression to tropical storm bret early on august 5 initially agency expected storm would attain hurricane status while moving west northwestward through caribbean sea although storm would maintain its westward track early on august 6 bret attained peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h fueled by warm waters and increased banding around a central dense overcast circulation became exposed late on august 6 but thunderstorms soon over center at 07 00 utc on next day bret struck island of trinidad near galera point storm moved across northern portion of island and later made landfall in northeastern venezuela near after hitting northeastern venezuela bret continued westward through extreme northern portion of country around 20 00 utc on august 7 circulation emerged into southeastern caribbean sea circulation weakened and became poorly defined although storm maintained stronger winds to north despite southerly inflow being disrupted by mountainous terrain bret maintained its circulation while continuing westward passing just north of venezuela s capital caracas around 08 00 utc on august 8 storm moved back onshore venezuela near national park in falcon state later that day nhc noted that there was little if any circulation left to this system although agency continued issuing advisory due to storm s heavy rainfall however a circulation emerged into gulf of venezuela which soon crossed into northeastern colombia there circulation neared pico cristobal colon tallest mountain in colombia with a peak of 18 947 ft 5 775 m this caused structure to deteriorate and on august 9 bret weakened to tropical depression status with circulation practically dissipated according to nhc hurricane hunters had difficulty finding a closed circulation prompting nhc to discontinue advisories at 15 00 utc on august 9 right thumb bret making landfall on nicaragua after moving through southwestern caribbean sea bret began to re develop convection as upper level conditions became more favorable by early on august 10 surface observations confirmed presence of a low level circulation and nhc re issued advisories on system convection continued to organize prompting nhc to upgrade bret again to a tropical storm storm strengthened slightly further to a secondary peak of 45 mph 75 km h around 17 00 utc on august 10 bret made its final landfall in southern nicaragua near bahia punta gorda circulation moved through country and turned more to west northwest operationally it was believed that bret survived after crossing central america and entered eastern pacific as nhc designated it tropical depression eight e post storm analysis determined otherwise that bret dissipated over western nicaragua near pacific coast on august 11 remnants continued to west northwest eventually developing into a tropical depression on august 15 off west coast of mexico system eventually became hurricane greg with peak winds of 135 mph 215 km h which lasted until august 28 preparations in general bret was forecast to track farther north than it ultimately did about 24 hours in advance of storm tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for southern lesser antilles and venezuela first tropical storm watch was posted late on august 5 from dominica southward to trinidad on next day this was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from saint lucia to trinidad tropical storm warnings spread westward through venezuela along storm s path as well as abc islands and northern colombia along guajira peninsula later when bret began
