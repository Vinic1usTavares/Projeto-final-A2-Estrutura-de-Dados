thumb upright 1 3 convergence of a convex curve to a circle under curve shortening flow inner curves lighter color are flowed versions of outer curves time steps between curves are not uniform in mathematics curve shortening flow is a process that modifies a smooth curve in euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to curve at a speed proportional to curvature curve shortening flow is an example of a geometric flow and is one dimensional case of mean curvature flow other names for same process include euclidean shortening flow geometric heat flow phrase geometric heat flow has also been used for flows on other kinds of object than curves such as differential forms and arc length evolution as points of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way curve remains simple and smooth it loses area at a constant rate and its perimeter decreases as quickly as possible for any continuous curve evolution if curve is non convex its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically until it becomes convex once convex isoperimetric ratio of curve decreases as curve converges to a circular shape before collapsing to a single point of singularity if two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point circle is only simple closed curve that maintains its shape under curve shortening flow but some curves that cross themselves or have infinite length keep their shape including grim reaper curve an infinite curve that translates upwards and spirals that rotate while remaining same size and shape an approximation to curve shortening flow can be computed numerically by approximating curve as a polygon and using finite difference method to calculate motion of each polygon vertex alternative methods include computing a convolution of polygon vertices and then vertices on resulting curve or repeatedly applying a median filter to a digital image whose black and white pixels represent inside and outside of curve curve shortening flow was originally studied as a model for annealing of metal sheets later it was applied in image analysis to give a multi scale representation of shapes it can also model reaction diffusion systems and behavior of cellular automata in pure mathematics curve shortening flow can be used to find closed geodesics on riemannian manifolds and as a model for behavior of higher dimensional flows definitions a flow is a process in which points of a mathematical space continuously change their locations or properties over time more specifically in a one dimensional geometric flow such as curve shortening flow points undergoing flow belong to a curve and what changes is shape of curve its embedding into euclidean plane determined by locations of each of its points p 140 a geometric flow is an evolution of geometry of over time in curve shortening flow each point of a curve moves in direction of a normal vector to curve at a rate proportional to curvature for an evolving curve represented by a two parameter function where parameterizes arc length along curve and parameterizes a time in evolution of curve curve shortening flow can be described by parabolic partial differential equation a form of heat equation where is curvature and is unit normal vector because ingredients of this equation arc length curvature and time are all unaffected by translations and rotations of euclidean plane it follows that flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations or more precisely if plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor flow remains essentially unchanged but is slowed down or sped up by same factor non smooth curves in order for flow to be well defined given curve must be sufficiently smooth that it has a continuous curvature however once flow starts curve becomes analytic and remains so until reaching a singularity at which curvature blows up for a smooth curve without crossings only possible singularity happens when curve collapses to a point but immersed curves can have other types of singularity in such cases with some care it is possible to continue flow past these singularities until whole curve shrinks to a single point for a simple closed curve using an extension of flow to non smooth curves based on level set method there are only two possibilities curves with zero lebesgue measure including all polygons and smooth curves instantly evolve into smooth curves after which they evolve as any smooth curve would however osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries topologist s sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth despite not even being locally connected examples such as this show that reverse evolution of curve shortening flow can take well behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time non euclidean surfaces curve shortening flow and many of results about curve shortening flow can be generalized from euclidean plane to any two dimensional riemannian manifold in order to avoid additional types of singularity it is important for manifold to be convex at infinity this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact convex hull as defined using geodesic convexity curve shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its convex hull so this condition prevents parts of curve from reaching boundary of manifold space curves curve shortening flow has also been studied for curves in three dimensional euclidean space normal vector in this case can be defined as in plane as derivative of tangent vector with respect to arc length normalized to be a unit vector it is one of components of frame it is not well defined at points of zero curvature but product of curvature and normal vector remains well defined at those points allowing curve shortening flow to be defined curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow and flow may lead to singularities in curves every singularity is asymptotic to a plane curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves beyond curves it is possible to extend definition of flow to more general inputs than curves for instance by using varifolds or level set method however these extended definitions may allow parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area 4 7 1 s solution p 100 thumb upright 1 3 for networks of curves extending curve shortening flow past a singularity may result in ambiguity or fattening a commonly studied variation of problem involves networks of interior disjoint smooth curves with junctions where three or more of curves meet when junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2 3 same conditions seen in an optimal steiner tree or two dimensional foam of soap bubbles flow is well defined for short term however it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction and there may be more than one way to continue flow past such a singularity behavior avoidance principle radius and stretch factor if two disjoint smooth simple closed curves undergo curve shortening flow simultaneously they remain disjoint as flow progresses reason is that if two smooth curves move in a way that creates a crossing then at time of first crossing curves would necessarily be tangent to each other without crossing but in such a situation two curves curvatures at point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing for same reason a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself this phenomenon is known as avoidance principle avoidance principle implies that any smooth curve eventually either reaches a singularity such as a point of infinite curvature or collapses to a point for if a given smooth curve is surrounded by a circle both will remain disjoint until one or other collapses or reaches a singularity but enclosing circle shrinks under curvature flow remaining circular until it collapses and by avoidance principle must remain contained within it by same reasoning radius of smallest circle that encloses must decrease at a rate that is at least as fast as decrease in radius of a circle undergoing same flow quantifies avoidance principle for a single curve in terms of ratio between arc length of shorter of two arcs and euclidean distance between pairs of points sometimes called stretch factor he shows that stretch factor is strictly decreasing at each of its local maxima except for case of two ends of a diameter of a circle in which case stretch factor is constant at this monotonicity property implies avoidance principle for if curve would ever touch itself stretch factor would become infinite at two touching points length as a curve undergoes curve shortening flow its length decreases at a rate given by formula where interval is taken over curve is curvature and is arc length along curve is always non negative and for any smooth closed curve there exist arcs within which it is strictly positive so length decreases monotonically more generally for any evolution of curves whose normal speed is rate of change in length is which can be interpreted as a negated inner product between given evolution and curve shortening flow thus curve shortening flow can be described as gradient flow for length flow that locally decreases length of curve as quickly as possible relative to norm of flow this property is one that gives curve shortening flow its name p vii p 526 area for a simple closed curve area enclosed by curve shrinks at constant rate of 2 units of area per unit of time independent of curve therefore total time for a curve to shrink to a point is proportional to its area regardless of its initial shape appendix b proposition 1 p 230 p vii theorem 1 p 527 because area of a curve is reduced at a constant rate and by isoperimetric inequality a circle has greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length it follows that circles are slowest curves to collapse to a point under curve shortening flow all other curves take less time to collapse than a circle of same length constant rate of area reduction is only conservation law satisfied by curve shortening flow this implies that it is not possible to express vanishing point where curve eventually collapses as an integral over curve of any function of its points and their derivatives because such an expression would lead to a forbidden second conservation law however by combining constant rate of area loss with avoidance principle it is possible to prove that vanishing point always lies within a circle concentric with minimum enclosing circle whose area is difference in areas between enclosing circle and given curve total absolute curvature total absolute curvature of a smooth curve is integral of absolute value of curvature along arc length of curve it can also be expressed as a sum of angles between normal vectors at consecutive pairs of inflection points it is 2 for convex curves and larger for non convex curves serving as a measure of non convexity of a curve new inflection points cannot be created by curve shortening flow p 143 each of angles in representation of total absolute curvature as a sum decreases monotonically except at instants when two consecutive inflection points reach same angle or position as each other and are both eliminated therefore total absolute curvature can never increase as curve evolves for convex curves it is constant at 2 and for non convex curves it decreases monotonically appendix b proposition 2 p 230 lemma 5 5 p 130 6 1 decrease in total absolute curvature pp 144 147 gage hamilton grayson theorem if a smooth simple closed curve undergoes curve shortening flow it remains smoothly embedded without self intersections it will eventually become convex and once it does so it will remain convex after this time all points of curve will move inwards and shape of curve will converge to a circle as whole curve shrinks to a single point this behavior is sometimes summarized by saying that every simple closed curve shrinks to a round point p vii theorems 2 and 3 pp 527 528 theorem 3 26 p 47 p 141 this result is due to michael gage richard s hamilton and matthew grayson proved convergence to a circle for convex curves that contract to a point more specifically gage showed that isoperimetric ratio ratio of squared curve length to area a number that is 4 for a circle and larger for any other convex curve decreases monotonically and quickly proved that all smooth convex curves eventually contract to a point without forming any other singularities and proved that every non convex curve will eventually become convex p vii p 47 p 141 provide a simpler proof of grayson s result based on monotonicity of stretch factor thumb upright 1 4 limiting shape for all networks of two collinear rays and two curves connecting endpoints of two rays central lens has shape of a vesica piscis similar results can be extended from closed curves to unbounded curves satisfying a local lipschitz condition for such curves if both sides of curve have infinite area then evolved curve remains smooth and singularity free for all time however if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area and curve has finite total absolute curvature then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to area on finite area side of curve with unbounded curvature near singularity for curves that are graphs of sufficiently well behaved functions asymptotic to a ray in each direction solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to same rays for networks formed by two disjoint rays on same line together with two smooth curves connecting endpoints of two rays an analogue of gage hamilton grayson theorem holds under which region between two curves becomes convex and then converges to a vesica piscis shape singularities of self crossing curves curves that have self crossings may reach singularities before contracting to a point for instance if a any smooth immersed curve with a single crossing resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol has unequal areas in its two lobes then eventually smaller lobe will collapse to a point however if two lobes have equal areas then they will remain equal throughout evolution of curve and isoperimetric ratio will diverge as curve collapses to a singularity when a locally convex self crossing curve approaches a singularity as one of its loops shrinks it either shrinks in a self similar way or asymptotically approaches grim reaper curve described below as it shrinks when a loop collapses to a singularity amount of total absolute curvature that is lost is either at least 2 or exactly on riemannian manifolds on a riemannian manifold any smooth simple closed curve will remain smooth and simple as it evolves just as in euclidean case it will either collapse to a point in a finite amount of time or remain smooth and simple forever in latter case curve necessarily converges to a closed geodesic of surface p 528 theorem 2 2 1 p 73 this result was already stated as a conjecture by immersed curves on riemannian manifolds with finitely many self crossings become self tangent only at a discrete set of times at each of which they lose a crossing as a consequence number of self crossing points is non decreasing thumb upright 0 75 a tennis ball curve shortening on a sphere can be used as part of a proof of tennis ball theorem this theorem states that every smooth simple closed curve on sphere that divides sphere s surface into two equal areas like seam of a tennis ball must have at least four inflection points proof comes from observation that curve shortening preserves smoothness and area bisection properties of curve and does not increase its number of inflection points therefore it allows problem to be reduced to problem for curves near limiting shape of curve shortening a great circle huisken s monotonicity formula according to huisken s monotonicity formula convolution of an evolving curve with a time reversed heat kernel is non increasing this result can be used to analyze singularities of evolution specific curves curves with self similar evolution thumb upright 1 2 grim reaper curve and translated copies of it produced by curve shortening flow because every other simple closed curve converges to a circle circle is only simple closed curve that keeps its shape under curve shortening flow however there are many other examples of curves that are either non simple they include self crossings or non closed they extend to infinity and keep their shape in particular 2 invariant solutions for curve shortening flow pp 27 44 every line stays unchanged by curve shortening flow lines are only curves that are unaffected by curve shortening flow although there exist more complex stable networks of curves such as hexagonal tiling of plane grim reaper curve moves upwards without changing its shape in same way any curve similar to grim reaper is translated by curve shortening flow shifted in direction of symmetry axis of curve without changing its shape or orientation grim reaper is only curve with this property it is also called hairpin model in physics literature a family of self crossing closed curves derived from projections of torus knots shrink homothetically but remain self similar under curve shortening flow these have come to be known as abresch langer curves after work of although they were mentioned earlier by and rediscovered independently by these curves are locally convex and therefore can be described by their support functions suitably scaled versions of these support functions obey differential equation which has positive periodic solutions corresponding to curves with self similar evolution for any period that is strictly between and other curves including some infinite spirals remain self similar with more complicated motions including rotation or combinations of rotation shrinking or expansion and translation for networks of smooth curves meeting in threes at junctions with angles of 2 3 self similar shrinking solutions include a double bubble surrounding two equal areas a lens shape vesica piscis bounded by two congruent arcs of circles together with two collinear rays having their apexes at corners of lens and a fish shaped network bounded by a line segment two rays and a convex curve any other self similar shrinking networks involve a larger number of curves another family of networks grows homothetically and remains self similar these are tree like networks of curves meeting at angles of 2 3 at triple junctions asymptotic to a fan of two or more rays that meet at a common endpoint two ray case of these shapes is an unbounded smooth curve for three or more rays evolution of these shapes may be defined using generalized variants of curve shortening flow such as one for varifolds a given fan of four or more rays may be asymptotic to more than one different solution of this type so these solutions do not provide a unique definition for curve shortening flow starting from a fan of rays two ray case was already described by for generalization to two or more rays and issues of non uniqueness see appendix c pp 235 237 and ancient solutions an ancient solution to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time without singularities all of self similar solutions that shrink or stay same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing self similarity transformation that they would undergo by forwards curve shortening flow thus for instance circle grim reaper and abresch langer curves are all ancient solutions only closed curves other than circle and abresch langer curves that form ancient solutions are a class of curves called ovals after work of these curves may be parameterized by specifying their curvature as a function of tangent angle using formula and have as their limiting shape under reverse evolution a pair of grim reaper curves approaching each other from opposite directions in cartesian coordinate system they may be given by implicit curve equation in physics literature same shapes are known as paperclip model for more general classes of curves such as graphs of functions a more diverse collection of ancient solutions is known numerical approximations in order to compute curve shortening flow efficiently both a continuous curve and continuous evolution of curve need to be replaced by a discrete approximation front tracking front tracking methods have long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track motion of boundaries between different materials of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts or of shock waves within a single material these methods involve deriving equations of motion of boundary and using them to directly simulate motion of boundary rather than simulating underlying fluid and treating boundary as an emergent property of fluid see e g same methods can also be used to simulate curve shortening flow even when curve undergoing flow is not a boundary or shock in front tracking methods for curve shortening curve undergoing evolution is as a polygon finite difference method is used to derive formulas for approximate normal vector and curvature at each vertex of polygon and these values are used to determine how to move each vertex in each time step 5 1 1 finite difference methods pp 107 108 although curve shortening flow is defined by motion of a curve perpendicularly to itself some parameterizations of curve shortening flow may allow vertices that approximate curve to move non perpendicularly in effect this allows vertices to move along curve as curve evolves choosing a careful can help redistribute vertices more evenly along curve in situations where perpendicular motion would cause them to bunch up write that these methods are fast and accurate but that it is much more complicated to extend them to versions of curve shortening flow that apply to more complicated inputs than simple closed curves where it is necessary to deal with singularities and changes of topology for most such methods warns that conditions of stability cannot be determined easily and time step must be chosen ad hoc 5 1 1 finite difference methods pp 107 108 another finite method by modifies formula for curvature at each vertex by adding to it a small term based on laplace operator this modification is called elliptic regularization and it can be used to help prove existence of generalized flows as well as in their numerical simulation p 1 using it method of crandall and lions can be proven to converge and is only numerical method listed by cao that is equipped with bounds on its convergence rate 5 2 3 a monotone and convergent finite difference schemes p 109 for an empirical comparison of forward euler backward euler and more accurate crank nicolson finite difference methods see resampled convolution suggest a numerical method for computing an approximation to curve shortening flow that maintains a discrete approximation to curve and alternates between two steps current curve by placing new sample points at a uniform spacing as measured by normalized arc length convolve locations of points with a gaussian function with small standard deviation in effect replacing each point s location with a weighted average of locations of nearby points along curve with gaussian weights standard deviation of gaussian should be chosen to be small enough that after this step sample points still have nearly uniform spacing as they show this method converges to curve shortening distribution in limit as number of sample points grows and normalized arc length of convolution radius shrinks pp 796 797 pp 10 11 median filtering describe a scheme operating on a two dimensional square grid effectively an array of pixels curve to be evolved is represented by assigning value 0 black to pixels exterior to curve and 1 white to pixels interior to curve giving indicator function for interior of curve this representation is updated by alternating two steps convolve pixelated image with a heat kernel to simulate its evolution under heat equation for a short time step result is a gaussian blur of image or equivalently weierstrass transform of indicator function with radius proportional to square root of time step set every pixel with numerical value less than 1 2 to 0 and every pixel with numerical value greater than 1 2 to 1 thresholding image back to its original values in new positions in order for this scheme to be accurate time step must be large enough to cause curve to move by at least one pixel even at points of low curvature but small enough to cause radius of blurring to be less than minimum radius of curvature therefore size of a pixel must be small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen method can be generalized to evolution of networks of curves meeting at junctions and dividing plane into more than three regions by applying same method simultaneously to each region instead of blurring and thresholding this method can alternatively be described as applying a median filter with gaussian weights to each pixel it is possible to use kernels other than heat kernel or to adaptively refine grid so that it has high resolution near curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from curve that do not contribute to outcome 5 2 4 bence merriman and scheme for mean curvature motion pp 109 110 for correctness of median filtering with other isotropic kernels see section 4 4 1 pp 90 92 instead of using only two values in pixelated image a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent signed distance to curve can achieve accuracy and require lower resolution applications annealing metal sheets an early reference to curve shortening flow by motivates it as a model for physical process of annealing in which heat treatment causes boundaries between grains of crystallized metal to shift unlike soap films which are forced by differences in air pressure to become surfaces of constant mean curvature grain boundaries in annealing are subject only to local effects which cause them to move according to mean curvature flow one dimensional case of this flow curve shortening flow corresponds to annealing sheets of metal that are thin enough for grains to become effectively two dimensional and their boundaries to become one dimensional appendix a pp 224 228 shape analysis in image processing and computer vision suggest applying curve shortening flow to outline of a shape derived from a digital image in order to remove noise from shape and provide a scale space that provides a simplified description of shape at different levels of resolution method of and mackworth involves computing curve shortening flow tracking inflection points of curve as they progress through flow and drawing a graph that plots positions of inflection points around curve against time parameter inflection points will typically be removed from curve in pairs as curve becomes convex according to gage hamilton grayson theorem and lifetime of a pair of points corresponds to salience of a feature of shape because of resampled convolution method that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of curve shortening flow they call their method resampled curvature scale space they observe that this scale space is invariant under euclidean transformations of given shape and assert that it uniquely determines shape and is robust against small variations in shape they compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes and find that resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive more robust against noise and less strongly influenced by small scale shape differences reaction diffusion in reaction diffusion systems modeled by allen cahn equation limiting behavior for fast reaction slow diffusion and two or more local minima of energy with same energy level as each other is for system to settle into regions of different local minima with fronts delimiting boundaries between these regions evolving according to curve shortening flow cellular automata thumb upright 1 2 cellular automaton 1600 steps after a random start in a cellular automaton each cell in an infinite grid of cells may have one of a finite set of states and all cells update their states simultaneously based only on configuration of a small set of neighboring cells a life like cellular automaton rule is one in which grid is infinite square lattice there are exactly two cell states set of neighbors of each cell are eight neighbors of moore neighborhood and update rule depends only on number of neighbors with each of two states rather than on any more complicated function of those states in one particular life like rule introduced by gerard and called twisted majority rule or annealing rule update rule sets new value for each cell to be majority among nine cells given by it and its eight neighbors except when these cells are split among four with one state and five with other state in which case new value of cell is minority rather than majority detailed dynamics of this rule are complicated including existence of small stable structures however in aggregate when started with all cells in random states it tends to form large regions of cells that are all in same state as each other with boundaries between these regions evolving according to curve shortening flow construction of closed geodesics curve shortening flow can be used to prove an isoperimetric inequality for surfaces whose gaussian curvature is a non increasing function of distance from origin such as on such a surface smooth compact set that has any given area and minimum perimeter for that area is necessarily a circle centered at origin proof applies curve shortening flow to two curves a metric circle and boundary of any other compact set and compares change in perimeter of two curves as they are both reduced to a point by flow theorem 2 3 1 p 75 curve shortening flow can also be used to prove theorem of three geodesics that every smooth riemannian manifold topologically equivalent to a sphere has three geodesics that form simple closed curves related flows other geometric flows related to curve shortening flow include following ones for simulating behavior of crystals or other anisotropic materials it is important to have variants of curve shortening flow for which speed of flow depends on orientation of a curve as well as on its curvature one way of doing this is to define energy of a curve to be integral of a smooth function of its normal vectors and form gradient flow of this energy according to which normal speed at which curve flows is proportional to an anisotropic analog of curvature this flow can be simulated by curve as a polygon in numerical experiments initial curves appear to converge to wulff shape for before shrinking to a point alternatively one can let curve flow with speed where is usual curvature and and are smooth functions of orientation when and so that flow is invariant under point reflection resulting flow can be shown to obey avoidance principle and an analog of gage hamilton grayson theorem chapter 6 a class of non convex anisotropic flows pp 143 177 affine curve shortening flow was first investigated by and in this flow normal speed of curve is proportional to cube root of curvature 3 2 3 affine invariant flow simplest affine invariant curve flow pp 42 46 resulting flow is invariant with a corresponding time scaling under affine transformations of euclidean plane a larger symmetry group than similarity transformations under which curve shortening flow is invariant under this flow an analogue of gage hamilton grayson theorem applies under which any simple closed curve eventually becomes convex and then converges to an ellipse as it collapses to a point theorem 3 28 p 47 transforming a curve with equal normal speeds at all points has been called transform curves evolved in this way will in general develop sharp corners trace of which forms medial axis of curve a closely related curve evolution which moves straight segments of a polygonal curve at equal speeds but allows concave corners to move more quickly than unit speed instead forms a different type of topological skeleton of given curve its straight skeleton for surfaces in higher dimensions there is more than one definition of curvature including extrinsic embedding dependent measures such as mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as gaussian curvature and ricci curvature correspondingly there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature including mean curvature flow in which normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature ricci flow an intrinsic flow on metric of a space based on its ricci curvature and willmore flow gradient flow for an energy functional combining mean curvature and gaussian curvature curve shortening flow is a special case of mean curvature flow for one dimensional curves inspired by curve shortening flow on smooth curves researchers have studied methods for flowing polygons so that they stay polygonal with applications including pattern formation and synchronization in distributed systems of robots length preserving polygonal flows can be used to solve carpenter s rule problem in computer vision active contour model for edge detection and image segmentation is based on curve shortening and evolves curves based on a combination of their curvature and features of an image notes references see in particular example 1 pp 542 544 and 601 604 also published in reprinted in
