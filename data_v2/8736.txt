wasp 44b is a closely orbiting jupiter sized planet found in orbit of sunlike star wasp 44 by superwasp program which searches for transiting planets that cross in front of their host stars as seen from earth after follow up observations using radial velocity planet was confirmed use of another telescope at same observatory detected wasp 44 transiting its star planet completes an orbit around its star every two and a half days and orbits at roughly 0 03 au from its host star wasp 44b s discovery was reported by royal astronomical society in may 2011 discovery using wasp south station at south african astronomical observatory superwasp project searched night sky for potential planets that transited or crossed in front of their host stars at a roughly periodic rate wasp 44 was among candidates identified as a possible host to a transit event wasp 44 s reclassification as a potential planetary host came about after wasp south scanned cetus constellation between july and november 2009 in combination with later observations using both wasp south and superwasp north in canary islands over 15 755 photometric measurements were collected a later set of observations between august and november 2010 produced a 6 000 point photometric data set but light curve was prepared late and was not considered in discovery paper star was observed at same time as stars wasp 45 and wasp 46 200px left thumb wasp south cameras in south africa in 2010 european team of astronomers used coralie spectrograph on 1 2m leonhard euler telescope at chile s la silla observatory same radial velocity measurements detected by superwasp were detected planet wasp 44b was confirmed after analysis of results ruled out spectroscopic binary stars leaving a transiting planet as most likely cause of radial velocity variations euler telescope was used to observe wasp 44b as it transited its host star for 4 2 hours on september 14 2010 euler observed wasp 44 in search of a slight dimming in brightness until a more precise light curve could be found accounting for all data yet collected analysis yielded planet s characteristics discovery of wasp 44b along with those of wasp 45b and wasp 46b were reported on may 16 2011 by royal astronomical society scientists who worked on paper discussed role of orbital eccentricity or how elliptical an orbit is and how poorly constrained it tends to be amongst hot jupiters where a circular orbit is assumed they used three newly discovered planets as studies into creation of a non eccentric circular model for a planet s orbit most likely solution or an eccentric elliptical solution for a planet s orbit solution that according to discovery team required less of an assumption host star wasp 44 is a sunlike g type star in cetus constellation wasp 44 has a mass of 0 951 solar masses and a radius of 0 927 solar radii which means that wasp 44 is 95 mass of and 92 size of sun with an effective temperature of 5410 k wasp 44 is cooler than sun although it is richer in iron with a measured metallicity of fe h 0 06 1 15 times amount of iron found in sun star is an estimated 900 million years old although this age is uncertain as error bars are large based on its spectrum wasp 44 is not active in its chromosphere outer layer star was also not found to demonstrate a high rate of rotation with an apparent magnitude of 12 9 wasp 44 cannot be seen with unaided eye from earth characteristics wasp 44b is a hot jupiter with a mass of 0 889 times jupiter s mass and a radius of 1 002 times that of jupiter although less massive than jupiter planet is bloated to a greater size because its proximity to its host star heats it a common effect in such closely orbiting gas giants wasp 44b orbits at a mean distance of 0 03473 au which is about 3 of distance between earth and sun an orbit is completed every 2 4238039 days 58 171 hours wasp 44b has an orbital inclination of 86 02o which is almost edge on as seen from earth references category hot jupiters category cetus constellation category transiting exoplanets category exoplanets discovered in 2011 category exoplanets discovered by wasp
