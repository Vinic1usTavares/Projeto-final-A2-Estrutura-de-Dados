incredible gift that mr gibson could have given me she acknowledged to herald sun that it was helpful to have gibson s production company assist with her music career if you think about it every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger because it s pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry so i ve become very lucky and i m very grateful you don t control situations or people you meet i did not plan this i m just doing what i ve always been doing it s not like i ve changed my goals at all gibson contributed lyrics to multiple tracks on album
