century industry centring on east coast of united states and norway involving large scale harvesting transport and sale of natural ice and later making and sale of artificial ice for domestic consumption and commercial purposes ice was cut from surface of ponds and streams then stored in ice houses before being sent on by ship barge or railroad to its final destination around world networks of ice wagons were typically used to distribute product to final domestic and smaller commercial customers ice trade revolutionised u s meat vegetable and fruit industries enabled significant growth in fishing industry and encouraged introduction of a range of new drinks and foods trade was started by new england businessman frederic tudor in 1806 tudor shipped ice to caribbean island of martinique hoping to sell it to wealthy members of european elite there using an ice house he had built specially for purpose over coming years trade widened to cuba and southern united states with other merchants joining tudor in harvesting and shipping ice from new england during 1830s and 1840s ice trade expanded further with shipments reaching england india south america china and australia tudor made a fortune from india trade while brand names such as wenham ice became famous in london increasingly however ice trade began to focus on supplying growing cities on east coast of u s and needs of businesses across midwest citizens of new york city and philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long hot summers and additional ice was harvested from hudson river and maine to fulfil demand ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by railroad industry allowing meat packing industry around chicago and cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally sending dressed meat east for either internal or overseas markets chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally u s and british fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice allowing longer voyages and bigger catches and brewing industry became operational all year around as u s ice exports diminished after 1870 norway became a major player in international market shipping large quantities of ice to england and germany at its peak at end of 19th century u s ice trade employed an estimated 90 000 people in an industry capitalised at 28 million 660 million in 2010 terms using ice houses capable of storing up to 250 000 tons 220 million kg each norway exported a million tons 910 million kg of ice a year drawing on a network of artificial lakes competition had slowly been growing however in form of artificially produced plant ice and mechanically chilled facilities unreliable and expensive at first plant ice began to successfully compete with natural ice in australia and india during 1850s and 1870s respectively until by outbreak of world war i in 1914 more plant ice was being produced in u s each year than naturally harvested ice despite a temporary increase in production in u s during war inter war years saw total collapse of ice trade around world today ice is occasionally harvested for

frederic tudor a new england entrepreneur to export ice on a commercial basis cummings pp 7 8 in new england ice was an expensive product consumed only by wealthy who could afford their own ice houses weightman pp xv 3 nonetheless icehouses were relatively common amongst wealthier members of society by 1800 filled with ice cut or harvested from frozen surface of ponds and streams on their local estates during winter months cummings pp 1 2 around neighbouring new york city area hot summers and rapidly growing economy had begun to increase local demand for ice towards end of 18th century creating a small scale market amongst farmers who sold ice from their ponds and streams to local city institutions and families cummings pp 2 3 blain p 6 some ships occasionally transported ice from new york and philadelphia for sale to southern u s states in particular charleston in south carolina laying it down as ballast on trip cummings p 6 tudor s plan was to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of west indies and southern us states where he hoped they would relish product during their sweltering summers conscious of risk that others might follow suit tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets in order to maintain high prices and profits weightman pp 3 17 he started by attempting to establish a monopoly on potential ice trade in caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around boston cummings pp 8 15 at time tudor was regarded by business community at best as something of an eccentric and at worst a fool weightman pp 11 12 first shipments took place in 1806 when tudor transported an initial trial cargo of ice probably harvested from his family estate at rockwood to caribbean island of martinique sales were hampered however by lack of local storage facilities both for tudor s stock and any ice bought by domestic customers and as a result ice stocks quickly melted away cummings pp 8 9 weightman pp 19 21 learning from this experience tudor then built a functioning ice depot in havana and despite u s trade embargo declared in 1807 was trading successfully again by 1810 he was unable to acquire exclusive legal rights to import ice into cuba but was nonetheless able to maintain an effective monopoly through his control of ice houses cummings p 11 weightman pp 39 43 1812 war briefly disrupted trade but over subsequent years tudor began to export fruit back from havana to mainland on return journey kept fresh with part of unsold ice cargo cummings p 12 trade to charleston and to savannah in

georgia it reached only six to eight cents 0 90 1 20 in 2010 terms cummings p 14 where tudor had a strong market share he would respond to competition from passing traders by lowering his prices considerably selling his ice at unprofitable rate of one cent 0 20 per pound 0 5 kg at this price competitors would typically be unable to sell their own stock at a profit they would either be driven into debt or if they declined to sell their ice would melt away in heat cummings pp 14 15 tudor relying on his local storage depots could then increase his prices once again cummings p 15 by middle of 1820s around 3 000 tons 3 million kg of ice was being shipped from boston annually two thirds by tudor cummings p 17 at these lower prices ice began to sell in considerable volumes with market moving beyond wealthy elite to a wider range of consumers to point where supplies became overstretched cummings p 15 weightman p 52 it was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable goods rather than for direct consumption weightman p 66 tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs but neither source proved practical instead tudor teamed up with nathaniel wyeth to exploit ice supplies of boston on a more industrial scale cummings p 16 wyeth devised a new form of horse pulled ice cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods cummings pp 19 20 he agreed to supply tudor from fresh pond in cambridge massachusetts reducing cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents 7 30 a ton 901 kg to only 10

respectively weightman pp 136 139 of two landor s venture was more successful and he formed wenham lake ice company to export to britain building an ice depot on strand cummings p 47 wenham ice was marketed as being unusually pure possessed of special cooling properties successfully convincing british customers to avoid local british ice which was condemned as polluted and unhealthy cummings p 48 blain pp 14 15 after some initial success venture eventually failed in part because english chose not to adopt chilled drinks in same way as north americans but also because of long distances involved in trade and consequent costs of ice wastage through melting cummings p 48 blain p 7 weightman pp 142 143 nonetheless trade allowed for some refrigerated goods to arrive in england from america along with ice cargos during 1840s cummings p 48 east coast of u s also began to consume more ice particularly as more industrial and private customers found uses for refrigeration cummings p

perkins s diethyl ether vapor compression refrigeration engine invented in 1834 engines that used pre compressed air john gorrie s air cycle engines and ammonia based approaches such as those championed by ferdinand carre and charles tellier cummings p 55 blain p 26 resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel in form of coal and capital for machinery so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging weightman p 177 early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced risk of explosions and consequent damage to surrounding buildings ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in ice into which it had leaked through joints of machinery blain p 40 weightman p 177 for most of 19th century plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than natural product blain p 40 weightman p 173 nonetheless alexander twining and james harrison set up ice plants in ohio and melbourne respectively during 1850s both using perkins engines cummings pp 53 54 twining found he could not compete with natural ice but in melbourne harrison s plant came to dominate market cummings p 55 isaac p 30 australia s distance from new england where journeys could take 115 days and consequent high level of wastage 150 tons of first 400 ton shipment to sydney melted en route made it relatively easy for

1850s ouren p 31 ice harvesting was initially centred on fjords of west coast but poor local transport links pushed trade south and east to main centres of norwegian timber and shipping industries both essential for ice exporting blain pp 7 8 in early 1860s lake oppegard in norway was renamed wenham lake with aim of confusing product with new england exports and exports to england increased blain p 9 initially these were run by british business interests but eventually transitioned to norwegian companies distribution of norwegian ice across britain was helped by growing railway networks while railway connection built between fishing port of grimsby and london in 1853 created a demand for ice to allow transport of fresh fish to capital blain pp 16 21 thumb left taking on ice on prior

ponds and rivers becoming contaminated dickason p 79 less trade was brought through new england as other ways of reaching western us markets were opened up making it less profitable to trade ice from boston while cost of producing ships in region increased due to deforestation dickason p 81 finally in 1860 there was first of four ice famines along hudson warm winters that prevented formation of ice in new england creating shortages and driving up prices outbreak of american civil war in 1861 between northern and southern states also contributed to trend war disrupted sale of northern ice to

retail prices in new york in 1900 in midst of a heat wave this created a scandal that caused morse to sell up his assets in ice trade altogether to escape prosecution making a profit of 12 million 320 million in process cummings p 96 woods pp 27 28 weightman p 184 when u s entered world war i in 1917 american ice trade received a temporary boost to production cummings pp 107 108 shipments of chilled food to europe surged during war placing significant demands on country s existing refrigeration capabilities while need to produce munitions for war effort meant that ammonia and coal for refrigeration plants were in short supply cummings p 108 u s government worked together with plant and natural ice industries to promote use of natural ice to relieve burden and maintain adequate supplies cummings pp 108 109 for britain and norway however war impacted badly on natural ice trade german attempt to blockade north sea with u boats made shipments difficult and britain relied increasingly more heavily on its limited number of ice plants for supplies instead blain p 31 thumb manhattan ice truck 2013 in years after war natural ice industry collapsed into insignificance cummings p 112 industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and introduction of cheap electric motors resulted in domestic modern refrigerators becoming common in u s homes by 1930s and more widely across europe in 1950s allowing ice to be made in home weightman p 188 natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses use of natural ice on a small scale lingered on in more remote areas for some years and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals but by end of 20th century there were very few physical reminders of trade weightman pp 191 192 supply in order for natural ice to reach its customers it had to be harvested from ponds and rivers then transported and stored at various sites before finally being used in domestic or commercial applications throughout these processes traders faced problem of keeping ice from melting melted ice represented waste and lost profits in 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to end user due to wastage en route weightman pp 83 84 by end of 19th century however wastage in ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent depending on efficiency of company calandro pp 15 16 harvesting thumb film of 1919 ice harvest in poconos ice trade started with harvesting of ice from ponds and rivers during winter to be stored for summer months ahead water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40 degf 5 degc and surrounding air temperature drops to 32 degf 0 degc ice needed to be at least 18 inches 0 46 m thick to be harvested as it needed to support weight of workers and horses and be suitable for cutting into large blocks weightman p xvi in new england ponds and rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between january and march while in norway harvesting occurred between december and february weightman p xv ouren p 31 natural ice could occur with different qualities most prized was hard clear crystal ice typically consumed at table more porous white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry blain p 17 with a good thickness of ice around 1 000 tons 900 000 kg could be harvested from an acre 0 4 hectares of surface water weightman p 118 purely natural sources were insufficient in some areas and additional steps taken to increase supplies in new england holes were drilled in ice to promote thickening of surface alternatively artificial lakes were created in some areas and guidance was published on how best to construct dams that lay at heart of these designs hiles p 13 low lying boggy land was dammed and flooded in maine towards end of century to meet surge demands while pre existing artificial mill ponds in wisconsin turned out to be ideal for harvesting commercial ice parker p 3 weightman p 179 in alaska a large shallow artificial lake covering around 40 acres 16 hectares was produced in order to assist in ice production and harvesting similar approaches were taken in aleutian islands in norway this was taken further with a number of artificial lakes up to half a mile long built on farmland to increase supplies including some built out into sea to collect fresh water for ice keithahn pp 125 126 blain pp 9 10 stevens p 290 ouren p 32 thumb left selection of late 19th century specialist ice tools clockwise from top left chisels ice saw ice adze grapples bars tongs ice cutting involved several stages and was typically carried out at night when ice was thickest first surface would be cleaned of snow with scrapers depth of ice tested for suitability then surface would be marked out with cutters to produce lines of future ice blocks weightman p xvi hiles pp 21 22 size of blocks varied according to destination largest being for furthest locations smallest destined for american east coast itself and being only 22 inches 0 56 m square blocks could finally be cut out of ice and floated to shore speed of operation might depend on likelihood of warmer weather affecting ice hiles p 20 in both new england and norway harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season providing valuable local employment ouren p 31 weightman pp 82 83 process required a range of equipment some of this was protective equipment to allow workforce and horses to operate safely on ice including cork shoes for men and spiked horse shoes early in 19th century only ad hoc improvised tools such as pickaxes and chisels were used for rest of harvest but in 1840s wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale more commercial harvesting process weightman p 74 these included a horse drawn ice cutter resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in marking out ice quickly and uniformly and later a horse drawn plough with teeth to assist in cutting process itself replacing hand saw cummings p 42 by 1850s specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along east coast cummings p 59 there were discussions over desirability of a circular cutting saw for much of 19th century but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until start of 20th century when gasoline engines became available a warm winter could cripple an ice harvest however either resulting in no ice at all or thin ice that formed smaller blocks or that could not be harvested safely calandro p 10 these winters were called open winters in north america and could result in shortages of ice called ice famines famous ice famines in u s included those in 1880 and 1890 while mild winter of 1898 in norway resulted in britain having to seek additional supplies from finland over time ice famines promoted investment in plant ice production ultimately undermining ice trade legalities thumb 1841 map by simon greenleaf establishing rights to ice from fresh pond in cambridge massachusetts early in ice trade there were few restrictions on harvesting ice in u s as it had traditionally held little value and was seen as a free good dickason p 60 as trade expanded however ice became valuable and right to cut ice became important legally different rules were held to apply to navigable water ways where right to harvest ice belonged to first to stake a claim and areas of public water such as streams or small lakes where ice was considered to belong to neighboring land owners hiles p 12 many lakes had several land owners however and following disagreements over fresh pond lawyer simon greenleaf was charged to adjudicate a solution in 1841 greenleaf decided that right to harvest ice would be divided up in proportion with amount of shore line owned by different claimants from then onwards rights to harvest ice could be bought and sold and value of land adjacent to sites such as fresh pond increased rapidly with one owner who purchased land at 130 2 500 in 2010 terms an acre 0 4 hectares in 1820s refusing an offer of 2 000 44 000 an acre by 1850s cummings pp 42 43 53 54 this judgement did not remove potential for disputes as ice could be washed downstream along rivers resulting in arguments over ownership of displaced ice in some states it was made illegal to damage uncut ice belonging to another businessman but arguments could still become nasty hiles p 11 in winter of 1900 01 for example disputes between pike and north lake company and its rival wisconsin lakes ice and cartage company over rights to harvest ice resulted in pitched battles between workers and deployment of a steamship icebreaker to smash competing supplies weightman pp 180 181 transportation thumb schooner being loaded with ice in norway using ramps late 19th century natural ice typically had to be moved several times between being harvested and used by end customer a wide range of methods were used including wagons railroads ships and barges bunting p 26 calandro p 19 cummings pp 44 45 ships were particularly important to ice trade particularly in early phase of trade when focus of trade was on international exports from u s and railroad networks across country were non existent parker p 1 weightman p 169 typically ice traders hired vessels to ship ice as freight although frederic tudor initially purchased his own vessel and tudor company later bought three fast cargo ships of its own in 1877 bunting p 26 ice was first transported in ships at end of 18th century when it was occasionally used as ballast shipping ice as ballast however required it to be cleanly cut in order to avoid it shifting around as it melted which was not easily done until wyeth s invention of ice cutter in 1825 cummings p 22 blain p 8 uniform blocks that wyeth s process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into limited space of a ship s hold and significantly reduced losses from melting dickason p 62 ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust and hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering other forms of protective used to protect ice included hay and pine tree cuttings stevens pp 289 290 this requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with growth in new england lumber industry in 1830s sawdust had no other use at time and was in fact considered something of a problem so its use in ice trade proved very useful to local timber industry weightman p 129 cummings p 38 thumb left an ice barge in new york city early 20th century ships carrying ice needed to be particularly strong and there was a premium placed on recruiting good crews able to move cargo quickly to its location before it melted blain p 8 by end of 19th century preferred choice was a wooden hulled vessel to avoid rust corrosion from melting ice while windmill pumps were installed to remove excess water from hull using bilge pumps ice cargoes tended to cause damage to ships in longer term as constant melting of ice and resulting water and steam encouraged dry rot parker p 6 shipment sizes varied depending on ports and route typical late 19th century u s vessel was a schooner carrying around 600 tons 500 000 kg of ice a large shipment from norway to england might include up to 900 tons 800 000 kg parker p 5 blain p 17 it was important to keep track of amount of ice being loaded onto a ship for both commercial and safety reasons so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship and a total tally of weight of ice was recorded parker p 5 initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and a whip was used to lower separated blocks of ice into hold but an improved method was developed by 1870s involving a levered platform superseded by a counterweighted platform device by 1890 ships were loaded quickly to prevent ice from melting and in u s ports an average cargo could be loaded in just two days freight charges were paid on intake or departure weight of cargo and conditions were laid down on handling of ice along route barges were also used to transport ice particularly along hudson river doubling on occasion as storage units as well calandro p 19 these barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons 400 000 to 800 000 kg of ice and like ice carrying ships windmills were typically installed to power barge s bilge pumps calandro p 20 barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting as ice was stored beneath deck and insulated by river calandro pp 19 20 charlie morse introduced larger seagoing ice barges in 1890s in order to supply new york these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3 000 tons three million kg of ice woods p 25 thumb an 1884 arctic ice wagon designed for delivery of ice to commercial and domestic customers for much of 19th century it was particularly cheap to transport ice from new england and other key ice producing centres helping to grow industry dickason p 64 region s role as a gateway for trade with interior of u s meant that trading ships brought more cargoes to ports than there were cargoes to take back unless they could find a return cargo ships would need to carry rocks as ballast instead ice was only profitable alternative to rocks and as a result ice trade from new england could negotiate lower shipping rates than would have been possible from other international locations later in century ice trade between maine and new york took advantage of maine s emerging requirements for philadelphia s coal ice ships delivering ice from maine would bring back fuel leading to trade being termed ice and coaling business weightman p 174 ice was also transported by railroad from 1841 onwards first use of technique being on track laid down between fresh pond and charleston by charlestown branch railroad company cummings pp 44 45 a special railroad car was built to insulate ice and equipment designed to allow cars to be loaded cummings p 45 in 1842 a new railroad to fitchburg was used to access ice at walden pond ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees however as it had to be moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport smith p 45 by 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across north american continent cummings pp 75 89 91 final part of supply chain for domestic and smaller commercial customers involved delivery of ice typically using an ice wagon in u s ice was cut into 25 50 and 100 pound blocks 11 23 and 45 kg then distributed by horse drawn ice wagons calandro p 21 an iceman driving cart would then deliver ice to household using ice tongs to hold cubes calandro p 22 deliveries could occur either daily or twice daily weightman pp 139 140 by 1870s various specialist distributors existed in major cities with local fuel dealers or other businesses selling and delivering ice in smaller communities cummings p 76 in britain ice was rarely sold to domestic customers via specialist dealers during 19th century instead usually being sold through fishmongers butchers and chemists who kept ice on their premises for their own commercial use storage thumb a large commercial u s ice house early 20th century ice had to be stored at multiple points between harvesting and its final use by a customer one method for doing this was construction of ice houses to hold product typically either shortly after ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out early ice houses were relatively small but later storage facilities were size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice understanding of thermodynamics was limited at start of 19th century when it was believed that key to successful storage to ice was construction of underground ice houses where it was believed incorrectly that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully weightman p 10 european ice houses were based on this theory and used underground chambers often built at considerable expense to store winter harvest weightman pp 43 44 some farmers in virginia however had developed much cheaper icehouses elevated off ground built from wood and insulated with hay weightman p 44 in addition to temperature that ice was held at there was also a need to efficiently drain off melted water as this water would further melt remaining ice much faster than warm air would do hiles p 56 tudor investigated various ice houses in 1805 and came to conclude they could be constructed above ground as well his early ice houses in cuba had inner and outer timber walls insulated with peat and sawdust with some form of a ventilation system and these formed basic design for ice houses during rest of century by 1819 however tudor was also building ice houses from brick able to hold more than 200 tons 200 000 kg of ice using charcoal within walls for insulation weightman p 59 by 1840s warehouses by pond were up to 36 000 square feet 3 300 square metres in size being built of brick to avoid risk of fire from new railroad line ice houses remained extremely flammable however and many caught fire including sydney s first ice house which was completely destroyed in 1862 isaacs p 29 thumb left an eddy darrius refrigerator with compartments to hold natural ice 1881 size of ice houses made it difficult to load ice into them in 1827 wyeth invented a lever and horse drawn pulley system to raise blocks of ice through roofs of warehouses weightman p 78 later improvements to loading included use of lift systems to raise blocks of ice to top of building first using horse power then steam power largest warehouses later introduced conveyor belt systems to bring ice into storage calandro p 13 weightman p 122 power houses containing equipment to support these were built alongside ice houses and care was taken to avoid risk of fire from this machinery calandro p 17 warehouses were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect sun during summer calandro p 14 a typical hudson river warehouse might be 400 feet 120 m long 100 feet 30 m deep and three stories high able to hold 50 000 tons four million kg of ice calandro pp 2 14 later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250 000 tons 220 million kg apiece weightman p 170 in contrast initially ice trade in norway made do without ice houses taking ice directly from lakes to ships for transport during winter and spring between 1850s and 1870s however numerous ice houses were constructed allowing exports to take place during rest of year as well ice houses were also built in major ice consuming cities to hold imported ice before final sale and consumption where they were often termed depots in london early ice depots were often circular and called wells or shades new cattle market depot built in 1871 was 42 feet 13 m wide and 72 feet 22 m deep able to hold 3 000 short tons three million kg of ice later ice depots at shadwell and kings cross in london were larger still and along with incoming barges were used for storing norwegian ice blain pp 16 17 city of new york was unusual and did not build ice depots near ports instead using incoming barges and on occasion ships that were delivering ice as floating warehouses until ice was needed parker pp 6 7 in order for a domestic or commercial customer to use ice however it was typically necessary to be able to store it for a period away from an ice house as a result ice boxes and domestic refrigerators were a critical final stage in storage process without them most households could not use and consume ice blain pp 15 16 by 1816 tudor was selling boston refrigerators called little ice houses to households in charleston these were made of wood lined with iron and designed to hold three pounds 1 4 kg of ice weightman pp 53 54 household refrigerators were manufactured in 1840s on east coast most notably by darius eddy of massachusetts and winship of boston many of these were shipped west cummings pp 59 60 degree to which natural ice was adopted by local communities in 19th century heavily depended on availability and up take of ice boxes bain p 16 applications consumption thumb 180px an ice crusher designed to support specialised 19th century drinks ice trade enabled consumption of a wide range of new products during 19th century one simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks either being directly added to glass or barrel or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers worried about health risks although this rapidly vanished in us weightman p 65 by mid 19th century water was always chilled in america if possible weightman p 133 iced milk also popular and german lager traditionally drunk chilled also used ice weightman pp 134 171 drinks such as sherry cobblers and mint were created that could only be made using crushed ice there were distinct differences in 19th century american and european attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks with europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit british visitors to india were surprised to see anglo indian elite prepared to drink iced water weightman p xvii dickason p 72 some hindus in india regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons and as such an inappropriate food dickason p 73 large scale production of ice cream also resulted from ice trade ice cream had been produced in small quantities since at least 17th century but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it mcwilliams p 97 this was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect and also on constantly agitating mixture to produce light texture associated with ice cream weightman p xvii by 1820s and 1830s availability of ice in cities of u s east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular but still an essentially luxury product mcwilliams pp 97 98 in 1843 however a new ice cream maker was patented by nancy johnson which required far less physical effort and time similar designs were also produced in england and france mcwilliams p 98 combined with growing ice trade ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities mcwilliams pp 98 99 in britain norwegian ice was used by growing italian community in london from 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with general public blain p 21 commercial applications thumb 250px an 1870 refrigerator car showing ice stored at both ends ice trade revolutionised way that food was preserved and transported before 19th century preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead blain p 6 although using ice to chill foods was a relatively simple process it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems in early stages of ice trade there was also a tension between preserving limited supply of ice by limiting flow of air over it and preserving food which depended on circulating more air over ice to create colder temperatures cummings p 34 early approaches to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes to solve problem of how to take small quantities of products short distances to market thomas moore an engineer from maryland invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803 this involved a large insulated wooden box with a tin container of ice embedded in top cummings pp 4 5 this refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation rather than ventilation but design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders and illegal copies abounded cummings p 5 by 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in meat trade taking advantage of growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve food by 1840s improved supplies and an understanding of importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in u s cummings pp 34 35 thumb left an icing and loading railroad platform norfolk virginia c 1900 with development of u s railroad system natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through invention of refrigerator car first refrigerator cars emerged in late 1850s and early 1860s and were crude constructions holding up to 3 000 lbs 1 360 kg of ice on top of which food was placed weld pp 11 12 it was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish subsequent designs hung meat from hooks allowing meat to breathe while swinging carcasses improved circulation in car armour p 20 after civil war j b sutherland john bate and william davis all patented improved refrigerator cars which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool cummings pp 65 66 this improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in car and causing damage to goods hiles p 93 salt could be added to ice to increase cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car which preserved foods even better for much of 19th century different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines which was a problem when ice was continually melting by 1860s refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process natural ice became essential to transportation of perishable foods over railroads slaughtering and dressing meat then transporting it was much more efficient in terms of freight costs and opened up industries of mid west while as industrialist jonathan armour argued ice and refrigerator cars changed growing of fruits and berries from a gamble to a national industry armour pp 17 18 29 weld pp 15 16 hiles p 94 refrigerated ships were also made possible through ice trade allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally first from u s and then from countries such as argentina and australia early ships had stored their chilled goods along with main cargo of ice first ships to transport chilled meat to britain designed by bate adapted railroad refrigerator cars using ice at either end of hold and a ventilation fan to keep meat cool an improved version invented by james craven piped a brine solution through ice and then hold to keep meat cool and created a drier atmosphere in hold preserving meat better natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches initially in eastern american fisheries blain p 16 in 1858 grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches and fishing industry became biggest single user of ice in britain blain pp 18 21 weightman p 164 natural ice was put to many uses ice trade enabled its widespread use in medicine in attempts to treat diseases and to alleviate their symptoms as well as making tropical hospitals more bearable in calcutta for example part of each ice shipment was specially reserved in city s ice house for use of local doctors dickason pp 71 72 by middle of 19th century british royal navy was using imported ice to cool interiors of its ships gun turrets dickason p 80 in 1864 and
