write a work of fiction of kind that she would like to read specifically waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting diverging from previous lesbian themed books such as isabel

norms existed during period as she stated i find it a fascinating period because it feels very close to us and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange many of things we think we know about it are stereotypes or simply wrong considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage waters was influenced by oscar wilde and chris hunt who wrote street lavender an historical novel with gay male themes also set in victorian era she has stated that tipping velvet is a female version of street lavender with a plot similar to my secret life by walter taylor debbie 2004 sarah waters 20 pp 15

bethnal green shown here in a map from 1911 greatest literary strengths in tipping velvet according to reviewers and literary scholars are vibrant portrayal of districts and streets of london and waters ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested harriet malinowitz in women s review of books for example malinowitz cites scene when nan first meets kitty removing her glove to shake kitty s hand very much an oyster girl nan s hands are covered with those rank sea scents of liquor and oyster flesh crab meat and whelks which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family for so many years we had ceased entirely to notice them nan is mortified that she smells like a herring but kitty her fears kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid waters p 33 malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights sounds and smells in victorian london as examples of elements that are

guardian london p 9 nan s path through plot indicates that tipping velvet is part bildungsroman and her journeys through streets of london invoke elements of a picaresque novel scholar emily jeremiah characterises story as a bildungsroman a coming of age adventure but one that far surpasses a simple coming out story stefania ciocia in literary london writes that plot has classical elements of a fairy tale as it follows main character s growth and progression and has a moral ending that includes a course of events where nan forsakes three suitors for her in this case princess charming nan

unapologetic celebration of lesbian eroticism and sexual diversity sarah waters in contemporary british novelists by rennison nick 2005 routledge donna allegra writes with appreciation of how existence of waters characters in a heterosexual existence forces an analysis of closeted positions sexism of period puts a stranglehold on women forcing readers to compare women in victorian era with present day sexual attitudes nan never has difficulty accepting her love for kitty butler and other women kitty s union with walter however reeks of lesbophobia according to allegra music halls could be rough in some areas but kitty is shown handling drunken and rowdy audiences with humour and grace only instance where she is overcome and flees stage is when a drunken patron shouts a euphemism for a lesbian at her this episode leads to final scene of part i when nan stumbles upon kitty and walter in bed kitty does not display any pleasure in their union but rather complacence tinged with shame waters pp 170 171 allegra compares kitty s desire for normality overshadowing her desire for love with nan to compulsory heterosexuality emblematic of and particular to lesbian existence scholar paulina palmer asserts that waters in tipping velvet and her two following novels also set in victorian era affinity and fingersmith is establishing a literary tradition that has not existed women engaging in same sex relationships in victorian era were on whole invisible and we have little knowledge of their literary interests waters however acknowledges that accuracy about lesbian life in victorian era is not her primary goal my purpose was not to be authentic but to imagine a history that we can t really recover short bursts of lesbian themed literary activity occurred in 1920s with authors such as natalie clifford barney and djuna barnes another surge of activity published as lesbian pulp fiction occurred in 1950s and early 1960s during which several notable lesbian authors such as ann bannon and valerie taylor helped to establish lesbian literary identity these fictions helped to inform readers about lives and cultural landmarks of lesbians when very little information existed waters states that she is not on a deliberate crusade to write about lesbians but that it is a reflection of what she knows lesbianism is at top of agenda for my books because it s at top of agenda for my life it would be bizarre not to write about it in 2009 as she reflected on her reasons for writing tipping velvet and fingersmith waters said she was searching for her own identity as a lesbian writer among waters victorian set novels depictions of sexual encounters are also according to palmer most vivid in tipping velvet a review in advocate calls book riotously sexy and seattle

follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour or employed it as an erotic element controlled by and for benefit of men lesbian literary scholar bonnie zimmerman writes lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject patriarchal stereotype of lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed it is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in closet or under covers we don t wish to give world another stick with which to beat us gender nan not only experiences a series of misadventures and lesbian relationships but also shifts from female to male at same time giving reader an opportunity to view london society from multiple perspectives gender masquerade and reaction to it permeates novel according to harriet malinowitz waters uses symbolism of clothing such as skirts pants stays braces bonnets ties and with sort of metaphorical significance that melville gives to whales stefania ciocia declares that in all of 19th century english literature only type of character who was able to enjoy adventures native to picaresque novel were males who acted as observer or stroller walking through city from one district to next single

bridges this divide waters often employs word queer to describe unusual or remarkable instead of its post 1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality she also uses term specifically to highlight what is unusual as it applies to gender or nan s own emotions toward kitty nan s father uses symbol of oyster what he calls a real queer fish that exhibits both male and female characteristics and compares

a large clitoris which they consider congenital in lower class women they attempt to prove their point with diana s maid zena but nan prevents this humiliation which precipitates her final rift with

filled with socialist literature although diana is a supporter of women s suffrage she discourages nan from reading such literature confiscating any political material nan picks up in contrast nan
