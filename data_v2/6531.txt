plot threads at metacritic which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews film received an average score of 50 out of 100 based on 36 critics indicating mixed or average reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of a on an a to f scale reviewer alex billington noted this is just how film industry works nowadays critics give bad opinions public usually has a differing opinion and all is well in world of hollywood since studios made their millions anyway drew mcweeny praised film s complexity as giving it repeat viewing value and its conclusion as perhaps most canny move it makes todd gilchrist found story too similar to other cinematic trilogies such as star wars but praised production values brian lowry felt that unlike last year s bloated sequel it at least possesses some semblance of a destination making it slightly more coherent if no less numbing during protracted finale total film praised performances but complained that twists and exposition made it hard to care for characters edward douglas liked film but had issues with its pacing while blake wright criticized davy jones locker and calypso segments james berardinelli found it weakest of trilogy as last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of previous installments which doesn t account for other 108 minutes of this gorged self indulgent and uneven production peter travers praised richards and rush but felt there can indeed be too much of a good thing regarding depp s character travers later declared movie to be one of worst films of year colm andrew of manx independent said film was overall a disappointment and that final showdown is a non event and repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by end review by colm andrew iom today retrieved march 27 2011 richard roeper gave a positive review saying gore verbinski and stunt and special effects crews have created one of most impressive blends of live action work and cgi wizardry ever put on film and believing it rarely drags and is almost always entertaining he praised performances of actors as one of best things about film chow yun fat s character stirred a great deal of controversy with chinese press perry lam of hong kong cultural magazine muse found an offensive resemblance between chow s character and fu manchu now fu manchu has returned after an absence of 27 years in hollywood cinema except that in a nod to political correctness and marketing realities he is no longer called fu manchu box office pirates of caribbean at world s end earned 309 420 425
