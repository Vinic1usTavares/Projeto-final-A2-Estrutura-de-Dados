battle of lira was one of last battles in uganda tanzania war fought between tanzania and its uganda national liberation front unlf allies and uganda army troops loyal to idi amin on 15 may 1979 tanzanian led forces easily routed lira s garrison of amin loyalists and then intercepted and destroyed one retreating column of uganda army soldiers near town idi amin had seized power in uganda in 1971 and established a brutal dictatorship seven years later he attempted to invade neighbouring tanzania to south attack was repulsed and tanzanians launched a counter attack into ugandan territory after a number of battles amin s regime and military largely collapsed whereupon tanzania and its ugandan allies of unlf began to mop up last pro amin holdouts in uganda s east and north one of these was town of lira whose capture was entrusted to a force consisting of tanzanian 201st brigade and unlf s kikosi maalum force while approaching lira tanzanian unlf force divided into two groups with main force attacking town from south other force was ordered to set up an ambush along western approach in order to destroy uganda army troops who attempted to flee town tanzanian led troops began their assault on lira on 15 may 1979 and garrison began to retreat one column of retreating soldiers ran into advancing tanzanian unlf troops west of town and was almost completely destroyed lira was consequently occupied by tanzanians and unlf fighters without further resistance background thumb left map of battles of uganda tanzania war in 1971 idi amin launched a military coup that overthrew president of uganda milton obote precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring state of tanzania amin installed himself as president and ruled country under a repressive dictatorship in october 1978 amin launched an invasion of tanzania tanzania halted assault mobilised anti amin opposition groups and launched a counter offensive in a matter of months tanzania people s defence force tpdf and its ugandan rebel allies unified under umbrella organisation uganda national liberation front abbreviated unlf defeated uganda army in a number of battles and occupied kampala uganda s capital on 11 april 1979 with his military disintegrating or already in open revolt amin s rule was finished having escaped from kampala he consequently traveled to a succession of cities in eastern and northern uganda urging his remaining forces to go back and fight enemy who had invaded our country even as he prepared to flee into exile most uganda army units opted to surrender desert or defect to tanzanian led forces but some decided to continue to fight for amin s collapsing regime thus tanzanians and unlf allies continued their advance to secure eastern northwestern and northern uganda tanzanian 201st brigade under brigadier imran kombe and a smaller number of unlf fighters were ordered to capture important town of lira in north unlf fighters consisted of kikosi maalum members loyal to ex president obote and were led by lieutenant colonel david oyite ojok entire force consisted of about 5 000 troops lira was home to one of largest uganda army barracks in country throughout spring of 1979 amin loyalists harassed abducted and murdered residents in surrounding area because many had tribal links to obote and were thus considered suspect they also maintained a roadblock in town and harassed passing civilians after fall of kampala uganda army troops from south moved into lira and local population fled soldiers then looted all of town s shops and banks prelude thumb right map of central uganda including main roads in red and lake kyoga in center kombe realised that most obvious way to approach lira was from west along main road which was located at lake kyoga s western side uganda army garrison was probably expecting that tanzanians would take this route to surprise amin loyalists kombe consequently decided to instead cross lake kyoga by boat then take small roads through nearby swamps and attack lira from south this plan had additional benefit of preventing 201st brigade from running into other tanzanian units reducing risk of possible intermingling and confusion one major drawback to kombe s idea was however that lake kyoga lacked ships large enough to transport all his men across let alone tanks and artillery with some help from locals 201st brigade s scouts managed to find at least one small and old but functional ferry at on lake kyoga s eastern side pilot initially refused to let soldiers use his ship which was owned by a uganda army officer kombe gave him food and cooking oil and assured him that he could keep ferry once war was over he then agreed to help tanzanians and started to transport 201st brigade from near nakasongola across lake in twenty hour shifts though he and tanzanian soldiers had to deal with constant engine breakdowns at one point wooden paddles on one of wheels broke loose and tanzanian soldiers had to retrieve them from lake and lash them back to wheel after almost a week entire brigade was moved but its tanks too heavy for transport were left behind after crossing lake kyoga tanzanian unlf force advanced toward lira at same time kombe refined his plans he wanted to secure a tangible victory at lira but knew that uganda army had repeatedly put up only a token resistance at several locations and then retreated in order to prevent amin loyalists in town from escaping kombe subsequently decided to split his force and have one small unit set up an ambush west of lira while main force would frontally attack town if amin loyalists attempted to flee they would run into ambushing force and be annihilated he selected lieutenant colonel roland chacha s battalion of 600 tanzanians supported by 150 unlf fighters to set up ambush these troops would travel lightly taking only small arms and a few light mortars with them though scouts who were supposed to chart path for chacha s force failed to return kombe ordered operation to begin by midafternoon on 14 may tanzanian unlf force moved out of village of toward lira which lay 25 miles to north at first chacha s troops continued their march on road directly toward lira in order to lure amin loyalists into believing that they were preparing for frontal assault tanzanian and unlf troops suffered from intense heat and progress was slow also because ugandan rebels suffered from indiscipline and often broke ranks to take water from sympathetic civilians on sides of road this stopped after chacha stripped one of his uniform for straying from column and ejected him from army when night fell chacha s column diverted from road and began its trek through bush toward area selected for ambush progress was hindered by darkness it was a moonless night difficult terrain and lack of maps so that chacha had to rely on a compass and dead reckoning to find way despite this tanzanian unlf force had to cover forty miles in order to reach its target before morning and pace was consequently a near run associated press later described march as gruelling nevertheless chacha s forces remained completely silent and thus fooled amin loyalists into believing that they were still at main road tanzanian unlf force was in fact so silent that entire 750 strong column passed by a local hut without waking its inhabitants around 2 a m lira s garrison started to shell former position of chacha s battalion after nearly 20 hours of marching tanzanian unlf force reached gulu road at dawn and took shelter in an adjacent orchard they found chacha s scouts there who stated that they had been too exhausted to return to battalion chacha ordered unlf fighters to assume positions along road while his men rested in case ugandan forces passed through meanwhile over course of night one detachment of 201st brigade moved around to eastern flank of lira cutting it off from while another took up position north of town to block access to kitgum in anticipation of attack estimated 300 strong garrison of lira destroyed bridges east of town and established defences there and to south battle kombe launched his attack later in morning on 15 may with a 30 minute artillery bombardment of lira followed by an advance into town a significant part of uganda army garrison started to retreat along western road as expected upon hearing artillery fire chacha s force began its advance down road towards lira which was 12 kilometres away one tanzanian company stayed in rear as reserve one moved along road and one swept bush along right flank unlf troops moved through bush on left flank some of amin loyalists who fled immediately after beginning of kombe s attack managed to escape area tanzanian unlf force advanced down western road until a ugandan truck came into view on crest of a hill driver saw troops and quickly turned around and drove out of sight five minutes later five ugandan trucks a bus and several land rovers pulled over crest of hill one of land rovers was mounted with a 106 mm recoilless rifle while two of trucks towed double barreled antiaircraft machine guns convoy quickly moved to bottom of hill tanzanians initially thought that group planned to surrender instead ugandan soldiers set up antiaircraft guns and opened fire while land rover with recoilless rifle pulled off into thicket when chacha and his bodyguard stood up to get a better look at convoy latter was hit instantly in head and killed tanzanian led troops thus realised that uganda army soldiers aim was relatively good outranged tanzanian unlf force had to stay close to ground and advance very slowly while closing in on convoy to bring their own weapons to bear recoilless rifle also opened fire though its first shot missed tanzanians by 200 meters ugandan gunner readjusted and next shells landed increasingly closer to chacha s position worrying tanzanians despite this 201st brigade s soldiers remained calm and continued to move toward their enemies and when one shell hit ground only fifty meters from tanzanians without an explosion they realised that amin loyalists were using wrong ammunition recoilless rifle was firing heat shells which were supposed to be used against armored targets such as tanks but extremely ineffective against infantry as his forces moved closer to ugandans chacha ordered rocket propelled grenades to be fired into air weapons were employed too far away to inflict any damage but chacha hoped that explosions would frighten ugandan troops thumb left burning wreckage of uganda army convoy along gulu road tanzanian unlf force was thus able to get close enough to use their mortars without suffering significant casualties after two misses tanzanians struck lead land rover in ugandan column setting it ablaze they gradually advanced their fire down road and within a few minutes most of vehicles had been destroyed wreckage of convoy burned detonating fuel and ammunition stocks a single land rover that had avoided being struck drove towards tanzanians in an attempt to effect a breakout it was disabled with gunfire and its three occupants were shot as they attempted to flee surviving uganda army soldiers scattered and fled into nearby swamp along left side of road they were pursued by unlf fighters while tanzanians celebrated their victory and took measure of uganda army s losses when unlf fighters returned to road with eight prisoners they were thus ignored by tanzanian soldiers militants discussed what to do with captured soldiers with some arguing for summary execution and others for turning them over to tanzanian military one unlf fighter eventually decided dispute on his own by simply shooting prisoners believing combat to be over some tanzanian soldiers grew lax and walked past destroyed convoy only to be targeted by a uganda army sniper who promptly killed two this incident however marked last serious resistance of uganda army at lira all remaining amin loyalists fled and 18 more ugandan soldiers were captured by tpdf on other roads out of town rest of uganda army loyalists fled north tanzanian unlf force occupied lira without further resistance on 15 or 16 may town was mostly deserted many civilians had fled out of fear of amin loyalist garrison and some properties were found looted at least part of civilian population reportedly greeted unlf with enthusiasm lifting oyite ojok onto their shoulders in celebration in all over 70 uganda army soldiers were killed in battle while just four tanzanians died and four others were wounded amin loyalists also lost important military equipment at lira diminishing their ability to further resist northward advance by tanzanian unlf forces aftermath lira was last place where disintegrating uganda army attempted to make an organised stand though scattered bands of amin loyalists continued to fight tanzanian unlf forces such as during battle of falls sudan news agency attempting to frame conflict as an anti islamic campaign erroneously reported that tpdf massacred muslims after occupying lira kombe allowed chacha s battalion to stay in town for four days to recuperate in its final action of war 201st brigade subsequently peacefully occupied kitgum which had been taken over by anti amin militiamen thus removing all towns east of white nile from pro amin control unit was thus second tpdf brigade to complete its allotted tasks for conflict war ended on 3 june when tpdf reached sudanese border and expelled last pro amin forces from uganda remnants of uganda army subsequently reorganised in northwestern border regions and launched a rebellion against new ugandan government in 1980 at same time kikosi maalum initiated a mass recruitment campaign in lira and surrounding areas with amin defeated various rebel factions that had formed unlf were preparing for a showdown with each other lango people who lived in region around lira were regarded as toward obote and thus secretly recruited trained armed and organised into militias by kikosi maalum to help obote seize power in uganda and destroy his rivals to keep these war preparations secret kikosi maalum forcibly expelled all non lango inhabitants from lira and apac one group that reportedly suffered most from this policy were region s nubians whose lands and properties were seized by new authorities in lira nubians were regarded as partisans of idi amin notes references citations works cited external links ambush near lira 15 may 1979 category uganda tanzania war category 1979 in uganda category
