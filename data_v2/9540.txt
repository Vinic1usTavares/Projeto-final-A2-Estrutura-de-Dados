up to date on project s progress much of quality assurance process took form of public beta testing at exhibitions on its release joe danger received generally positive reviews most reviewers praised accessible gameplay and ability to edit courses while playing them some suggested game would have benefited from more options such as sharing and rating user generated content and criticised lack of an online multiplayer mode hello games subsequently released downloadable content to add features that users and reviewers had requested in months following game s release using leaderboard statistics joe danger was estimated to have sold at least 108 000 units in its first three months on sale it was nominated for several awards including grand prize at 2010 independent games festival gameplay player controls motorbike stuntman joe danger and guides him through ten trials to defeat his nemeses members of team nasty game uses elements of both racing and side scrolling platform genres in which protagonist can move to right and by reversing to left as well as hopping over and ducking under various obstacles although game is based on a two dimensional plane some of its courses are designed with three layers accessible by changing lanes bike is controllable in air allowing various tricks to be performed for which points are awarded with higher scores awarded for long trick sequences and for manoeuvring onto targets executing a stunt will build a boost meter which is used to increases joe s speed but drains meter select button is used to teleport joe back to last checkpoint passed thumb left alt player character hitting a giant boxing glove one of obstacles with a comic book style graphic boxing glove obstacle is representative of art director grant duncan s artwork and comic level design inspiration for which came from past jobs with sega joe danger level design was directly influenced by sonic hedgehog game series as evidenced by use of avoidable spikes vertical loops and springs placed in levels to allow higher jumps some elements are designed to hinder player such as conveyor belts which slow motorbike oversized boxing gloves which will propel player backwards and barricades which make it necessary to switch to an alternative lane primary goal in each level is to collect as many stars as possible a star is collected for completing an objective and once enough are collected next course is unlocked critics compared this process to that used in super mario bros titles player is free to choose which objectives to complete with option of replaying a level to earn more stars most common objective is to finish a course within a time limit with as many points as possible other level specific objectives include collecting a series of coins hidden stars or letters spelling danger while in others player is required to land on every target or to complete a course in one continuous sequence of tricks later levels require player to do more than one objective simultaneously joe danger contains a sandbox mode which allows player to drag and drop objects onto course to customise levels this mode is integrated into some single player levels where game may instruct player to introduce obstacles such as ramps to access later sections new levels can be shared online with friends via playstation network game has a split screen multiplayer mode for up to four players on a selection of specially made tracks there is leaderboard support initially limited to those on player s playstation network friend list development hello games was formed in 2008 by former criterion and electronic arts employee sean murray together with three friends who had experience with british videogame developers climax and sumo murray who held technical director and lead programmer roles working on playstation 2 games burnout 3 takedown and black became managing director of hello games with grant duncan as art director ryan doyle as technical director and david ream as creative director team gained their first experiences of creating their own games by making levels for doom and unreal doyle expressed belief that smaller games could be created more cost effectively by an independent group than by a larger company according to doyle concept for joe danger arose from team s wish to make something that puts a smile on people s faces similar to games such as mario kart and micro machines an evel knievel toy was a main source of inspiration for joe character team had fun firing that stunt cycle out of windows and down halls nevertheless murray likened work as an independent developer to reality of eating ice cream every day for every meal as novelty of working for themselves wore off team often spent more than 60 hours a week working on project because of unrealistic time scales for development and with only four team members each had to fulfil several roles they had no public relations representative nor did they have a business manager or a designer no software design document was made throughout production of joe danger since team felt they understood each other s ideas thumb left staff of hello games in their office in guildford from left david ream sean murray grant duncan and ryan doyle game was announced on developers website on 23 september 2009 and given its first public showcase in november 2009 at eurogamer expo in earls court team used this event as an opportunity for extensive playtesting receiving feedback from those playing game and creating new software builds for each day of expo murray cited numerous happy accidents during development which led to incorporation of various features into end product an example of this was a bug in programming which enabled players to jump as often as they liked in mid air team decided this was fun and incorporated it as a double jump hello games struggled to find a third party publisher for game a month after release murray revealed at annual develop developers conference in brighton some of reasons publishers gave for their rejections there were worries about lack of potential for porting it to other platforms and comments such as collecting giant coins feels unrealistic to me and we want games that are less about fun right now one prospective publisher intimated that they might have published game if main character had been a monkey when players were invited to make suggestions for additional characters there was popular support for monkey idea this led to introduction of a downloadable bonus character chuckles chimp after nine months looking for a publisher team ran out of money murray later came up with idea of selling his home to help fund development he explained to jessica conditt of engadget that he considered house like a blood diamond since it was paid for with money earned at his job with electronic arts release after initially being unsure of best platform on which to release joe danger developers announced in march 2010 that they would be releasing game only on sony s playstation 3 this decision enabled hello to make use of sony s publishing fund a scheme which offered advantageous financial terms in exchange for exclusivity murray said that playstation network was ideal place to release game because it was only way they could publish by themselves and branded xbox live arcade platform a slaughterhouse for small developers due to poor sales figures for independent works joe danger was released on 8 june 2010 in north american playstation store with a european release following day in october 2011 eurogamer picked up on an xbox live arcade listing for a joe danger special edition on korea media rating board project was officially announced on 3 november a gamespot exclusive trailer was released same day murray said that special edition will include new gameplay modes and characters another new addition is laboratory mode in which player must complete unique developer challenges edition was released on 14 december 2011 and was exclusive to xbox 360 murray stood by his earlier statements criticising microsoft s platform he said obviously a comment like that isn t meant exactly how it sounds for probably a few years xbla was basically only show in town if you managed to get your game on there it was almost a guarantee of success i don t think that s case now that isn t microsoft s fault and it isn t developers fault it s just that a hundred games come out there a year and of those maybe ten break through and make an impact rest don t he stressed decision to port game made business sense and that team jumped at chance without even thinking about economics of it since release of special edition a spin off version for ios and android devices has been in development team decided not to directly adapt original game for new device murray told mike rose of gamasutra that simply porting a game is never something i could get excited about it s soulless work he explained that team s aim is to create a game with similar graphics to a console game while also keeping frame rate at 60 frames per second game is being co developed by steven burgess who previously worked on wiiware game with frontier developments it was given its first public showcase at penny arcade expo in boston massachusetts on 7 april ios version titled joe danger touch was listed on itunes store on 10 january 2013 a version of game for playstation vita was announced on 27 august 2014 containing both levels from original game and levels exclusive to playstation vita it was made available for free on playstation plus instant game collection service in september 2014 there are 25 playable characters available in game as well as a modified level editor downloadable content since game s initial release additional downloadable content has been made available first patch for game dubbed people s patch was released in august 2010 adding two features ability to upload video replays to youtube and ability to share customised courses with those not on player s friends list their absence had been source of early criticism by reviewers other additional features included custom soundtracks new levels and alternative costumes announcement of game s expansion coincided with a level designing competition in which top five contestants won t shirts and artwork murray said hello were trying to respond to all suggestions from users and that they would release a patch addressing every concern we could in november 2010 team announced four new playable characters each with a unique appearance and range of moves reception critical single player gameplay mode of joe danger was generally well received by critics game s accessibility was a source of praise according to eric neigher of 1up com it allows for five minute sprints of gameplay although more in depth options take up more time ign s daemon hatfield compared game favourably to nintendo entertainment system launch title excitebike and said that joe danger felt like a nintendo game other critics focused on similarities to super mario bros such as non linear level progression ability to play levels in any order providing that player has earned enough stars to unlock level encouragement to play through multiple times to complete every objective and use of platforms another influences noted with favour by critics was combo system which some compared with tony hawk s series of skateboarding games comments were also made on influence of early sonic hedgehog titles cheerful cartoon like nature of joe danger artwork was well received eurogamer s tom bramwell said i ve worked on games websites for over a decade and not enough games are happy and colourful this one is more of this please everyone opinions were less uniformly complimentary about other modes of game scott alan marriott of g4 tv was disappointed with shortage of options in multiplayer modes in particular inability to play against others online game s leaderboard feature was another source of criticism with several reviewers noting severe lag issues daily telegraph martin gaston said it would also have been nice to see game give dedicated players opportunity to study from world s finest by implementing online replays an option not originally included decision not to allow sharing custom courses with users outside player s friend s list was labelled questionable and obtuse minor criticisms related to lack of variety in sound design and background scenery two months after initial release hello games first patch for joe danger contained features to cover most critics concerns before its release joe danger was up for seumas mcnally grand prize and for technical excellence award at 2010 independent games festival at game developers conference losing to monaco what s yours is mine and limbo respectively game was unsuccessfully nominated for best new download ip award at same year s

network gamers choice awards in march 2011 but was beaten by dead nation it appeared in best downloadable game category at gamesmaster golden joystick awards in september 2011 but missed out to minecraft same month play placed it top of its 50 best psn games feature ahead of titles such as braid and last guy commercial joe danger sold over 50 000 units in its first week on sale on playstation network team announced at develop conference 2010 that they broke even on day of release based on research published by gamasutra s ryan langley who used number of unique entries on a game s online leaderboard to estimate number of sales it sold more than 68 000 units in its first month of release in july same statistics indicated a further 24 000 units had been sold bringing two month total to over 92 000 next month saw at least 16 000 new players exact sales figures are uncertain because only a limited number of scores can be held within a leaderboard for playstation network games but on basis of these numbers game sold at least 108 000 units in its first three months murray said that as joe danger does not allow scores of zero to make leaderboards true quantity sold was likely to be substantially higher than indicated in december 2011 playstation network s senior director susan panico named joe danger year s third best selling game to be supported by sony s publishing fund behind hoard and tales from space about a blob sales for xbox live arcade version were less impressive langley s statistics indicate that 8 300 units sold in first week and by december s end that figure rested at around 16 800 at least 6 800 further sales were noted with same technique in january 2012 and by march overall figure was thought to be least 37 500 units sequel several months after joe danger release hello games began to advertise positions on their website indicating that work was proceeding on a new project new staff were added and towards end of year organisation moved its offices after an announcement on hello games website a week prior joe danger movie was presented for first time at gamescom in cologne in august 2011 murray said game is kind of a sequel to joe danger
