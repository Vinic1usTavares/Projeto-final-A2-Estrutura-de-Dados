a department of munitions and supply it was some months before department was established in meantime howe supervised war purchasing board howe worked to persuade many of his business contacts to work for him or for other government departments roberts suggests that no political minister could have done that as many of howe s recruits were conservatives according to historian and author michael

western prince in december 1940 this was an intensely dangerous trip germany was attempting to blockade britain and there were many german submarines in north atlantic one of those submarines sank western prince on 14 december howe survived sinking and eight hours in a lifeboat gordon scott his aide was killed trying to climb from lifeboat to rescuing ship howe professed coolness in incident

address given nichols was surprised to find that howe was minister of munitions and supply and found him most friendly howe was told about manhattan project and nichols was told that eldorado was now a crown company according to roberts what howe started in 1940 was an industrial revolution so widespread that most canadians were unaware of its extent or of its penetration into country s economy although there had been increases in production throughout first three years of war minister s efforts truly bore fruit in 1943 in which canada had fourth highest industrial production among allies trailing only us ussr and britain by 1944 canada had produced over 600 ships for war effort 1 100 aircraft and over half a million cars and trucks of which 31 000 were armoured according to roberts howe s actions swung canada s economy from agriculture based to industrial a change which would prove permanent howe stated in 1943 never again will there be any doubt that canada can manufacture anything that can be manufactured elsewhere what s a million during debate on howe s war spending estimates in 1945 which totalled 1 365 billion howe answered an opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced i dare say my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount but a million dollars from war appropriations bill would not be a very important matter saskatchewan tory mp john diefenbaker spoke following day and alleged that howe had said we may save a million dollars but what of it howe angrily denied quote accusing diefenbaker of being a past master of distortion language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary diefenbaker sharpened anecdote over time and it emerged in its final form as howe saying what s a million even liberals who knew that howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just sort of thing he could have said in years to come what s a million would be a mocking tory attack on liberals most often directed at howe in 1942 canada requested and was given a place on combined production and resources board alongside u s and britain howe served as chief executive officer for canada postwar mackenzie king years thumb hon c d howe watches a scientist test curve of a lens by interference fringes at instruments division in canadian arsenals ltd optical plant in october 1944 mackenzie king appointed howe

another fortune in business among those who urged howe to remain was minister of justice louis st laurent with whom howe forged a strong relationship prime minister obtained a dissolution of parliament in april 1945 in ensuing election liberals obtained a bare majority over conservatives renamed progressive conservatives and other parties howe was intensively involved in liberal fundraising and campaigned nationally for its candidates he was easily returned in port arthur taking just over half of all votes cast with co operative commonwealth federation predecessor of today s new democratic party a distant second mackenzie king himself was defeated in his saskatchewan riding but was returned in an ontario by election within months prime minister was now past 70 years of age and tired howe favoured as quick a transition to a peacetime economy as possible most industries in which there were not shortages were released from government controls in late 1945 labour leaders fearing unemployment wanted to keep wartime government plants in production howe opposed such proposals when union members who were laid off from research enterprises limited r e l confronted howe on a golf course minister stated r e l was a war time plant war is through plant is through and your union what happens to your union is up to you get hell off of course in disposing of redundant government property howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored since end of boer war and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years he strove to eliminate such anachronisms however howe was slower to release economic controls according to roberts although he worked to return country s economic power to private hands he often seemed as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to parliament in november 1945 howe s wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form department of reconstruction and supply howe was determined to support technologically advanced industries and saw no reason why canada should not continue to produce aircraft after war his director general for aircraft production ralph bell disagreed with him noting that canada had no aircraft engine manufacturer and that despite presence of manufacturing plants and skilled workers there was no guarantee that they could sell their products nevertheless howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business allowing british hawker siddeley group to take over victory aircraft as a v roe canada avro canada while was sold to us

proceed their names with right honourable mackenzie king recommended two cabinet members but not howe after honours were announced on new year s day 1946 howe demanded a meeting with mackenzie king told prime minister that he felt his war service was being slighted and threatened his resignation mackenzie king calmed howe down and arranged for howe to receive honour in june this created additional ill feeling among other members of cabinet two more were elevated in 1947 new year s honours after which prime minister refused to consider any more in february 1947 mackenzie king fell ill with pneumonia and after recovering spent a month on vacation in united states with st laurent by then secretary of state for external affairs as acting prime minister in july minister of national defence brooke claxton warned mackenzie king that issue of prime minister s age and uncertainty of succession was causing political difficulties for liberals mackenzie king consulted howe who bluntly stated that it was best that mackenzie king go out while still retaining his full faculties and before a crisis erupted after talk prime minister decided that he should retire within a year and that st laurent who had recently threatened to leave cabinet and return home to quebec should be successor howe was among those who persuaded st laurent not to resign he also helped persuade st laurent to stand for leadership offering to remain in cabinet to assist quebecer st laurent government thumb left hon c d howe and vermont governor william h wills join us and canadian segments of an oil pipeline on 20 january 1948 mackenzie king announced his intent to resign he also announced a cabinet reshuffle both st laurent and howe had urged prime minister to move howe who had not enjoyed his work at ministry of reconstruction and supply mackenzie king finally yielded moving james angus mackinnon minister of trade and commerce to open his place for howe albertan became minister of fisheries howe publicly announced that he was not available to stand for leadership and that he was supporting st laurent quebecer was elected leader of liberal party in august and mackenzie king finally resigned on 15 november at age 66 st laurent was only seven years younger than mackenzie king but was nevertheless seen as a breath of fresh air except at cabinet meetings where he reversed mackenzie king s smoking ban in october 1948 progressive conservatives also elected a new leader ontario premier george a drew drew had won three consecutive provincial elections taking even francophone ridings and tories perennially weak in quebec hoped that drew could repeat his success on a national scale drew defeated diefenbaker for leadership st laurent called an election for june 1949 and howe again was successful in fundraising from corporate backers major corporations from cpr to eaton s contributed to well financed liberal campaign liberals won a huge victory taking 190 seats to 40 for tories and howe again won port arthur easily drew had used howe s record as an election issue accusing him of being power mad and of selling off crown corporations for bargain prices but allegations got little traction according to howe only result of drew s attacks was to give me a record majority in port arthur in early 1950 st laurent considered recommending appointment of howe as governor general governor general had always been a british peer many nationalists wanted a canadian to hold post and st laurent agreed with them governor general viscount alexander was due to retire by 1953 by which time howe would be 68 st laurent saw this as a way of allowing his friend and colleague to step away from politics for a quieter life minister was willing to take post but position unexpectedly opened early when alexander was appointed to british cabinet howe decided he still had work to do as a minister he was also reluctant to exchange real power for nominal power of governor generalship st laurent recommended appointment of canadian born vincent massey who was duly appointed by king george vi mackenzie king died in 1950 by which time canada was again going to war this time in korea on train returning from former prime minister s funeral st laurent and his external relations minister lester pearson began planning troop movements howe saw it as wrong war in wrong place and thought that canadian troops should not be sent nevertheless he spent summer of 1950 at his desk making plans to implement government controls on booming economy in september 1950 howe tabled a bill allowing him to reallocate scarce materials such as steel from civilian sector to military use bill passed but not before opposition had charged that howe had an enormous appetite for power late in year government decided on a massive rearmament program as canadian commercial corporation crown corporation which handled government purchases was felt to be inadequate for task cabinet decided on a new department to handle procurement st laurent introduced a bill in february 1951 creating a department of defence production and announced that on passage howe would add that responsibility to his portfolio opposition parties objected to defence production act stating that there was no emergency justifying powers howe wanted according to roberts howe sought to implement rearmament by getting full power for himself and running rights over everyone and everything to get an urgent job done backed by overwhelming liberal majority bill passed and department was established on 1 april 1951 early 1950s saw an era of prosperity in canada in most years there was a government surplus in 1951 government introduced an old age pension for canadians to receive from age of 70 with little unemployment and thus a surplus in unemployment insurance fund coverage was extended to seasonal workers such as fishermen st laurent s supervision of his ministers was minimal at start of his tenure and decreased as years passed with opposition few in numbers ministers did as they wanted and when howe was accused by british columbia tory mp howard green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if people would let him howe replied who would stop us don t take yourself too seriously if we wanted to get away with it who would stop us despite avro canada s success in producing cf 100 canada s first jet fighter for royal canadian air force rcaf aircraft development had proven to be a time consuming and expensive process projected next generation aircraft canada s first supersonic jet interceptor cf 105 arrow was a more daunting project in terms of financial commitment and a leap in technological prowess howe wrote in a letter to defence minister claxton in 1952 that i am frightened for first time in my defence production experience government spent much of early 1953 in enacting remainder of its legislative program st laurent did not wish to call an election until after queen elizabeth s coronation on 2 june and eventually scheduled it for 10 august drew made large numbers of promises to voters and attempted to exploit a defence ministry scandal which had broken earlier in year at petawawa ontario army base an investigation had found frauds which included placing horses on payroll but liberals were not seriously challenged liberals lost 20 seats from their 1949 high water mark but still constituted almost two thirds of house of commons and no minister was defeated howe was again easily elected for port arthur pipeline debate thumb left map showing trans canada pipeline in green beginning in 1954 howe planned for pipelines to take alberta s natural gas to market there were us backed proposals to build pipelines directly to united states howe wanted a route passing north of great lakes which could supply toronto and montreal two rival groups contended for approval which howe had power to grant howe forced groups to work together on route he wanted in march 1955 st laurent tabled legislation to make department of defence production permanent this would also extend extraordinary powers of minister fearful of another damaging confrontation between howe and opposition cabinet agreed that st laurent would guide bill through but after first day of debate st laurent who was prone to depression absented himself tory frontbencher donald fleming contended that extension could make minister virtual dictator of economy with st laurent absent or when present silent howe took charge of bill and according to his biographers robert bothwell and william kilbourn utterly failed to perceive that bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to opposition when howe alluded to avro arrow project and that he was out on a limb for 30 million which gave him shudders opposition met statement with jeers and cries of what s a million tories were supported by social credit mps while government gained support of ccf on this issue interrupted by a lengthy governmental trip by howe to australia and new zealand debate stretched on until midyear in early july howe left town for a long weekend after asking st laurent and minister of finance walter harris to maintain his stand while he was gone although he gave harris authority to do as he saw fit without informing howe st laurent contacted drew and two men agreed that minister s powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed amended bill passed commons in howe s absence and when he returned he furiously accused harris of making a deal behind his back however when howe was told that it had been prime minister s decision he accepted it howe had earlier turned down an opposition offer to agree to a three year extension of his ministerial powers saying that would mean coming back to parliament in three years and i ve more to do with my time than amusing parliament extension was allowed to expire in 1959 although by then howe had left office pipeline project was wracked with financing difficulties pipeline company wanted government to guarantee loans needed to build what would become known as trans canada pipeline but cabinet refused fearful of political implications of giving a large sum of government money to a us dominated corporation howe was embittered by this decision and grumbled that he was now part of a government which has fallen into hands of children a solution was proposed by howe s deputy minister mitchell sharp government and province of ontario would themselves build most expensive part of route in northern ontario to be reimbursed by trans canada once pipeline was open for business this was approved by both governments by 1956 however further difficulties had arisen until us government granted formal approval for a part of route which connected to us pipelines trans canada could not raise enough money to build its portion approval was a matter of routine but delay would mean that construction on pipeline could not begin until spring of 1957 howe was determined that pipeline not be delayed and proposed that government advance money to pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956 he emotionally pleaded with his cabinet colleagues who agreed both to proposal and to use of rarely used closure to limit debate closure had not been applied in house since 1932 issue was attractive to tories and ccf with an election due within two years it would allow them to portray howe as an arrogant dictator and play to those citizens who disliked american involvement in pipeline project if bill did not receive royal assent by 7 june 1956 options that trans canada held for steel pipe would expire bothwell and kilbourn describe howe s speech opening pipeline debate as probably best of his career he told commons that waiting a year would be imprudent given worldwide shortage of steel pipe and unfair to those who owned natural gas wells in western canada which were presently capped howe told house he believed this to be a great project of truly national scope which we must either launch now or see languish for years to come he completed his address by giving notice that following day government intended to invoke closure social credit with many members from alberta supported bill while tories and ccf engaged in weeks of bitter debate and parliamentary wrangling this culminated on 1 june dubbed by tories black friday when speaker rene beaudoin reversed a ruling he had made previous evening which would have allowed opposition to continue debate past deadline opposition accused speaker of yielding to government pressure bill passed within deadline and construction on pipeline began immediately howe wrote i should not like to face a general election at this moment fortunately we do not have to in mid 1956 drew fell ill and soon resigned as tory party leader leadership convention s choice of diefenbaker as drew s replacement prompted delight in some liberal circles diefenbaker had long been a maverick even within his party was little known in eastern canada and many deemed him although defence minister claxton and rcaf remained firm supporters of arrow program as costs continued to rise in 1957 cabinet s defence committee proposed elimination of arrow a decision that was to be reviewed after forthcoming election and which was supported by howe 1957 election after election was called in april 1957 for 10 june howe raised sufficient money to enable liberals to heavily outspend their opponents as there were few liberal ministers from western canada howe was called upon to make appearances throughout region he found that manitoba farmers union was organizing opposition to liberals at some meetings howe had difficulty getting heard at all at other meetings howe engaged in well publicised conflicts with audience members on 19 may in morris manitoba howe told one man demanding to speak that when his own party held a meeting he could ask all questions he wanted man bruce mackenzie proved to be head of a local liberal association as howe left another man asked why he had not answered his question posed earlier howe replied look here my good man when election comes why don t you go away and vote for party you support in fact why don t you just go away at another meeting a few days later howe was asked why he did not care about farmers s economic plight looks like you ve been eating pretty well under a liberal government howe replied poking questioner in midsection diefenbaker used pipeline debate as a major theme in campaign one which he mentioned more than any other issue in vancouver he told largest political crowd in province since 1935 i give this assurance to canadians that government shall be servant and not master of people road of liberal party unless it is stopped and howe has said who s going to stop us will lead to virtual extinction of parliamentary government you will have form but substance will be gone howe was opposed in his riding by ccf candidate doug fisher a local high school teacher fisher s campaign was well financed with support from his party unions and a number of corporate enemies howe had made over years fisher was able to buy up key time on local television station howe initially scheduled no television appearances voters of port arthur saw fisher on television every night explaining why liberals had gone wrong in his view and what his party proposed to do to correct matters called back to his riding after remainder of his disastrous prairie tour was canceled howe found that fisher s appeals had caused defections among liberals howe managed to get tv time just before election and according to bothwell and kilbourn treated his viewers to sight of a tired harsh old man telling them
