clear front runner indeed wall street journal referred to eight person democratic field as snow white and seven dwarfs p 243 but hart then withdrew from race in may 1987 following revelations of donna rice and monkey business however biden did not see a rise in his poll numbers immediately after hart withdrawal and was particularly stagnant in polls for iowa caucuses nevertheless biden had confidence that he could prevail on eve of his announcement he said i m going to win this thing i really am i just know it i can feel it in my fingertips some political professionals saw biden as believing that he could simply will himself to win race but his continued ability to raise campaign funds gave him credibility as a candidate but by other later reports up until his announcement biden was actually unsure whether he wanted to run at all and it took urging of his wife jill biden to convince him to go forward announcement thumb right upright announcement of biden s official candidacy at age of 44 biden became one of official candidates for democratic nomination formally declaring his candidacy at wilmington train station on june 9 1987 in his speech biden said that americans should rise above mere accumulation of material things in language intended to recall john f kennedy he said for too long in this society we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community for too long as a nation we have been lulled by anthem of self interest for a decade led by ronald reagan self aggrandizement has been full throated cry of this society i ve got mine so why don t you get yours and what s in it for me we must rekindle fire of idealism in our society for nothing suffocates promise of america more than unbounded cynicism and indifference biden also laid out platform he was running on which included a middle stance between protectionism and free trade opposition to reagan strategic defense initiative and support for child welfare reduction of poverty and war against illegal drugs biden also emphasized need for integrity in government campaign staff and policy team biden s campaign manager was tim ridley his press secretary was larry and his pollster and strategist was pat caddell pp 102 103 biden s senate chief of staff ted kaufman served as campaign treasurer and principle fundraiser john served as a political consultant and tom donilon served as another strategist biden s sister valerie biden owens also served a major role in running campaign as she had in all of his senate campaigns and was considered first among equals in making decisions campaign developments 1987 summer 1987 once underway biden s campaign messaging became confused due to staff rivalries and bickering taylor see how they run pp 108 109 four different themes were presented sometimes simultaneously pepsi generation voice of optimism save children and scold voters pollster pat caddell in particular was a disruptive force within campaign but he had been biden s friend for fifteen years another of themes was generational change biden hoped to inspire a new generation as john f kennedy had inspired his p 364 indeed biden had a theory of presidential elections as a cycle wherein there are candidates such as he saw himself who can bring with them large spurts of sometimes disruptive progress followed by periods of adjustment in which voters prefer candidates who can let america catch its breath but generational change theme was not catching on especially well drew election journal 1987 1988 p 17 biden was also hurt by his never having been a player in washington social scene biden would later write that his messaging had been a bit opaque like audiences were hearing me through a veil i started looking at race through wrong prism i looked around ing myself against other potential candidates for nomination he received somewhat mixed notices for his performance in first of democratic presidential primary debates which was held at wortham theater center in houston texas on july 1 1987 during a special production of william f buckley s firing line program biden received audience applause for his energy policy in favor of domestic oil production for his objections to what he called unfair trade practices of foreign countries and for his criticisms of reagan administrations policies in central america biden was also suffering from having to divide his attention between campaign senate responsibilities including handling bork nomination and family duties but he campaigned intensively nonetheless a profile at time in dallas morning news assessed him thusly he brings to campaign an ingratiating manner and a quick wit with considerable irish charm plus an ability to rouse audiences that few democrats can match but he also brings a reputation as a showboater and a hothead with a penchant for such was his propensity to keep talking at campaign appearances that staffers gave reporters a note saying that senator may stray from prepared remarks then as throughout his career biden was as new york times later profiled a gut politician swaggering ad libbing liable to get carried away in front of a crowd by august 1987 biden s campaign had begun to lag behind those of michael dukakis and richard gephardt although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but dukakis and was seeing an upturn in iowa polls p 46 kinnock controversy major controversy beset biden s candidacy beginning on september 12 1987 with high profile articles in new york times and des moines register taylor see how they run pp 89 91 biden was accused of plagiarizing a speech by neil kinnock leader of british labour party kinnock s speech delivered to a welsh labour party conference on may 15 1987 and then rebroadcast during uk 1987 general election made reference to his background and that of his wife glenys it included lines while biden s speech made reference to himself and his wife jill and included lines biden went on to duplicate other parts of kinnock s speech such as their forebears ability to read and write poetry their strength in working for hours underground in a mine only to come up and play football afterward and their being limited by lack of a platform upon which to stand biden had in fact cited kinnock as source for formulation on previous occasions but he made no reference to original source at august 23 democratic debate at iowa state fair being reported on germond and witcover whose broad stripes and bright stars pp 230 232 nor in an august 26 interview for national education association moreover while political speeches often appropriate ideas and language from each other biden s use came under more scrutiny because he fabricated aspects of his own family s background in order to match kinnock s following kinnock attention reports came from san jose mercury news of biden giving a february 3 1987 speech to california democratic party that reused without credit passages from a 1967 speech by robert f kennedy and of biden giving 1985 and 1986 speeches that did same with a passage from a 1976 speech by hubert h humphrey germond and witcover whose broad stripes and bright stars pp 233 234 in kennedy case which got greater attention since there was film footage of both versions that television news programs could play side by side pat caddell stated that reuse without credit was his own fault and that he had never informed biden of source of material it was also reported that california speech had taken a short phrase from 1961 inaugural address of john f kennedy after biden withdrew from race it was learned that he had indeed correctly credited kinnock on other occasions but in iowa speech that was recorded and distributed to reporters with a parallel video of kinnock by aides to michael dukakis eventual nominee he failed to do so dukakis who disowned any knowledge of kinnock video fired john sasso his campaign manager and long time chief of staff but biden s campaign could not recover academic revelations as a part of kinnock controversy it was revealed that biden had been involved in a similar incident during his first year at syracuse university school of law in 1965 biden initially received an f in an introductory class on legal methodology for writing a paper relying almost exclusively on a single fordham law review article which he had cited only once biden was allowed to repeat course and passed with high marks though then dean of law school as well as biden s former professor downplayed incident they did find that biden drew chunks of heavy legal prose directly from article in question biden said it was inadvertent due to his not knowing proper rules of citation after ending his presidential campaign biden requested board of professional responsibility of delaware supreme court review issue board concluded on december 21 1987 after biden had withdrawn that senator had not violated any rules although biden did not release this result until may 1989 as revealed by a video shown on c span c span video 1988 road to white house with sen biden via youtube see how they run p 97 when questioned by a new hampshire resident about his grades in law school biden had replied i think i probably have a much higher iq than you do i suspect germond and witcover whose broad stripes and bright stars p 235 and then inaccurately recollected graduating in top half of his class when he actually graduated 76th from 85 that he had attended law school on a full scholarship and had received three degrees in college in fact he had earned a single b a with a double major in history and political science and had received a half scholarship to law school based on financial need with some additional assistance based in part upon academics during this time biden also released his undergraduate grades which were unexceptional at best youth activism before and during campaign biden had a tendency to invent a past as a marcher in civil rights movement for instance in a february 1987 speech in new hampshire he said when i marched in civil rights movement i did not march with a 12 point program i marched with tens of thousands of others to change attitudes and we changed attitudes statements of this nature had been made by biden going back to at least 1983 such statements concerned campaign advisors who knew they did not represent a truthful recollection of biden s past biden said he understood but continued to make them following kinnock and academic revelations reporters pressed biden on matter biden acknowledged that his activities were actually limited to one summer job incident where while working as a lifeguard at a swimming pool he learned of racial inequality issues and joined black lifeguards in establishing a picket line around a local movie theater that had a segregation policy biden said civil rights movement was an awakening for me not as a consequence of my participation but as a consequence of my being made aware of what was happening speaking to reporters he objected to this line of questions as a whole saying i find y all going back and saying well where were you senator biden at time you know i think it s bizarre other people marched i ran for office withdrawal on september 17 1987 biden held a press conference at united states capitol in an attempt to address all these questions and put issues behind him he acknowledged that i ve done some dumb things and i ll do dumb things again but he vowed to stay in race regardless a number of biden s senate colleagues supported him on controversies including longtime democratic fixture robert c byrd and republican alan simpson who quoted theodore roosevelt s man in arena speech but kinnock and academic revelations were magnified by limited amount of other news about nomination race at time p 37 when most of public were not yet paying attention to any of campaigns biden thus fell into what washington post writer paul taylor described as that year s trend a trial by media ordeal taylor see how they run pp 86 88 as valerie biden owens later said it was a tsunami biden lacked a strong demographic or political group of support to help him survive crisis taylor see how they run pp 88 89 controversy also hit biden in his most vulnerable area accentuating notion that he lacked mental and verbal discipline drew election journal 1987 1988 p 16 biden withdrew from nomination race on september 23 1987 saying his candidacy had been overrun by exaggerated shadow of his past mistakes his formal campaign had lasted only three and a half months aftermath because of his early withdrawal biden did not participate in 1988 caucuses and primaries in which governor michael dukakis defeated jesse jackson senators al gore and paul simon and other longer standing contenders in retrospect biden would take blame for his mistakes during campaign on one he said all i had to say was like kinnock if i d just said those two words like kinnock and i didn t it was my fault nobody else s fault on another he ruefully recalled hey pal you want to compare iqs what an immature thing to say biden had felt poorly physically during parts of campaign suffering repeated headaches and at one point in september 1987 having to halt a speech in new hampshire for 15 minutes after feeling faint during his time on road he carried an oversize bottle of tylenol with him in february 1988 he suffered first of two brain aneurysms that required life saving surgery and seven months away from senate in order to convalesce biden and others would speculate that had his campaign not ended early aneurysms might have been more severe or detected later and that he might not have lived out year in any case biden would not run again for presidency until his 2008 campaign twenty years later this time he made it to iowa caucuses but withdrew after a poor showing meanwhile biden and kinnock had become close friends after plagiarism incident meeting in august 2008 after biden had been chosen by democratic nominee barack obama as his running mate biden introduced kinnock to his senate staff by saying hey you people do you know this guy he used to be my greatest speechwriter obama and biden proceeded to win general election against republican ticket of john mccain and sarah palin biden s 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in race and biden invited kinnock to inauguration in 2015 as obama s second term neared completion biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid but he decided not to in large part due to recent death of his son beau due to brain cancer kinnock controversy and other failings of 1988 campaign were not considered to be major factors in 2016 decision nor were they considered likely to be a factor in his decision process regarding attempting a run in 2020 presidential election and indeed on april 25 2019 biden announced his 2020 campaign for presidency this time biden was front runner and failures of his 1988 bid again received scrutiny notes category 1988 united states presidential campaigns category joe biden category plagiarism
