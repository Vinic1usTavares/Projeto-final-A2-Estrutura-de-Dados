in addition rainn wilson plays convenience store clerk valerie tian plays pro life protester and emily perkins plays abortion clinic receptionist themes along with knocked up and waitress two other 2007 films about women facing unplanned pregnancies juno was interpreted by some critics as having a pro life theme ann hulbert of slate magazine believed that juno undercut both pro life and pro choice purism jeff dawson of sunday times believed that film was inevitably placed in unwanted pregnancy subgenre with knocked up and waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro life film only muddied waters hadley freeman of guardian criticized juno for complet ing a hat trick of american comedies in past 12 months that present abortion as unreasonable or even unthinkable a telling social sign though she noted i don t believe any of these films is consciously designed to be anti abortion propaganda a o scott writing for new york times agreed that juno has an underlying theme a message that is not anti abortion but rather pro adulthood ellen page commented what i get most frustrated at is when people call it a pro life movie which is just absurd most important thing is choice is there and film completely demonstrates that cody and page have openly stated that they are pro choice reitman thought that it was fantastic that pro life and pro choice groups were embracing film he said that juno seems to be a mirror and people on both sides see themselves in it other critics labeled juno as feminist because of its portrayal of juno as a confident and intelligent teenage girl wesley morris of boston globe concluded juno serves cool intelligent girls something they rarely see in a movie themselves cody said about writing film women are clever women are funny women are sharp and i wanted to show that these girls were human and not stereotypical teenage girls that we often see in media and there was a lack of authentic teen girl characters i saw writing this screenplay as an opportunity to create an iconic female page praised film for its positive depiction of teenage girls describing juno s character as really refreshing and allow ing for new possibilities in what young women can be and honest but original completely devoid of stereotype while also highlighting that girls haven t had that sort of character before we don t have our catcher in rye she criticized media perception of her character as a strong woman arguing that if juno were a male character strength of character would not be considered remarkable reitman was interested in personal political conflict for vanessa s character feminism has paved way for vanessa s career but ultimately vanessa wants to be a full time mother production development thumb upright diablo cody wrote film based on many of her own high school experiences diablo cody was first approached to write a screenplay by film producer mason novick who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir candy girl a year in life of an unlikely stripper after discovering her blog about stripping he persuaded her to adapt book for screen but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios that sample became juno after deciding on an adoption storyline cody collected stories of adoptees birth parents and adoptive parents including that of her then husband an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote film she also found inspiration in story of a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend s experience in film such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician much of juno however was based on cody s own high school experiences she dated a tic tac loving boy similar to paulie she was best friends with a cheerleader like leah and she used a hamburger phone identical to one that appears in film after writing screenplay over seven weeks in starbucks section of a target store in crystal minnesota cody compared writing to breathing seeing juno as an extension of herself novick sent cody s screenplay to his friend jason reitman by time reitman had read halfway through script he felt that if he did not direct film he would regret it for rest of his life initially reitman found it difficult to acquire script because his first film thank you for smoking had not been released yet so he did not have any feature film credits other directors including jon poll were considered but reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct juno cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing juno i didn t ever think this film would be produced and indeed film was delayed by financial problems after its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios john malkovich s production company mr mudd took on project it was later brought to production company mandate pictures by co producer jim miller funding originated from united states casting thumb upright right jason reitman pictured ellen page as juno when he first read script having admired her performance in hard candy reitman cast ellen page in lead role saying that when he read screenplay for first time he pictured her as juno he visited her on set of a film on which she was working to offer her role he also handed script to j k simmons who had featured in his previous film thank you for smoking not telling him that he intended simmons to play mac simmons says that after reading script he would have been happy to play even high school teacher who has no speaking lines other cast members reitman had in mind right from start were olivia thirlby who had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for role of juno and michael cera he took them with page and simmons to a panavision stage in california and shot 45 pages of script on 35mm film against a black backdrop he presented this footage to fox searchlight as initial cast reitman highlighted importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions saying this is a movie that s all about relationships and idea of auditioning people outside of each other one on one with casting director didn t make sense jennifer garner who accepted a lower salary than usual to prevent film from exceeding its budget was confirmed by reitman to have signed onto project in january 2007 after working with jason bateman on kingdom garner recommended him to reitman when they first met bateman was cast as mark last cast member to be signed lucas mcfadden better known as cut chemist a dj and record producer makes a cameo appearance as juno and paulie s chemistry teacher mcfadden was doing scoring work for reitman when he received juno screenplay and asked mcfadden to appear in film reitman thought that it was perfect irony for chemistry teacher to be played by cut chemist michael cera stated that film had a lot of canadian influence due to fact that he and page were canadian and that a lot of other actors originated from vancouver cera s comment was a response to a statement from peter howell of toronto star i thought juno was a very canadian movie even though it was set in u s filming thumb eric hamber secondary school stood in for fictional dancing elk high school shooting on a budget of us 6 5 million juno was filmed in and around vancouver british columbia standing in for minnesota where production was originally intended to take place although films commonly use a canada as america location shift for budgetary reasons reitman insists choice of filming location was instead at his request filming locations included a house in nearby white rock as mark and vanessa s home eric hamber secondary school as dancing elk high school and south surrey s athletic park track as dancing elk high school s athletics track after minimal rehearsal filming took place in february and march 2007 on a six week schedule of which 30 days were designated to filming crew was planning to import snow for film s winter events but it snowed on location and they were able to reschedule filming to shoot winter scenes during snowfall which second assistant director josy says resulted in much wider snow shots than originally planned although film was shot out of sequence final scene was scheduled for final day and after a long period of rain crew was intending to shut down production and resume months later to shoot scene set in summer but rain stopped and they were able to shoot scene in sun that final scene depicted juno and paulie singing moldy peaches anyone else but you and band member kimya dawson visited set to speak to page and cera while they were practicing song music movie features several songs performed by kimya dawson in her solo antsy pants and moldy peaches guises this was due to a suggestion by page director jason reitman explains at one point i asked ellen page before we started shooting w hat do you think juno listens to and she said moldy peaches she went on my computer played songs and i fell in love with it diablo and i discussed putting a moldy peaches song in it where characters would sing to each other i got in touch with kimya dawson of moldy peaches and she started sending me her work which was beautiful and that became a lot of soundtrack thumb right kimya dawson provided both solo songs and songs from two of her former bands reitman contacted dawson and after reading film s screenplay she agreed for her songs to be used in film sending him a packet of cds containing about 120 songs songs were almost entirely self published by dawson who says she wrote nothing specifically for juno and that all songs had been performed and recorded before she was contacted to work on film reitman asked her to additionally re record instrumentals which included humming over lyrics of some of her songs he also contacted composer mateo messina with whom he had previously worked on thank you for smoking to compose film s incidental score he gave messina a collection of dawson s songs and asked him to create sound of film through an instrumental score that replicated recording quality tone feel and innocence of her music messina decided to implement an acoustic guitar feel that was jangled and was really loose like juno experimenting with different guitars he ended up using stella a second hand guitar belonging to guitarist billy katz that he described as kind of tinny not perfectly in tune but it has all kinds of character katz was hired to perform acoustic and classical guitar for movie s score using stella extensively throughout page also suggested cat power s cover of song sea of love which reitman was hesitant to include as it had already been featured in 1989 film sea of love however he decided that its inclusion would mark a new take on film s cinematic references initially reitman had conceived of juno being a fan of glam rock but rejected it as too inauthentic and he said he wanted to construct juno to be into music very real and authentic making her a fan of punk rock including runaways patti smith and iggy pop and stooges he felt that sonic youth cover of superstar defined juno and mark s relationship juno preferring classic 1971 version by carpenters while mark preferred sonic youth s 1994 cover a well respected man by kinks was a song reitman had associated with a character from another of his screenplays and says it was heart breaking when he decided to include song as an introduction for paulie instead despite feeling it suited scene perfectly he found children s songwriter barry louis polisar s all i want is you after surfing itunes for hours on end using different words and names as search terms and thought that handmade quality was perfect for opening titles which were afterwards made to correspond to song brunch jingle mark writes in film was composed by advertisement writer chris corley with whom reitman had previously worked on a set of commercials for wal mart design film was set out in a sequence of year s seasons which reitman said really resonated with me when i read it because they mirror three trimesters of juno s pregnancy because filming took place over only 30 days fake flora were used to give impression of different seasons while other flora were edited in post production brown leaves were composited onto a fake tree outside juno s house and cherry blossom trees outside leah s house were touched up in a lighter shade of pink to depict autumn a fan was used to blow leaves around in some scenes as if leaves were falling from trees fake flowers were used in front of paulie s house at end of film to give impression of summer reitman used different colors to inform character such as burgundy and gold dancing elk high school track uniforms and an early scene with juno in a red hooded jacket walking through a world of somber greens and browns cody was impressed with production design team s creation of set from only a few sentences in her script calling juno s bedroom a very emotional set for me because it reminded me so much of my own little habitat when i was a teenager walls of juno s room are covered with posters of bands while leah s room includes a mural of older men she finds attractive and paulie s room is overly childlike to indicate his innocence production designer steve designed mark and vanessa s house with assumption that vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what s in them as best she could costume designer monique prudhomme was nominated for a costume designers guild award in excellence in contemporary costume design for film category she dressed vanessa in clothes that were simple and very tasteful but with an anal retentive quality and mark in conservative clothing to complement vanessa s taste it was page s suggestion that juno wear flannel shirts and sweater vests page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in back a third real belly that is seen when juno has an ultrasound and a variety of sizes of fake breasts footage displayed on juno s ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer scott sanders s son matthew and was embedded into scene in post production opening title sequence thumb 900 hand cut images were composited onto a background to create opening title sequence juno s opening title sequence depicting a rotoscoped juno walking through her town while drinking a bottle of sunnyd orange drink was put together over 7 8 months by a small design studio shadowplay studio based in los angeles reitman had met studio s co founder gareth smith in japan on short film festival circuit where they each had shorts screening shadowplay created opening title sequence for reitman s previous film thank you for smoking and he contacted them again when he found out he was going to direct juno with vintage 1970s punk rock posters as inspiration smith and artist jenny lee decided to create a sequence that had texture and a little bit of edge but also imparted warmth and heart of screenplay in last days of filming in vancouver ellen page was photographed with a high speed camera from a number of angles walking on a treadmill and drinking sunnyd 900 still images of a walking and drinking page were printed out and repeatedly run through a xerox machine to degrade their quality until pictures appeared hand drawn pictures were cut out and scanned back onto computer then layered onto background drawn by lee with compositing software to create a stop motion animation sequence that corresponded to all i want is you by barry louis polisar song reitman had chosen shadowplay also designed for each of seasons for film hand made a custom typeface for opening title sequence and closing credits and collaborated on design of soundtrack and dvd distribution theatrical release with a well received preview first screened on september 1 2007

of 100 greatest characters of last 20 years however not all critics share positive view towards juno david edelstein of new york magazine felt that film was desperate to be a movie that confers hipness on teens that makes kids want to use same slang and snap up soundtrack music reviewer jim derogatis criticized film s stylized dialogue and what he saw as a casual take on abortion and juno s naivete in becoming pregnant claiming as an unapologetically old school feminist father of a soon to be teenage daughter a reporter who regularly talks to actual teens as part of his beat and a plain old moviegoer i hated hated hated this movie juno effect in 2008 after 17 students under sixteen years of age at a gloucester massachusetts high school became pregnant time magazine called it juno effect kingsbury kathleen june 18 2008 pregnancy boom at gloucester high time time stated that some adults dismissed statistic as an outlier while others accused films such as juno and knocked up for glamorizing teenage pregnancy miller an adolescent psychology professor at university of minnesota duluth stated that t he juno effect is how media glamorizes pregnancy and how it s also pregnancy is also redemptive of any past problems after senator john mccain named alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate on republican presidential ticket it was revealed in september 2008 that gov palin s daughter bristol age 17 was pregnant with child of another teenager news reports and editorials termed bristol palin s pregnancy as latest episode in debate over teen pregnancy of which juno was a part while conservative commentators made comparisons between bristol palin s pregnancy and film noted new republic literary editor leon republicans wanted a new conversation and they got one juno in juneau fox news roger friedman wondered juno at once violated and vindicated conservative values question is will public rally round bristol palin way it did juno or will it reject her for getting in this situation in first place juno actor jason bateman defended film unfortunately he said we ve had these instances where guys kill people because of what they hear in rock n roll lyrics or some garbage like that look if you re going to blame a movie or song for your actions whether they be good or bad i think you re looking at wrong things to influence your life i think people should look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance mainly parents or teachers or friends or whomever that should probably be where you should point your eyes and ears amy of salon com wrote in 2010 that according to figures released by centers for disease control and prevention pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008 meaning that slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture and that if there had been such a thing as a juno effect it would have caused pregnancies to go down not up she criticized proponents of theory stating that they believed that teenagers somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman s particular situation and instead make some sort of primitive cause and effect connection and that by talking about pregnant girls and most of all by daring to portray some of them as ordinary even likable we d get way more babies having babies she concluded that depicting teen parents may not glamorize them so much as humanize them you know that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too so now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting lives of tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won t necessarily contaminate rest of them it s time to stop worrying and ask what we can do to help top ten lists film appeared on critics top ten lists of best films of 2007 1st roger ebert chicago sun paste magazine staff 2nd office for film and broadcasting
