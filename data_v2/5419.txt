her involvement in january 2014 carter is first female character to headline a standalone story as part of marvel cinematic universe mcu ahead of popular comic characters such as black widow and captain marvel unlike other major marvel heroes carter does not have any superpowers instead writers always said her superpower is fact that other people underestimate her and she often uses that to her advantage atwell said it was thrilling to explore backdrop of this male dominated world where women are still in workforce unspoken for and struggling to find a place outside home and how it affects carter who must deal with this along with missions she receives for carter s costumes though some vintage pieces were used most of her outfits were custom made to accommodate scripted action scenes costume designer giovanna ottobre melton gave outfits an hourglass style with strength in tailoring and defined shoulders but not overly exaggerated for character s tactical gear world war ii underground military looks were referenced gabriella graves portrays a young carter speaking about influence that apparent death of steve rogers has on carter atwell explained that it s only been a year and she s grieving him and i think what keeps her going is he was greatest person she ever knew she s also determined to make sure that his work wasn t in vain following first season atwell noted that carter did not win everyone s respect with jack thompson taking credit for her actions for example but she knows her value so she doesn t need that praise for second season executive producer michele fazekas explained that after carter put a lot of things emotionally to bed such as letting go of captain america she is now more open to looking at her life and figuring out does she want a relationship fazekas added that carter would start to realize that not everybody has her ideals even in ssr a v club named atwell s performance as one of best individual performances of 2015 atwell was also nominated for best actress in a television series at 41st saturn awards but lost award to balfe of outlander edwin jarvis edwin jarvis portrayed by james d arcy was charged with treason during war after he forged signature of his superior officer in an attempt to save woman that would become his wife ana saved from this by howard stark jarvis becomes stark s butler and is eventually offered to carter as support for her mission to clear stark s name befriending carter jarvis came to enjoy his missions with her and chose to continue to help her with missions unrelated to stark such as fight against whitney frost for this ana became involved as well until she was seriously injured by frost in retaliation jarvis unsuccessfully attempted to murder frost thumb left upright james d arcy edwin jarvis was announced to be in series in july 2014 a butler to stark family in original comics jarvis was first adapted in mcu films as an artificial intelligence named j a r v i s created by tony stark official tie in comic iron man 2 public identity explained that a more comic accurate version of character did exist in mcu with butler jarvis serving as a mentor to a young tony and eventually inspiring his a i jarvis seen in agent carter is a younger version of this butler working for howard stark before tony is born d arcy was cast in role in september 2014 fazekas explaining introduction and development of jarvis in series stated that some of it has come from comics and some of it we ve developed ourselves some of it is influenced by james d arcy himself and his strengths d arcy was initially nervous about portraying jarvis s comedic side given his history of predominantly play ing psychopaths and did not study paul bettany s performance as j a r v i s when approaching character ottobre melton explained in terms of costume design that jarvis is a tweed suit man he has a large responsibility handling howard stark s affairs and needs to look polished at all times he s a well paid employee who can afford custom made 3 piece suits and has a british sensibility so we put him in a finely tailored bold black and grey suit atwell referred to carter s relationship with jarvis as series comic relief while fazekas called their relationship center relationship of show executive producer tara butters compared relationship to that of fox mulder and dana scully in early seasons of x files where you really believed they cared about each other but it wasn t sexual that was very refreshing fazekas discussed giving jarvis a major character arc in second season saying that he really got a taste for adventure with peggy in first season so when she comes back into his life he s so happy because he s so bored with being howard stark s butler what that starts is a really interesting story for him which is how much did he really understand about what peggy does for him it s like a fun diversion even though he s in danger we will see in jarvis story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in end it will have a cost for him and it will have an impact on his relationship with peggy jack thompson jack thompson portrayed by chad michael murray is a war veteran and agent with ssr who accidentally killed surrendering enemy soldiers but hid mistake instead being praised as a hero he takes credit for carter s work in defeating leviathan and is promoted to chief of new york ssr office thompson is shot by a mysterious person looking to take a redacted case file he has on m carter thumb right upright chad michael murray murray was cast in august 2014 he noted that unlike his character on one tree hill thompson does not serve as moral compass of series which meant that he would not be confined to a box and would instead be allowed to really play things up and do what s unexpected costumes for ssr agents in series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters thompson wears single breasted suits with suspenders second season ends on a cliffhanger with thompson being shot by an unknown character executive producers insisted that thompson was not necessarily dead and that his fate would be revealed in a potential third season murray described character as chauvinistic and chest puffing and compared him to indiana jones stating that he s working his way up to become head of ssr his goal in life is to just be great at his job so he has a large chip on his shoulder which gives him an attitude butters stated that problem with thompson is he s such an opportunist and he so wants to succeed above all other things that he sometimes makes bad choices i think he s not a bad guy he just gets blinded by ambition on character s second season arc fazekas reiterated that he puts his ambition and his ego over other things over sometimes doing right thing and he often doesn t care who gets hurt or who is upset about it but he actually decides to do right thing in end at great cost to himself daniel sousa daniel sousa portrayed by enver gjokaj is a war veteran and agent with ssr who experiences prejudice due to his crippled leg for which he uses a crutch to support himself sousa s own investigation leads to him discovering carter s status as a traitor his relationship with carter becoming complicated sousa accepts position of chief of los angeles ssr office to get some distance from her and eventually begins a new relationship with violet however violet leaves sousa when she discovers that he still has feelings for carter sousa eventually begins a relationship with carter once they defeat whitney frost together thumb left upright enver gjokaj gjokaj was cast in role in august 2014 he was a soldier and he had been very active all his life and now he has to figure out how to use his brains how to try to be smart gjokaj explained of character he accepts his injury he accepts his compromised status in society peggy says forget this i m peggy carter i m going to do something else i think that s difference between two of them considering a potentially romantic relationship between sousa and carter gjokaj said i think there s definitely a situation where if she hadn t dated captain america he might ask her out for a drink it s like if your new girlfriend dated ryan gosling it s going to make you sweat a bit for second season gjokaj said you ll see him deal with actually being part of machine not trying to get machine but being boss first season was him trying to be listened to and now he s being listened to by a lot of people costumes for ssr agents in series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters sousa wears sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants ahead of second season fazekas explained that after carter turned sousa down at end of first season saying oh let me take a rain check i have something to do carter felt like a potential relationship was something she could consider while sousa felt like he missed an opportunity there because of that sousa moved to los angeles to avoid carter and they haven t spoken since he left there s that interesting awkward feeling when they start working together again but now sousa has got a girlfriend and it s very serious so that s a new thing for peggy to deal with though sousa and carter do eventually get together in second season finale executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean sousa is carter s future husband who was first mentioned in captain america winter soldier roger dooley roger dooley portrayed by shea whigham is chief of new york ssr office after talking to russian psychiatrist johann fennhoff about his marital issues dooley is hypnotized by latter into aiding russians before being placed in an exploding vest designed by stark dooley manages to jump out a nearby window before vest explodes and kills him saving ssr agents in september 2014 whigham was cast as dooley for first seven episodes of series since character is killed off during first season s penultimate episode this decision was made to help build stakes for series given that everyone knows peggy lives costumes for ssr agents in series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters dooley wears classic 1940s double breasted looks many of his closet pieces are sourced 1940s vintage suits dooley is not a well established character in comics so whigham created his own background for him feeling that dooley is not a political appointee i think i worked my way up through good hard work unlike many of other agents whigham believes that dooley does respect carter saying i think he likes her i think he cares deeply i m not sure that he can always show that when asked whether dooley s death was what brings carter and other ssr agents together fazekas said that this was not necessarily case as carter had already begun to earn that herself but she did feel that it sort of focuses everyone and affects everyone recurring characters following is a list of guest characters that have recurring roles throughout series characters are listed by mcu media or season in which they first appeared introduced in films howard stark howard stark portrayed by dominic cooper is a weapons developer who is framed for selling weapons to america s enemies one of weapons he created during war was midnight oil designed to give soldiers extra stamina during war but instead it caused psychosis and led to them killing each other u s military stole midnight oil and used it on russians and fennhoff blames stark for ensuing massacre fennhoff stark into bombing new york but carter is able to convince stark to stop he moves on to set up his own film studio in los angeles thumb upright dominic cooper in march 2014 markus and mcfeely stated that howard stark father of tony stark ceo of stark industries and a founding member of s h i e l d would be a recurring character in agent carter contingent on cooper s willingness to reprise role from first avenger and short film in june 2014 atwell confirmed that cooper would be involved with series ottobre melton designed stark s outfits with his fugitive status in mind aiming to have him look rich comfortable and sexy all rolled up into one stark doesn t wear a tie while on run unlike many men during time and tends to wear casual shirts with custom made jackets and vintage pants in describing character cooper said you don t know what he does in depths of evening and he s around he continued i love dipping into some of that material of howard hughes which i m sure he s kind of been likened to and described his biggest challenge in playing character as keeping it very realistic but at same time tongue in cheek as well and not making stark too broad on carter and stark s relationship moving into second season atwell said there s a new comfort level between stark and peggy they re on a bit more of an even level she respects him hugely but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his dionysian ways but when it comes to peggy he doesn t see her as big boobs and red lips he sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with which probably scares hell out of him in first season finale creators ensured that stark spoke of steve rogers as greatest thing he ever did this was done to set up former s obsession with super soldier and identify something someone he s prouder of than his own son which pays off in captain america civil war in film stark is shown still attempting to recreate his super soldier serum in 1990s also his love for rogers adds to antagonistic relationship between latter and tony cooper was nominated for best guest performance in a television series at 41st saturn awards and for best guest actor in a drama series at 19th online film television association awards he lost awards to wentworth miller for flash and jonathan pryce for game of thrones respectively introduced in season one angie martinelli angie martinelli portrayed by lyndsy fonseca is a waitress and aspiring actress who befriends carter fonseca was drawn to martinelli s funky personality which differed from her much more serious previous role of alexandra on nikita fonseca and atwell discussed keeping their characters as friends rather than falling to jealousy or there s nothing but just support and interest and friendship because a lot of times it s more complicated than that on shows by july 2015 fonseca was negotiating to return for second season and that december she was revealed to be returning for a dream sequence in a little song and dance fazekas said that angie s appearance in sequence is her acting as carter s conscience speaking things that peggy maybe can t say to herself it ties things back together from first season and it s connecting all of these things in a way that only a dream can do ray krzeminski ray krzeminski portrayed by kyle bornheimer is a misogynistic ssr agent who clashes with carter until he is killed by dottie underwood bornheimer was cast in recurring role by october 2014 as part of series stocking up on male counterparts for carter to deal with throughout series in terms of costume ottobre melton described krzeminski as a bit of a slob with his sport jacket and open collar shirts after character s death butters explained that carter would feel guilty about it moving forward as it was her decisions that inadvertently put krzeminski at risk his death also affected series in general with fazekas explaining stakes have changed now they ve gotten a lot more serious episodes that come subsequently really reflect that rose roberts rose roberts portrayed by lesley boone is a switchboard operator who works for ssr in new york and later in los angeles discussing rose s increased role in second season after making brief guest appearances in first fazekas stated that opportunity presented itself to bring rose out to l a for second season in order for carter to have another person to talk to who knows her secrets and knows a lot about what s going on boone called rose a little bit of a trying to get information from carter and sousa to help move things along since she sees an attraction between two for second season rose goes into field with boone saying she gets recruited and she is herself excited that she gets to go out there and be a bad woman i think she s quite capable miriam fry miriam fry portrayed by meagen fay is strict proprietor of griffith hotel for women a boarding house where carter lives fay was cast as woman in charge of boarding house where carter lives in october 2014 set for a minimum four episode arc fay and griffith hotel were introduced as a way to have more female characters in series as we were troublingly dominated by men given that carter was only woman working in ssr griffith was based on barbizon hotel for women one of places in new york that were considered safe places for women to live in big city dottie underwood dorothy dottie underwood portrayed by bridget regan is a russian sleeper agent disguised as a small town girl from iowa who moves next door to carter she reveals her true allegiance in an attempt to capture carter and later escapes after being defeated in a fight with latter dottie resurfaces in an attempt to raid a bank account only to be stopped by carter and ssr she is taken into fbi custody until carter breaks her out to help her defeat whitney frost thumb left upright one of underwood s dresses from series on display red and black colors are a nod to character s black widow status underwood was created to give carter a strong female antagonist and butters noted that we said wouldn t it be great to have one of those people who is living right there with her be actually a bad guy in late january 2015 butters and fazekas revealed that underwood is a product of precursor to black widow program regan did not know character was a black widow when auditioning but quickly learned after being cast as showrunners wanted her to change her then current red hair in order to avoid being a tip to audience because of natasha romanoff they didn t want to imply that every black widow had red hair and they didn t want audience to see it coming regan trained with a tae kwan do expert and studied scarlett johansson s black widow choreography from films in preparation for character s fight scenes while ottobre melton referenced her black widow status by using colors red and black underwood s initial small town girl from iowa persona was based on judy garland s dorothy gale from wizard of oz butters and fazekas stated that underwood doesn t quite understand what it s like to be a normal woman after her upbringing in program and is intrigued by carter regan elaborated that she s never seen anyone like carter before and she s never been beaten before there s this competitive but playful obsession with her which is seen with underwood s flirtation and feminine prowess regan continued she knows that to be on top she has to beat peggy so dottie does want to get under her skin she tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says atwell said peggy has male baddies that she fights but to have someone who is physically her equal she s a black widow incredibly capable and very smart i think that shows some balance for peggy like a flip side of same coin after carter defeats underwood and leviathan in first season underwood becomes a lone wolf she s a woman without a country right now but she is more involved in overarching case for second season than it initially appears johann fennhoff johann fennhoff portrayed by ralph brown is a russian hypnotist working for leviathan whose brother died from effects of stark s chemical weapon midnight oil fennhoff infiltrates ssr under guise of rescued psychiatrist dr and steals midnight oil for himself he then tries to use hypnosis to make stark spread midnight oil over new york but is defeated by carter and ssr he is arrested gagged and imprisoned with arnim zola fennhoff s history as doctor faustus in comics is referenced in series with him shown reading christopher marlowe s tragical history of life and death of doctor faustus having faustus meet zola was intended to set up hydra s use of mind control for winter soldier program as seen in captain america winter soldier hydra s system of brainwashing and mind control is also seen in series agents of s h i e l d where it is referred to as faustus method introduced in season two whitney frost whitney frost portrayed by wynn everett is stage name of agnes cully an actress and scientific genius forced to hide behind her husband senatorial candidate calvin chadwick due to sexism of age she accidentally absorbs zero matter which leaves her with a zero matter scar on her forehead and ability to absorb any living thing she touches after she is purged of zero matter frost goes insane and is committed to an asylum in august 2015 butters and fellow executive producer chris dingess stated that madame masque would appear in season and that an actress had been cast in role everett was confirmed to be playing character that october after being cast and seeing a picture of comic version of character everett felt they got wrong girl only because i look nothing like her i was very nervous about it and thought they will probably dye my hair dark and i m going to need to work out a bit and those are some pretty big boobs however producers were looking to take a different approach to character taking inspiration from hollywood icons like hedy lamarr and lauren bacall character also does not wear gold mask from comics though show does reference this with masks appearing in background of many scenes featuring frost ivy george and olivia welch portray younger versions of cully during her time growing up in broxton oklahoma thumb makeup artist robin beauchesne applying special prosthetics to wynn everett to depict whitney frost s zero matter crack series head of make up debra lamia denaver explained that for zero matter wound on frost s face guidelines were for it to be like a cracked porcelain doll and then black matter would come from inside out from there jay wejebe makeup artist designed prosthetics that we use and robin beauchesne key makeup artist created all different avenues dark matter takes using reference photographs and pre made prosthetics make up team were ultimately able to apply effect to everett in 30 minutes crack was then augmented with visual effects to add depth sentience and an infinite black by color correcting image with effects animators studying cracking glass to better capture animation effect fazekas said that whitney is used to people treating her with a certain amount of deference because she s a famous actress and she s met her match in peggy she added that in series you see makings of a villain but she doesn t start off evil she starts off manipulative and not nicest person you ve ever met but she s not a bad guy when you first meet her fazekas additionally noted how sexist themes of times were handled by showing that only way whitney frost felt she could exert power in world was through her husband because she had been told her whole life nobody cares how smart you are they care about how pretty you are on frost s relationship with chadwick everett called him her best friend and like many friends and family you end up fighting but he s always there he knows i can do what i say i can do especially in science world so he s really only one who gets me jason wilkes jason wilkes portrayed by reggie austin is a scientist for isodyne only company willing to hire him as a black man who informs carter of company s zero matter discovery he is rendered invisible and intangible following exposure to substance and under its influence he attempts to take drastic steps to gain power he expresses remorse for his actions after zero matter is eventually purged from his body and he regains tangibility austin joined cast as wilkes in october 2015 wilkes who originates from comics was changed to a black character for series which allowed series to address racism during 1940s on race of character austin said it does play a factor it can t not really it s los angeles or rather america in 1947 so race does play a factor butters added we wanted to tell a rich story around blatant racism that existed and not feel like you re preaching about it you know racism is not good for when character becomes intangible following exposure to zero matter series science adviser theoretical physicist clifford johnson explained that substance introduces idea of moving in another direction from what is usually possible and so wilkes s intangibility is actually zero matter taking him somewhat off towards place it came from in another dimension austin noted that this experience causes both fear and curiosity in wilkes and forces his role in series to be more cerebral rather than action focused as he is relegated to explaining science and planning until he regains his tangibility on how wilkes connects to carter austin said wilkes is one of top scientists in his field working at isodyne but he s had to work hard to get there it s sort of a similar struggle of an african american and a woman in 1940s to try to succeed so i think that they both see that in one another and that s part of where chemistry and connection comes from expanding on love triangle that forms between wilkes sousa and carter austin said we re very nice to each other we re professional i think that sousa likes wilkes enough and it s same other way calvin chadwick calvin chadwick portrayed by currie graham is frost s husband owner of isodyne energy and secret member of council of nine he is a senatorial candidate for council until he tries to turn over powered frost to council out of fear frost absorbs him in retaliation graham was announced as cast in role in october 2015 he compared his relationship to frost to that of bill and hillary clinton calling them a power couple and adding i think that chadwick was probably attracted to her because of her beauty but she s also a very smart woman very successful also probably a type a we really strive both of us i think as a very successful actress and with a very successful business man world is our oyster we re going to make as many pearls as we can ana jarvis ana jarvis portrayed by lotte verbeek is free spirited and quirky wife of edwin jarvis who quickly befriends carter she is wounded by whitney frost resulting in internal complications that render her unable to have children character was featured entirely off screen in first season often as a disembodied voice in july 2015 she was revealed to be physically appearing in second season and verbeek was cast in role by october 2015 verbeek was in europe when she auditioned for and got part and agent carter had not yet begun airing there so verbeek didn t really know anything i just talked to showrunners what is it about what is character about verbeek wanted to play more than just wife of and noted that her take on character is somewhat unexpected with jarvis being who he is ana just brings a whole different dimension to him verbeek who is dutch has spent a lot of time in budapest which helped with character s hungarian accent on creating character fazekas said writers wanted to be really specific about who woman is that jarvis is just madly in love with in order to highlight strong platonic relationship jarvis has with carter fazekas added it makes sense in that jarvis likes peggy carter so of course woman he s in love with would not be a quiet prim and proper lady we also wanted to be very clear that peggy and ana really like each other and that there s no jealousy from ana ana and jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship they re not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives on some of differences between ana and edwin verbeek said first scene we had i walk in and i smack him on his ass which is a sort of sexual playful fun thing they have that s not something he would do that s something she does and he loves it d arcy later revealed that verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set after having flown in calling it brilliantly courageous to do it to an actor you don t know and so perfectly what they were hoping that ana would be like aloysius samberly aloysius samberly portrayed by matt braunger is an ssr lab tech who eventually goes out into field with carter sousa jarvis and roberts to help them retrieve old atomic bombs at roxxon oil he then assists them in defeating frost fazekas called him a comedy guy who plays lab tech who is kind of disgruntled he feels like you agents you just look down your nose at lab techs and he s a thorn in sousa s side he s so funny because everything he says is completely earnest but hilarious he just annoys everyone but he also has his little hero moments as well butters called braunger a great comic addition to our cast vernon masters vernon masters portrayed by kurtwood smith is a veteran of war department and subordinate of council of nine he was thompson s mentor and boss in war department and manipulates thompson into doing bidding of council in october 2015 smith was cast in major recurring role of masters for second season having previously worked with butters and fazekas on their television series resurrection though executive producers never thought that they would be able to get smith for series they developed and wrote masters with actor in mind character was intended to be killed off at end of season and a version of that was filmed but writers ultimately decided to leave masters fate ambiguous as they enjoyed working with smith with fazekas saying nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it maybe we never see him again or maybe we see him again and by way he s full of zero matter now last thing you saw was whitney zero him and then getting interrupted but it s still in him either way we wanted to keep our options open joseph manfredi joseph manfredi portrayed by ken marino is leader of maggia crime syndicate branch in los angeles who aids frost having previously dated her he is also an old acquaintance of howard stark and helps stark and ssr defeat frost when she begins losing her mind to zero matter marino was cast in november 2015 on which fazekas said he s obviously very funny but he also is a great dramatic actor we had talked about him for a different role but it was too small of a role then we knew we wanted him in manfredi role so that role became so much bigger because it was ken about character fazekas added what i love about manfredi is he s funny he can flip on a dime and be a total psycho and he is madly in love with whitney and genuinely so even when she s cuckoo their scenes together there s such a tenderness to them since character differs from its comic counterpart marino said two things vital to character were defining that manfredi definitely was muscle for whitney and that he did have a true love for her marino wanted to make sure manfredi felt like he was an old school tough guy and felt that frost was one true love for him comparing their relationship to joe dimaggio and marilyn monroe s guest characters following
