type of constans also called typos of constans was an imperial edict issued by eastern roman emperor constans ii in 648 in an attempt to defuse confusion and arguments over christological doctrine of monotheletism for over two centuries there had been a bitter debate regarding nature of christ orthodox chalcedonian position defined christ as having two natures in one person whereas monophysite opponents contended that jesus christ possessed but a single nature at time byzantine empire had been at near constant war for fifty years and had lost large territories it was under great pressure to establish domestic unity this was hampered by large number of byzantines who rejected council of chalcedon in favour of monophysitism type attempted to dismiss entire controversy on pain of dire punishment this extended to kidnapping pope from rome to try him for high treason and mutilating one of type s main opponents constans died in 668 ten years later his son constantine iv fresh from a triumph over his arab enemies and with predominately provinces irredeemably lost called third council of constantinople it decided with an overwhelming majority to condemn monophysitism monotheletism type of constans and its major supporters constantine put his seal to council s decisions and reunited such of christendom as was not under arab suzerainty background political background thumb byzantine empire in 648 under constans ii in 628 christian byzantine empire and zoroastrian sasanian empire of iran ended a harrowing twenty six year long war both states were completely exhausted byzantines had had majority of their territory overrun and a large part of it devastated consequently they were vulnerable to sudden emergence of islamic rashidun caliphate in arabia caliphate s forces invaded both empires only a few years after war muslim also known as arab forces swiftly conquered entire sasanian empire and deprived byzantine empire of its territories in levant caucasus egypt and north africa by 642 muslim armies had conquered all of syria and egypt richest parts of byzantine empire norwich pg 300 02 for a variety of reasons byzantine population of syria did not put up much resistance hugh n kennedy notes that muslim conquest of syria does not seem to have been actively opposed by towns but it is striking that antioch put up so little resistance kennedy 1970 611

and justice far better than state of oppression and tyranny in which we were army of heraclius byzantium we shall indeed repulse from city al baladhuri battle of yarmuk 636 and after another key reason for welcome of arabs as rulers by christian syrians and egyptians is that they found strict monotheism of islam closer to their own monophysite christian position than hated doctrine of constantinople which they perceived as norwich 1988 pp 304 05 on 11 february 641 heraclius emperor for 31 years who had pulled empire back from brink of ruin died in following three years empire endured four short lived emperors or usurpers before seventeen year old constans ii grand son of heraclius established himself on throne of diminished realm lilie et al pp 70 71 in 643 644 valentinus led a campaign against arabs but his army was routed he fled and his treasury was captured in 644 or 645 valentinus attempted to usurp his son in law s throne he failed populace of capital lynching

background thumb upright 0 6 pope john iv thumb upright 0 6 maximus confessor council of chalcedon fourth ecumenical council was held in 451 and laid basis of christological belief christ was a single person possessing two natures a perfect god and a perfect man united and inseparably norwich pp 156 this was viewed as outright heresy by monophysites who briefly believe that jesus christ is one person and one hypostasis in one nature divine martin lecture in course meetings with world s religions centre for theology and religious studies lund university spring term 2010 monophysite belief was widespread in egypt and to a lesser extent syria after chalcedon orthodoxy in 5th 6th centuries byzantine state had repeatedly attempted to stamp it out emperor heraclius spent last years of his life attempting to find a compromise theological position between monophysites and chalcedonians what he promoted via his ecthesis was a doctrine which declared that jesus whilst he possessed two distinct natures had only one will question of energy of christ was not relevant bury 2005 p 251 this approach seemed to be an acceptable compromise and it secured widespread support throughout east pope honorius i and four patriarchs of east constantinople alexandria antioch and jerusalem all gave their approval to doctrine referred to as monothelitism and so it looked as if heraclius would finally heal divisions in church norwich p 309 popes in rome objected pope honorius i died in 638 and his successor pope severinus condemned ecthesis outright and so was forbidden his seat by constans until 640 his successor pope john iv also rejected doctrine completely leading to a major schism between eastern and western halves of catholic church when news of pope s condemnation reached heraclius he was already old and ill and news is said to have hastened his death norwich p 310 meanwhile there were problems in province of africa since fall of egypt it was in front line against arab expansionism nominally a byzantine province in practice africa was all but independent and a hotbed of dissent to constantinople s policies threat of imminent invasion increased local bishops antipathy to monophysitism knowing that its adherents in syria and egypt had welcomed invading arabs compromise policy of monotheletism was disliked as giving comfort to those seen theologically as heretics and politically as potential traitors a monk named maximus confessor had long carried on a furious campaign against monotheletism and in 646 convinced an african council of bishops all resolutely chalcedonian to draw up a manifesto against it this they forwarded to new pope theodore i who in turn wrote to patriarch paul ii of constantinople outlining heretical nature of doctrine paul a devoted monothelete replied in a letter directing pope to adhere to doctrine of one will theodore in turn excommunicated patriarch in 649 declaring paul a heretic divisions in byzantine society and open opposition to imperial authority were starkly exposed treadgold p p 292 constans issues type thumb left constans ii constans ii was a young man of seventeen and he was supremely indifferent to religious debates convulsing church bury p 293 however he was certainly concerned about effect arcane debate was having on his empire a key reason for parlous position of byzantine empire was religious divide he had just established an uncertain truce with arabs and badly needed to rebuild his forces and to gain full support of his empire so he issued an imperial edict called type in 648 modern historian salvatore consentino suggests that it may have been issued as late as spring 649 consentino pp 153 54 this edict made it illegal to discuss topic of christ possessing either one or two wills or one or two energies or even to acknowledge that such a debate was possible he declared that whole controversy was to be forgotten during proceedings of lateran council of 649 text of type was read out in full and so is preserved in recorded acts first section expresses concern that some subjects of empire consider christ to have had one will and some that he had two this is discussed and concluded with observation that debate is dividing society and that constans intends to put a stop to this price r acts of lateran synod of 649 liverpool 2014 262 263 type goes on to deny people licence to conduct any dispute contention or controversy explaining that whole matter has been settled by five previous ecumenical councils and straight forwardly plain statements of approved holy fathers right of any individual to interpret their findings is explicitly forbidden situation that existed previously is to be maintained everywhere as if no had arisen over them there is to be an amnesty for any past comments on topic and all writings regarding it are to be destroyed in third and final section various penalties were prescribed for anyone who disobeys imperial decree bishops or clerks of church are to be deposed monks are to be excommunicated while public servants or military officers are to lose their office private citizens of senatorial rank would have their property confiscated finally if any of great mass of citizenry so much as mentioned topic they would face corporal punishment and banishment for life norwich p 317 opposition thumb left upright 0 6 pope martin i first pope since 537 consecrated without imperial approval in rome and west opposition to monotheletism was reaching fever pitch and type of constans did nothing to defuse situation indeed it made it worse by implying that either doctrine was as good as other theodore planned lateran council of 649 to condemn ecthesis but died before he could convene it his successor pope martin i did not only did council condemn ecthesis it condemned type as well after synod pope martin wrote to constans informing emperor of its conclusions and requiring him to condemn both monothelete doctrine and his own type however constans was not sort of emperor to take such a rebuke of imperial authority lightly norwich p 318 constans sent a new exarch of ravenna olympius who had authority over all byzantine territory in italy which included rome he had firm instructions to ensure that type was followed in italy and to use whatever means necessary to ensure that pope adhered to it bury p 294 arriving while lateran synod was sitting he realised how opposed west was to emperor s policy and set up italy as an independent state his army joined his rebellion this made it impractical for constans to take effective action against pope martin until after olympius died three years later ostrogorsky p 107 constans appointed a new exarch theodore i who marched on rome with newly loyal army abducted pope martin and brought him to constantinople where he was tried for high treason before senate he was banished to chersonesus present day crimea and shortly after died as a result of his mistreatment bury p 296 in an unusual move a successor pope eugene i was elected in 654 by college of cardinals while martin i still lived new pope normalized relations with constantinople and although he avoided pressing issues of christological controversy he ceremonially refused to accept a letter from patriarch of constantinople when imperial emissary attempted to deliver it ekonomou 2007 pp 159 161 constans viewed settling dispute as a matter of state security and persecuted anyone who spoke out against monotheletism including maximus confessor and a number of his disciples maximus was tortured over several years he lost his tongue and his right hand as constans attempted to force him to recant constans even personally journeyed to rome in 663 to meet with pope first emperor to visit since fall of western roman empire ostrogorsky pp 107 09 condemnation thumb left miniature 45 from constantine manasses chronicle 14th century showing sixth ecumenical council with constans death in 668 throne passed to his son constantine iv pope who had hosted visit of constans ii to rome in 663 almost immediately declared himself in favour of doctrine of two wills of christ orthodox chalcedonian position in response patriarch theodore i of constantinople and patriarch of antioch both pressed constantine to take measures against pope constantine however was fully occupied with military matters and saw no profit in reigniting this debate in 674 arabs commenced great siege of constantinople which lasted four years before they were defeated with pressure from external enemies at least temporarily relieved constantine was able to turn to church affairs with predominately provinces permanently lost to arabs he was under less pressure to support any compromise which included their position ostrogorsky pp 111 15 300px thumb right arab expansion he decided to put monotheletic question to a church council constantine suggested this to pope in 678 and proposal was welcomed bury p 314 this council sixth ecumenical council met for ten months from 680 to 681 it hosted 174 delegates from every corner of christendom patriarchs of constantinople and antioch were present in person while pope and patriarchs of alexandria and jerusalem sent representatives it held 18 plenary sessions constantine chaired first 11 carefully expressing no opinion on 16 september 681 it nearly unanimously condemned monotheletic doctrine and type of constans with exception of two delegates constantine personally signed final declaration and was hailed as destroyer of heretics monotheletism was outlawed and non arab christian world was united norwich pp 326 p 115 one of patriarchs excommunicated as heretics for their support of type was pope honorius ostrogorsky p 114 issue of a pope being disowned by his own successors has caused difficulty for catholic theologians ever since especially when discussing papal infallibility norwich p 326 pope leo ii later replaced finding of heresy with one of negligence and catholic theologians have since argued that honorius s pronouncements never met criteria for ex cathedra statements as defined by first vatican council see also miaphysite
