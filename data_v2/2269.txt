season although to remain a viable candidate to pitch in phillies rotation he needed to regain complete health pettibone began 2014 phillies season s spring training with more shoulder discomfort although issue was not structural according to an mri it was disconcerting to phillies as he was a young pitcher ultimately discomfort kept him from remaining a competitor for a spot in back of phillies rotation and he began season in minor leagues however he was first pitcher to be called up from minor leagues to make a start for phillies in 2014 serving as a spot starter while cole hamels recovered from injury he made two starts before being demoted back to minor leagues his injury woes subsequently continued he was diagnosed with a slap tear and though he declined surgery he received a cortisone injection and was placed on disabled list to rest todd phillies beat writer for mlb com noted pettibone s shoulder is a legitimate concern because this is third time he has had to stop

signed with new britain bees of atlantic league of professional baseball he re signed with club in early 2018 pettibone was released on may 10 2018 scouting report although pettibone was not projected to have highest potential of any phillies pitching prospect some talent evaluators thought he had highest floor i e worst case scenario in terms of his development and these evaluations were confirmed by his rookie season as such he projected to be a decent back of rotation starter he throws three pitches including a fastball that while predominantly around can reach secondarily he throws a changeup which eric called his best offering because it features good fade and arm speed when he first reached major leagues scouts thought he threw either curveball and slider but upon reaching major leagues they determined he threw both a slider and a cutter which move similarly and can induce weak contact and maybe miss some bats if it s thrown in right spot ultimately pettibone s long term effectiveness hinges on whether he could remain healthy see also list of second generation major league baseball players references external links category living people category 1990 births category
