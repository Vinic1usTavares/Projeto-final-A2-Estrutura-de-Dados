thumb 250px durham cathedral above river wear alt a winter view showing durham cathedral with three large towers looming high on a craggy cliff above a river bordered with snow covered trees a weir and a house medieval cathedrals of england which date from between approximately 1040 and 1540 are a group of twenty six buildings that constitute a major aspect of country s artistic heritage and are among most significant material symbols of christianity though diversified in style they are united by a common function as cathedrals each of these buildings serves as central church for an administrative region or diocese and houses throne of a bishop late latin ecclesia from greek cathedral each cathedral also serves as a regional centre and a focus of regional pride and affection only sixteen of these buildings had been cathedrals at time of reformation eight that were served by secular canons and eight that were monastic a further five cathedrals are former abbey churches which were reconstituted with secular canons as cathedrals of new dioceses by henry viii following dissolution of monasteries and which comprise together with former monastic cathedrals cathedrals of new foundation two further pre reformation monastic churches which had survived as ordinary parish churches for 350 years became cathedrals in 19th and 20th centuries as did three medieval collegiate churches that retained their foundations for choral worship while there are characteristics of each building that are distinctly english these cathedrals are marked by their architectural diversity both from one to another and also within each individual building this is much more case than in medieval cathedrals of northern france for example where cathedrals and large abbeys form a relatively homogenous group and architectural development can easily be traced from building to building one of points of interest of english cathedrals is way in which much of history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building which typically has important parts constructed in several different centuries with no attempt whatsoever to make later work match or follow through on an earlier plan for this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another only at one building salisbury cathedral is stylistic unity demonstrated background historical thumb see of canterbury was founded in 597 by st augustine alt view of exterior of canterbury cathedral on a bright day building is of pale stone with three large towers and much ornate gothic detail people are entering through a richly sculptured side porch christianity was carried to england by romans and spread throughout britain until 5th century when it waned through departure of romans and invasion by saxons in 597 pope gregory sent augustine as a missionary from rome to canterbury where a church was established and run initially by secular canons then benedictine monks from late saxon period until 1540 present cathedral church at canterbury is seat of archbishop of canterbury primate of all england as begun by alfred great in 871 and consolidated under william conqueror in 1066 england became a politically unified entity at an earlier date than other european countries one of effects was that units of government both of church and state were comparatively large england was divided into see of canterbury and see of york under two archbishops during medieval period there were no more than 17 bishops far fewer than numbers in france and italy thumb left upright rochester cathedral was a foundation of secular canons from 604 1076 then benedictine until 1540 when it reverted to a secular chapter alt an interior view of nave of rochester cathedral looking towards east nave has norman arches and a flat wooden ceiling beyond which there stone vault of choir cathedral is divided by a stone screen on which rest two section of richly decorated organ pipes benedictine monasticism present in england from 6th century was greatly extended after norman invasion in 1066 there were also a number of cistercian abbeys but these were often in remote areas and not destined to become cathedrals romanesque architecture of normandy replaced that of saxon england buildings being generally larger and more spacious general arrangement of monastic buildings following those of great abbey of cluny romanesque style of which english form is often known as norman architecture developed local characteristics at norman conquest most english cathedrals were already richly endowed and as major centres of norman power they were then able to acquire further lands formerly held by dispossessed english landowners furthermore development of tithe as a compulsory tax on agricultural production resulted in greatly increased incomes for incumbent clergy although all cathedrals gathered donations from worshippers and pilgrims in practice major building campaigns were largely or entirely funded from accumulated wealth of bishop and chapter clergy availability of finance largely determined speed of construction for major projects when money was readily available cathedral works could proceed with great speed at winchester during norman period an entire cathedral of unprecedented size begun in 1079 was built from scratch in less than 20 years an important aspect in practice of medieval christianity was veneration of saints and associated pilgrimages to places where particular saint s relics were interred and their tradition honoured possession of relics of a popular saint was a source of funds to individual church as faithful made donations and benefices in hope that they might receive spiritual aid a blessing or a healing from presence of physical remains of holy person among those churches to benefit in particular were st alban s abbey which contained relics of england s first christian martyr ripon with shrine of it founder st wilfrid durham which was built to house body of saints cuthbert of lindisfarne and aidan ely with shrine of st ethelreda westminster abbey with magnificent shrine of its

a detail from an ancient stained glass window shows becket being murdered by several men all these saints brought pilgrims to their churches but among them most renowned was thomas becket late archbishop of canterbury assassinated by henchmen of king henry ii in 1170 as a place of pilgrimage canterbury was in 13th century second only to santiago de compostela in 1170s gothic architecture was introduced from france at canterbury and westminster abbey over next 400 years it developed in england sometimes in parallel with and influenced by continental forms but generally with great local diversity and originality in 16th century reformation brought about changes in governance of cathedrals as discussed below some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time several of buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of dissolution of monasteries 1537 40 many of large abbey churches particularly those outside towns were robbed burnt out and abandoned late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass as well as many new fittings thumb upright left reredos in st alban s cathedral was severely damaged in dissolution of monasteries it was reconstructed with new statues in 1888 alt photo shows altar of st alban s cathedral behind which rises a large stone screen with tiers of statues and a crucifix centrally placed during period of commonwealth 1649 60 wholesale iconoclasm was wrought on all pictorial elements of christian buildings most of england s medieval stained glass was smashed majority of england s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact medieval paintings almost disappeared vestments embroidered in famous style known as opus were burnt those medieval communion vessels that had escaped dissolution were melted down so that only about 50 items of pre reformation church plate remain restoration of monarchy in 1660 also brought about some restoration of churches and cathedrals such as that at lichfield by sir william wilson and their enrichment with new fittings new church plate and many elaborate memorials loss of ancient st paul s cathedral in great fire of london in 1666 meant that an entirely new cathedral present st paul s was built on its site to a design in baroque style by sir christopher wren in general from time of reformation onwards apart from necessary repairs so that buildings might remain in use and internal adornments of successive generations who wished to be commemorated there was little building work and only piecemeal restoration this situation lasted for about 250 years with fabric of many major cathedrals suffering from neglect severity of problem was demonstrated by spectacular collapse of spire of chichester cathedral which suddenly telescoped in on itself in 1861 thumb nave of southwark cathedral was built by arthur blomfield in 1890s alt this longshot of interior of southwark cathedral shows both nave with crisply detailed pointed arches and older structure beyond a number of visitors are silhouetted against pale stone by this date medieval architecture was back in fashion a growing awareness of value of england s medieval heritage had begun in late 18th century leading to some work on a number of cathedrals by architect james wyatt consciousness accelerated until in 1840s two academic groups oxford society and cambridge camden society both pronounced that only suitable style in which to design a church was gothic critic john ruskin was an ardent advocate of all things medieval and popularised these ideas architect augustus welby pugin who designed mainly for growing roman catholic church set himself to recreate not only structural appearance of medieval churches but also richly decorated and colourful interiors that had been almost entirely lost existing only as a painted screen here and there a few tiled floors such as those at winchester and canterbury and intricate painted wooden ceiling of peterborough cathedral victorian era saw restoration of all of england s cathedrals and remaining major abbey churches some buildings left incomplete were completed at this time and greater part of existent church furniture fittings and stained glass dates from this period architects included george gilbert scott john loughborough pearson george frederick bodley arthur blomfield and george edmund street scope thumb lincoln cathedral had a chapter of secular canons for whom earliest polygonal chapter house was built alt an external view of chapter house at lincoln against a dark cloudy sky polygonal building has a steeply pointed lead roof paired pointed windows and huge flying buttresses with splay out all around building like spider s legs 26 cathedrals described in this article are those of bristol canterbury carlisle chester chichester durham ely exeter gloucester hereford lichfield lincoln manchester norwich oxford peterborough ripon rochester st alban s salisbury southwark southwell wells winchester worcester and york with reference also to westminster abbey and ancient cathedral of london generally known as old st paul s all medieval buildings that are now cathedrals of england were roman catholic in origin as they predate reformation all these buildings now serve church of england as a result of change to official religion of country which occurred in 1534 during reign of henry viii cathedrals fall into three distinct groups depending on their earlier organisational structure firstly there are those that during medieval period as now were governed by a body of secular clergy or chapter presided over by a dean these cathedrals are chichester exeter hereford lichfield lincoln london salisbury wells and york all of which built specifically to serve as cathedral churches thumb left fan vaulted south range of cloister at gloucester cathedral which was a benedictine abbey from 1022 to 1539 alt view along a stone cloister passage showing shaped sections of vault and carved stone panelling of walls secondly there was a group of monastic cathedrals in which bishop was titular abbot these cathedrals are canterbury carlisle durham ely norwich rochester winchester and worcester these monasteries were benedictine except in case of carlisle which was augustinian six of these churches were built from start as cathedrals carlisle and ely are purely monastic churches which then became seat of a bishop during course of construction at dissolution of monasteries under henry viii all previously monastic cathedrals became governed by secular canons like first group third group are those churches established as new cathedrals since reformation they include five great medieval abbey churches established as new cathedrals under henry viii bristol chester gloucester oxford and peterborough five further large churches later became cathedrals st albans and southwark which were of monastic foundation and manchester ripon and southwell which were collegiate churches and all of which consequently combine functions of cathedral and parish church westminster abbey was a benedictine monastery that became a cathedral after dissolution of monasteries but only for ten years four other churches are associated with this tradition st john baptist s church chester old st paul s cathedral london bath abbey and destroyed benedictine abbey of coventry collegiate church of st john in chester was raised to cathedral status in 1075 but became a co cathedral in 1102 when see was removed to coventry current building was probably begun around time of see s removal st paul s a cathedral with a secular chapter was destroyed in great fire of london in 1666 and was replaced by present cathedral in baroque style designed by christopher wren bath abbey was co cathedral of diocese of bath and wells along with wells cathedral although a large church architecturally it does not fit cathedral tradition but has much in common with king s college chapel cambridge and st george s chapel windsor abbey church at coventry was co cathedral with lichfield and st john chester in diocese of lichfield but was destroyed at dissolution large parish church of st michael s coventry became coventry cathedral in 1918 it was bombed during world war ii leaving intact only its spire regarded as one of finest in england new coventry cathedral designed by sir basil spence was consecrated in 1962 and adjoins shell of ancient church liturgical and organisational thumb choir practice at york minster alt a view in choir of york minster with girl choristers and male lay clerks in blue standing in richly carved choir stalls cathedrals are places where christian rituals particular to a bishop especially ordination and enthronement can be performed and are structured and furnished for these purposes each cathedral contains seat of local bishop often literally a large throne bishop s throne is located towards eastern end of cathedral near high altar which is main focus of worship on altar is served eucharist a symbolic meal of bread and wine in memory of jesus last supper with his disciples in early medieval period altar always contained or was associated with relics of a saint sometimes relics were held in a separate shrine near high altar in this part of church are often located tombs of former bishops typically arranged either side of major shrine so worshipping congregation symbolically comprised whole body of clergy of diocese both living and dead in communion with their patron saint seats are provided for other significant clergy of cathedral dean who is foremost priest at cathedral precentor archdeacon and canons each of these priests either as secular clergy or as previously members of a religious order is obligated to say holy office every day to this end cathedrals normally have a number of small chapels used for private devotion or for small groups in england there is a strong tradition that each chapel should face east for this reason transepts of english cathedrals are longer than those in most other countries and there is often a second transept as at salisbury this arrangement permits a greater number of eastward facing chapels that part of main interior which is furthest to east and reserved for prayers of clergy is presbytery thumb left nave of lincoln cathedral alt view of north side of nave at lincoln showing wide arcade arches supported on tall slim columns surrounded by shafts of dark marble aisle windows are full of stained glass beneath them runs a wall arcade in which is displayed a modern set of stations of cross carved in different recycled timbers english cathedrals maintain a traditional form of church service of which canticles set psalm of day responses and an anthem are sung by a choir traditionally composed of about thirty men and boys many cathedrals now also have a girls choir and a lay choir because of this tradition that part of building that contains stalls usually to east of central tower but sometimes extending under it is called choir or quire choir is sometimes divided from nave of cathedral by a wide medieval pulpitum screen constructed of stone and in some instances carrying a large pipe organ notably at exeter gloucester lincoln norwich rochester st albans southwell wells and york this screen traditionally separated quire from nave and clergy from laity who were expected to worship at parish churches rather than at cathedral nave of cathedral in medieval times was used primarily for processions at its western end it contains font for ritual washing service of baptism at which a person most often an infant is symbolically accepted into church font is usually made of stone and is usually oldest fitting in cathedral many of them being norman since reformation nave is that part of building which is usually open to and most used by congregation and general public there is also usually in nave a raised pulpit from which dean or other clergy can expound scriptures in late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to be said for benefit of visitors and this is often presented from nave pulpit in a large cathedral particularly in those where building is divided by a screen as at canterbury an altar may be set at eastern end of nave so that services might be held there for large congregations at each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a bible general characteristics of english cathedrals note all dimensions are those given by john harvey unless otherwise cited periods and style names are those used by banister fletcher and others based on rickman and sharpe plan and section thumb plan of salisbury cathedral shows many features that are typically english alt plan of salisbury cathedral is a long latin cross with an additional smaller transept towards eastern end a wide square at crossing of western transept marks location of central tower a porch juts from nave on north side a chapel extends from square eastern end like majority of medieval cathedrals those of england are cruciform while most are of latin cross shape with a single transept several including salisbury lincoln wells and canterbury have two transepts which is a distinctly english characteristic transepts unlike those of many french cathedrals always project strongly cathedral whether of monastic or secular foundation often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings in particular chapter house and cloister with two exceptions naves and eastern arms of cathedrals have single lower aisles on either side with a clerestory that illuminates central space at bristol aisles are at same height as medieval choir like some german cathedrals and at chichester there are two aisles on either side of nave like some french cathedrals at a number of cathedrals where transepts are large they also have aisles either on eastern side as at peterborough durham lincoln and salisbury or both as at wells winchester ely and york winchester and ely additionally have a third aisle at end of both transepts

view at winchester taken from near north west corner of cathedral and with a war memorial statue in foreground looks acutely along north side of building showing it receding into distance length nave and sometimes eastern arm are often of great length by comparison with medieval cathedrals of other countries seven of twenty five english cathedrals canterbury durham ely lincoln st albans winchester and york exceeding 150 metres being between only equalled by cathedrals of milan and florence another nine of cathedrals norwich peterborough salisbury worcester gloucester wells exeter chichester and lichfield are between long by comparison largest cathedrals of northern france notre dame de paris amiens rouen reims and chartres are all about 135 140 metres in length as is cologne in germany longest cathedrals of spain including seville which has largest floor area of any medieval church are about 120 metres five english cathedrals chester hereford rochester southwell and ripon are between in length last four cathedrals all for various reasons either have no medieval nave or only a few remaining bays at bristol and southwark naves were built in victorian era leaving carlisle and oxford with naves of only two and four bays respectively as smallest of england s ancient cathedrals at and thumb nave of winchester gives an impression of height as well as length but at it is half height of beauvais alt this interior view at winchester shows whole length of nave which has huge stone piers that appear to comprise clusters of upward sweeping stone shafts stone vault has ribs which sweep up to a point like branches of trees in a forest overall effect is visually spectacular height by contrast with their tendency towards extreme length vaults of english cathedrals are low compared with many of those found in other countries highest medieval stone vault in england is at westminster abbey at that at york minster being of same height but despite its appearance not actually of stone but wood majority of english cathedrals have vaults ranging in height from these contrast with cathedrals such as beauvais amiens and cologne with internal heights of over towers an important feature of english cathedrals uncommon elsewhere except in normandy is large and often elaborate square central tower over crossing larger of these towers range from at wells to at lincoln central tower may exist as a single feature as at salisbury gloucester worcester norwich and chichester or in combination with paired towers at west front as at york lincoln canterbury durham and wells among cathedrals that have three towers central tower is usually tallest at southwell two western towers are capped by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead thumb upright left central tower of canterbury cathedral is alt tower at canterbury is seen rising high above one of transepts it is in two stages with pairs of tall arched windows in each stage at four corners are buttresses which are much ornamented and terminate in four large carved pinnacles tall gothic central spires remain at salisbury and norwich that at chichester having been rebuilt in 19th century after its collapse spire of salisbury at is tallest in britain it is also tallest 14th century spire tallest ashlar masonry spire in contrast to openwork spires of germany and france and tallest spire in world that remains from medieval period that has not been entirely rebuilt however it was greatly surpassed in height by spires of lincoln and old st paul s at lincoln between early 14th century and 1548 central tower was surmounted by tallest spire in world at about but this fell in a storm lichfield cathedral uniquely in england has three medieval masonry spires although single western towers are common in english parish churches only one medieval cathedral ely retains a centrally placed western tower and in that case it was framed by two lower lateral towers one of which has since fallen down ely alone among england s cathedrals has a central feature over crossing that somewhat resembles polygonal vaulted lantern towers of spain this elaborate lantern like structure known as octagon spans both nave and aisles and is thus said to have inspired christopher wren s design for dome of st paul s cathedral its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer beams an architectural device unique to english gothic facades thumb exeter cathedral has a screen with much original sculpture alt facade of exeter cathedral appears to have been constructed in three layers in first layer there is gable of cathedral with a traceried window which over battlements of second layer this layer which is battlemented includes lower aisles and a large western window which has within its arch a circular pattern of elaborate stone lace across entire lower front of building stretches a stone screen with three doors into nave and aisles screen is tiered with niches containing numerous statues facades of english cathedrals show a considerable diversity rather than a consistent progression as is case in northern france and other cathedrals influenced by french gothic style in many cases regardless of architectural form english facade was treated as a decorative screen with many niches occupied by statues a great number of these were toppled or defaced during 17th century however a gallery of kings remains high on facade of lincoln and many of original weather worn figures remain at exeter most english cathedral facades fall into two basic types with several variations most typical cathedrals are those that have large paired towers at their western end as at canterbury durham southwell wells ripon and york thumb left wells cathedral has towers a sculpture gallery and lancet windows alt facade of wells unlike exeter presents a unified and balanced composition however towers look truncated because they were intended to have spires that were not built between towers is either a single large traceried window as at york and canterbury or an arrangement of untraceried lancets as at ripon and wells rather than rose windows typical of french facades there are usually three doors but unlike those of french cathedrals they are rarely highly elaborate and far more emphasis is placed on central door than those to either side entrance in most common use is sometimes located in a porch at one side of nave where there are not two large towers at west front there are generally two pinnacled turrets that frame facade or central nave much in nature of very large buttresses this arrangement may be seen at salisbury winchester and rochester thumb early english facade of peterborough cathedral is unique alt appearance of this facade which is described in text is overwhelmingly and majestic at lincoln a vast gothic screen with similar buttress like terminals was built across front of cathedral incorporating norman portals but hiding norman towers towers were then greatly heightened to be visible above screen a gothic screen was also added to norman nave at peterborough but this is an architectural oddity with no precedent or successor screen is composed of three enormous open arches two outer ones being much wider than that which frames central door overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by later porch and fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind screen despite this it is regarded as one of supreme masterpieces of gothic revealing enormous diversity and imagination of english medieval architects ripon east end thumb left ripon cathedral has a cliff like east end typical of english gothic alt square east end of ripon cathedral is defined by strongly projecting buttresses terminating in gables and pinnacles there is a large decorated east window with tracery in a circle like west window at exeter eastern end eastern ends of english cathedrals show a greater diversity than those of any other country those built in norman era had high apsidal ends surrounded by a lower ambulatory as is typical of northern france this arrangement still exists at norwich and in part at peterborough and also with variation in early english gothic east end at canterbury but in every other case has been modified typical arrangement for an english gothic east end is square and may be an unbroken cliff like design as at york lincoln ripon ely and carlisle or may have a projecting lady chapel of which there is a great diversity as at salisbury lichfield hereford exeter and chichester ends of norwich and canterbury also have projecting chapels that at norwich being a gothic addition to norman east end while that at canterbury known as corona being designed as part of early english plan specifically to enshrine relic of crown of thomas becket s skull sliced off at time of his assassination east ends of a number of other cathedrals such as durham peterborough and gloucester have been modified in various ways and do not fit any particular model thumb 240px lichfield cathedral postcard 1888 alt this faded postcard of lichfield cathedral shows a delicately coloured engraving of cathedral with three tall slim spires rising against sunlit clouds above a gliding river external appearance as english cathedrals are often surrounded by an expanse of green lawn plan is usually clearly visible at ground level which is not case with many european cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings general impression is that english cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs these horizontal projections are visibly balanced by strong verticals of massive towers which may be one two or three in number many of cathedrals particularly those like winchester st albans and peterborough where towers are not particularly high give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling aircraft carriers thumb left 240px salisbury cathedral oil painting john constable 1820s alt one of constable s best known works this shows salisbury cathedral with its single tall spire lit by sun against a stormy sky it is viewed through an arch made by two tall trees while all cathedrals are impressive some because of their location are highly significant landmarks and landscape elements among these is chichester which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields and is only one of england s cathedrals that is visible from sea grey spire of norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city to be a focus of norwich school of landscape painters ely on a small hill dominates rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as ship of fens three spires of lichfield are known as ladies of vale exquisite tower of worcester is seen best across river severn lincoln with its vast facade and three towers tallest being over 80 metres 270 ft rises majestically from a steep hill above town salisbury cathedral with its faultless spire constitutes one of iconic views of england made famous by landscape painter john constable in north of england durham makes a spectacular view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above river wear half church of god half castle scots internal appearance thumb in wells cathedral horizontal is emphasised rather than vertical alt an interior view of nave at wells as described in text nave terminates abruptly in a structure known as st andrew s cross which was inserted to support tower horizontal emphasis because architecture of english cathedrals is so diverse and inventive internal appearances differ a great deal however in general english cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length this is in part because many of buildings are actually very long but also because more than in medieval architecture of any other country horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as vertical this is particularly case at wells where unlike most gothic buildings there are no vertical shafts that continue from arcade to vault and there is a very strong emphasis on triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while course below triforium and undecorated capitals of purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals in cases of winchester norwich and exeter horizontal effect is created by emphasis on ridge rib of elaborate vaults thumb left lierne vaulting at winchester alt this view shows a vaulted ceiling of great complexity with many small interconnecting ribs there are carved and gilt stone bosses wherever ribs meet complex vaulting complexity of vault is another significant feature of english cathedrals vaults range from simple vault in french manner at chichester through increasingly elaborate forms including multi ribbed tierceron vault at exeter similar vault with inter connecting lierne ribs at norwich still more elaborate variation at winchester array of unique lierne vaults at bristol net like stellar vaulting of choirs at gloucester and york fan vaulting of retro choir at peterborough and pendant vaulting of choir at oxford where elaborate long stone bosses are suspended from ceiling like lanterns many of more elaborate forms are unique to england with stellar vaulting also occurring in spain and germany architectural styles thumb upright norman interior of peterborough cathedral alt this interior view of peterborough shows part of very long nave and chancel with no screen dividing building structure is mostly of a unified norman appearance with three levels of simple round topped arches only tall arches of central tower being gothic other visible features are ancient painted ceiling medieval choir stalls and modern rood which has a gilt wooden figure of christ on a red cross suspended high in front of tower arch saxon while in most cases a norman church entirely replaced a saxon one at ripon cathedral uniquely retains its early saxon crypt while a similar crypt also survives below former cathedral of hexham at winchester excavated foundations of 10th century cathedral when built largest church in northern europe are marked on grass of cathedral close at worcester a new cathedral was built in norman style from 1084 but crypt contains re used stonework and columns from its two saxon predecessor churches elsewhere abbey church of sherborne preserves much masonry from former saxon cathedral in west front transepts and crossing so that nave and crossing of present late medieval abbey retains proportions of previous saxon structure norman comprehensive reconstruction of saxon cathedral churches of england by normans represented single largest ecclesiastical building programme of medieval europe and when built these were biggest structures to have been erected in christian europe since end of roman empire all medieval cathedrals of england with exception of salisbury lichfield and wells have evidence of norman architecture peterborough durham and norwich remain for greater part norman buildings while at many others there are substantial parts of building in norman style such as naves of ely gloucester and southwell and transepts at winchester norman architecture is distinguished by its round headed arches and bold tiers of arcades on piers which originally supported flat wooden roofs of which two survive at peterborough and ely columns where used are massive as in nave at gloucester and are alternated with piers at durham mouldings were cut with geometric designs and arcading was a major decorative form particularly externally little figurative sculpture has survived notably barbaric ornament around west doors at lincoln bestial capitals of crypt at canterbury and tympanum of west door at rochester thumb upright left lancet gothic at salisbury cathedral alt a view into north transept at salisbury shows a harmonious arrangement of lancet arches rising in three tiers of various sizing and grouping details are enhanced by narrow attached shafts of dark coloured purbeck marble ribbed vault is of a simple form lancet gothic many of cathedrals have major parts in late 12th to early 13th century style known as lancet gothic or early english gothic and defined by its simple untraceried lancet like openings salisbury cathedral is major example of this style which is also seen at wells and worcester at eastern arms of canterbury hereford and southwark and transepts of york also of this period is spectacular facade of peterborough and less grand but harmonious facade of ripon decorated gothic decorated gothic style with traceried windows is further subdivided dependent upon whether tracery is geometric or curvilinear many cathedrals have important parts in geometric style of mid 13th to early 14th centuries including much of lincoln lichfield choir of ely and chapter houses of salisbury and southwell by late 13th century style of tracery evolved to include a greater number of narrow shapes that adapted easily to gothic openings in combination with circular shapes as can be seen in windows of chapter house of york octagon of ely and west window of exeter thumb upright decorated gothic at exeter cathedral alt interior of nave at exeter shows a great richness and diversity of decoration above gothic arcade runs an ornately sculptured blind gallery above which rise clerestory windows full of tracery wide western window of nine lights beneath an upper rose fills western end vault has many ribs of strong profile which spring out in clusters like palm branches further development included repetition of curvilinear or flame like forms that occur in a great number of windows of around 1320 notably in retro choir at wells and nave of exeter cathedral this type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding as is seen in chapter house at wells and vault at exeter which stretches uninterrupted by a central tower for 91 metres 300 ft and is longest medieval vault in world last stage of curvilinear or flowing decorated gothic is expressed in tracery of very varied and highly complex forms many of largest and most famous windows of england date from 1320 30 and are in this style they include south transept rose window known as bishop s eye at lincoln heart of yorkshire window in west end of york and famous nine light east window of carlisle there are many smaller architectural works within cathedrals which have curvilinear tracery these include arcading in lady chapel at ely which also has widest vault in england pulpitum screen at lincoln and richly decorated doorways at ely and rochester characteristic of this period of gothic is elaborate lierne vaulting in which main ribs are connected by intermediate ribs which do not spring from wall and so are not major structural members vaults of bristol are most famous examples of this style which can also be seen at york thumb left upright perpendicular choir of york minster alt this interior view at york shows gothic style becoming less about projecting forms and more about surface treatment walls vault and east window are all covered with a decorative net like tracery pattern of vault ribs resembles interconnecting stars perpendicular gothic in 1330s when architects of europe were embracing flamboyant style english architecture moved away from flowing decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with reconstruction in highly modular form of choir of norman abbey now cathedral at gloucester perpendicular style which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect gives an overall impression of great unity in which structure of vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with arcades below and vault above style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in naves of canterbury and winchester and in choir of york during 15th century many of england s finest towers were either built or extended in perpendicular style including those of cathedrals of gloucester worcester wells york durham and canterbury and spires of chichester and norwich design of church interiors went through a final stage that lasted into 16th century this was development of fan vaulting first used in about 1370 in cloisters at gloucester then in retrochoir at peterborough in early 15th century in a still more elaborate form with stone pendants it was used to roof norman choir at oxford and in great funerary chapel of henry vii at westminster abbey at a time when italy had embraced renaissance thumb upright this view of chichester cathedral shows four distinct architectural styles alt this picture of chichester cathedral shows norman windows of nave clerestory early english windows of tower geometric windows of aisles and large perpendicular window of transept spire is a victorian restoration architectural diversity plan of salisbury cathedral is that most often reproduced in architectural histories for purpose of comparing english gothic architecture with that of france italy and other countries it has many features that on paper at least are typical plan of worcester

architectural drawings survive for any english cathedral earlier than 1525 although an engineer s design for a proposed new water supply at canterbury cathedral priory exists in a 12th century plan architectural details such as window tracery designs were not executed as scale drawings but were incised full size onto a large flat gypsum tracing floor examples of which survive at york and wells medieval construction was seasonal work on site being undertaken only in spring and summer when light was good and weather more reliable each autumn all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage architects worked over winter in tracing house that of york has both a fireplace and a privy to prepare designs for next season s campaign they translated designs into sets of planed oak cross sectional templates which were given to stone cutters construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at eastern arm and then proceeded westwards with towers
