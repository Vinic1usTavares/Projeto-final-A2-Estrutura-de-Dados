finding that it was almost completely crippled by self seriousness vanderwerff felt that episode reflected millennium seeming simultaneously both intrinsically of 1990s and ahead of its time find that its treatment of dread and shadowy fear and sense that world held several cloaked and mysterious evils for well to do americans was a symptom of 1990s preoccupation with end of world while foreshadowing mood of united states following september 11 attacks in new york in 2001 as a result vanderwerff described episode and series as being first post sept 11 show bill gibron writing for dvd talk rated episode 4 5 out of 5 noting that there is more here than just your standard serial killer show gibron praised episode s atypical storyline which he felt was achieved through some suggestive effects and wonderful crosscutting robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode two and a half stars out of five calling it a somewhat humdrum story shearman and pearson felt that episode s core premise that of a company being a front for a terrorist cult was intriguing but that millennial flavour that accompanies this resulted in episode seeming a little confused shearman and pearson pp 106 107 notes footnotes references external links category millennium season 1 episodes category 1996 american
