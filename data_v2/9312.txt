what he deemed a classical witch brown designed witch with a long nose and a broomstick he created a plasticine model of character as a reference for a painting that was used for game s box art brown was joined by richard leinfellner who served as lead programmer two enjoyed different video game genres brown liked platform games while leinfellner preferred shoot em ups and decided to create a game engine that could handle both methods of playing both developers play tested game but only played segments individually rather than in a sequence in retrospect brown attributes game s excess difficulty to this along with fact that two played with unlimited game lives game was released on three home computers amstrad cpc commodore 64 and zx spectrum spectrum and amstrad versions lack scrolling graphics in shoot em up levels and use flick screening to approximate it a port of palace s 1984 game evil dead originally programmed for commodore 64 by leinfellner was included on second
