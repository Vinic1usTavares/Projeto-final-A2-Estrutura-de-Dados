giant freshwater stingray urogymnus polylepis also widely known by junior synonym himantura chaophraya is a species of stingray in family dasyatidae it is found in large rivers and estuaries in southeast asia and borneo though historically it may have been more widely distributed in south and southeast asia one of largest freshwater fish in world this species grows upwards of across and may reach in weight it has a relatively thin oval pectoral fin disc that is widest anteriorly and a sharply pointed snout with a protruding tip its tail is thin and whip like and lacks fin folds this species is uniformly grayish brown above and white below underside of pectoral and pelvic fins bear distinctive wide dark bands on their posterior margins bottom dwelling in nature giant freshwater stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates females give live birth to litters of one to four pups which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph uterine milk this species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat recreation and aquarium display as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation these forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central thailand and cambodia as a result international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed giant freshwater stingray as endangered taxonomy and phylogeny first scientific description of giant freshwater stingray was authored by dutch ichthyologist pieter bleeker in an 1852 volume of journal verhandelingen van het bataviaasch van kunsten en wetenschappen his account was based on a juvenile specimen across collected from jakarta indonesia bleeker named new species polylepis from greek poly many and scales and assigned it to genus trygon now a synonym of dasyatis however in subsequent years bleeker s description was largely overlooked and in 1990 giant freshwater stingray was described again by and tyson roberts in an issue of japanese journal of ichthyology they gave it name himantura chaophraya which came into widespread usage in 2008 peter last and b mabel manjaji matsumoto confirmed that t polylepis and h chaophraya refer to same species and since bleeker s name was published earlier scientific name of giant freshwater stingray became himantura polylepis this species may also be called giant freshwater whipray giant stingray or freshwater whipray thumb upright 0 8 left annandale s trygon fluviatilis may represent an indian population of giant freshwater stingray there is a complex of similar freshwater and estuarine stingrays in south asia southeast asia and australasia that are or were tentatively identified with u polylepis australian freshwater urogymnus were described as a separate species urogymnus dalyensis in 2008 freshwater urogymnus in new guinea are probably u dalyensis rather than u polylepis though confirmation awaits further study trygon fluviatilis from india as described by nelson annandale in 1909 closely resembles and may be conspecific with u polylepis on other hand comparison of freshwater whipray dna and amino acid sequences between india and thailand has revealed significant differences finally additional research is needed to assess degree of divergence amongst populations of u polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted in terms of broader evolutionary relationships between giant freshwater whipray and rest of family dasyatidae a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial dna reported that it was most closely related to porcupine ray urogymnus and that they in turn formed a clade with mangrove whipray u granulatus and whipray u this finding adds to a growing consensus that genus himantura sensu lato is paraphyletic description thumb preserved giant freshwater stingray showing characteristic shape of its disc giant freshwater stingray has a thin oval pectoral fin disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards front elongated snout has a wide base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond disc eyes are minute and widely spaced behind them are large spiracles between nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae two to four large at center and one to four small to sides on floor small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement like bands there are five pairs of gill slits on ventral side of disc pelvic fins are small and thin mature males have relatively large claspers thin cylindrical tail measures 1 8 2 5 times as long as disc and lacks fin folds a single serrated stinging spine is positioned on upper surface of tail near base at up to long spine is largest of any stingray species there is band of heart shaped tubercles on upper surface of disc extending from before eyes to base of sting there is also a midline row of four to six enlarged tubercles at center of disc remainder of disc upper surface is covered by tiny granular denticles and tail is covered with sharp past sting this species is plain grayish brown above often with a yellowish or pinkish tint towards fin margins in life skin is coated with a layer of dark brown mucus underside is white with broad dark bands edged with small spots on trailing margins of pectoral and pelvic fins tail is black behind spine giant freshwater stingray reaches at least in width and in length and can likely grow larger with reports from mekong and chao phraya rivers of individuals weighing it ranks among largest freshwater fishes in world distribution and habitat giant freshwater stingray is known to inhabit several large rivers and associated estuaries in indochina and borneo in indochina it occurs in mekong river to potentially as far upstream as chiang khong in thailand as well as in chao phraya nan mae klong bang pakong and rivers also found in bueng but now completely extinct in borneo this species is found in river in kalimantan and kinabatangan and rivers in sabah it is reportedly common in kinabatangan river but infrequently caught though it has been reported from sarawak as well surveys within past 25 years have not found it there elsewhere in region recent river surveys in java have not recorded its presence despite island being locality of species holotype historical records from myanmar ganges river in india and bay of bengal latter two as trygon fluviatilis have similarly not been corroborated by any recent accounts disjunct populations of giant freshwater stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another though species occurs in brackish environments there is no evidence that it crosses marine waters this is a bottom dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat unexpectedly it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas biology and ecology diet of giant freshwater stingray consists of small fishes and invertebrates such as crustaceans and molluscs which it can detect using its electroreceptive ampullae of lorenzini individuals can often be seen at edge of river possibly feeding on earthworms parasites documented from this species include tapeworms acanthobothrium a a a a rhinebothrium r and r giant freshwater stingray is viviparous with developing embryos nourished initially by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk provided by mother this species does not appear to be diadromous migrating between fresh and salt water to complete its life cycle observed litter sizes range from one to four pups newborns measure around across pregnant females are frequently found in estuaries which may serve as nursery areas males mature sexually at approximately across female maturation size and other life history details are unknown human interactions giant freshwater stingray is not aggressive but its sting is sheathed in toxic mucus and is capable of piercing bone across its range this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines and to a lesser extent gillnets and fish traps it is reputedly difficult and time consuming to catch a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud becoming almost impossible to lift or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater meat and cartilage are used large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale adults that are not used for food are often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless in mae klong and bang pakong rivers giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums these trends pose conservation concerns former because catch and release is not universally practised and post release survival rate is unknown latter because this species does not survive well in captivity major threats to giant freshwater stingray are overfishing and habitat degradation resulting from deforestation land development and damming construction of dams also fragments population reducing genetic diversity and increasing susceptibility of resulting subpopulations to extinction due to its low reproductive rate giant freshwater stingray is not resilient to anthropogenic pressures in central thailand and cambodia population is estimated to have been reduced by 30 50 over past 20 30 years with declines as severe as 95 in some locations size of rays caught has decreased significantly as well for example in cambodia average weight of a landed ray has dropped from in 1980 to in 2006 status of populations in other areas such as borneo is largely unknown as a result of documented declines international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as endangered overall and as critically endangered in thailand in 1990s thai government initiated a captive breeding program at chai nat to bolster population of this and other freshwater stingray species until issue of habitat degradation can be remedied however by 1996 program had been put on hold references polylepis category fish of southeast asia category fish of thailand category fish
