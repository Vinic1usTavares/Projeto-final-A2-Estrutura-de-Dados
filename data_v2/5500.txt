america where he was besieged by merchandising offers but had signed away 90 per cent of rights in advance this is viewed as his one miscalculation some of epstein s other young discoveries had also prospered at this time under his management they included gerry and pacemakers billy j kramer and dakotas tommy quickly and cilla black his only female client as a gay man epstein had to observe great

technique and was impressed enough to lure him to work for nems with offer of a higher salary and a commission on sales beatles epstein first noticed beatles in issues of mersey beat and on numerous posters around liverpool created by his commercial artist associate tony booth before he asked mersey beat editor bill harry who they were harry had previously convinced epstein to sell magazine at nems with beatles featured on front page of its second issue beatles had recorded my bonnie single with tony sheridan in germany and some months after its release epstein asked his personal assistant alistair taylor about it in nems epstein s version of story was that customer raymond jones walked into nems shop and asked him for my bonnie single which made epstein curious about group taylor later claimed that he had used name of jones a regular customer to order single and paid deposit knowing that epstein would notice it and order further copies harry and mccartney later repudiated epstein s story as harry had been talking to epstein for a long time about beatles group that he promoted most in mersey beat with mccartney saying brian knew perfectly well who beatles were they were on front page of second issue of mersey beat on 3 august 1961 epstein started a regular music column in mersey beat called stop world and listen to everything in it brian epstein of nems beatles were due to perform a lunchtime concert at cavern club on 9 november 1961 according to club owner sytner epstein had visited club quite a few times previously on saturday nights once asking sytner to book a group for his twenty first birthday party epstein asked harry to arrange for epstein and his assistant taylor to watch beatles perform club allowed epstein and taylor to enter without queuing they bypassed line of fans at door and heard bob wooler resident disc jockey announce a welcome message over club s public address system we have someone rather famous in audience today mr brian epstein owner of nems epstein later talked about performance i was immediately struck by their music their beat and their sense of humour on stage and even afterwards when i met them i was struck again by their personal charm and it was there that really it all started after performance epstein and taylor went into dressing room which he later described as being as big as a broom cupboard to talk to group beatles anthology dvd 2003 episode 1 0 57 59 epstein talking about his first meeting with beatles beatles all regular nems customers immediately recognised epstein but before he could congratulate them on their performance george harrison said and what brings mr epstein here epstein replied with we just popped in to say hello i enjoyed your performance he introduced taylor who merely nodded a greeting said well done then goodbye and left epstein and taylor went to peacock s restaurant in hey for lunch and during meal epstein asked taylor what he thought about group taylor replied that he honestly thought they were absolutely awful but there was something remarkable about them epstein sat there smiling for a long time before exclaiming i think they re tremendous later when epstein was paying bill he grabbed taylor s arm and said do you think i should manage them beatles played at cavern club over next three weeks and epstein was always there to watch them he contacted allan williams their previous promoter manager to confirm that williams no longer had any ties to group but williams advised epstein not to touch them with a fucking barge pole because of a hamburg concert percentage that group had refused to pay management contract in an afternoon meeting with group at nems on 3 december 1961 epstein proposed idea of managing beatles john lennon harrison and pete best arrived late for meeting as they had been drinking at grapes pub in mathew street mccartney also did not arrive on time because he had just got up and was taking a bath as harrison explained epstein was upset but harrison placated him by saying he may be late but he ll be very clean lennon had invited wooler to be at meeting so that he could give his opinion of epstein but he introduced wooler by saying this is me dad epstein was reticent throughout short meeting only asking if they had a manager after learning that they had not he said it seems to me that with everything going on someone ought to be looking after you he had further meetings with group on 6 and 10 december 1961 mccartney harrison and best were under 21 and therefore needed consent of their parents to enter into a contract best and his mother mona best owner of casbah coffee club were impressed with epstein s professional image as were other beatles because he was a businessman wore expensive suits and owned a large car best s mother said that epstein could be good for them beatles mccartney s father was skeptical about a jewish manager and warned his son to be careful about finances beatles et al 2000 p 65 lennon s aunt and guardian mimi smith was against idea believing that epstein would lose interest when something attracted his attention but lennon who had just turned 21 ignored his aunt s advice beatles signed a five year contract with epstein on 24 january 1962 giving epstein 10 to 15 per cent of their income they signed a new contract in october 1962 which gave epstein 15 20 or 25 per cent of revenues depending on how much he helped band earn beatles would then share any income after various expenses had been deducted epstein then formed a management company nems enterprises telling his parents that managing group was only a part time occupation and would not interfere with family business beatles signed epstein s first management contract but epstein did not he later told taylor well if they ever want to tear it up they can hold me but i can t hold them note english law would have enforced contract through doctrine of part performance contract stated that epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of group s gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached beatles argued for a smaller percentage but epstein pointed out that he had been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return on 1 october 1962 four days before release of love me do epstein signed lennon and mccartney to a three year nems publishing contract in 1963 epstein advised creation of northern songs a publishing company that would control copyrights of all lennon mccartney compositions recorded between 1963 and 1973 music publisher dick james and his partner charles silver owned 51 per cent of company lennon and mccartney 20 per cent each and epstein 9 per cent by 1969 lennon and mccartney had lost control of all publishing rights to atv music publishing epstein s death in 1967 marked beginning of group s dissolution and had a profound effect on each beatle in 1997 mccartney said if anyone was fifth beatle it was brian beatles appearance on stage epstein had no prior experience of artist management yet he had a strong influence on band s early dress code and stage demeanor they had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song david states that when epstein first saw them at cavern club he thought they were a scruffy crowd in leather and they were not very tidy and not very clean they smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties insisted that they stop swearing smoking drinking or eating on stage and also suggested famous synchronised bow at end of their performances mccartney was first to agree with epstein s suggestions believing that they reflected epstein s rada training epstein explained that process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time i encouraged them at first to get out of leather jackets and jeans and i wouldn t allow them to appear in jeans after a short time and then after that step i got them to wear sweaters on stage and then very reluctantly eventually suits epstein took group to wirral to see his friend master tailor beno dorn who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen but which epstein approved of i thought it was an excellent design at time lennon resisted wearing suits and ties but later said i ll wear a suit i ll wear a bloody balloon if somebody s going to pay me epstein began seeking publicity by charming and newspaper people as lennon said in 1972 beatles et al 2000 p 66 according to mccartney gigs went up in stature and though pay went up only a little bit it did go up they were now playing better places beatles et al 2000 p 67 group was now far more organised having one single diary in which to record bookings rather than using whoever s diary was at hand group usually called epstein mr epstein or brian in interviews but in private group abbreviated his name to or bri record contract thumb right 270px telegram that epstein sent to mersey beat newspaper in liverpool to announce that he had secured beatles their first recording contract epstein made numerous trips to london to visit record companies in hope of securing a record contract but many rejected him including columbia pye philips oriole and most notoriously decca on 13 december 1961 at epstein s invitation mike smith of decca travelled from london to liverpool to watch group at cavern which led to an audition in london on 1 january 1962 see beatles decca audition decca informed epstein one month later that audition tapes had been rejected beatles later found out that epstein had paid decca producer tony meehan ex drummer of shadows to produce studio recordings while epstein was negotiating with decca he also approached ron white an emi marketing executive who contacted emi producers norrie walter ridley and norman newell but they all declined to record group white could not contact emi s fourth staff producer george martin as he was on holiday on 8 may 1962 epstein visited hmv store owned by emi in 363 oxford street london to have decca tape transferred to 78 rpm acetates an hmv disc cutter named jim foy liked recordings suggesting that epstein should contact sid coleman head of emi s record publishing division which controlled publishing company ardmore beechwood coleman liked recordings and sent epstein to martin a r manager of parlophone on next day 9 may 1962 epstein met martin at emi s abbey road studios supposedly martin had no intention of signing beatles after listening to decca recordings but he offered a contract after learning that epstein would cancel all his substantial nems business with emi day in life p32 martin denied this account by saying that epstein s conviction that beatles would become internationally famous finally convinced him to offer a recording contract he also later admitted that emi had nothing to lose by signing a contract with beatles as terms of payment were negligible at this point almost every other british record company had rejected group and martin had never heard group live beatles were eventually signed to emi s small parlophone label which had very little experience with pop or rock artists upon signing contract epstein immediately sent a telegram to beatles who were in hamburg and to mersey beat music journal in liverpool recording contract gave beatles one penny 1d for each record sold which was split among four members meaning that each earned one farthing per copy royalty rate was further reduced for singles sold outside uk group received half of one penny per single which was again split amongst whole group martin scheduled first recording session to be on 6 june 1962 at abbey road studios epstein later renegotiated emi s royalty rate and on 27 january 1967 beatles signed a new nine year contract with emi contract stipulated that 25 per cent would be paid to nems for full nine years even if beatles decided not to renew their management contract with epstein which was up for renewal later that year dismissal of pete best after first recording session on 6 june 1962 martin had one reservation as he felt that using an experienced studio session drummer rather than pete best would improve recording this was in accordance with normal practice at time lennon mccartney and harrison asked epstein to sack best when they learned that martin wanted to replace him on their recordings epstein agonised about decision asking cavern s disc jockey bob wooler if it was a good idea wooler replied that best was very popular with fans who would not like it at all epstein dismissed best on 16 august over two and half months after first recording session at emi studios best was never given an explanation for his dismissal epstein initially offered vacant position to johnny hutchinson of big three a group that epstein managed at that time as well hutchinson turned down offer saying pete best is a very good friend of mine i couldn t do dirty on him although hutchinson did play for beatles at short notice when best did not turn up on evening of his dismissal and for two subsequent bookings until ringo starr was able to join starr was well known to group as he was then playing with rory storm and hurricanes resident group at butlins holiday complex in skegness he had also occasionally replaced best when drummer was ill and had performed at a recording session with lennon mccartney and harrison in hamburg beatles last official live appearance in uk beatles made their last official live appearance in britain on 1 may 1966 at nme annual poll winners all star concert at empire pool wembley park although concert was televised cameras were switched off while beatles played because brian epstein and abc tv had failed to agree over terms they were filmed receiving their awards however after candlestick park beatles hectic schedule kept epstein very busy between 1963 and 1965 with touring plus television and film work their last live concert was at candlestick park in san francisco on 29 august 1966 and epstein s management duties then changed to reflect changing nature of their career he pressured them to continue touring but they steadfastly refused business dealings epstein once offered all four beatles a fixed wage of ps50 a week for life harrison remembered that he was earning ps25 a week at time which was more than ps10 a week that his father was earning group declined epstein s offer believing that they were worth much more than ps50 a week nems had a staff of twenty five at time of its move from liverpool to london in 1964 nems booked beatles concerts and it also presented groups as an opening act it accrued money as promoter booking agent and manager for all concerts beatles were constantly in demand by concert promoters and epstein took advantage of situation to avoid paying some taxes by accepting hidden fees on night of a performance which he always kept in a brown paper bag epstein also successfully managed gerry and pacemakers billy j kramer and dakotas who had four hits with lennon mccartney songs lennon wrote their first two singles epstein s first american group and cilla black who was epstein s only female artist as well as tommy quickly and sounds incorporated later known as sounds inc he sent his roster of artists on package tours around uk a common practice at time this involved short sets by each act alternating with a compere or a comedian epstein once revealed that even though he was entitled to be reimbursed by acts for expenses incurred he paid for his own flights to and from united states as he did not see himself as being part of a touring group photographs transport and international telephone calls were paid from his own 25 percent share in profits beatles toured philippines in july 1966 playing two shows at rizal memorial football stadium in manila epstein unintentionally snubbed nation s first lady imelda marcos when presented with an invitation to a breakfast party he had politely declined on behalf of group as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on same day and given a police escort to airport even though epstein had publicly apologised for misunderstanding in a televised statement which was not seen or heard because of static entourage boarded plane for home but epstein and beatles assistant mal evans were ordered off both believing that they would not be allowed back on plane epstein was forced to give tax authorities ps6 800 worth of philippine peso notes earned from manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying exchange before being allowed back on plane with evans epstein added vic lewis organisation to nems in 1966 and later brought impresario robert stigwood in as a manager he once offered to sell control of nems to stigwood without telling any of his artists about offer mccartney was taking a more active interest in nems finances as it became known that some artists with more ruthless managers claimed to be benefiting from more commercially advantageous terms such as rolling stones under management of allen klein after epstein s death clive epstein assumed control of nems as company s second largest shareholder stigwood then tried to take over management of nems but all four beatles vigorously objected with lennon saying we don t know you why would we do this mccartney admitted that they had always signed all contracts that epstein presented to them without reading them first but after epstein s death lennon complained well he was alright i ve found out since of course that he wasn t quite as honest to us as he made out despite this other interviews with lennon report him as being loyal to epstein s memory we had complete faith in him when he was running us to us he was expert when asked in 1964 about his standing as a manager or businessman epstein replied fair as a businessman fair i ve got a business background and probably a reasonable business brain i m no sort of genius laughter asked about his deficiencies epstein replied i m probably too conscious of ideas rather than finance behind ideas merchandising before beatles achieved nationwide success in britain epstein had permitted a company run by his cousins and initially catering to fan club members mojo magazine 2002 special limited edition no m p 100 to produce beatles sweaters for 30 shillings ps1 50 and badges for 6 pence 6d 2 1 2p it sold 15 000 sweaters and 50 000 badges as group s popularity grew when beatlemania swept uk in november 1963 epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies desperate to use beatles name on plastic guitars drums disc racks badges belts and other merchandise epstein refused to allow beatles to endorse any product directly but through nems enterprises he granted discretionary licences to companies who were able to produce good quality products at a fair price even though many companies were already selling products without a licence during first beatles trip to united states merchandisers pitched many products to epstein including beatles clocks pens cigarette lighters plastic wigs bracelets games etc but he rejected them all this was because he had already allowed david jacobs lawyer for nems to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one nicky byrne in uk this was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake as it left only 10 per cent for epstein nems and beatles byrne then took over epstein s merchandising in uk and set up seltaeb beatles spelled backwards in united states while beatles were ensconced in plaza hotel in new york epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters retailers television commentators and hustlers mindful of number of records group was selling in united states capitol records sent a well spoken yorkshire woman wendy hanson to plaza hotel to act as epstein s secretary and to filter his calls hanson later worked solely with epstein in his albemarle street office in london which was separate from nems office lennon later said on business end he epstein ripped us off on seltaeb thing mccartney said years later he epstein looked to his dad for business advice and his dad knew how to run a furniture store in liverpool lenmac epstein asked chartered accountant james trevor isherwood to set up a company to collect lennon and mccartney s prs payments called lenmac which he did on 12 may 1964 when he first visited epstein s office isherwood was surprised to learn that epstein took 25 per cent of gross income and not 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time all of epstein s expenses were deducted from his artists gross income including office rental staff wages travel telephone costs and entertaining expenses before his death epstein knew that renegotiation of his management contract up for renewal on 30 september 1967 would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent and that nems would no longer receive a share of beatles performance fees reducing its revenues still further publishing beatles entered into a publishing agreement with dick james music so james set up a company called northern songs james and his financial partner and accountant charles silver would each receive 25 per cent of shares lennon and mccartney received 20 per cent each with epstein receiving remaining 10 per cent beatles prs income increased rapidly so epstein asked isherwood to devise a way of avoiding tax that lennon and mccartney would owe isherwood suggested a stock market flotation for northern songs he also suggested to epstein that during flotation lennon and mccartney should move to houses near isherwood s own in esher lennon harrison and starr agreed while epstein and mccartney remained in london promoter and presenter thumb upright epstein hosting teen music program hullabaloo 8 january 1965 after settling in london in 1965 epstein rented an office in monmouth street and later bought lease of

his flat at 36 falkner street liverpool when they needed a home he also agreed to be godfather to lennon s son julian sexual orientation epstein s homosexuality was not publicly known until some years after his death although it had been an open secret among his friends and business associates while epstein was in british army he commissioned a tailor to make an officer s uniform for him that he wore when cruising bars of london but was arrested one night at army and navy club in piccadilly by military police for impersonating an officer epstein managed to avoid a court martial by agreeing to see an army psychiatrist who learned of epstein s sexuality after ten months he was discharged from army on medical grounds for being emotionally and mentally unfit epstein later stated that his first homosexual experience was when he returned to liverpool after being discharged epstein spent a year studying acting at rada but dropped out shortly after his arrest for persistent outside a men s public toilet in swiss cottage london as it was called was one of few public ways that gay and bisexual men could meet at time especially if they were closeted when epstein first saw beatles perform he noticed their stage attire first saying they were rather scruffily dressed in nicest possible way or i should say in most attractive way black leather jackets jeans long hair of course mccartney said that when epstein started to manage beatles they knew that he was homosexual but did not care because he encouraged them professionally and offered them access to previously off limits social circles although lennon often made sarcastic comments about epstein s homosexuality to friends and to epstein personally no one outside group s inner circle was allowed to comment ian sharp one of lennon s art school friends once made a sarcastic remark about epstein saying which one of you beatles does he fancy sharp was sent a letter by epstein s office within 48 hours that demanded a complete apology sharp apologised but was then completely ostracised mccartney sent him a letter directing him to have no contact with any of them in future epstein went on holiday to places such as amsterdam torremolinos and barcelona or manchester at weekends as attitude to homosexuals there was more tolerant than in liverpool even though liverpool did have several gay bars in his autobiography

in a hotel overnight best replied that he was not interested and two never mentioned incident again there were reports of a brief sexual encounter between lennon and epstein during a four day holiday in barcelona in april 1963 lennon always denied rumours telling playboy in 1980 well it was almost a love affair but not quite it was never consummated but we did have a pretty intense relationship

after start of his management career epstein started taking stimulants usually preludin which did not require a prescription at time lennon mccartney harrison and starr had also taken it since their days in hamburg epstein explained his use of drug as only means of staying awake at night during numerous concert tours in 1964 peter brown suspected that epstein was taking too many pills as he would often cough at parties which brown realised was epstein s way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing mccartney often met epstein at late night clubs in london and remembered that epstein would often grind his jaws possibly due to bruxism once saying to him pills epstein also developed dependencies on drug a barbiturate like sedative hypnotic drug in 1964 after having been introduced to cannabis by bob dylan in new york epstein was observed by mccartney standing in front of a mirror pointing at himself and repeatedly saying jew while laughing loudly which mccartney
