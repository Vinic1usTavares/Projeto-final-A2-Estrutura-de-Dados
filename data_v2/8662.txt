grantham canal runs for 33 miles 53 km from grantham through 18 locks to west bridgford where it joins river trent it was built primarily for transportation of coal to grantham it opened in 1797 and its profitability steadily increased until 1841 it was then sold to a railway company declined and was finally closed in 1936 it was used as a water supply for agriculture and so most of it remained in water after closure although bridges were lowered since 1970s grantham canal society have been working to restore it two stretches are now navigable to small vessels a new route will be required where canal joins trent as road building has severed original one history concept of a canal from river trent to grantham was first raised on 27 august 1791 as a way of supplying district with cheaper coal intent was for navigation to join trent below nottingham at radcliffe on trent as william jessop was surveying nottingham canal at time he was to survey grantham route as well and a bill was put before parliament in 1792 it was defeated as there was opposition from coal suppliers who delivered coal by road to grantham and from those who thought that river witham would be damaged by project a revised route was developed with junction now at west bridgford and an additional branch to bingham a second bill was put forward and act of parliament received royal assent on 30 april 1793 building work on canal started in 1793 with jessop in overall charge but with james green and william king as resident engineers green who was from wollaton was appointed engineer for section of canal from trent to leicestershire border while king who was agent for duke of rutland was responsible for rest of canal including two reservoirs one at denton and other at on river devon act authorised an initial ps75 000 to be raised to pay for construction together with an option to raise a further ps30 000 of which ps20 000 should be raised by shares of ps100 each among initial subscribers and ps10 000 by mortgaging future income of canal however this amount proved insufficient and there was also disagreement between shareholders as to their liability to raise additional ps20 000 as a result a second act was sought this received royal assent on 3 march 1797 and made clear obligations of existing shareholders to pay extra subscription and also authorised an additional ps24 000 to be raised second act also removed restrictions in first act and allowed company to set whatever rates it chose for using canal eastern section from leicestershire border was opened on 1 february 1797 with rest of canal later that year canal was built with locks same size as those on nottingham canal to allow boats to use both branch to bingham authorised by first act was not built 18 locks raised level of canal by from trent to grantham eleven of them were located in first above trent after which there was a level pound of around before a flight of seven locks at woolsthorpe and a much shorter upper pound to grantham at canal passed through a deep cutting effectively crossing watershed between river witham and river trent which was only wide enough for a single boat but this situation was partially rectified in 1801 when cutting was widened in two places to allow boats travelling on opposite directions to cross at cropwell bishop and cropwell butler route passed through gypsum beds which resulted in problems with leakage operation canal made sufficient money to repay substantial debts in 1804 and 1805 after which dividends were paid to shareholders beginning at 2 per cent in 1806 rising to 5 per cent in 1815 and reaching their highest level of 8 6 per cent in 1839 tolls brought in an income which remained below ps9 000 until 1823 but then rose steadily to reach ps13 079 in 1841 traffic towards grantham included coal and coke lime groceries and building materials some of it supplied villages along line of canal and some of that which travelled full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond grantham downward traffic was largely agricultural produce including corn beans malt and wool such produce was normally loaded at grantham or harby initially some of coal carried on canal had been transported in boats owned by canal company but they had given up this practice in 1812 they resumed carrying coal in 1827 because they felt that coal stocks at grantham were not adequate but were accused of price fixing although penalty imposed by lincoln assizes was small they ceased this trade and coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2 660 tons at grantham in 1833 j rofe and his son made a proposal for a canal to connect grantham and sleaford but this was not pursued decline in common with most canals competition from railways posed a major threat and in 1845 canal owners agreed to sell it to ambergate nottingham boston and eastern junction railway when their line from ambergate to grantham was opened although railway was completed in 1850 railway company did not honour agreement canal company brought a large number of cases against railway company and successfully opposed several bills which railway were trying to get passed in parliament eventually railway company agreed to pay and shareholders received ps45 per share in cash with balance being in railway mortgages agreement was reached on 1 june 1854 and transfer of ownership took place on 20 december railway mergers meant that canal came under control of great northern railway in 1861 and later london and north eastern railway traffic declined as railway companies neglected canal and were down to 18 802 tons in 1905 on which tolls amounted to ps242 and an act of parliament was passed in 1936 formally closing canal though there had been no boat traffic since 1929 closure act stipulated that water levels should be maintained at to support agricultural needs this effectively guaranteed continued existence of canal channel but structures such as locks and bridges deteriorated and in 1950s 46 of 69 bridges over canal were lowered as part of road improvement schemes although low bridges act as barriers to navigation large parts of canal are still in water in 1948 britain s railways and hence canal were nationalised and became responsibility of british transport commission in 1963 control of canal passed to british waterways under terms of transport act 1968 all waterways within jurisdiction of british waterways were classified as commercial cruising or remainder waterways remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues grantham canal was listed in this latter category restoration thumb left dirty duck at woolsthorpe viewed through bridge 61 thumb left woolsthorpe bottom lock a plan to fill in a section of canal in nottingham resulted in a number of letters appearing in local press in 1963 and a student at kesteven college produced a report on state of canal which was presented to grantham civic society in 1970 british waterways board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining water levels of canal inland waterways association campaigned against bill and clause was amended grantham canal society was formed soon afterwards to promote restoration of waterway in 1974 a national boat rally was held at nottingham to gain support for restoration scheme and to promote idea of a new link to trent which would pass through old gravel workings together with british waterways inland waterways association and waterway recovery group society began work of restoration of canal to navigation a process which is still ongoing a major development was granting of permission in 1992 to remove an old railway embankment which blocked route near top of woolsthorpe flight of locks task was completed by a number of waterway recovery group new gates were fitted to top three locks and rebuilding of bridge was funded by lincolnshire county council opening up of canal for navigation further down canal restoration of a section between hickling basin and hose was funded by a derelict land grant of ps400 000 received in 1993 grantham canal partnership was formed in 1997 as a way to take project forwards it consisted of representatives from each of six local authorities through which route passes british waterways inland waterways association grantham canal restoration society and grantham navigation association a group which had split off from canal society in 1992 as a result of co operation british waterways formulated a draft business plan for canal following restoration of top three locks at woolsthorpe in 1990s a 10 mile 16 km section from a1 to redmile will be completed once bottom four locks of flight are restored rebuilding of locks 6 and 7 completed in 2000 brought number of locks restored to five and approximately one quarter of canal has been restored to navigable standard much improvement of towpath has also taken place and access to it is possible at most of bridges a major setback occurred in 2007 when one of walls of woolsthorpe top lock had to be propped to prevent it collapsing and british waterways took decision to fill it in as funding was not available to rebuild it inland waterways association received a legacy of ps100 000 from estate of fredrick woodman designated for grantham canal but british waterways ruled that no work could start until whole cost of ps175 000 had been found balance was made up by grants of ps40 000 from lincolnshire county council and ps35 000 from east midlands development agency wall was demolished and rebuilt in three sections utilizing of concrete and 7 500 new bricks thumb right a dry section of canal near cropwell bishop restoration of most of canal does not present major problems but challenges are presented by final sections at both ends original route to join trent has been severed by building of a52 road a route was identified which followed course of brook which passes under a52 to north of canal but by 2009 three possible solutions were under consideration these pose additional problems in finding funding since they do not count as restoration and many of traditional funding sources are not then available at grantham an embankment carrying a1 road blocks line of canal and terminal basin has been filled in there are plans for a tunnel under a1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to grantham and basin could be redeveloped in due course there is also a dry section between and which has presented problems since construction in 18th century gypsum in soil reacted with waterproof clay leading to leaking in early 2005 grantham canal partnership appointed a full time grantham canal restoration manager kevin mann for an initial 18 month trial period he would be responsible for planning and managing funding schemes for restoration identifying development opportunities and promotion and interpretation of canal trial proved to be successful as he was still doing job in 2009 canal and its banks between redmile and harby is designated a biological site of special scientific interest as grantham canal sssi points of interest belvoir tramway thumb left line of belvoir tramway duke of rutland also constructed a private or tramway between wharf at gorse and belvoir castle it was constructed in 1814 15 and remained operational for 100 years it was constructed with fish belly rail set
