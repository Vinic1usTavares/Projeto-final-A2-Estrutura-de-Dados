steven moffat described premise as traditional doctor who thing of taking something omnipresent in your life and making it sinister if something did get in wi fi we d be kind of screwed nobody had really done it before so i thought it s time to get kids frightened of wi fi however he denied that his intention was to give a warning about technology but rather tell an adventure story about a new way for aliens to invade based on something viewers were familiar with producer marus wilson suggested that episode be an urban thriller as story would already be set in contemporary london to introduce clara and wi fi monsters moffat compared style to james bond and bourne identity moffat said that episode was an action roller coaster rather than a story intended to be scary despite being announced as actress to portray new companion jenna louise coleman had first appeared as two different characters called and clara respectively in asylum of daleks and snowmen but bells of saint john introduces character who will be doctor s travelling companion coleman played each version of character as a different individual with trust that there would be a payoff to her mystery moffat

a half out of five stars he was positive towards visual style and plot as well as performances of smith coleman and celia imrie a radio times reviewer was pleased that coleman was playing clara as a straightforward companion and highlighted her chemistry with smith he described it as a hugely enjoyable episode that revels in its modern london setting praising way its ideas were realised visually on screen msn s hilary wardle gave bells of saint john episode four out of five stars noting that it moved at a fast pace and plot was similar to idiot s lantern 2006 but was very well done she especially praised chemistry between smith and coleman ben lawrence writing in daily telegraph gave episode four out of five stars saying that it had much to enthral a present day viewer and showed how doctor who was constantly reinventing itself a similar statement was made by euan ferguson of observer who also wrote that episode was splendid with good villains though he felt that plot was insanely complicated and hard to understand digital spy s morgan jeffery also rated bells of saint john four stars feeling that threat leaves a little to be desired and spoonheads physical appearance was not memorable however he said that practically everything else here is wonderful especially clara s new characterisation ign reviewer mark snow rated episode 8 2 out of 10 he praised wi fi concept but was underwhelmed by spoonheads and felt that it was more low key than it was promoted a v club alasdair wilkins gave bells of saint john a grade of b explaining that plot suffered just as previous companion introductions had because threat was secondary to establishing clara he also wrote that episode struggles to make all its chosen genre elements compelling and was not positive towards menace of wi fi and questioned how realistic technology seen was despite this he said that it was still fun with good performances dan martin of guardian was disappointed writing that it makes a hearty meal of its iconic london locations but after tour de force that was snowmen it feels as though this handsome episode constantly just misses mark he found monsters and plot familiar to past episodes but noted that a generic opening episode had been common for show when it was introducing a new companion which was done successfully with clara neela debnath in independent echoed similar sentiments feeling that it did not live up to hype and reused several elements from previous episodes jon cooper of daily mirror wrote that bells of saint john had its moments but as a whole it didn t reach heights of previous episodes while he welcomed departure in tone he felt that set pieces were shoehorned in and also expressed concern that clara despite coleman s success was too similar to previous companion amy pond karen gillan in doctor who magazine graham white gave it a positive review describing it as zestful and exciting doctor who he complimented fact that action sequences are played at a fury and current anything s possible flourishes continue unabated he noted that there s something pointless but pleasing in having clara s charge artie reading summer falls a book written by amelia williams additionally he described spoonheads as a very effective threat albeit written as one of foot soldiers of doctor who world with only verbal facility to paraphrase back what s been said and stated that revelation of concave absence at back of skull is horrific however he complained that to him clara s guess that tardis was a snogging booth seemed like something a 13 year old boy would conjure not a 24 year old woman notes references external links category eleventh doctor episodes category fiction set in 1200s category fiction set in 2013 category 2013 british television episodes
