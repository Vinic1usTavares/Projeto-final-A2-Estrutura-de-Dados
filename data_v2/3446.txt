42nd street shuttle is a new york city subway shuttle train service that operates in manhattan shuttle is sometimes referred to as grand central times square shuttle since these are only two stations it serves shuttle runs at all times except late nights with trains running on three tracks underneath 42nd street between times square and grand central with two stations it is shortest regular service in system by number of stops running about in 90 seconds shuttle is used by over 100 000 passengers every day and by up to 10 200 passengers per hour during rush hours 42nd street shuttle was constructed and operated by interborough rapid transit company irt and is currently part of a division of new york city transit tracks that it uses opened in 1904 as part of first subway in city original subway line ran north from city hall on what is now irt lexington avenue line to 42nd street from where it turned west to run across 42nd street then at broadway line turned north to 145th street on what is now irt broadway seventh avenue line this operation continued until 1918 when construction on lexington avenue line north of 42nd street and on broadway seventh avenue line south of 42nd street was completed one trunk would run via new lexington avenue line down park avenue and other trunk would run via new seventh avenue line up broadway section in middle via 42nd street was converted into shuttle operation over years various attempts to convert or replace shuttle have failed a 1960s attempt to use automatic train operation on one of shuttle s trains ended in a fire in 1964 a major reconstruction of shuttle is set to take place between 2019 and 2022 reconstruction would allow trains to be lengthened while also expanding both shuttle stations capacity and would bring shuttle into compliance with americans with disabilities act of 1990 in order to distinguish it from other shuttles in system nyct rapid transit operations internally refers to it as 0 zero its route

irt first day of subway service in manhattan current shuttle line was part of first irt subway line which ran north to 145th street via broadway and south to city hall via park avenue and lafayette street 42nd street section of line connected broadway at times square on west to park avenue at grand central terminal on east at times square end of this segment line curved sharply to north under one times square swinging northeast under seventh avenue before shifting under broadway platforms at times square are located on this curve like rest of original subway line was built with a vertical clearance of and a total width of maximum grade of line is 1 0 percent between sixth avenue and broadway in 1910 platforms at two stations were extended in 1913 irt brooklyn rapid transit and city agreed to dual system of rapid transit to expand city s transportation as part of agreement existing irt subway would be split into two north south lines and a shuttle along 42nd street section of line south of 42nd street would be connected to a newly constructed line stretching from 41st street and park avenue to bronx running via lexington avenue while section of line north of 42nd street would be connected to a newly constructed line heading south under seventh avenue section along 42nd street was left as a shuttle to connect new east side and west side lines new lexington avenue route curved off of old line at 41st street and ran underneath private property to reach lexington avenue at 43rd street with a new grand central station located in diagonal segment since there was 400 feet between eastern end of original line s station and new lexington avenue line station a new shuttle station was to be built near lexington avenue line station construction of narrow island platform station required building two new trackways extending east under 42nd street two track layout was expected to provide ample capacity for shuttle on august 1 1918 dual system s h system was put into service with through trains over irt lexington avenue line and irt broadway seventh avenue line and only shuttle trains under 42nd street station was not ready in time and therefore wooden flooring was temporarily laid over sections of trackways at times square and grand central shuttle was heavily used and crowding conditions were so bad that shuttle was ordered closed next day by public service commission thumb left alt1 a view of platform for track 3 at times square facing east view of wooden platform at times square over track 2 in 1947 new unused trackways of planned station were covered with flooring and turned into a passageway between shuttle and lexington avenue stations shuttle reopened on september 28 1918 with improved passageways and platforms track 2 at grand central station was covered over by a wooden platform a new york times columnist later said that former southbound express track 2 was still usable for first few hours of shuttle s operation but wooden platform was placed over that track later same day to allow shuttles to use former northbound express track 3 due to high demand for shuttles on former local tracks numbered 1 and 4 on walls of stations black bands at times square and green bands at grand central were painted to guide passengers to shuttle platforms shuttle was meant to be temporary and by 1922 there were proposals for shuttle to be replaced by a moving sidewalk on march 14 1927 extension of irt flushing line from fifth avenue to times square under 41st street was completed and opened for operation extension was expected to significantly reduce overcrowding on shuttle and on its first night of operation it reduced shuttle ridership by 50 crowding was expected to be reduced further as riders became familiar with extension in 1921 of 100 000 daily shuttle riders 25 000 transferred to flushing line then called queensboro subway originally plans for flushing line called for use of two of four tracks between times square and grand central for new line and other two for shuttle service proposed improvements throughout history of shuttle there have been proposals to improve service on line and to extend line both to east and to west however it is not feasible to extend line in either direction as line is at same level as tracks of broadway seventh avenue line and those of lexington avenue line there have been several proposals to replace line with moving walkways or conveyor belts in 1923 h s putnam proposed to replace shuttle with an endless moving platform system there would have been three platforms with speeds of and fastest platform was to have been installed with seats even though plan was supported by chief engineer of new york city rapid transit commission it was not adopted in 1930 charles e smith vice president of new york new haven and hartford railroad proposed allowing trains from broadway seventh avenue and lexington avenue lines to use shuttle tracks for through service as well as discontinuing shuttle service this also was not carried out on february 12 1946 work began to double width of passageway connecting shuttle platforms at grand central and main mezzanine over lexington avenue line platforms as part of work wooden passenger walkway which had an average width of was replaced by a wide passageway with concrete flooring this walkway had been temporary when it was put into place in august 1918 new long passageway covered most of trackways used by downtown trains of original subway prior to 1918 iron railings along planked walkway were removed project cost 45 800 and was intended to ease congestion as part of project upper passageway was moved to within fare control to allow passengers to go between subway mezzanine and entrance to grand central terminal at shuttle without paying a fare this was accomplished by moving turnstiles at eastern end of passageway in march members of metallic union local 46 sought to halt construction on project which was 80 percent complete as union objected to having work done by city employees who made less than union workers rebuilt passageway opened on march 18 1946 on june 21 1949 william reid chairman of new york city board of transportation announced that his capital budget request for 1950 would include 3 500 000 to improve shuttle for first time since it was created as part of project double platforms would have been constructed at both ends of shuttle abandoned track 2 would have been removed and switches would have been installed on track 3 to allow trains to pull into either platform on either track 1 or track 3 in addition shuttle would have been extended to east to shorten transfers to lexington avenue line chairman reid also stated that he would look for ways to improve service for riders before any funding arrived noting that a way was needed to get riders to proper platform before car doors closed while there were lights giving number of platform for next train they did not give passengers enough time to get to train before their doors closed on october 28 1953 transport workers union twu asserted that it was impossible for its members to follow schedule of shuttle which called for a train every two minutes during rush hours its president michael quill said that if new york city transit authority took action against train crews skipping scheduled runs there would be unrest among twu s members between 1948 and 1951 stephens adamson manufacturing company and goodyear tire and rubber company proposed that shuttle be replaced by a pedestrian conveyor system called carveyor carveyor would have consisted of a set of cars running on conveyor belts they would have run slowly at speeds of in stations and would have run more quickly at speeds of between stations 12 cars would move along conveyor belt and each car would have held 12 seated and 5 standing passengers system was expected to travel between grand central and times square in 1 minute 15 seconds and was expected to move 18 000 passengers per hour as opposed to 12 000 that could be accommodated by existing shuttle this proposal was formally presented to board of transportation in march 1951 even though new york city transit authority nycta and board of estimate approved plan it was not completed due to union opposition and high cost on april 21 1953 board of transportation chairman sidney h bingham announced that installation of conveyor belt would cost 3 800 000 and could be completed in 18 months after funding was budgeted for project he hoped that city and federal government would each foot 25 of bill with remaining 50 to come from state funding for project was included in 1953 and 1954 capital budgets on october 19 1954 single bid for project was submitted by passenger belt conveyors which was a subsidiary formed previous month by stephens adamson corporation and goodyear tire project was expected to be completed in 550 days cost of project was expected to increase to 5 500 000 to pay for additional structural changes needed for new system on november 4 1954 3 881 000 contract for a modified version of plan was awarded new york times lauded plan stating that times square grand central subway shuttle was an atrocity from beginning and has had no substantial improvement in a third of a century bids on structure to accommodate conveyor belt which was expected to cost 1 100 000 were to be received on december 10 1954 contract required approval of new york city board of estimate but never received it in may 1955 it was announced that project was tabled for discussion for august 25 of that year at request of city controller lawrence gerosa who considered plan to be dangerous he hoped to convince board of estimate to scrap project on september 15 1955 chairman of new york city transit authority which had taken over operations of board of transportation in june 1953 said that allocation of funds for project was questionable on october 20 1955 nycta told board of estimate that it was rescinding its request for 4 991 000 to build conveyor belt plan was canceled due to its high cost in 1954 nycta created a design concept to reconfiguring shuttle onto a tangent alignment under 42nd street this design was never executed because of significant impact it would have had on utilities and street above and because it would have required a full shutdown of station on august 16 1954 a project to replace 1 000 incandescent bulbs with of new fluorescent lighting at grand central platform was completed new lighting fixtures replaced green and red lines of light bulbs that had indicated way to and from shuttle respectively and lit up signs directing riders to shuttle with additional fixtures to direct riders from shuttle to be installed in two weeks in addition to replacing platform lighting lighting was replaced to mezzanine this project which cost 440 000 was beginning of a program to improve lighting at old stations across irt system 1960s automation test testing and operation alt1 a view of platform between tracks 3 and 4 at grand central in 1962 opening of automated train on track 4 in 1962 thumb as part of a demonstration for automation track 4 was briefly automated from 1962 to 1964 it was first automated service in new york city subway system on january 26 1959 chairman of new york city transit authority nycta charles patterson announced that nycta was exploring converting shuttle to pilot automatic operation if pilot were successful rest of system could be converted to automatic operation in phases automatic system would make use of existing tracks platforms and rolling stock with minor modifications project would cost 1 000 000 and patterson said that automating shuttle would save 150 000 annually by reducing 25 train operators and conductors if whole system were automated 90 of 3 100 train operators and 75 of conductors and platform conductors could be eliminated starting in december 1959 fully automatic train consisting of three cars was tested on of one of bmt sea beach line express tracks e4 between 18th avenue and new utrecht avenue stations train was equipped with a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at two shuttle terminals at each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers relays controlled train s starting acceleration braking and stopping as well as opening and closing of car doors relays were operated by electrical impulses initiated by a punched tape at full speed train ran at slowing to when coming into two stations when entering stations train passed through a series of detectors which caused a series of tripper arms at trackside to go into open position if train was going at speed if train was going too quickly tripper arms would stay upright and train s brakes would automatically be set equipment was built and installed by general railway signal company and union switch and signal division of westinghouse air brake company after several years of research and development nycta contributed between 20 000 to 30 000 on project while bulk of it between 250 000 and 300 000 was contributed by two companies automation of shuttle was opposed by president of transport workers union michael j quill who pledged to fight project and called device insane a june 1961 report from new york city transit authority nycta mentioned automatic train was planned to be placed into service that november on february 29 1960 nycta began to test a new tie less roadbed on track 1 which had been installed since previous thursday experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters in addition to lessening effect of moisture and erosion it was planned that if test succeeded rest of tracks in subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner set up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as roadbed between them flat bottomed steel troughs were installed cushioned by rubber inside troughs there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase rail bottom rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete third rail was also mounted on concrete this differed from normal roadbeds which consisted of stone with wooden ties set into it ties under damp conditions would rot and spikes would become loose resulting in bumpy rides this test replicated similar roadbeds in toronto s subway system in order to construct new roadbed track 1 had to be closed from may 6 to june 5 1961 track 4 was closed for installation of same roadbed as was tested on track 1 in afternoon of january 4 1962 three car automated train began service with a ceremony trains carried a stand by motorman during six month trial period train had scheduled to begin service on december 15 1961 but quill threatened to strike all city and private owned transit in city if train ran under new contract with twu nycta agreed to put a motorman in train during experimental period while in its experimental period automated train was only operating during rush hours in july test was extended for three more months and in october test was extended for six additional months chairman of nycta charles patterson was disappointed by automated shuttle train doubting that train could be operated without any transit personnel on board initially automation of shuttle was expected to save 150 000 a year in labor costs however with one employee still required on train there would essentially be no savings tape recorded messages warned passengers that doors of train were closing if test succeeded it was planned to automate irt flushing line franklin avenue shuttle myrtle avenue elevated bmt canarsie line and culver shuttle however nycta did not have plans to automate whole system demise on april 16 1964 an automated train derailed on northernmost track east of times square during morning rush hour causing a short circuit and thus suspending service on all three tracks a severe fire at grand central station on april 21 1964 destroyed demonstration train and resulted in subsequent restoration of manual operations fire began under a shuttle train on track 3 and it became larger feeding on wooden platform train on track 1 was saved when motorman saw smoke and reversed train basements of nearby buildings were damaged tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on april 23 1964 while track 3 returned to service on june 1 1964 reinstallation of track 3 was delayed because of need to replace 60 beams that were damaged in fire initially a decision was not made concerning whether or not automated shuttle train should be reintroduced from september 19 1966 to april 1967 service on shuttle was limited in order to allow for reconstruction of parts of line entire project cost 419 000 and included construction of a new mezzanine at grand central and replacement of wooden platform at times square with a new concrete one of as part of project tiles damaged by smoke from fire were replaced with tiles in city s colors of blue white and orange with black tiles interspersed in addition fluorescent lighting which was 12 times brighter than old lighting was installed 1980s 2000s in 1978 united states department of transportation undertook a study to analyze and determine feasibility of installing an accelerating walkway system in an urban environment study used 42nd street shuttle as a case study two options study analyzed were a one directional reversible linear walkway and a bi directional loop study found that walkways would provide a better level of service during off peak hours and a similar level of service during peak hours it was estimated that it would cost between 5 4 and 13 million to install system thumb alt a r62a subway car in shuttle service at times square a r62a consist one car pictured in service on 42nd street

projects from its capital program including 23 million allocated for reconfiguration of shuttle shuttle would have been rebuilt with two tracks and platforms at times square would have been moved closer to other subway lines work was to begin in 1991 but was deferred so it could be done in conjunction with other rehabilitation work at times square which was delayed shuttle ran at all times until september 10 1995 when night service was discontinued in order to avoid raising fares meaning that late night passengers had to use train new york city transit had been expecting a 160 million surplus in 1995 but due to reductions in state and federal contributions it was left with a deficit expected to reach 172 million elimination of late night service was part of a larger plan to reduce spending in order to avert a fare increase which governor george pataki and mayor rudy giuliani had pressured mta to avoid eliminating night service on shuttle was done to avoid need to reduce service on corridors without alternate service shuttle service had been running every ten minutes overnight and was used by 275 passengers per hour on february 28 2005 a shuttle train crashed into bumper block of track 3 at grand central injuring train operator and hospitalizing two passengers crash caused 100 000 in damage to 4 car train new york state public transportation safety board s investigation into collision concluded that most likely cause of accident was train operator falling asleep while operating train which led to his overrunning stop sign and colliding into bumper block planned capital reconstruction planning in 1998 mta officials announced that times square station would be renovated and that entire complex would become compliant with americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada project was to be split into two phases each lasting four years renovation of 42nd street shuttle platforms would occur during second phase of renovations however curved platforms at times square made it very difficult to convert to ada standards and shuttle platform renovation project was delayed although planning was completed in 2006 project was delayed due to a lack of funding in 2014 and 2015 mta commissioned wsp to undertake and feasibility studies to increase capacity on shuttle and to make it ada accessible in 2014 and 2015 nyct called for a plan that would include a wider center platform to fit accommodate two six car trains to east of existing station wsp developed a plan that allowed shuttle to be reconstructed without any need to excavate along 42nd street initial study to 1 only called for elimination of 36 columns along platform edges to align with train doors and for elimination of 20 columns in concourse area this plan would have kept remaining platform columns which are located every five feet nyct considered using platform screen doors to separate trains from platforms nyct then asked wsp to engage in a study to 3 to look into eliminating all platform edge columns while keeping station open with minimal impacts funding and approval left thumb times square station starting a renovation project platform is covered by blue construction walls initially 1 million in funding for a study to develop requirements for a second program to automate shuttle was included in 2015 2019 mta capital program however this study was removed from program in july 2017 amendment to capital program funding for renovation of times square shuttle platforms and reconfiguration of shuttle was provided as part of 2015 2019 mta capital program improving access to times square will cost 28 93 million while reconfiguration project will cost 235 41 million contract for construction of project was originally scheduled to be awarded in june 2018 however this was delayed by several months because of changes to project schedule and cost construction duration was expected to be extended by three months and cost would increase by 25 million because of additions to original construction plan a construction contract was awarded on march 7 2019 with an estimated completion date of march 2022 project is expected to take three years to complete on august 2 2019 mta announced that work on project would begin on august 16 work on project will be completed in multiple phases with only minor reductions in service as part of first phase of work track 1 would be taken out of service for two weeks until august 30 components as part of project 42nd street shuttle would become ada accessible and shuttle would be reconfigured from three to two tracks with center track track 3 to be removed as part of project train reliability will be improved with installation of a new signal system replacing existing system which dates back to 1930s shuttle would be able to run six car trains compared to two three car trains used for tracks 1 and 4 and one four car train currently in use on track 3 increasing capacity by 20 times square and grand central stations will be reconfigured with wide island platforms and access improvements will be completed at times square certain features of times square station would be repaired and restored and to increase capacity 122 five foot spaced columns between trackways and 11 mezzanine columns will be removed these would be replaced by 45 new fifteen foot spaced columns that are at least two feet away from platform edges
