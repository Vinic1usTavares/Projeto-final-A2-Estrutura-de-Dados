lagleyze p 11 a british army invaded buenos aires in 1806 starting british invasions of rio de la plata winaski p 11 although moreno was not actively involved with military counter offensive which drove them out he opposed british presence in buenos aires he wrote a diary that noted all events so that in future his countrymen would know circumstances that allowed such an invasion luna pp 47 49

winaski pp 12 13 first political activities thumb representation of landowners economic paper written by mariano moreno although mariano moreno was a criollo a spanish citizen born in americas he did not work with other criollos of buenos aires who sought to promote political changes against privileges of spanish born unlike criollo politicians manuel belgrano and juan jose castelli he did not support viceroy liniers or carlotist project which sought coronation of carlota of spain in americas he joined mayor martin de alzaga instead which allowed him to serve as a legal adviser of cabildo in that capacity he wrote a petition to king of spain so that buenos aires cabildo was named protector of cabildos of viceroyalty of rio de la plata as a result all petitions from local cabildos to king or viceroy would be channeled through cabildo at capital martin de alzaga organized a mutiny on january 1 1809 and moreno joined it alzaga aspired to replace viceroy santiago de liniers with a government junta after learning of capture of spanish king ferdinand vii during peninsular war and creation of junta of seville if it prevailed mariano moreno would have been part of new junta mutiny was defeated by swift reaction of cornelio saavedra in command of regiment of patricians who dispersed crowd and persuaded liniers not to abdicate it is disputed by historians whenever mutiny had similar or opposite goals to those of may revolution that would take place a year later historians who support latter perspective try to make attempts to excuse or justify moreno s involvement scenna p 12 those who support former consider instead that moreno was a revolutionary a year before most other argentines scenna p 15 moreno was alzaga s lawyer in trial that followed which was labeled a trial for independentism liniers did not extend trial to moreno himself for reasons unknown scenna p 23 liniers was succeeded by baltasar hidalgo de cisneros a few months later who pardoned mutineers to reduce political conflicts cisneros allowed free trade as well as instructed by junta of seville which benefited british merchants britain was allied with spain in peninsular war agents of consulate of cadiz asserted that this would hurt local economy moral values social usages religious practices and loyalty to spain and its monarchy as a result cisneros closed trade again restoring spanish monopsony a group of hacendados owners of who did not feel adequately represented at cabildo asked moreno to defend them moreno wrote representation of landowners a report that represented export interest of landowners encouraged free trade and condemned privileges of merchants benefited from monopsony it is considered most comprehensive economic report from time of viceroyalty it represented new european economic ideas and noted that legal monopsony with spain did not prevent british goods from being smuggled several authors have questioned moreno s authorship of paper considering it instead an update of another previously drafted by manuel belgrano secretary of commerce consulate of buenos aires written to make a similar request to former viceroy liniers scenna p 30 this report as well as moreno s prestige in colonial society helped him gain confidence of cisneros yet secretly moreno supported plan to dismiss viceroy primera junta thumb 250px mariano moreno left as a member of primera junta mariano moreno had several contacts with groups seeking removal of cisneros but was not strongly involved with may revolution which considered fall of junta of seville a reason to depose viceroy and create a local junta at time moreno was still loyal to alzaga he attended may 22 open cabildo but according to father of vicente fidel lopez and father in law of bartolome mitre both direct witness he stayed silent at one side and did not join debate scenna pp 33 34 he voted for saavedra s proposal to remove viceroy cisneros and replace him with a junta manuel hermenegildo aguirre captain of hussars proposed that cabildo take reins of government with five men appointed as counselors moreno among them however nobody else voted for that proposal and it was only one that included him pp 22 23 moreno felt betrayed when cabildo twisted results of open cabildo and created a junta that would be headed by cisneros he refused any further contacts with revolutionaries and stayed home during remaining events definitive members of junta came from a popular petition signed on may 25 which was given to cabildo reasons for moreno s inclusion in list are unclear as with all other members of junta a commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between carlotists and alzaguists scenna pp 46 47 junta faced strong opposition from beginning it was resisted locally by cabildo and royal audiencia still loyal to absolutist factions nearby plazas of montevideo and paraguay did not recognize it and santiago de liniers organized a counter revolution at cordoba mariano moreno an unimportant politician up to that point became leader of most radical supporters of junta he was supported by popular leaders domingo french and antonio beruti dupuy donado and cardozo and priests like grela and aparicio galasso p 9 historian carlos ibarguren described that morenist youths roamed streets preaching new ideas to each pedestrian they found turned marcos coffee shop into a political hall and proposed that all social classes should be illustrated carlos ibarguren p 18 manuel belgrano and juan jose castelli supported moreno within junta and french was promoted to colonel of regiment america this regiment also known as star because of a star that they wore on their sleeves was composed of radical youths led by french during riots of may revolution galasso pp 10 11 moreno established official newspaper gazeta de buenos ayres through a june 2 decree and managed its contents first newspapers were available to public five days later he issued a freedom of press decree which allowed press to publish anything that did not offend public morals or attack revolution or government moreno published some works of gaspar de jovellanos and his translation of jean jacques rousseau s social contract in this later work he skipped chapter about religion suggesting that author has raved in religious matters mariano moreno prologue to social contract translation galasso p 65 this was done to prevent religious disputes among patriots galasso p 65 this publication was criticized by conservatives such as tomas de anchorena who said that it could generate popular unrest i don t know if someone had read any work of modern politics neither that there was other than rousseau s social contract translated to spanish by famous mariano moreno whose work can only serve to disband populations turn them into great mobs of angry madmen and villains tomas de anchorena carlos ibarguren p 16 as with junta itself moreno s writings maintained loyalty to ferdinand vii it is unclear to historians whether he was concealing pro independence ambitions or was truly loyal to deposed king however he made specific references to independentism as early as november 1810 galasso p 100 in reference to courts of cadiz that would write a constitution he said that congress may establish an absolute disposal of our beloved ferdinand galasso p 103 meaning that right of self determination would allow even that he did not think monarchical authority to be absolute but subject to popular sovereignty so that a monarch may lose his authority if he worked against common good of people imprudent man ferdinand vii what do you discover in your person that makes you superior to us which would be your empire if we hadn t give it to you have we released our powers on you so that you can use them for our misfortune you had duty to create by yourself our happiness that was sole price for which we placed crown over your head you allowed it to be stolen by an act of inexperience capable of generating doubts about whenever you were excluded from number of men that nature seems to have shaped to lead others lowered to prisons and incapable of filling your duties we took distasteful work of doing by ourselves what should have been done by those who call themselves our kings if you oppose our good you do not deserve to reign over us and if you want to manifest yourself creditor to high dignity we have conferred you should be congratulated of leading a free nation moreno galasso pp 105 106 he also considered that if ferdinand vii returned to throne he would not be able to challenge a constitution written in his absence can king oppose resolutions of congress such a doubt could be a crime king at his return would not be able to resist a constitution that even if he was leading courts he would have had to accept and if one day he achieve freedom for which we yearn a simple transmission would restore him to throne of his elders with variations and reforms that peoples would have enacted to prevent evil results of an arbitrary power moreno galasso p 106 however he wrote that as a hypothetical scenario to describe strength of a constitution not as a likely possibility galasso p 106 moreno issued several decrees during his first days in government he ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes and for those concealing conspiracies against junta or other people capture and punish with rigor anyone who by work or word attempts to generate divisions or discontents anyone who does not report any project or conspiracy against authority or security of individuals will be declared responsible before government decree of june 6 1810 galasso p 10 military bodies of pardos and morenos composed of indigenous peoples were reformed to have military ranks similar to those of spanish military bodies he did this by invoking rulings of catholic monarchs during early spanish colonization of americas junta could not see with indifference that naturals were incorporated to caste bodies excluded from spanish battalions where they belong for their class and specific declarations of your majesty from this day on there shall be no difference between spanish military and indian military both are equal and should have always been because since beginning of discovery of these americas catholic monarchs desired that their peoples should have same privileges as vassals of castilla speech of mariano moreno detailed at juan manuel beruti memoirs galasso p 10 actions against royalists thumb 250px execution of santiago de liniers although junta of seville was defeated a new one was created afterward regency council primera junta did not swear loyalty to it but royal audiencia did so in defiance of local authority junta summoned them along with former viceroy cisneros and exiled them to spain with pretext that there was a threat to their lives junta appointed new members for audiencia loyal to revolution galasso p 11 moreno wrote in gazeta that audiencia attacked good faith of government and that junta left their usual moderation for safety of people firmness of government where your trust rests has been strongly attacked and it was needed that junta violated its moderation so that people was not victim of a pusillanimous condescension mariano moreno gazeta de buenos ayres june 23 1810 galasso p 12 junta was rejected in montevideo as was exile of cisneros and former audiencia moreno reacted immediately replying to montevidean concerns he supported legitimacy of primera junta by criticizing regency council and stating that overseas spanish territories were equally capable of creating juntas as it was debated during open cabildo junta advises you to watch carefully principles that influenced its establishment main reason for it was doubt about legitimacy with which fugitive central junta despised by people insulted by its own subjects and with public charges of traitor appointed by itself a regency council without asking for vote of villages mariano moreno june 8 1810 federico ibarguren p 215 he also called for unity and support of metropolis let s redouble our efforts to help metropolis defend their cause watch their laws celebrate their triumphs cry their bad fortunes and do what provincial juntas did before establishment of central one mariano moreno june 8 1810 federico ibarguren p 216 and that both cities recognize ferdinand vii as their legitimate monarch both cities acknowledge a same monarch junta has sworn for ferdinand vii and will die keeping his august rights mariano moreno june 8 1810 federico ibarguren p 216 he argued that junta treated exiles initially with moderation but their obstinacy particularly on part of cisneros generated popular discontent obstinacy of magistrates and former viceroy don baltasar h de cisneros despite of solicitude and moderation with which junta has treated them have exited popular fury in such a way that it was imperative to remove them from city and deport them to canary islands until your majesty disposes of these people who by personal motives have almost caused loss of these kingdoms primera junta june 21 1810 federico ibarguren p 39 matias irigoyen told same thing to british lord strangford in rio de janeiro junta does not have at moment any further interest in independence a system that spanish america would only adopt as an alternative to escape from greatest of all evils to return to former state of things matias irigoyen federico ibarguren p 36 moreno organized two military expeditions to counter threat of plazas that resisted junta first expedition first one headed by francisco ortiz de ocampo would move to cordoba and attack counter revolution organized by former viceroy santiago de liniers they next went to upper peru ocampo s initial orders were to capture counter revolutionary leaders and send them to buenos aires so that they could be judged galasso p 18 when counter revolution became stronger moreno called junta and with support from castelli and paso proposed that enemy leaders should be shot as soon as they were captured instead of brought to trial junta orders to shoot don santiago de liniers don juan gutierrez de la bishop of cordoba don joaquin rodriguez colonel allende and royal officer don joaquin moreno at right moment in which they are captured under whatever circumstances this resolution will be executed mariano moreno july 28 1810 galasso p 18 junta accepted new proposal and delivered it to ocampo counter revolution was defeated following august but ocampo did not execute his prisoners gregorio funes head of patriotic party of cordoba persuaded him to spare them because prisoners were popular in cordoba and people would not support their deaths most of this city would be shrouded in mourning and they would assume that junta is dominated by force and not by love which is most secure base to strengthen new system of government ortiz de ocampo galasso p 19 besides liniers prisoners included governor of cordoba and bishop of city ocampo stuck to initial orders and delivered prisoners to city moreno did not accept it and told ocampo that a general should simply obey orders obedience is first virtue of a general and best lesson he may give to his army which must be demanded during a combat superior government gathers and concentrates relations that must not be communicated and soldiers must not know them in order to obey what is commanded to them mariano moreno galasso p 19 he called a new meeting of junta and produced a paper left at his home which said if liniers does not die let him live galasso p 19 note second part was written in capital letters in original junta agreed to fire ocampo and replace him with castelli go you castelli and i hope that you do not fail in same weakness than our general if determination was not yet done vocal larrea would go whom i think is not lacking resolution and finally i would go myself if needed mariano moreno chavez p 167 with nicolas rodriguez pena as secretary and domingo french leading escort they intercepted convoy at cabeza de tigre and executed them except for bishop orellana because of his religious endowment auxiliary army commanded by ocampo and castelli was renamed as army of north and launched first alto peru campaign moreno gave harsh new instructions for it namely monitor activities of rich kill goyeneche nieto paula sanz and bishop on sight and allow soldiers to pillage enemies at first patriot victory to generate terror galasso p 60 context was not favorable only cochabamba and charcas made a genuine support of revolution and some indigenous people hesitated in joining fearing consequences of a possible royalist counter attack galasso p 76 morenist projects for upper peru which included emancipation of indigenous peoples and nationalization of mines of potosi were resisted by local populations that were benefiting from system already in force galasso pp 77 p 274 castelli proposed to advance military campaign even closer to lima but moreno asked him to stay at his position galasso p 87 second expedition other military expedition moved to paraguay commanded by manuel belgrano following instructions from moreno he helped natives at missions in corrientes on his way to paraguay he gave them full civil and political rights granted lands authorized commerce with united provinces removed taxes for ten years abolished any type of torture and lifted restrictions on taking public or religious office galasso p 59 moreno promoted stronger measures against royalists in july he gave orders to neighboring mayors to prevent creation of secret groups or activities that could promote alienation take care against creation of suspicious groups nor proclamation of rumors that may promote alienation or distrust of government mariano moreno galasso p 50 he promoted a new decree of junta that called for trial and confiscation of goods for anyone that left city without authorization any individual that leaves city without government licence will have his goods confiscated without any other process needed than confirmation of his departure primera junta decree art 1 july 31 1810 galasso p 50 kept military weapons in secret any person found with royal weapons against orders of releasing them will be punished with any kind of punishment not excepting even capital one according to circumstances primera junta decree art 3 july 31 1810 galasso p 50 promoted popular alienation or discontent against government anyone who promotes rumors against europeans or patriots promoting division will be punished according to sedition laws primera junta decree art 4 july 31 1810 galasso p 50 or wrote letters to people in other cities for such a purpose anyone found corresponding with individuals from other places promoting divisions distrust or parties against current government will be shot without any other process than confirmation of fact primera junta decree art 5 july 31 1810 galasso p 50 serious cases were usually punished with execution or exile some rich people exiled by this decree were francisco olaguer norberto de y and pablo galasso p 51 manuel andres arroyo y pinedo another rich man blamed moreno for these actions accusing him of equaling disagreement with anti patriotism and felt that ideas of egalitarianism would only cause great evils moreno had cunning and ambition he was unruly by nature he invented spartan ostracism against spanish europeans and politically against americans as well which was most secure way to hallucinate peoples and have a party anyone who does not follow his ideas will be reputed as and it will be of public knowledge in his clubs but according to moreno we are all equals now maxim that being thus generalized has made so much evils and there will be further sufferings by this cursed disorder manuel andres arroyo y pinedo galasso p 51 those measures were also criticized by moderate supporters of revolution such as gregorio funes from cordoba who rejected lack of proper trials he moreno pointed most respectable heads to die without any type of process gregorio funes manifest about events of april 5 and 6 1811 carlos ibarguren p 31 or damaso uriburu from salta who compared moreno castelli and vieytes with french jacobins moreno castelli and vieytes inside government junta were representatives of doctrine of that political sect that intended as an example of its model regenerate political and social order of those countries through blood and crime damaso uriburu galasso p 51 by this time moreno thought that only way to secure revolution would be if it was successful throughout continent we must secure continental system of our glorious insurrection never before had south america a better chance to establish a republic mariano moreno escritos politicos y galasso pp 56 57 however he considered that latin american integration should be achieved peacefully among equals and not as result of a conquest campaign he wrote at gazeta that even as pure as our intentions may be it would be dangerous if freedom of america was just our own work such a circumstance could lead to a real despotism and peruvian peoples would not improve having porteno oppressors instead of european ones mariano moreno gazeta de buenos ayres november 22 1810 galasso p 58 he made positive comments about rebellions at cochabamba and chile operations plan thumb first page of operations plan following a proposal of manuel belgrano junta wrote a political platform setting broad goals and procedures to follow to achieve its objectives creation of this document whose name is often summarized simply as operations plan was trusted to mariano moreno there have been disputes about authenticity of this document some historians like paul groussac suspect that document was a literary forgery prepared by a spaniard at court of portugal to discredit junta groussac pp 103 143 supporters of truthfulness of document like norberto pineiro allege that content would be consistent with government actions taken by primera junta pineiro pp 33 103 document states need to defeat royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by jacobins during reign of terror of french revolution it rejected use of political moderation considering that it would be dangerous during revolutionary times moderation out of time is no sanity nor is a truth on contrary it is a weakness to adopt a system whose circumstances do not require never in any time of revolution was moderation or tolerance adopted by governors mere thought of a man who opposes new system is a crime because of influence and harm he may cause with his example and punishment is unavoidable moreno operations plan p 276 it compared south american revolution still in its early stages with french and north american my nation how many mutations you must suffer where are noble and great washington lessons of your politics where laborious rules of architecture of your great work your principles and your regime could be capable to guide us giving us your lights to fill goals we have proposed to ourselves moreno operations plan pp 273 274 ones and even revolution in spain itself pointing out that none of those relied solely upon conspiracies or secret meetings ref let s talk with frankness so far we have only seen speculation of conspiracies and as such when we try to approach practical matters we are deterred well no these are not lessons taught by masters of great revolutions fix your view over annals of histories of north of france etc and even spain itself and you shall see plots and political cunning aiming only to get by that way goals they had proposed themselves moreno operations plan pp 281 282 ref document proposes to favor patriots and fill state offices with them all true patriots whose conduct is satisfactory and had given notable proof of it if they made a crime which does not concern system they must receive consideration and kindness in a word during revolutionary times no crime shall be punished save for infidelity and rebellion moreno operations plan pp 283 284 peninsulars on other hand should be carefully monitored and punished at slightest proof of action against junta and executed if they were rich or influential with seconds n enemies of government at slightest of deeds words etc against cause they shall be punished with capital punishment specially when they convene with circumstances of being people of skill and some opinion but when they do not convene in such a man it may be possible to have consideration and moderate punishment but never having any trusting on them mariano moreno operations plan pp 284 285 for this end junta would need to create an espionage network government must keep some spies not of first or second skill level but of a known loyalty to cause secretly instructed to sneak into most dubious people talk with them and manifesting themselves in an opposing manner to real cause they defend to discover thus thoughts of our enemies or any plot they may try moreno operations plan p 285 this policy towards peninsulars is coherent with actions taken against liniers counter revolution and similar to one employed by simon bolivar in north shortly after moreno thought that jose gervasio artigas would be an invaluable ally and that buenos aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join fight against absolutism it would be advisable to draw two men by any interest or promise because of their knowledge which we know is great in countryside as for their skill opinion concept and respect as it is captain of dragoons don jose rondeau and captain of blandengues don jose artigas moreno operations plan pp 294 295 he noted internal conflicts in chile and paraguay and urged support of local patriots against local royalists on level of international relations mariano moreno rejected slavery in brazil a neighboring portuguese colony he proposed to distribute large numbers of gazeta de buenos ayres newspapers filled with libertarian ideas and translated into portuguese they must receive issues of gazetas from capital and montevideo as often as possible with speeches about rights of men happiness freedom equality and benevolence of new system insulting in turn old despots moreno operations plan p 325 those speeches and gazetas must be printed and delivered in portuguese moreno operations plan p 326 and provide military support to slaves if they should riot he considered risk of a complete spanish defeat in peninsular war or a restoration of absolutism great menaces and regarded britain as a potential ally against them we must not stop assisting them britain with as many interests as needed to persuade them to support our projects always considering proposals that may benefit as we know about that nation first to be most plotting for their supremacy in seas and second that all their relation are always directed by principle of expanding their merchant goals whose ambition never allowed to conceal and those principles must guide our enterprises for their success in that court moreno operations plan pp 320 321 during a conflict britain would be able to provide them with weapons and other goods not produced locally critics of moreno consider him an anglophile because of this proposal but same document also warns against risk of allowing britain too much influence in national economy he criticized relationship between britain and portugal considering that portugal was subject to a shameful slavery to britain as long as their alliance with her stands british portuguese alliance or better said shameful and ignominious slavery in which they had her moreno operations plan p 321 and that british influence in brazil was so high that portuguese colonies might eventually become british ones it is clearly seen that her purpose is to suck blood of their state extenuating it so much that perhaps their american colonies may become british someday moreno operations plan p 322 moreno held same ideas about being simultaneously friendly and cautious with britain in pages of gazeta newspaper in economic field document addressed lack of a bourgeoisie that could turn political changes into economic development and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism mariano moreno proposed that state invest 200 or 300 million in factories manufacturing arts agriculture navigation and other critical areas it shall be seen that a number of two or three hundred million pesos given to state to promote arts agriculture navigation etc will produce in few years a working educated and virtuous continent moreno operations plan p 314 there would be no risk of bankruptcy because state would manage businesses they may be in risk of bankruptcy which when managed by state itself are in little risk moreno operations plan p 314 with money generated state would then seek seeds and tools and ultimately allow continent to be economically initial money that state would need to become such an active economic force would come from mines in potosi where slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million moreno proposed simply to confiscate money and mines it shall be absolutely forbidden that any man works mines of gold or silver with duty of working it and managing its resources reserved for state for more or less ten years moreno operations plan p 315 he reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit i estimate that even if in those vast provinces we must aggravate at least five or six thousands as advantages are perceived by eighty or a hundred thousand people nor government should doubt nor lost anything in public perception when after achieving desired purposes we reward those aggravated with graces or privileges moreno operations plan p 314 state would not manage those areas indefinitely moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area and then state would just observe making sure that they followed laws enacted for common good of society early 19th century liberalism did not promote confiscation among their common proposals but an antecedent of this proposal was conspiracy of equals promoted by francois noel during french revolution galasso p 36 moreno thought that state sized fortunes managed by a few individuals were detrimental to civil society and those individuals would tend to manage economy for their own benefit without fixing problems of society at large document proposed to avoid exporting money and to include high tariffs on import of luxury goods this is often seen as a contradiction of representation of hacendados but each request different things representation opposed absolute prohibition of trade with britain which is not same than allowing it while following a protectionist policy galasso 39 41 as secretary moreno reduced tariffs on national exports but kept high ones for imports internal disputes thumb cornelio saavedra president of primera junta mariano moreno and cornelio saavedra had disagreements about events of may revolution and way to run government their disputes became public shortly after creation of junta saavedra was president and moreno was a secretary with support of other vocal members ignacio nunez describes how morenists felt that president was attempting to restore in his office authority of viceroys thus downgrading importance of other members of junta at public events while saavedrists considered that secretary was overstepping his authority and did not allow even appointment of a janitor that was not of his liking nunez p 174 however domingo matheu would clarify in his memoirs that their initial concerns with saavedra were based more on his desire for honors and privileges than for a real power struggle galasso pp 12 13 nunez described how moreno was resisted by some criollos who initially supported revolution without being aware of long term consequences he was resisted by criollos alarmed by his straightforward way of talking about concepts like self determination tyranny slavery and freedom theologians resented that moreno cited authors like rousseau voltaire or montesquieu rather than christian philosophers like saint augustine or saint thomas he was also resisted by conservative lawyers and by most of military nunez p 177 by october moreno s measures started to generate resistance among some who initially supported may revolution traders did not like protectionist policy and some members of military had close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment galasso pp 66 67 on october 16 it was discovered that ten members of cabildo had sworn loyalty to regency council past july and they were all jailed this included julian leiva and juan jose de lezica galasso p 67 moreno and saavedra had a dispute when junta was deciding what to do moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent accusing them of working with montevideo cabildo enemy of junta it s needed to condemn leiva and his henchmen as example to enemies of country and our system do you saavedra forget that leiva is with montevideo cabildo and surely with regency council to plot this reactionary coup moreno discussing with saavedra cronica historica argentina p 198 saavedra replied that government should promote leniency and rejected use of patricians regiment to carry out such executions proposal exceeds sentiments of leniency that government should promote if it s insisted to give death penalty i deny right now involvement of my troops to apply it moreno discussing with saavedra cronica historica argentina p 198 prisoners were finally exiled to lujan ranchos and salto and leiva was housed by gregorio funes in cordoba cronica historica argentina p 198 by this point only military support for moreno was domingo french head of star regiment castelli and belgrano supported him but were far away from capital on their respective military campaigns activists of may revolution supported him as well as did other members of junta and other patriots like vieytes and nicolas rodriguez pena saavedra kept strong support of regiment of patricians and added that of merchants and even some supporters of former regime who deemed moderated saavedra a lesser evil galasso p 69 moreno sought to modify military balance of power by reforming promotion rules up until that point sons of officials were automatically granted status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead son of a colonel has worn cords since crib and a soldier of seventy years old would lift a kid that he could never equal in honours and wages this kid could be badly raised without habits without talents but he would eventually become general because with a long life he would count many years and those would prepare a seniority that would open door to promotions junta will follow an entirely different conduct it is convinced that it cannot be a good official who has never been a good soldier and will never allow scars of a brave to be dressed with tatters while sad relics of a rotten soldier are concealed with primera junta decree september 19 1810 galasso p 70 however in short run this measure worked against him as it antagonized members of military who got promoted precisely because of such rules galasso p 70 he also thought that support from lower classes was instrumental to success of revolution not only peoples of villages have displayed a patriotism that doesn t stop in personal sacrifices but also inhabitants of our countrysides with pure and simple offerings as their hearths display most respectful kindness and acknowledgement when they talk about junta from here springs abundance of resources that multiply a thousands ways to fill our urgent tasks this explains fast marches of our troops which in a single week cross spaces that former viceroys could not defeat in a month and a half peoples from countryside give their cattle without interest give soldiers their own personal horses and save nothing to little fortunes of their sons when it is requested for nation and government mariano moreno gazeta de buenos ayres september 15 1810 galasso p 71 and wrote letters to chiclana instructing him to generate such support at upper peru don t neglect levy of creoles and make them take a personal interest in this work let no one rule save for sons of country let them know advantages mariano moreno mail to chiclana justo p 160 such popular involvement would take time to consolidate guerra war of and rise of jose gervasio artigas took place later not as of 1810 galasso p 72 saavedra increased his resistance to moreno s proposals after victory at battle of considering that revolution had defeated its enemies and should relax its severity in consequence as all things have changed their circumstances by reunion of provinces of viceroyalty thus it s also need to change resolutions this is lower rigors adopted so far cornelio saavedra cronica historica argentina p 226 regiment of patricians hosted a banquet celebration at barracks restricting attendance to military and supporters of saavedra moreno was not allowed to pass by guards at door which generated a small incident nunez p 175 that same night officer atanasio duarte who was drunk gave a crown of sugar to saavedra s wife and saluted saavedra as if he was new king or emperor of americas nunez p 176 next day when moreno heard about incident he wrote honours suppression decree which suppressed ceremony usually reserved for president of junta and inherited privileges of office of viceroy duarte was exiled and moreno s act was justified by stating that an inhabitant of buenos aires neither drunk nor asleep should be expressed against freedom of his country primera junta decree december 6 1810 galasso p 90 saavedra signed decree without complaint but gregorio funes felt that patricians resented moreno because of this body of patricians took this as a personal offense and was near a break of relations this commotion has placated but i believe it grows in secret saavedra is very cautious and will contain everything i have been told that he questioned himself officer of gregorio funes mail to his brother december 10 1810 galasso p 90 thumb left gregorio funes from cordoba joined saavedra against moreno conflicts between moreno and saavedra generated international reactions lord strangford complained about later actions of junta such as execution of liniers which were seen as more violent than initial ones last procedures of junta in respect of liniers and his companions are in little with spirit of moderation that enacted your first measures and have given to those who had a good mood towards you reasons to be against lord strangford mail to mariano moreno november 17 1810 galasso p 91 brazil was also concerned because many copies of gazeta were being distributed in rio grande do sul influencing their slaves with libertarian ideas galasso p 92 moreno is robespierre of day and other are null for good and fiery tools of all of them pretend to establish a republic among their favourite projects is one to extend revolution to brazil carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 475 brazilian government sent carlos jose guezzi to buenos aires with purpose of mediating in conflict with royalists at montevideo and to ratify aspirations of carlota joaquina to rule as regent he met saavedra in his first interview in july and got a positive impression of him saavedra said that if carlota s rights were confirmed by spanish monarchy buenos aires would support her even if it meant they had to stand against other provinces saavedra said then that there was no room for doubt and even if whole nation had another opinion peoples of buenos aires and junta would have been first ones to offer their weapons for conservation of her rights carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 469 following month he requested a representative for court of brazil offered carlota s mediation with montevideo recognize eventual rights of princess or allow mediation of brazil to solve differences in viceroyalty carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 469 and pointed out that brazil had forces near frontier awaiting orders to attack revolution divisions of provinces and differences of opinion worry court of brazil who has all forces ready to extinguish or contain any revolutionary movement that may manifest at la plata basin carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 470 this time moreno resisted moreno rejected sending a representative junta does not consider convenient to send a representative to court of brazil she must be declared satisfied with token of confidence given when they received mails from marquis of irujo house destined to viceroy cisneros mariano moreno carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 471 and told him that junta did not work for interests of brazil but for those of united provinces junta does not work for interests of brazil but for those of viceroyalty of rio de la plata mariano moreno carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 471 he rejected mediation as well considering that no mediation was possible under a military threat court of brazil may want to employ force and by that way mediation is inadmissible mariano moreno carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 471 guezzi was immediately sent back to rio de janeiro on first available ship excellency provisional government junta of united provinces of rio de la plata has decidedly resolved that you guezzi in first ship that sails to rio de janeiro return to that destiny for this purpose at this same date there s an order for captain of port to see for commitment of this rule and report so for intelligence carlos guezzi memoirs pueyrredon p 472 he described moreno as robespierre of day and accused junta of attempting to build a republic in december deputies of other provinces convened by circular of may 27 arrived in buenos aires most of them were closer to ideas of saavedra and gregorio funes became highly influential over them they did not agree about which body they should join deputies wanted to join junta while moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly funes allied with saavedra calculated that they could stop moreno by joining junta as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority junta with both its original members and deputies discussed topic on december 18 funes said that buenos aires had no right to rule other provinces without their consent and got support of other members galasso p 112 he said that there was popular discontent with junta supporters of moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels and moreno said that it was only discontent of patricians in respect of decree however only paso voted with him and deputies joined junta moreno resigned but his resignation was rejected his opposition to incorporation of deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in conflict between buenos aires and other provinces which dominated politics in argentina during following decades some call it a precursor of unitarian party while others find his words or actions more consistent with federalist party however historians paul groussac and norberto pineiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into future pineiro considered it an error to label moreno as federal or unitary proving that this organization been prioritized over secondary aspect of centralism or federalism while groussac similarly notes that moreno devoted all his energies to immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long term scenarios political decline and death thumb death of mariano moreno hipolito vieytes was about to make a diplomatic mission to britain but moreno requested that he should be given appointment instead saavedra accepted immediately he traveled to britain with his brother manuel moreno and his secretary tomas guido on british schooner fame his health declined and there was no doctor on board but captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in rio de janeiro brazil or cape town south africa captain gave him an emetic in common use at that time prepared with four grams of antimony potassium tartrate moreno had great convulsions as a consequence and considered that in his state he could not have resisted more than quarter of a gram he died shortly afterward scenna p 97 98 his body was wrapped in a union jack and thrown into sea after a volley of musketry manuel moreno speculated later that he was poisoned by captain manuel moreno was unsure of whether captain really gave him that substance or if he substituted something else or gave an even higher dose circumstances did not allow an autopsy to be performed further points used to sustain idea of a murder are captain s refusal to land elsewhere his slow sailing his administration of emetic in secrecy and that he didn t return to buenos aires with ship scenna pp 98 99 enrique de gandia pointed to an irregular ruling of junta that appointed a british person named curtis as moreno s replacement for diplomatic mission in case of moreno s death son of mariano moreno commented to historian adolfo saldias that his mother guadalupe cuenca received an anonymous gift of a mourning hand fan and handkerchief with instructions to use them soon by that time murder of moreno was a common assumption and it was mentioned during trial of residence of members of junta juan madera stated at trial that moreno may have requested to go to britain because he was afraid of being murdered and that he may have stated this during meeting when junta discussed his resignation scenna pp 99 100 modern author manuel luis martin studied health of both moreno and his family and concluded that he died of natural causes national p 348 legacy despite death of mariano moreno his supporters were still an influential party in buenos aires morenists accused saavedra and funes of plotting to allow coronation of carlota and organized a rebellion with star regiment however saavedrists became aware of it and organized another rebellion on may 5 and 6 1811 this rebellion requested strong changes in government removal of morenists nicolas rodriguez pena hipolito vieytes miguel azcuenaga and juan larrea from junta exile of domingo french antonio beruti agustin donado gervasio posadas and ramon vieytes and return and trial of manuel belgrano thus morenist party was set apart from government galasso p 124 131 hegemony was short lived military defeats of castelli and belgrano started a new political crisis and first triumvirate replaced junta grande as executive power and then closed it completely former supporters of moreno belgrano dupuy tomas guido beruti monteagudo french vicente lopez would later support campaign of jose de san martin galasso p 136 137 argentine war of independence would give room to argentine civil war between unitarians and federals saavedrists like martin rodriguez ortiz de ocampo de la cruz and even saavedra himself became unitarians ferla p 149 manuel moreno french agrelo vicente lopez and pancho planes opposed both first triumvirate and presidency of unitarian bernardino rivadavia galasso p 137 manuel moreno and tomas guido in particular worked in government of most powerful federal leader juan manuel de rosas historical perspectives thumb argentine historian ricardo levene during a conference about mariano moreno early argentine historians described mariano moreno as leader of revolution and a great historical man later liberal historians would embellish this portrayal even more an example of this tendency is la revolucion de mayo y mariano moreno by ricardo levene scenna p 6 biographers would describe him as a serene statesman a notable economist a decided democrat and a great leader for those historians moreno would have been an anglophile and representation of hacendados government platform of may revolution scenna pp 27 28 subsequently revisionist authors would formulate accusations against him while promoting saavedra as a popular leader according to those authors moreno was a british agent a demagogic caudillo a paranoid a mere man of theoretical ideas applying european principles that failed in local context wrongly portrayed as leader of revolution by liberal historiography scenna pp 6 7 ano x by hugo is considered harshest work against moreno moreno was still considered an anglophile but in a negative light they blamed moreno for harsh policies of junta considering him a pp 74 75 or a predecessor of marxism liberal historians usually concealed these policies scenna p 74 modern authors like ernesto palacio norberto galasso and jorge abelardo ramos attempt to rescue image of moreno by avoiding both extremes sweet liberal moreno and horrible one written by revisionists scenna p 8 those historians do not consider bernardino rivadavia a successor of moreno and proposals to seek an alliance with britain are not seen as product of anglophilia but just an example of limited options available to primera junta scenna pp 69 74 similarly they do not attribute much influence to representation considering it a mere work for a p 29 that didn t really influence cisneros who would have allowed free trade for international contexts scenna p 32 harsh policies are acknowledged but not attributed specifically to moreno but rather to whole junta and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish chuquisaca la paz revolution and indigenous rebellion of tupac amaru ii scenna pp 75 79 journalism mariano moreno is regarded as first argentine journalist as he created gazeta de buenos ayres june 7 day this newspaper was first available to public is recognized in argentina as journalist s day since 1938 gazeta however was not first newspaper in buenos aires but first one since may revolution first newspaper was telegrafo mercantil 1801 followed by semanario de agricultura industria y comercio 1802 and correo de comercio de buenos aires 1810 edited during colonial period moreno was only one to sign decree that established newspaper but text implies that it was result of a discussion of whole junta and not just his initiative scenna p 53 a fellow member of junta manuel alberti was appointed as director of newspaper however alberti never actually directed newspaper moreno did historian guillermo furlong considers that it was really alberti who directed newspaper but memoirs of jose pedro agrelo a later director tomas guido and saavedra confirm that newspaper was managed by moreno scenna pp 54 55 moreno has also been promoted as a supporter of freedom of press but gazeta was actually a state sponsored newspaper and junta allowed such freedom only for information that was not against interests of government according to norberto galasso that situation would today be considered media bias scenna p 56 personal life thumb maria guadalupe cuenca wife of mariano moreno moreno family was poor but could afford a house and some slaves ana maria valle y ramos mariano s mother was one of few literate women in buenos aires winaski p 19 mariano moreno was firstborn of fourteen children mariano moved to chuquisaca with his brother manuel moreno and their friend tomas guido once family raised money lagleyze p 8 long and difficult journey gave mariano a rheumatism attack he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival he had further attacks years later lagleyze p 9 moreno met maria guadalupe cuenca in this city after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith s house both moreno and maria were expected by their families to follow religious studies and moreno s father did not authorize a change moreno studied laws all same and married maria in secret to avoid family resistance they had a single son named mariano like father lagleyze p 10 when moreno left for europe on a diplomatic mission in 1811 his wife and son stayed in buenos aires maria wrote many letters to moreno with descriptions of ongoing events in city most of them were written when moreno was already dead she did not learn of his fate until following august when a letter arrived from manuel moreno she requested a widow s pension from first triumvirate which was in power by then its value was thirty pesos pigna pp 338 341 beliefs mariano moreno studied french and spanish authors of age of enlightenment during his studies at chuquisaca jean jacques rousseau s social contract was main influence he translated this work into spanish and used it to justify actions of primera junta contemporary people as ignacio nunez and tomas de anchorena acknowledged him as translator however as main page said that work was reprinted in buenos ayres some historians doubt whether it was actually moreno s work vicente fidel lopez claimed that moreno reprinted translation made by spaniard gaspar melchor de jovellanos but two translations differ scenna p 37 paul groussac thought it was a reprint of an asturian translation and ricardo levene said that moreno was not translator but neither gave any indication as to who they thought had completed it scenna pp 57 58 enrique de gandia considers that comments of contemporary people and lack of an earlier similar translation of rousseau s work allow us to conclude that moreno must have been translator at least until an earlier translation is found scenna p 58 despite his interest in french authors mariano moreno was not francophile or he kept a strong spanish cultural heritage and both levene and abelardo ramos agree that his stay in chuquisaca influenced him more than books in line with spanish enlightenment moreno kept strong religious beliefs he removed chapter from rousseau s work that is critical of religion and never became a freemason scenna p 60 he gave up his religious studies to study law and get married but never actually became a priest so there was no defrocking he studied with priests such as terrazas who approved and perhaps even encouraged change of vocation physical aspect thumb portrait of moreno made by painter juan de dios rivera it is thought to be a realistic representation canonical image of mariano moreno is one from portrait mariano moreno en su mesa de trabajo it was done by chilean artist pedro subercaseaux during centennial of may revolution in 1910 historian adolfo carranza asked him to design various allegorical pictures of event carranza belonged to mainstream line of historians who professed great admiration for moreno who he described as follows he was soul of government of revolution of may his nerve distinguished statesman of group managing ship attacked absolutism and doubt anxious to reach goal of his aspirations and his destiny moreno was compass and that also grabbed helm as he was strongest and ablest of those who came to direct it he asked for a picture that was consistent with this image portrait depicts him as a friendly man with an open and round face a wide forehead and a serene look subsequent interpretations like those of antonio estrada would follow this style as would portraits of other members of junta however as this portrait was made a hundred years after death of subject with no known depictions done during his lifetime it was thus based on artist s imagination it was known that moreno had clearly visible smallpox scars from age of eight but not to point where they disfigured his face scenna p 101 later a portrait of moreno was discovered that had been done from life by peruvian silversmith juan de dios rivera this portrait was painted between 1808 or 1809 before moreno s appointment as secretary of junta it is now considered to be closest representation of moreno s real appearance in this portrait he is depicted with an elongated face abundant hair long sideburns big eyes and a pointy nose scenna p 102
