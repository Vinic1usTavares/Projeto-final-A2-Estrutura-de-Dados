my back pages is a song written by bob dylan and included on his 1964 album another side of bob dylan it is stylistically similar to his earlier folk protest songs and features dylan s voice with an acoustic guitar accompaniment however its lyrics in particular refrain ah but i was so much older then i m younger than that now have been interpreted as a rejection of dylan s earlier personal and political idealism illustrating his growing disillusionment with 1960s folk protest movement with which he was associated and his desire to move in a new direction although dylan wrote song in 1964 he did not perform it live until 1988 my back pages has been covered by artists as diverse as keith jarrett byrds ramones nice steve earle and hollies byrds version initially released on their 1967 album younger than yesterday was also issued as a single in 1967 and proved to be band s last top 40 hit in u s writing recording and performance bob dylan wrote my back pages in 1964 as one of last songs perhaps last song composed for his another side of bob dylan album he recorded it on june 9 1964 under working title of ancient memories last song committed to tape for album song was partly based on traditional folk song young but growing and has a mournful melody similar to that of lonesome death of hattie carroll from dylan s previous album times they are a changin as with other songs on another side dylan is sole musician on my back pages and plays in a style similar to his previous protest songs with a sneering rough edged voice and a hard strumming acoustic guitar accompaniment in song s lyrics dylan criticizes himself for having been certain that he knew everything and apologizes for his previous political preaching noting that he has become his own enemy in instant that i preach dylan questions whether one can really distinguish between right and wrong and even questions desirability of principle of equality lyrics also signal dylan s disillusionment with 1960s protest movement and his intention to abandon protest songwriting song effectively protest movement to establishment it is trying to overturn concluding with refrain ah but i was so much older theni m younger than that now music critic robert shelton has interpreted this refrain as an internal dialogue between what he dylan once accepted and now doubts shelton also notes that refrain maps a path from experience to innocence of william wordsworth refrain has also been interpreted as dylan celebrating his bright new post protest future dylan s disenchantment with protest movement had previously surfaced in a speech he had given in december 1963 when accepting an award from emergency civil liberties committee eclc in new york author mike has commented that no song on another side distressed dylan s friends in movement more than my back pages in which he transmutes rude incoherence of his eclc rant into organized density of art lilting refrain must be one of most lyrical expressions of political apostasy ever penned it is a recantation in every sense of word in an interview with sheffield university paper in may 1965 dylan explained change that had occurred in his songwriting over previous twelve months noting big difference is that songs i was writing last year they were what i call one dimensional songs but my new songs i m trying to make more three dimensional you know there s more symbolism they re written on more than one level in late 1965 dylan commented on writing of my back pages specifically during an interview with margaret steen for toronto star i was in my new york phase then or at least i was just coming out of it i was still keeping things that are really really real out of my songs for fear they d be misunderstood now i don t care if they are as dylan stated to nat hentoff at time that my back pages and other songs on another side of bob dylan were written there aren t any finger pointing songs here now a lot of people are doing finger pointing songs you know pointing to all things that are wrong me i don t want to write for people anymore you know be a spokesman dylan did not play my back pages in concert until june 11 1988 during a performance in mountain view california arrangement he used eliminated some of song s verses and included an electric guitar part performed by session musician g e smith since 1988 dylan has played song in concert many times in both electric and semi acoustic versions and sometimes as an acoustic encore at 30th anniversary tribute concert to dylan at madison square garden in 1992 dylan performed my back pages in byrds arrangement with george harrison eric clapton tom petty neil young and roger mcguinn this performance which featured vocals from all six musicians along with guitar solos by clapton and young was released on 30th anniversary concert celebration album in 1993 in addition to its initial appearance on another side of bob dylan my back pages has appeared on a number of dylan

yesterday title of younger than yesterday was itself directly inspired by song s refrain of ah but i was so much older then i m younger than that now my back pages was subsequently issued as a single by byrds on march 13 1967 with version included on single being a radio edit that omitted song s second verse in order to reduce playing time from 3 08 to 2 31 single reached number 30 on billboard hot 100 and number 18 in canada but failed to chart in united kingdom my back pages was last single by byrds to reach top 40 of u s charts song was initially suggested as a suitable vehicle for band by their manager jim dickson lead guitarist jim mcguinn felt that it would make an effective cover version but david crosby band s rhythm guitarist felt that covering another dylan song was formulaic byrds had already released a total of six dylan covers on their first two albums mr tambourine man and turn turn turn enjoying particular success with their recordings of mr tambourine man and all i really want to do despite crosby s objections band recorded my back pages between december 5 and december 8 1966 during recording sessions for their fourth album upon its release this cover was received well by critics and is today regarded as one of byrds strongest dylan interpretations following its release on younger than yesterday song would go on to become a staple of byrds live concert repertoire until their final disbandment in 1973 on december 4 1968 a later line up of byrds re recorded an excerpt of my back pages as part of a medley that was included on their 1969 album dr byrds
