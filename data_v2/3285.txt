tetronarce californica also known as pacific electric ray is a species of electric ray in family torpedinidae endemic to coastal waters of northeastern pacific ocean from baja california to british columbia it generally inhabits sandy flats rocky reefs and kelp forests from surface to a depth of but has also been known to make forays into open ocean measuring up to long this species has smooth rimmed spiracles paired respiratory openings behind eyes and a dark gray slate or brown dorsal coloration sometimes with dark spots its body form is typical of genus with a rounded pectoral fin disc wider than long and a thick tail bearing two dorsal fins of unequal size and a well developed caudal fin solitary and nocturnal pacific electric ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity for purposes of subduing prey or self defense it feeds mainly on bony fishes ambushing them from substrate during day and actively hunting for them at night reproduction is aplacental viviparous meaning that embryos are initially nourished by yolk later supplemented by histotroph uterine milk produced by mother females bear litters of 17 20 pups probably once every other year care should be exercised around pacific electric ray as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver it and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species under least concern as it is not fished in any significant numbers taxonomy pacific electric ray was described by american ichthyologist william orville ayres first curator of ichthyology at california academy of sciences who named it after u s state where it was first discovered by science ayers published his account in 1855 in inaugural volume of academy s proceedings no type specimens were designated in 1861 theodore gill placed this species in his newly created genus tetronarce on basis of its smooth rimmed spiracles later authors have generally regarded tetronarce as a subgenus of torpedo closely similar electric rays found off peru chile and japan may be same as this species other common names used for this ray include california torpedo ray pacific torpedo or simply electric ray or torpedo ray this species is placed in genus tetronarce distribution and habitat only electric ray found off western north america pacific electric ray occurs as far south as sebastian vizcaino bay in baja california and as far north as dixon entrance in northern british columbia it is most common south of point conception california with rays north of point perhaps representing one or more separate populations off california pacific electric ray is generally encountered at a depth of while off baja california it is typically observed at a depth of it has been reported from as deep as this species prefers temperatures of it frequents sandy flats rocky reefs and kelp forests however one individual has been videotaped west of point pinos monterey county california swimming below surface in water deep this and other observations suggest that this species makes periodic excursions away from shallow coastal habitats into zone description thumb upright 1 2 alt a blue gray ray swimming just above bottom some pacific electric rays have dark spots on upper surface pacific electric ray has a soft flabby body devoid of dermal denticles it has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1 2 times as wide as long with a nearly straight front margin and a pair of kidney shaped electric organs visible beneath skin eyes are small and followed by smooth rimmed spiracles space from spiracles to snout tip is about 1 8 times distance between spiracles there is a curtain of skin between nostrils that almost reaches mouth which is arched with deep furrows at corners distance between mouth and snout tip is about equal to mouth width and three times that of distance between nostrils there are 25 28 upper tooth rows and 19 26 lower tooth rows each tooth is tiny and smooth with a single sharp cusp two dorsal fins are present with first more than twice size of second and positioned opposite large pelvic fins tail is short and stocky terminating in a large triangular caudal fin with a nearly straight trailing margin this ray is dark gray slate or brown above sometimes with small darker spots that increase in number with age underside is white males attain a maximum known length of and females maximum recorded weight is biology and ecology with a sizable oily liver and low density tissues pacific electric ray is almost neutrally buoyant and can hover in water column with very little effort propulsive power is provided by muscular tail while disc is held rigid telemetry studies have shown that this species swims primarily at night when it enters reefs and other habitats with high terrain relief and spends most of day in nearby open areas buried in sediment it is nomadic and solitary though several individuals may rest within same area like other members of its family pacific electric ray produces powerful electric shocks for attack and defense its paired electric organs are derived from muscle and comprise approximately 15 of its total weight consisting of many thousands of jelly filled electric plates stacked hundreds high into vertical hexagonal columns these columns function essentially like batteries connected in parallel a large adult ray can generate some 45 volts of electricity with a power output of one kilowatt due to low internal resistance electric organs discharge direct current in pulses each lasting 4 5 ms when attacking prey in first few moments ray normally produces pulses at a rate of 150 200 per second slowing down over time over a thousand pulses may be produced in all depending on how long it takes for prey to be subdued pulse rate increases with water temperature because of its large size and formidable defenses pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals there is a record of one being fed upon by a killer whale orcinus orca off santa catalina island cooper s nutmeg is a specialized parasite of this ray and possibly other bottom dwelling fishes such as pacific angelshark squatina californica snail is attracted to chemicals contained in ray s surface mucus it makes a small cut on ventral surface of ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood other known parasites of this species include copepod fluke amphibdelloides maccallumi and tapeworm acanthobothrium feeding thumb left alt a dark gray ray cruising over a plain sandy bottom at night pacific electric ray actively hunts for food over sea floor pacific electric ray feeds mainly on bony fishes including anchovies herring hake mackerel croakers rockfishes kelp bass and flatfishes but will also take cephalopods and invertebrates given opportunity its jaws are highly distensible allowing it to swallow surprisingly large prey one female long has been observed ingesting a silver salmon oncorhynchus nearly half her length during day pacific electric ray is an ambush predator when a fish approaches its head ray jumps forward from its resting place and folds down its disc to envelop it while delivering strong shocks once fish is subdued ray itself to swallow it head first entire process takes about two minutes at night when many diurnal fishes descend from water column and become inactive a short distance above bottom pacific electric ray switches to an active hunting strategy it stalks fish by slowly swimming or simply drifting through water when it closes to of prey it lunges forward and again envelops prey within its disc while delivering shocks to better secure fish within its disc ray will make short kicks with its tail that sometimes send it into barrel rolls or somersaults finally stunned prey is maneuvered to mouth with ripples of disc in one recorded case a long female captured and consumed a long jack mackerel in under ten seconds nighttime seine net sampling at surface of monterey bay has captured pacific electric rays in surprising numbers suggesting that they rise upward from bottom to feed on small fishes though pacific electric ray will feed at any hour it responds to prey much more quickly at night than during day most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions when its eyes are largely useless instead it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of lorenzini to locate food experiments in field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes mechanical sensory cues detected via lateral line also play an important role this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster moving prey even if a closer food item was available life history pacific electric ray exhibits aplacental viviparity with developing embryos at first receiving nourishment from yolk and later from histotroph uterine milk enriched with proteins fat and mucus produced by mother and delivered through specialized outgrowths of uterine lining mature females have two functional ovaries and uteruses reproduction occurs year round with males apparently capable of mating every year and females every other year gestation period is unknown reported litter sizes range from 17 to 20 at least number of ova and perhaps also number of young increases with size of female newborns measure long and double their size in first year of life adding around to their length male grow faster than females but reach a smaller ultimate size sexual maturity is attained at a length of and age of seven years for males and a length of and age of nine years for females oldest documented individuals are 16 years of age and extrapolating from growth curves maximum lifespan of this species may be upwards of 24 years human interactions thumb pacific electric ray with diver offshore island shock generated by pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human it should be treated with caution especially at night when it is active and has been known to charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed it is not known to be responsible for any fatalities but may have been involved in several unexplained fatal diving accidents this species fares poorly in captivity as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium since 2000 aquarium of bay and monterey bay aquarium have had some success keeping pacific electric rays by offering them moving food pacific electric ray and its relatives are used as model organisms for biomedical research because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as acetylcholine receptor and in 1970s and 1980s acetylcholine receptors from this species and marbled electric ray t marmorata became first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced in what is considered to be a landmark success in field of neurobiology this led to a number of further advances one of most significant being elucidation of pathophysiology underlying disease myasthenia gravis a small commercial fishery in southern california supplies pacific electric rays for research purposes as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers otherwise this ray has no economic value it is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries and on hook and line by sport anglers these activities appear to have little impact on its population leading it to be listed under least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn fishing for this ray is not managed by pacific fishery management council references category strongly electric fish ray pacific ray pacific
