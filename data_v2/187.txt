battle of crecy took place on 26 august 1346 in north east france between a french army commanded by king philip vi and an english army led by king edward iii french attacked english while they were traversing northern france during hundred years war resulting in an english victory and heavy loss of life among french english army had landed in cotentin peninsula on 12 july it had burnt a path of destruction through some of richest lands in france to within of paris sacking many towns on way english then marched north hoping to link up with an allied flemish army which had invaded from flanders hearing that flemish had turned back and having temporarily outdistanced pursuing french edward had his army prepare a defensive position on a hillside near crecy en ponthieu late on 26 august french army which greatly outnumbered english attacked during a brief archery duel a large force of french mercenary crossbowmen was routed by welsh and english longbowmen french then launched a series of cavalry charges by their mounted knights these were disordered by their impromptu nature by having to force their way through fleeing crossbowmen by muddy ground by having to charge uphill and by pits dug by english attacks were further broken up by effective fire from english archers which caused heavy casualties by time french charges reached english men at arms who had dismounted for battle they had lost much of their impetus ensuing hand to hand combat was described as murderous without pity cruel and very horrible french charges continued late into night all with same result fierce fighting followed by a french repulse english then laid siege to port of calais battle crippled french army s ability to relieve siege town fell to english following year and remained under english rule for more than two centuries until 1558 crecy established effectiveness of longbow as a dominant weapon on western european battlefield background since norman conquest of 1066 english monarchs had held titles and lands within france possession of which made them vassals of kings of france following a series of disagreements between philip vi of france and edward iii of england on 24 may 1337 philip s great council in paris agreed that lands held by edward in france should be taken back into philip s hands on grounds that edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal this marked start of hundred years war which was to last 116 years thumb upright left alt a head and shoulders drawing of edward iii in armour and bearing a sword in 1345 edward s main army sailed on 29 june and anchored off sluys in flanders until 22 july while edward attended to diplomatic affairs when it sailed probably intending to land in normandy it was scattered by a storm there were further delays and it proved impossible to take any action with this force before winter meanwhile henry earl of derby led a whirlwind campaign through gascony at head of an anglo gascon army he heavily defeated two large french armies at battles of bergerac and auberoche captured more than 100 french towns and fortifications in perigord and agenais and gave english possessions in gascony strategic depth in march 1346 a french army numbering between 15 000 and 20 000 enormously superior to any force anglo gascons could field including all military officers of royal household and commanded by john duke of normandy son and heir of philip vi marched on gascony they besieged strategically and logistically important town of aiguillon on 2 april arriere ban formal call to arms for all able bodied males was announced for south of france french financial logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive derby now lancaster during 1345 campaign he was known as earl of derby but his father died in september 1345 and he became earl of lancaster sent an urgent appeal for help to edward edward was not only morally obliged to succour his vassal but contractually required to his indenture with lancaster stated that if lancaster were attacked by overwhelming numbers then edward shall rescue him in one way or another meanwhile edward was raising a fresh army and assembled more than 700 vessels to transport it largest english fleet ever to that date french were aware of edward s efforts and to guard against possibility of an english landing in northern france relied on their powerful navy this reliance was misplaced and french were unable to prevent edward successfully crossing channel prelude thumb upright 1 4 left alt a map of south east england and north east

their path and looted whatever they could from populace caen cultural political religious and financial centre of north west normandy was stormed on 26 july and subsequently looted for five days more than 5 000 french soldiers and civilians were killed among few prisoners was raoul count of eu constable of france on 29 july edward sent his fleet back to england laden with loot with a letter ordering that reinforcements supplies and money be collected embarked and loaded respectively and sent to rendezvous with his army at crotoy on north bank of mouth of river somme english marched out towards river seine on 1 august french military position was difficult their main army commanded by john duke of normandy son and heir of philip vi was committed to intractable siege of aiguillon in south west after his surprise landing in normandy edward was devastating some of richest land in france and flaunting his ability to march at will through france on 2 august a small english force supported by many flemings invaded france from flanders french defences there were completely inadequate treasury was all but empty on 29 july philip proclaimed arriere ban for northern france ordering every able bodied male to assemble at rouen where philip himself arrived on 31st on 7 august english reached seine south of rouen and turned south east by 12 august edward s army was encamped at poissy 20 miles from paris having left a 20 mile wide swath of destruction down left bank of seine burning villages to within of paris philip s army marched parallel to english on other bank and in turn encamped north of paris where it was steadily reinforced paris was in uproar swollen with refugees and preparations were made to defend capital street by street thumb upright 0 7 alt a medieval image of philip iv seated wearing a blue robe decorated with fleurs de lys philip sent orders to duke john of normandy insisting that he abandon siege of aiguillon and march his army north which after delay and prevarication he did on 20 august french army outside paris consisted of some 8 000 men at arms 6 000 crossbowmen and many infantry levies philip sent a challenge on 14 august suggesting that two armies do battle at a mutually agreed time and place in area edward indicated that he would meet philip to south of seine without actually committing himself on 16 august french moved into position edward promptly burnt down poissy destroyed bridge there and marched north french had carried out a scorched earth policy carrying away all stores of food and so forcing english to spread out over a wide area to forage which greatly slowed them bands of french peasants attacked some of smaller groups of foragers philip reached river somme a day s march ahead of edward he based himself at amiens and sent large detachments to hold every bridge and ford across seine between amiens and sea english were now trapped in an area which had been stripped of food french moved out of amiens and advanced westwards towards english they were now willing to give battle knowing that they would have advantage of being able to stand on defensive while english were forced to try and fight their way past them edward was determined to break french blockade of somme and probed at several points vainly attacking and pont remy before moving west along river english supplies were running out and army was ragged starving and beginning to suffer from a drop in morale on evening of 24 august english were encamped north of while french were away at abbeville during night english marched on a tidal ford named far bank was defended by a force of 3 500 french english longbowmen and mounted men at arms waded into tidal river and after a short sharp fight routed french main french army had followed english and their scouts captured some stragglers and several wagons but edward had broken free of immediate pursuit such was french confidence that edward would not ford somme that area beyond had not been denuded allowing edward s army to plunder it and resupply meanwhile flemings having been rebuffed by french at estaires besieged bethune on 14 august after several setbacks they fell out among themselves burnt their siege equipment and gave up their expedition on 24 august edward received news that he would not be reinforced by flemings shortly after crossing somme ships which were expected to be waiting off crotoy were nowhere to be seen edward decided to engage philip s army with force he had having temporarily shaken off french pursuit he used respite to prepare a defensive position at crecy en ponthieu french returned to abbeville crossed somme at bridge there and doggedly set off after english again opposing forces english army english army mainly comprised english and welsh soldiers along with some allied breton and flemish troops and a few german mercenaries exact size and composition of english force is not known contemporary estimates vary widely for example froissart s third version of his chronicles more than doubles his estimate in first modern historians have estimated its size as from 7 000 to 15 000 andrew ayton suggests a figure of around 14 000 2 500 men at arms 5 000 longbowmen 3 000 hobelars light cavalry and mounted archers and 3 500 spearmen clifford rogers suggests 15 000 2 500 men at arms 7 000 longbowmen 3 250 hobelars and 2 300 spearmen jonathon sumption going by carrying capacity of its original transport fleet believes force was around 7 000 to 10 000 up to a thousand men were convicted felons serving on promise of a pardon at end of campaign many of english including many of felons were veterans perhaps as many as half men at arms of both armies wore a quilted under mail armour which covered body and limbs this was supplemented by varying amounts of plate armour on body and limbs more so for wealthier and more experienced men heads were protected by open faced military iron or steel helmets with mail attached to lower edge of helmet to protect throat neck and shoulders a moveable visor face guard protected face heater shields typically made from thin wood overlaid with leather were carried english men at arms were all dismounted weapons they used are not recorded but in similar battles they used their lances as pikes cut them down to use as short spears or fought with swords and battle axes thumb left upright 0 6 alt a photograph of an iron arrowhead longbow used by english and welsh archers was unique to them it took up to ten years to master and could discharge up to ten arrows per minute well over this range is given by material scientists and is supported by most modern historians some historians argue that range of a longbow would not have exceeded computer analysis by warsaw university of technology in 2017 demonstrated that heavy bodkin point arrows could penetrate typical plate armour of time at depth of penetration would be slight at that range predicted penetration increased as range closed or against armour of less than best quality available at time when computer modelling from 2006 was matched against performance of replica bows these were found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements contemporary sources speak of arrows frequently piercing armour archers carried one quiver of 24 arrows as standard during morning of battle they were each issued with two more quivers for a total of 72 arrows per man this was only sufficient for perhaps fifteen minutes shooting at maximum rate although as battle wore on rate would slow regular resupply of ammunition would be required from wagons to rear archers would also venture forward during pauses in fighting to retrieve arrows modern historians suggest that half a million arrows may have been shot during battle thumb alt a pen and ink drawing of a very early bombard english army was also equipped with several types of gunpowder weapons in unknown numbers small guns firing lead balls firing either metal arrows or grapeshot and bombards an early form of cannon firing metal balls in diameter contemporary accounts and modern historians differ as to what types of these weapons and how many were present at crecy but several iron balls compatible with bombard ammunition have since been retrieved from site of battle french army exact size of french army is even less certain as financial records from crecy campaign are lost although there is consensus that it was substantially larger than english contemporary chroniclers all note it as being extremely large for period two who provide totals estimate its size as 72 000 or 120 000 numbers of mounted men at arms are given as either 12 000 or 20 000 an italian chronicler claimed 100 000 knights men at arms 12 000 infantry and 5 000 crossbowmen contemporary chroniclers estimated crossbowmen present as between 2 000 and 20 000 left upright 0 6 thumb alt a small group of men in medieval clothing bearing crossbows these numbers are described by historians as exaggerated and unrealistic on basis of extant war treasury records for 1340 six years before battle clifford rogers estimates french host was at least twice as large as english and perhaps as much as three times ayton suggests around 12 000 mounted men at arms as core of french army several thousand mercenary crossbowmen recruited by and hired from major trading city of genoa and a large though indeterminate number of common infantry sumption and lynn agree and both concur that 6 000 italian crossbowmen were present questions this figure based on estimates that 2 000 crossbowmen were available in all of france in 1340 and doubts that genoa alone could have recruited several thousand crossbowmen how many common infantrymen militia and levies of variable levels of equipment and training were present is not known with any certainty except that on their own they outnumbered english army french men at arms were equipped similarly to english they were mounted on entirely unarmoured horses and carried wooden lances usually ash tipped with iron and approximately long many of men at arms in french army were foreigners many joined individually out of a spirit of adventure and attractive rates of pay offered others were in contingents contributed by philip s allies three kings a prince bishop a duke and three counts led entourages from non french territories since philip came to throne french armies had included an increasing proportion of crossbowmen as there were few archers in france they were usually recruited from abroad typically genoa their foreign origin led to them frequently being labelled mercenaries they were professional soldiers and in battle were protected from missiles by large shields with their own bearers behind each of which three crossbowmen could shelter a trained crossbowman could shoot his weapon approximately twice a minute initial deployments thumb upright 1 22 alt a map showing positions of both sides during battle english archers other english infantry french crossbowmen french men at arms edward deployed his army in a carefully selected position facing south east on a sloping hillside broken by copses and terracing at crecy en ponthieu this was in an area which edward had inherited from his mother and well known to several of english it has been suggested that position had long been considered a suitable site for a battle left flank was anchored against while right was protected by crecy itself and river maye beyond this made it difficult for french to outflank them position had a ready line of retreat in event that english were defeated or put under intolerable pressure while waiting for french to catch up with them english dug pits in front of their positions intended to disorder attacking cavalry and set up several primitive gunpowder weapons edward wished to provoke french into a mounted charge uphill against his solid infantry formations of dismounted men at arms backed by welsh spearmen and flanked by archers army had been in position since dawn and so was rested and well fed giving them an advantage over french who did not rest before battle having decisively defeated a large french detachment two days before their morale was high english army was deployed in three divisions or battles with two forward and one in reserve edward s son edward prince of wales aided by earl of warwick commanded largest of frontline battles other was led by earls of northampton and suffolk and positioned to left of prince of wales king commanded reserve battle each division was composed of men at arms in centre all on foot with ranks of spearmen immediately behind them and with longbowmen on each flank and in a skirmish line to their front many of longbowmen were concealed in small woods or by lying down in ripe wheat baggage train was positioned to rear of whole army where it was circled and fortified to serve as a park for horses a defence against any possible attack from rear and a rallying point in event of defeat around noon on 26 august french scouts advancing north from abbeville came in sight of english crossbowmen under antonio doria and carlo grimaldi formed french vanguard following was a large battle of men at arms led by count charles of alencon philip s brother accompanied by blind king john of bohemia next battle was led by duke rudolph of lorraine and count louis of blois while philip commanded rearguard as news filtered back that english had turned to fight french contingents sped up jostling with each other to reach front of column italians stayed in van while mounted men at arms left their accompanying infantry and wagons behind discipline was lost french were hampered by absence of their constable who was normally responsible for marshalling and leading their army but who had been captured at caen once it halted men especially infantry were continually joining philip s battle as they marched north west from abbeville after reconnoitring english position a council of war was held where senior french officials who were completely confident of victory advised an attack but not until next day army was tired from a 12 mile march and needed to reorganise so as to be able to attack in strength it was also known that count of savoy with more than 500 men at arms was marching to join french and was nearby he intercepted some of french survivors day after battle despite this advice french attacked later same afternoon it is unclear from contemporary sources whether this was a deliberate choice by philip or because too many of french knights kept pressing forward and battle commenced against his wishes philip s plan was to use long range missiles of his crossbowmen to soften up english infantry and disorder and possibly dishearten their formations so as to allow accompanying mounted men at arms to break into their ranks and rout them modern historians have generally considered this to have been a practical approach and one with proven success against other armies battle archery duel thumb upright alt a black and white engraving of a mounted knight charging french army moved forward late in afternoon unfurling their sacred battle banner oriflamme indicating that no prisoners would be taken as they advanced a sudden rainstorm broke over field english archers de strung their bows to avoid strings becoming slackened genoese with their crossbows did not need to take precautions as their bowstrings were made of leather genoese engaged english longbowmen in an archery duel longbowmen outranged their opponents and had a rate of fire more than three times greater crossbowmen were also without their protective pavises which were still with french baggage as were their reserve supplies of ammunition mud also impeded their ability to reload which required them to press stirrups of their weapons into ground and thus slowed their rate of fire italians were rapidly defeated and fled aware of their vulnerability without their pavises they may have made only a token effort modern historians disagree as to how many casualties they suffered but as some contemporary sources suggest they may have failed to get off any shots at all and most recent specialist study of this duel concludes that they hastily shot perhaps two volleys then withdrew before any real exchange with english could develop they were probably light knights and nobles following in alencon s division hampered by routed mercenaries hacked at them as they retreated by most contemporary accounts crossbowmen were considered cowards at best and more likely traitors and many of them were killed by french clash of retreating genoese and advancing french cavalry threw leading battle into disarray longbowmen continued to discharge their bows into massed troops discharge of english bombards added to confusion though contemporary accounts differ as to whether they inflicted significant casualties cavalry charges alencon s battle then launched a cavalry charge this was disordered by its impromptu nature by having to force its way through fleeing italians by muddy ground by having to charge uphill and by pits dug by english attack was further broken up by heavy and effective shooting from english archers which caused many casualties it is likely archers preserved their ammunition until they had a reasonable chance of penetrating french armour which would be a range of about armoured french riders had some protection but their horses were completely unarmoured and were killed or wounded in large numbers disabled horses fell spilling or trapping their riders and causing following ranks to swerve to avoid them and fall into even further disorder wounded horses fled across hillside in panic by time tight formation of english men at arms and spearmen received french charge it had lost much of its impetus thumb upright left alt a colourful and stylised picture of late medieval cavalry battle a contemporary described hand to hand combat which ensued as murderous without pity cruel and very horrible men at arms who lost their footing or who were thrown from wounded horses were trampled underfoot crushed by falling horses and bodies and suffocated in mud after battle many french bodies were recovered with no marks on them alencon was among those killed french attack was beaten off english infantry moved forward to knife french wounded loot bodies and recover arrows some sources say edward had given orders that contrary to custom no prisoners be taken outnumbered as he was he did not want to lose fighting men to escorting and guarding captives in any event there is no record of any prisoners being taken until next day after battle fresh forces of french cavalry moved into position at foot of hill and repeated alencon s charge they had same problems as alencon s force with added disadvantage that ground they were advancing over was littered with dead and wounded horses and men ayton and preston write of long mounds of fallen warhorses and men add ing significantly to difficulties facing fresh formations as they sought to approach english position nevertheless they charged home albeit in such a disordered state that they were again unable to break into english formation a prolonged melee resulted with a report that at one point prince of wales was beaten to his knees one account has prince s standard bearer standing on his banner to prevent its capture a modern historian has described fighting as horrific carnage edward sent forward a detachment from his reserve battle to rescue situation french were again repulsed they came again english ranks were thinned but those in rear stepped forward to fill gaps how many times french charged is disputed but they continued late into night with dusk and then dark french yet further all had same result fierce fighting followed by a french retreat in one attack count of blois dismounted his men and had them advance on foot count s body was found on field french nobility stubbornly refusing to yield there was no lack of courage on either side famously blind king john of bohemia tied his horse s bridle to those of his attendants and galloped into twilight all were dragged from their horses and killed there are accounts of entire english battles advancing on occasion to clear away broken french charges milling in front of them then withdrawing in good order to their original positions philip himself was caught up in fighting had two horses killed underneath him and received an arrow in jaw bearer of oriflamme was a particular target for english archers he was seen to fall but survived albeit abandoning sacred banner to be captured finally philip abandoned field of battle although it is unclear why it was nearly midnight and battle petered out with majority of french army melting away from battlefield english slept where they had fought next morning substantial french forces were still arriving on battlefield to be charged by english men at arms now mounted routed and pursued for miles their losses alone were reported as several thousand including duke of lorraine meanwhile a few wounded or stunned frenchmen were pulled from heaps of dead men and dying horses and taken prisoner casualties thumb upright alt a colourful late medieval depiction of edward iii counting dead after battle losses in battle were highly asymmetrical all contemporary sources agree that english casualties were very low three give specific figures for english men at arms killed 3 30 and 300 no contemporary source estimates how many non notable english were killed while some consider english casualty figures given to be improbably low rogers argues that they are consistent with reports of casualties on winning side in other medieval battles to date only two englishmen killed at battle have been identified squire robert and newly anointed knight aymer two english knights were also taken prisoner although it is unclear at what stage in battle this happened similarly all contemporary sources consider french casualties to have been very high according to a count made by english heralds after battle bodies of 1 542 french knights were found jonathan sumption assumes another few hundred men at arms were killed in pursuit which followed sumption describes total french losses as catastrophic ayton refers to extraordinarily heavy casualties suffered by french and breathtaking losses he estimates at least 2 000 french men at arms were killed noting that more than 2 200 heraldic coats were taken from field of battle as war booty by english an estimate by chronicler geoffrey baker deemed credible by modern historians says 4 000 french knights were killed among known knightly dead were two kings nine princes ten counts a duke an archbishop and a bishop according to ayton heavy losses of french can also be attributed to chivalric ideals held by knights of time nobles would have preferred to die in battle rather than flee field especially in view of their fellow knights no reliable figures exist for losses among common french soldiery although they were also considered to have been heavy jean le bel estimated 15 000 16 000 froissart writes that french army suffered a total of 30 000 killed or captured modern historian alfred burne estimates 10 000 infantry as a pure guess for a total of 12 000 french dead aftermath result of battle is described by clifford rogers as a total victory for english and by ayton as unprecedented and a devastating military humiliation sumption considers it a political catastrophe for french crown battle was reported to english parliament on 13 september in glowing terms as a sign of divine favour and justification for huge cost of war to date a contemporary chronicler opined by haste and disorganisation were french destroyed rogers writes that among other factors english benefitted from superior organisation cohesion and leadership and from indiscipline of french according to ayton england s international reputation as a military power was established in an evening s hard fighting edward ended campaign by laying siege to calais which fell after eleven months battle of crecy having crippled french army s ability to relieve town this secured an english entrepot into northern france which was held for two hundred years battle established effectiveness of longbow as a dominant weapon on western european battlefield english and welsh archers served as
