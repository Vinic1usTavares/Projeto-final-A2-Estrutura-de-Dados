southwest of diego garcia it moved generally to southwest for much of its duration steered by a ridge to southeast manou affected saint brandon and mauritius with gusty winds after an initial strengthening phase storm weakened but later re intensified as it approached madagascar manou developed a well defined eye and reached peak winds only 19 km 12 mi from eastern madagascar coastline for about 12 hours cyclone stalled before turning to south and weakening manou became extratropical on may 10 and dissipated three days later damage in madagascar was heaviest near vatomandry where 85 of buildings were destroyed and 23 people were killed manou destroyed about 24 500 houses nationwide leaving 114 480 people homeless storm destroyed large areas of crops and disrupted transportation including damaging road between vatomandry and brickaville manou injured 85 and killed 89 people throughout madagascar meteorological history in late april an area of convection persisted southwest of diego garcia in southern indian ocean system had a low level circulation and pulsating thunderstorm activity located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear convection gradually organized while developing outflow on may 2 a secondary area of convection also with an accompanying circulation formed to northwest and also showed signs of development that day original disturbance organized enough for meteo france mfr to designate it tropical disturbance 16 at 1200 utc joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued tropical cyclone formation alerts for both systems within a 14 hour period and upgraded original system to tropical cyclone 18s on may 3 about 980 km 610 mi northeast of mauritius due to disturbance to northwest as well as a building ridge to northeast system continued to southwest on may 4 mfr upgraded disturbance to a tropical depression and later tropical storm manou according to jtwc storm quickly reached 1 minute sustained winds of 85 km h 50 mph secondary disturbance to west weakened while approaching storm manou also weakened due to ongoing shear and windspeeds dropped as circulation became exposed from convection on may 6 storm re intensified and thunderstorms redeveloped while passing north of mauritius and reunion on may 8 while approaching madagascar manou developed an eye and as a result mfr upgraded it to tropical cyclone status with 10 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph jtwc also upgraded storm to equivalent of a minimal hurricane after becoming a tropical cyclone manou intensified further although its forward motion slowed significantly mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 155 km h 95 mph on may 8 and jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 140 km h 85 mph with gusts to 165 km h 105 mph this made manou a rare may tropical cyclone in basin only four other storms that formed in south west indian ocean in may reached winds of over 140 km h 85 mph since satellite coverage began most recently cyclone kesiny in previous year while maintaining its peak intensity and an eye 44 km 28 mi in diameter manou reached a position only 19 km 12 mi from eastern madagascar coastline at that time gale force winds extended over 150 km 90 mi from center and mfr estimated a minimum barometric pressure of for about 12 hours manou drifted off eastern coast of madagascar before turning to south moving around a ridge to its east land interaction and drier air weakened eye and on may 9 cyclone weakened to tropical storm status next day manou weakened to a tropical depression and jtwc issued its last advisory mfr continued tracking storm until it dissipated on may 13 impact and aftermath thumb cyclone manou approaching madagascar early in its duration manou passed just north of saint brandon there sustained winds
