thumb upright 2 route of far eastern party from main base at cape denison in north west across mertz and ninnis glaciers and return far eastern party was a sledging component of 1911 14 australasian antarctic expedition which investigated previously unexplored coastal regions of antarctica west of cape adare led by expedition commander douglas mawson party aimed to explore area far to east of their main base in adelie land pushing about towards victoria land accompanying mawson were belgrave edward sutton ninnis a lieutenant in royal fusiliers and swiss ski expert xavier mertz party used sledge dogs to increase their speed across ice initially they made good progress crossing two huge glaciers on their route south east on 14 december 1912 with party more than from safety of main base at cape denison ninnis and sledge he was walking beside broke through snow lid of a crevasse and were lost their supplies now severely compromised mawson and mertz turned back west gradually shooting remaining sledge dogs for food to supplement their scarce rations as they crossed first glacier on their return journey mertz became sick making progress difficult after almost a week of making very little headway mertz died leaving mawson to carry on alone for almost a month he pulled his sledge across antarctic crossing second glacier despite an illness that increasingly weakened him mawson reached comparative safety of aladdin s cave a food depot from main base on 1 february 1913 only to be trapped there for a week while a blizzard raged outside as a result he missed ship back to australia sy aurora had sailed on 8 february just hours before his return to cape denison after waiting for more than three weeks with a relief party mawson remained at cape denison until aurora returned following summer in december 1913 causes of mertz s death and mawson s related illness remain uncertain a 1969 study suggested hypervitaminosis a presumably caused by men eating livers of their greenland huskies which are now known to be unusually high in vitamin a while this is considered most likely theory dissenting opinions suggest prolonged cold exposure or psychological stresses in 1976 explorer and mountaineer sir edmund hillary described mawson s month long journey as probably greatest story of lone survival in polar exploration edmund hillary 1976 in bickel 2000 p x background thumb last photograph taken of far eastern party by archibald lang mclean of eastern coastal party after parties separated on 17 november 1912 australasian antarctic expedition commanded by douglas mawson explored part of east antarctica between 1911 and 1914 expedition s main base was established in january 1912 at cape denison in commonwealth bay adelie land ayres 1999 p 63 this was much farther west than originally intended dense pack ice had prevented expedition ship sy aurora from landing closer to cape adare original eastern limit bickel 2000 p 43 only after aurora heading west had rounded ice tongue of mertz glacier was a landing made battling katabatic winds that swept down from antarctic plateau shore party erected their hut and began preparations for following summer s sledging expeditions men readied clothing sledges tents and rations conducted limited survey parties and deployed several caches of supplies ayres 1999 p 2009 p 87 most notable of these depots was aladdin s cave excavated from ice on slope to south of main hut riffenburgh 2009 p 90 on 27 october 1912 mawson outlined summer sledging program riffenburgh 2009 p 98 of seven sledging parties that would depart from cape denison three would head east eastern coastal party led by geologist cecil madigan was charged with exploring beyond mertz glacier tongue mawson 1996 p 135 they would initially be supported by near eastern party led by frank stillwell which would then turn to mapping area between cape denison and glacier riffenburgh 2009 p 99 final party led by mawson would push rapidly inland to south of coastal party towards victoria land an area he had explored during ernest shackleton s british antarctic expedition in 1908 09 he hoped to travel about east collecting geological data and specimens mapping coast and claiming territory for crown bickel 2000 pp 78 79 assisting him on this far eastern party would be belgrave edward sutton ninnis a lieutenant in royal fusiliers and swiss ski expert xavier mertz riffenburgh 2009 p 42 they were in charge of expedition s sledge dogs greenland huskies who would be crucial if party was to cover distance at speed mawson intended ninnis and mertz had spent winter preparing dogs for journey sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with sledges bickel 2000 p 2000 p 77 each of parties was required to return to cape denison by 15 january 1913 to allow time for aurora to collect them and escape antarctic waters unencumbered by winter sea ice bickel 2000 p 81 journey eastwards thumb upright 1 mawson rests on one of sledges at aladdin s cave during outward journey blizzards prevented parties from leaving cape denison until 10 november 1912 four days after scheduled start date in his diary mertz recorded clearing weather as definitely a good omen ayres 1999 p 70 mawson wrote a short letter to his fiancee paquita delprat allowing madigan and stillwell s parties a head start mawson ninnis mertz and seventeen dogs left cape denison early in afternoon reaching aladdin s cave four hours later bickel 2000 pp 86 2009 p 103 stopping for night they took on extra supplies and rearranged sledges first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges which collectively carried half weight of party s supplies remaining supplies were put on third sledge towed by second dog team heading south following day to avoid crevasses to east they travelled about before poor weather forced them to stop and camp strong winds confined them to tent until 13 november and they were able to travel just a short distance before weather picked up again for three more days they remained in their tent unable even to light stove bickel 2000 pp 90 91 when weather cleared on 16 november madigan and stillwell s parties joined them riffenburgh 2009 p 105 three parties travelled together for much of following day before mawson s party separated and pushed on ahead in late afternoon bickel 2000 p 92 mertz and ninnis glaciers heading south east towards mertz glacier with mertz skiing ahead and mawson and ninnis driving dogs party covered on 18 november riffenburgh 2009 pp 106 107 this was despite encountering sastrugi ridges in ice caused by wind as high as that caused dogs to slip and sledges to roll bickel 2000 p 1988 p 132 during day they passed two peaks which mawson named madigan nunatak and aurora peak after leader of eastern coastal party and expedition s ship riffenburgh 2009 p 106 following day they began steep descent to mertz glacier after sledges several times overtook dogs huskies were allowed to run free down slope riffenburgh 2009 p 108 following a particularly steep descent following day half of mawson s team of dogs reattached to his sledges were almost lost when they fell into a crevasse they were hauled out but mawson decided to camp when one of dogs ginger bitch gave birth to first in a litter of fourteen pups bickel 2000 pp 99 100 over next several days party continued across glacier they developed a method of crossing many crevasses forerunner on skis would cross snow covering hole lid and once across first of two dog teams would follow only after first dog team was across would second follow otherwise wrote mawson dogs in rear would make a course direct for wherever front dogs happened to be cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse riffenburgh 2009 pp 109 110 but despite their precautions ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip riffenburgh 2009 pp 108 109 after mawson slipped into a crevasse they began to tie themselves to their sledges as a precaution bickel 2000 p 102 ninnis developed snow blindness which mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride mawson 1996 p 146 they were also losing dogs one broke his leg and was shot another fell ill and a third was lost down a crevasse bickel 2000 p 101 on 24 november party reached eastern side of glacier and ascended to plateau mawson 1996 p 151 on level ground again they began to make quick progress they awoke on morning of 27 november to find another glacier later known as ninnis glacier far larger than first bickel 2000 p 2009 p 110 as with first glacier they had to dogs from sledges and slowly make treacherous descent once at bottom of glacier they spent four days crossing fields of crevasses battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult riffenburgh 2009 pp 110 111 in harsh conditions dogs began to grow restless one of them shackleton tore open men s food bag and devoured a pack of butter crucial for their nourishment to supplement bickel 2000 p 106 on 30 november party reached eastern limit of glacier and began ascent to plateau beyond only to find themselves confronted at top by sastrugi so sharp edged dogs were useless bickel 2000 p 107 worse still temperatures rose to melting snow and making pulling difficult party switched to travelling at night to avoid worst of conditions riffenburgh 2009 p 112 from atop ridge on eastern side of ninnis glacier mawson began to doubt accuracy of reports of land to east by charles wilkes during 1838 42 united states exploring expedition by wilkes reckoning mawson recorded in his diary we now appear to be off real continent edge mawson 1988 p 140 concerned about overlap with madigan s party to north he turned his party south they made good progress initially but beginning on 6 december a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days on 9 december they set off again but ninnis was struggling he had developed neuralgia on left side of his face and a whitlow on one of his fingers latter was making sleep difficult for him and on 13 december mawson lanced finger bickel 2000 pp 109 112 death of ninnis thumb upright 1 ninnis in his royal fusilier uniform before expedition we could do nothing wrote mertz in his diary after ninnis death we were standing helplessly next to a friend s grave my best friend of whole expedition on evening of 13 december mawson and mertz rearranged sledges rear most sledge which had carried most weight was well worn and they decided to abandon it remaining supplies were re distributed between remaining two sledges most of important supplies tent and most of food were stored on new rear sledge bickel 2000 p 113 if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse they reasoned it would be front less vital sledge riffenburgh 2009 p 115 as rear sledge was heavier strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it at camp they left a small amount of supplies including abandoned sledge and a tent cover without floor or poles hall and scanlan 2000 p 126 by noon next day they had covered from cape denison hut mertz was ahead on skis breaking trail mawson sat on first sledge ninnis walked beside second in his diary that night mertz recounted ninnis his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse wide with straight ice walls mawson 1988 p 148 on a ledge deep in hole mawson and mertz could see bodies of two dogs one still alive but seriously injured and remains of ninnis sledge there was no sign of their companion bickel 2000 p 119 they measured distance to ledge as too far for their ropes to reach ayres 1999 p 73 dog ceased to moan shortly wrote mawson in his diary that night we called and sounded for three hours then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations came back called sounded for an hour read burial service return along with heavy weather tent most of their own food and all of dogs food they had lost pickaxe shovel and mertz s waterproof and helmet on mawson s sledge they had their stove fuel sleeping bags and ten days worth of food bickel 2000 p 121 their best immediate hope was to reach camp of two days earlier where they had left abandoned sledge and supplies west they reached it in five and a half hours where mertz used tent cover with runners from abandoned sledge and a ski as poles to erect a shelter ayres 1999 p 74 they were faced with two possible routes back to cape denison first option was to make for coast where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat and hope to meet with madigan s party that would considerably lengthen journey and sea ice in summer could not be relied on or pushing slightly to south of their outward route they could hope to avoid worst of crevasses and aim for speed ayres 1999 pp 74 75 mawson chose inland route which meant that in absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs ayres 1999 p 75 first dog george was killed following morning and of his meat some was fried for men and rest fed to now starving dogs on whole it was voted good wrote mawson of meat though it had a strong musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed riffenburgh 2009 p 121 thumb upright 1 mertz photographed before expedition before setting off again they raised flag which they had forgotten to do at their furthest point and claimed land for crown with temperature rising they switched to travelling at night to take advantage of harder surface cold provided with five remaining dogs mawson and mertz pushed on starving dogs began to struggle two more johnson and mary were shot and divided between men and dogs over following days riffenburgh 2009 p 148 mawson and mertz found most of meat tough but enjoyed liver it at least was tender bickel 2000 p 121 with pulling power of dogs now severely depleted mertz stopped making trail and instead helped mawson to pull sledge despite challenges they made good progress in first four nights they travelled bickel 2000 p 147 as they approached ninnis glacier on 21 december haldane once largest and strongest of dogs was shot mawson 1988 p 2009 pp 123 124 death of mertz both men were suffering but mertz in particular started to feel ill he complained of stomach pains and this began to slow them down bickel 2000 p 153 pavlova was killed leaving only one remaining dog mawson decided to lighten their sledge and much of equipment including camera photographic films and all of scientific equipment save theodolite was abandoned riffenburgh 2009 p 125 on 29 december day they cleared ninnis glacier last dog was killed mawson recorded had a great breakfast off ginger s skull and brain mawson 1988 p 2009 p 127 two days later mawson recorded that mertz was off colour mertz wrote that he was really tired and shall write no more mawson 1988 p 156 they made on 31 december no progress for following two days and 5 miles more on 3 january cold wind frost bit mertz s fingers recorded mawson and he is generally in a very bad condition skin coming off legs etc so had to camp though going was good not until 6 january did they make any more progress they went before mertz collapsed ayres 1999 pp 76 77 following day mawson placed mertz onto sledge in his sleeping bag and continued but was forced to stop and camp when mertz s condition again deteriorated mawson recorded strong winds prevented mawson from continuing for two days instead he prepared for travelling alone removing rearmost half from sledge and rearranging its cargo to save having to carry excess kerosene for stove he boiled remainder of dog meat dragging mertz s body in sleeping bag from tent mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it and used two spare beams from sledge to form a cross which he placed on top following day he read burial service riffenburgh 2009 pp 131 133 alone thumb upright 1 2 mawson s half sledge which he used during final stage of journey as weather cleared on 11 january mawson continued west estimating distance back to cape denison at ayres 1999 p 79 he travelled 2 miles before pain in his feet forced him to stop he found that soles of his feet had separated as a complete layer applying lanolin to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots he continued riffenburgh 2009 p 135 my whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment he recorded frost bitten fingertips festering mucous membrane of nose gone saliva glands of mouth refusing duty skin coming off whole body mawson 1988 p 159 averaging around 5 miles a day he began to cross mertz glacier on 17 january he broke through lid of a crevasse but rope around his waist held him to sledge and halted his fall bickel 2000 pp 198 199 to save himself from future crevasses mawson constructed a rope ladder which he carried over his shoulder and was attached to sledge it paid off almost immediately and twice in following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses riffenburgh 2009 p 139 once out of mertz glacier his mileage increased and on 28 january madigan nunatak came into view following day after travelling 5 miles a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about to his right in it he found food and a note from archibald lang mclean who along with frank hurley and alfred had been sent out by auroras captain john king davis to search for far eastern party ayres 1999 p 2000 p 215 from note mawson learned he was south east of aladdin s cave and near two further food depots note also reported on other parties of expedition all had returned to hut safely and on roald amundsen s attainment of south pole in december 1911 cairn had been left there just six hours before when three men had returned to hut riffenburgh 2009 p 142 struggling on his injured feet and lacking crampons he had thrown his away after he crossed mertz glacier mawson took three days to reach aladdin s cave riffenburgh 2009 p 143 although supplies had been left in aladdin s cave including fresh fruit there were not spare crampons he had expected without them he could not hope to descend steep ice slope to hut and so he began to fashion his own collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases bickel 2000 pp 229 2009 p 144 even when completed a blizzard confined him to cave and only on 8 february was he able to begin descent nearing hut he was spotted by three men working outside who rushed up hill to meet him ayres 1999 p 82 aftermath thumb upright 1 mawson shortly after his return to cape denison aurora arrived at cape denison on 13 january 1913 when mawson s party failed to return davis sailed her east along coast as far as mertz glacier tongue searching for party finding no sign and reaching end of navigable ice free water they returned to cape denison oncoming winter concerned davis and on 8 february just hours before mawson s return to hut ship departed commonwealth bay leaving six men behind as a relief party upon mawson s return aurora was recalled by wireless radio but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from plateau prevented ship s boat from reaching shore to collect men ayres 1999 pp 86 87 aurora returned to cape denison following summer in mid december to take men home bickel 2000 p 257 delay may have saved mawson s life he later told phillip law then director of australian national antarctic research expeditions that he did not believe he could have survived sea journey so soon after his ordeal riffenburgh 2009 p 154 cause of mawson and mertz s illnesses remains in part a mystery at time mclean expedition s chief surgeon and one of men who had remained at cape denison attributed their sickness to colitis mawson wrote in home of blizzard his official account of expedition that mertz died of fever and appendicitis bickel 2000 p 2009 p 136 a 1969 study by sir john cleland and r v southcott of university of adelaide concluded that symptoms mawson described hair skin and weight loss depression dysentery and persistent skin infections indicated men had suffered hypervitaminosis a an excessive intake of vitamin a this is found in unusually high quantities in livers of greenland huskies of which both mertz and mawson consumed large amounts while hypervitaminosis a is generally accepted medical diagnosis for mertz s death and mawson s illness theory has its detractors riffenburgh 2009 p 137 law believed it was completely unproven symptoms that were described are exactly ones you get from cold exposure you don t have to predicate a theory of this sort to explain soles coming off your feet ayres 1999 pp 80 81 a 2005 article in medical journal of australia by denise carrington smith suggested it may have been psychological stresses related to death of a close friend and deaths of dogs he had cared for and a switch from a predominately vegetarian diet that killed mertz not hypervitaminosis a carrington smith 2005 p 641 thumb upright 1 memorial cross erected at cape denison in 1913 for mertz and ninnis suggestions of cannibalism that mawson may have eaten mertz after his death surfaced during mawson s lecture tour of united states following expedition several reports in american newspapers quoted mawson as saying he considered eating mertz but these claims were denied by mawson who labelled them outrageous and an invention riffenburgh 2009 pp 131 132 mawson s biographers believe suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong beau riffenburgh notes that mawson nursed mertz for days even at possible risk to his own life moreover he notes mawson had no way of knowing why mertz died eating his flesh could possibly have been very dangerous riffenburgh 2009 pp 132 133 these sentiments are echoed by philip ayres who also notes that with mertz s death mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism ayres 1999 pp 78 79 law who knew mawson well believed he was a man of very solid conservative morals it would have been impossible for him to have considered it ayres 1999 p 78 in november 1913 shortly before aurora arrived to return them to australia men remaining at cape denison erected a memorial cross for mertz and ninnis on azimuth hill to north west of main hut cross constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from mertz s bunk bickel 2000 p 254 cross still stands although crossbar has required reattaching several times and plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986 two glaciers far eastern party crossed previously unnamed were named by mawson for mertz and ninnis at a celebration in centre of adelaide on his return from antarctica mawson praised his dead companions survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more but these men had done their all mawson s return was celebrated at adelaide town hall in an event attended by governor general lord denman a typical speaker stated that mawson has returned from a journey that was absolutely unparalleled in history of exploration one of greatest illustrations of how affairs of nature were overcome by superb courage power and resolve of man riffenburgh 2009 pp 177 178 including far eastern party sledging parties from cape denison base covered over of previously unexplored land expedition s western base party on shackleton ice shelf under frank wild covered a further ayres 1999 pp 95 96 expedition was first to use wireless radio in antarctic transmitting back to australia via a relay station established on macquarie island and made several important scientific discoveries first published in 1915 mawson s account of expedition home of

1915 p 424 a later analysis by j gordon hayes while commending most of expedition was critical of mawson s decision not to use skis but fred jacka writing in australian dictionary of biography suggests that for mawson and ninnis who were manoeuvring heavy sledges this would have been difficult much of time in his 1976 foreword to lennard bickel s book on australasian antarctic expedition
