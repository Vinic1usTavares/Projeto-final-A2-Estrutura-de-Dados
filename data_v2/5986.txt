merchants of doubt how a handful of scientists obscured truth on issues from tobacco smoke to global warming is a 2010 non fiction book by american historians of science naomi oreskes and erik m conway it identifies parallels between global warming controversy and earlier controversies over tobacco smoking acid rain ddt and hole in ozone layer oreskes and conway write that in each case keeping controversy alive by spreading doubt and confusion after a scientific consensus had been reached was basic strategy of those opposing action in particular they show that fred seitz fred singer and a few other contrarian scientists joined forces with conservative think tanks and private corporations to challenge scientific consensus on many contemporary issues org some of book s subjects have been critical of book but most reviewers received it favorably one reviewer said that merchants of doubt is exhaustively researched and documented and may be one of most important books of 2010 another reviewer saw book as his choice for best science book of year it was made into a film merchants of doubt directed by robert kenner released in 2014 themes thumb right fred singer 2011 a prominent opponent of greenhouse gas regulation oreskes and conway write that a handful of politically conservative scientists with strong ties to particular industries have played a disproportionate role in debates about controversial questions authors write that this has resulted in deliberate obfuscation of issues which has had an influence on public opinion and policy making book criticizes so called merchants of doubt some predominantly american science key players above all bill nierenberg fred seitz and fred singer all three are physicists singer was a space and satellite researcher whereas nierenberg and seitz worked on atomic bomb they have been active on topics like acid rain tobacco smoking global warming and pesticides book claims that these scientists have challenged and diluted scientific consensus in various fields as of dangers of smoking effects of acid rain existence of ozone hole and existence of anthropogenic climate change seitz and singer have been involved with institutions such as heritage foundation competitive enterprise institute and george c marshall institute in united states funded by corporations and conservative foundations these organizations have opposed many forms of state intervention or regulation of u s citizens book lists similar tactics in each case discredit science disseminate false information spread confusion and promote doubt book states that seitz singer nierenberg and robert jastrow were all fiercely anti communist and they viewed government regulation as a step towards socialism and communism authors argue that with collapse of soviet union they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism they feared that an over reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy handed government intervention in marketplace and intrusion into people s lives oreskes and conway state that longer delay worse these problems get and more likely it is that governments will need to take draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear they say that seitz singer nierenberg and jastrow denied scientific evidence contributed to a strategy of delay and thereby helped to bring about situation they most dreaded authors have a strong doubt about ability of media to differentiate between false truth and actual science in question however they stop short of endorsing censorship in name of science journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped according to authors to amplify misleading messages of contrarians oreskes and conway state small numbers of people can have large negative impacts especially if they are organised determined and have access to power main conclusion of book is that there would have been more progress in policy making if not for influence of contrarian experts who tried for ideological reasons to undermine trust in science base for regulation similar conclusions were already drawn among others on frederick seitz and william nierenberg in book requiem for a species why we resist truth about climate change 2010 by australian academic clive hamilton reception most reviewers received merchants of doubt enthusiastically christian rohr die der wissenschaft das des leugnens in physik in unserer zeit 46 issue 2 2015 p 100 philip kitcher in science says that naomi oreskes and erik conway are two outstanding historians he calls merchants of doubt a fascinating and important study kitcher says that apparently harsh claims against nierenberg seitz and singer are justified through a powerful dissection of ways in which prominent climate scientists such as roger and ben santer were exploited or viciously attacked in press in christian science monitor will buchanan says that merchants of doubt is exhaustively researched and documented and may be one of most important books of 2010 oreskes and conway are seen to demonstrate that doubt merchants are not objective scientists as term is popularly understood instead they are science speaking mercenaries hired by corporations to process numbers to prove that corporations products are safe and useful buchanan says they are salesmen not scientists buchanan will june 22 2010 merchants of doubt how scientific misinformation campaigns sold untruths to consumers christian science monitor bud ward published a review of book in yale forum on climate and media he wrote that oreskes and conway use a combination of thorough scholarly research combined with writing reminiscent of best investigative journalism to unravel deep common links to past environmental and public health controversies ward bud july 8 2010 reviews leaving no doubt on tobacco acid rain climate change yale forum on climate and media in terms of climate science authors leave little doubt about their disdain for what they regard as misuse and abuse of science by a small cabal of scientists they see as largely lacking in requisite climate science expertise phil england writes in ecologist that strength of book is rigour of research and detailed focus on key incidents he said however that climate change chapter is only 50 pages long and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect jim hoggan s climate cover up george monbiot s heat how to stop planet burning and ross gelbspan s heat is on and boiling point england also said that there is little coverage about millions of dollars which exxon mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt england phil september 10 2010 merchants of doubt ecologist a review in economist calls this a powerful book which articulates politics involved and degree to which scientists have sometimes manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties but opines that authors fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors all guns blazing a question of dodgy science june 17 2010 economist robert n proctor who coined term to describe study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt wrote in american scientist that merchants of doubt is a detailed and artfully written book he set it in context of other books which cover history of manufactured ignorance proctor robert september october 2010 book review manufactured ignorance american scientist david michaels s doubt is their product 2008 chris mooney s republican war on science 2009 david rosner and gerald markowitz s deceit and denial 2002 and his own book cancer wars 1995 robin mckie in guardian states that oreskes and conway deserve considerable praise for exposing influence of a small group of cold war ideologues their tactic of spreading doubt has confused public about a series of key scientific issues such as global warming even though scientists have actually become more certain about their research results mckie says that merchants of doubt includes detailed notes on all sources used is carefully paced and is my runaway contender for best science book of year mckie robin august 8 2010 merchants of doubt by naomi oreskes and erik m conway guardian sociologist reiner grundmann s review in journal acknowledges that book is well researched and factually based but criticizes book as being written in a black and white manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy he says this shows a lack of basic understanding of political process and mechanisms of knowledge policy because authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of science while book provides all formal hallmarks of science grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book william o keefe and jeff from george c marshall institute which was founded by seitz say that although merchants of doubt has appearance of a scholarly work it discredits and undermines reputations of people who in their lifetime contributed greatly to american nation they say that it does this by questioning their integrity impugning their character and questioning their judgement authors thumb right naomi oreskes 2015 co author of merchants of doubt naomi oreskes is
