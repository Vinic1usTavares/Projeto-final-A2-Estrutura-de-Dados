triaenops menamena is a bat in genus triaenops found on madagascar mainly in drier regions it was known as triaenops rufus until 2009 when it was discovered that that name had been incorrectly applied to species triaenops rufus is a synonym of triaenops persicus a middle eastern species closely related to t menamena malagasy species had previously been placed as a subspecies of t persicus by some authors triaenops menamena is mostly found in forests but also occurs in other habitats it often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as butterflies and moths because of its wide range common occurrence and tolerance of habitat degradation it is not considered to be threatened with a forearm length of 50 to 56 mm 2 0 to 2 2 in in males and 46 to 53 mm 1 8 to 2 1 in in females this is a medium sized bat its fur color is variable ranging from reddish brown to gray but it is generally darker than species in closely related genus paratriaenops which also occur on madagascar skull contains a pronounced swelling around nose and second upper premolar is displaced outside toothrow maximum frequency of echolocation call averages 94 2 khz and species can easily be recognized on basis of its call taxonomy in 1881 alphonse milne edwards described two new species in genus triaenops on basis of specimens supposedly collected by leon humblot on madagascar reddish triaenops rufus and larger gray t humbloti milne edwards 1881 p 1035 jean dorst who reviewed madagascan triaenops in 1947 retained both as separate species in another review published in 1982 john edwards hill considered two to represent same species in 1994 karl koopman considered rufus itself to be part of middle eastern and mainland african species triaenops persicus a possibility hill had discussed goodman and ranivo 2009 p 47 benda and vallo 2009 table 1 but most authors regarded two as distinct species benda and vallo 2009 p 7 in 2006 julie ranivo and steven goodman revised madagascan triaenops and found little variation among specimens of t rufus from throughout dry parts of island ranivo and goodman 2007 pp 963 975 three years later they published another paper which showed that original material of t rufus and t humbloti was distinct from madagascan specimens identified as triaenops rufus and more similar to t persicus goodman and ranivo 2009 p 52 on his journey to madagascar humblot had stayed in somalia and yemen and goodman and ranivo concluded that he had probably collected triaenops there after which their provenance was incorrectly recorded goodman and ranivo 2009 pp 52 53 thus rufus and humbloti cannot be used for madagascan species and goodman and ranivo proposed new name triaenops menamena for species formerly known as t rufus specific name menamena is malagasy for reddish referring to animal s coloration goodman and ranivo 2009 p 54 rufous trident bat has been used as a common name for triaenops rufus triaenops menamena is currently one of four living species in genus triaenops a 2009 revision by petr benda and peter vallo split off african t afer and yemeni t parvus from t persicus and removed three other species including two from madagascar to separate genus paratriaenops benda and vallo 2009 p 34 an extinct species triaenops goodmani is known from northwestern madagascar in 2007 and 2008 amy russell and colleagues used phylogenetic and coalescent methodologies to investigate history of triaenops group they found that t menamena as t rufus was closest to mainland african triaenops but did not study middle eastern bats and concluded that t menamena and species of paratriaenops then still placed in triaenops independently reached madagascar from africa colonization of island by t menamena was dated to about 660 000 years ago russell et al 2007 p 839 2008 p 995 benda and vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in triaenops and included middle eastern t persicus and t parvus in their analysis they found little resolution of relationships within triaenops but some evidence suggested that t menamena is more closely related to middle eastern species than to t afer in mainland africa therefore t menamena may have reached madagascar from middle east or northeastern africa they also placed split between t menamena and other species much further back at around 4 million years ago benda and vallo 2009 pp

triaenops goodmani which is known only from three mandibles lower jaws is also larger samonds 2007 p 46 in shaped a group of fleshy structures around nose and mouth t menamena has trident structure characteristic of triaenops and paratriaenops three adjacent lancets projecting structures on posterior leaf in t menamena two outer lancets are shorter than middle one and curved whereas three lancets are more equal in paratriaenops goodman and ranivo 2008 p 686 anterior leaf contains a broad flat horizontal process and intermediate leaf contains a pointed process yoshiyuki 1995 p 120 ears are small and 1995 p 119 and contain notches on inner side peterson et al 1995 p 82 fur is silky and hairs on body are about 5 to 6 mm long wing membrane is dark and translucent and end of tail

paratriaenops but premaxilla is longer rostrum front part of skull is well developed and contains a pronounced nasal swelling which is less pronounced than in paratriaenops depression behind swelling is relatively shallow compared to other species of triaenops rostrum is relatively narrow and short similar to t parvus t afer and t persicus have a broader rostrum benda and vallo 2010 p 29 front margin of rostrum is cast back between left and right corners a transverse line passes over roof of rostrum ranivo and goodman 2006 p 971 infraorbital foramen an opening in skull is oblong in shape zygomatic arches cheekbones are not broadened towards sides are connected to by broad bones and contain clear crests on their upper sides in t menamena these crests are rectangular in form and larger

identified from recordings of its echolocation call kofoky et al 2007 p 1042 call consists of a component with constant frequency followed by a short one with changing frequency call takes 6 5 to 13 5 ms averaging 10 1 ms and period between two calls is 22 7 to 86 3 ms averaging 42 7 ms maximum frequency averages 94 2 khz minimum frequency averages 82 0 khz and call emits most energy at a frequency of 93 2 khz kofoky et al 2009 table 1 p 380 fig 4a distribution and ecology triaenops menamena mainly occurs in dry regions of western madagascar but has also been recorded in humid areas in far southeast and northeast and is found up to 1300 m 4300 ft above sea level it mainly occurs in forests kofoky et al 2007 p 1049 but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it an obligate cave dweller racey et al 2010 p 392 it is known to roost in large colonies with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40 000 bats this cave also contained an estimated 10 000 paratriaenops furculus olsson et al 2006 p 402 kofoky et al 2007 p 1047 effective population size of species is estimated to be about 121 000 russell et al 2008 p 998 lepidoptera butterflies and moths form main component of its diet but it also eats coleoptera beetles and hemiptera bugs and fewer members of some other insect orders rakotoarivelo et al 2007 table 2 it is unclear how ecological niches of triaenops and less frequently captured paratriaenops furculus are separated as both eat lepidopterans and occur in same regions rakotoarivelo et al 2007 p 964 conservation status under triaenops rufus iucn red list lists this species as being of least concern citing its common occurrence over a wide distribution and tolerance of human modifications of its habitat even though its forest habitat is being destroyed in places it has been recorded in numerous protected areas andriafidison et al 2008 bats mainly large hipposideros are sometimes hunted for food in southwestern
