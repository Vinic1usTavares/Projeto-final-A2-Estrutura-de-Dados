mesozoic structures are visible in papuk and other slavonian mountains processes also led to formation of a stratovolcanic chain in basin 17 12 mya million years ago and intensified subsidence observed until 5 mya as well as flood basalts about 7 5 mya contemporary uplift of carpathian mountains prevented water flowing to black sea and pannonian sea formed in basin sediments were transported to basin from uplifting carpathian and dinaric mountains with particularly deep fluvial sediments being deposited in pleistocene during uplift of transdanubian mountains ultimately up to

central parts of depressions formed by subduction around in slavonia syrmia depression in sava depression and nearly in drava depression with deepest sediment found between virovitica and slatina results of those processes are large plains in eastern slavonia baranya and syrmia as well as in river valleys especially along sava drava and kupa plains are interspersed by horst and graben
