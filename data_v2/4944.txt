year old claron formation exposed geology of bryce canyon area in utah shows a record of deposition that covers last part of cretaceous period and first half of cenozoic era in that part of north america ancient depositional environment of region around what is now bryce canyon national park varied from warm shallow sea called cretaceous seaway in which dakota sandstone and tropic shale were deposited to cool streams and lakes that contributed sediment to colorful claron formation that dominates park s amphitheaters other formations were also formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from laramide orogeny which started around 70 million years ago mya this event created rocky mountains far to east and helped to close sea that covered area a large part of western north america started to stretch itself into nearby basin and range topography around 15 mya while not part of this region greater bryce area was stretched into high plateaus by same forces uplift of colorado plateaus and opening of gulf of california by 5 mya changed drainage of colorado river and its tributaries including paria river which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to park uplift caused formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form free standing pinnacles called hoodoos badlands and monoliths we see today formations exposed in area of park

cretaceous seaway advance in cretaceous a shallow seaway spread into interior of north america from gulf of mexico in south into utah and later to arctic ocean in far north davis and pollock 2003 geology of bryce canyon national park page 45 geologists call this shallow sea cretaceous seaway or western interior seaway seaway divided north america into two halves an eastern portion dominated by already ancient appalachian mountains and a western part composed primarily of still growing sevier mountains formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by sevier orogeny davis and pollock 2003 geology of bryce canyon national park page 55 as shoreline moved back and forth bryce area alternated from being part of sevier landmass to being under cretaceous seaway alternating layers of intertidal and marine sediments lay on top of each other as a result conglomerate siltstone and fossil rich sandstone that together are up to thick mark arrival of cretaceous seaway called dakota sandstone it is oldest formation exposed in bryce canyon area but youngest one exposed in zion and kolob canyons area to southwest abundant amounts of petrified wood oyster beds containing millions of fossils and coal are all found in dakota in bryce canyon area this formation can be seen in paria valley where it is found as a lithified blanket sand that probably accumulated on beaches in lagoons and vast coal producing swamps as cretaceous seaway transgressed advanced inland over region and later retreated harris ann 1997 geology of national parks page 51 it sits unconformably on much older jurassic formations that are not exposed in immediate area see geology of zion and kolob canyons area for a discussion about these older sediments mud and silt were deposited on top of dakota formation as seaway became deeper and calmer in area resulting dark gray to black tropic shale records maximum transgression of seaway into utah and is thick in paria amphitheater it forms unvegetated badlands seen in tropic valley and is perhaps most fossil rich formation in area containing numerous straight shelled and coiled ammonites retreat cretaceous seaway was already retreating east and to south by time locally thick straight cliffs formation was deposited davis and pollock 2003 geology of bryce canyon national park page 46 its members represent various stages in this process cliff forming sandstone of canyon member was deposited on top of tropic shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments shale and sandstone from smoky hollow member were deposited on top of its basal layer of coal rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on shore of seaway while alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of john henry member were laid down in swamps lagoons and fluvial environments one member drip tank is not found in bryce canyon area this formation erodes into almost cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone shark teeth are found in lower parts of formation lakes and east flowing rivers became dominant resting place for sediment following retreat of cretaceous seaway shales and sandstones of locally thick formation were deposited in moving water fluvial setting this formation is part of grey cliffs of grand staircase mentioned previously it contains abundant fossils of vertebrates including dinosaurs such as hadrosaurs continental deposition flood plains uplift and erode alt tall pink colored rock formations thumb hoodoos in claron formation bryce canyon a flood plain crossed by rivers and lakes developed in area mud and sand accumulated in this setting to become gray sandstones and mudstones of kaiparowits formation this formation is up to thick in bryce canyon area but other parts of kaiparowits in region are several hundreds of feet tens of meters thick two formations canaan peak and pine hollow sit on top of kaiparowits elsewhere in region but are absent in bryce canyon area sandstones and conglomerates of these formations record stream and river deposition starting in paleocene epoch uplift caused by a mountain building episode called laramide orogeny lasted from late cretaceous around 70 mya to early paleocene this hoisted once lower uplands skyward while low lying basins between them gradually subsided harris ann 1997 geology of national parks page 52 compression from laramide event deformed land in area to form up to 5deg dipping bryce canyon anticline all of canaan peak pine hollow kaiparowits and formations along with part of underlying straight cliffs were removed from anticline s crest by erosion before claron formation was deposited davis and pollock 2003 geology of bryce canyon national park page 53 an angular unconformity therefore exists along anticline s crest park also sits on western gently dipping flank of much larger kaibab uplift which was also formed as a result of laramide claron flood plain and lake system uplift from laramide paused briefly in eocene meandering streams flowed slowly over resulting broad and almost featureless plains periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1 000 years spreading mud cobbles and fine silt over plains erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant oxidation of iron in mud and silt turned soil into hematite giving it a pink and red hue these sediments were later lithified into up to thick pink member of locally eocene aged claron formation previously called wasatch formation channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in red canyon along state route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of park s fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos geologist clarence dutton called iron oxide rich lower member of claron pink cliffs series due to its colorful appearance frame right alt brown map with a large lake on it claron lake system a large system of shallow but expansive lakes and associated deltas covered several thousand square miles of what is now northwest colorado and southwest utah and wyoming these lakes existed from paleocene to mid oligocene but did not spread to bryce canyon area until eocene time large quantities of sediments were laid down in this system during 20 million years of its existence from about 60 to 40 mya kiver and harris 1999 geology of u s parklands page 525 climate change and cycles caused lakes in system to expand and shrink through time as they did so they left beds of differing thickness and composition stacked atop one another various sand and cobble deposits near shore calcium poor muds further from shore calcium rich mud in deeper water and pure limey oozes were deposited in deepest waters limey oozes and mud were later lithified into limestone and interbedded siltstone of up to 300 foot 90 m thick white member of claron this member erodes into white colored monoliths that are found only at highest elevations of paunsaugunt plateau fossils are rare in white member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams indicating that lakes supported little life most arches and natural bridges in park including famous natural bridge were carved from sandstone beds in claron marysvale volcanics a gap in geologic record following deposition of claron formation was interrupted 34 to 31 mya by eruptions from nearby marysvale volcanic field which is located northwest of park volcanic ash and lava from these flows are found less than from bryce canyon but at least some volcanic material was likely deposited directly in park area only to be later removed by erosion most of activity at marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals 34 22 mya 22 14 mya and 9 5 mya dacites and andesites were erupted above an evolving batholith in first interval crystal rich ash from 27 million year old myo three creeks caldera 24 myo big john caldera and 23 myo monroe peak caldera hardened into tuff second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites alkali rich rhyolite erupted in second interval from 19 myo mount belknap caldera marysvale volcanic field collapsed under its own weight around 20 mya likely due to weaknesses in evaporites of carmel formation some below folding and faulting of claron formation from collapse created ruby s inn thrust a slight running east west and perpendicular to thrust motion called bryce syncline was also created volcanic activity in marysvale and bryce area ceased some 500 000 years ago basaltic rocks of same age can be seen along sevier fault near entrance to red canyon dark colored volcanic rocks have been displaced by fault some and are now in direct contact with much older claron formation kiver and harris 1999 geology of u s parklands page 526 late cenozoic tectonics formation of high plateaus alt raised map frame right colorado plateaus map younger rock units were laid down but were mostly removed by subsequent uplift accelerated erosion outcrops of these formations can be found in northern part of park and in a few places on plateau rim among these are thick oligocene or miocene aged boat mesa conglomerate and pliocene to early pleistocene aged sevier river formation harris ann 1997 geology of national parks page 53 boat mesa is made mostly of conglomerates with minor amounts of sandstone and some limestone from lakes representing stream and flood deposits brownish gray sandstone and gravels of sevier river formation were laid down in valleys that were part of ancestral sevier river drainage system around 15 mya in miocene time tensional forces in nevada to west were so great that crust was spread thin creating basin and range province these same forces segmented what is now western part of colorado plateau into nine different smaller plateaus including paunsaugunt that park sits astride harris ann 1997 geology of national parks page and harris 1999 geology of u s parklands page 524 long north south trending normal faults were either newly created or reactivated from older pre existing faults a plateau rose on one side of each fault while valleys subsided on other as crust was extended in an east west direction two of these faults bound paunsaugunt plateau sevier on west and paunsaugunt on east movement along these two faults has displaced claron formation by 2 000 feet 600 m relative to paria and sevier valleys hurricane fault marks west edge of markagunt plateau and is topographic boundary between basin and range and colorado plateaus provinces cedar breaks national monument which shares almost same exposed geology and erosional features as bryce canyon national park sits on west edge of markagunt entire colorado plateau then started to uplift from near sea level to several thousand feet over a kilometer in elevation an alternate theory is that laramide orogeny uplifted what is today basin and range and colorado plateau and that tensional forces that formed basin and range caused that region to subside relative to colorado plateau whatever order of events were high plateaus region of colorado plateau were by now nearly complete modern drainage and erosion drainage of colorado plateau was significantly altered by opening of gulf of california rifting tore baja california peninsula northwestward from mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5 mya ancestral colorado river responded to regional by taking a shortcut to sea by flowing into new gulf this significantly decreased distance from river s headwaters and its delta at sea water in colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper creating topography formation of approximately current depth of colorado river s grand canyon by 1 2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper kiver and harris 1999 geology of u s parklands page 407 headward erosion of one of those tributaries paria river eroded north northwestward toward what is now paria amphitheater davis and pollock 2003 geology of bryce canyon national park page 56 river took a route roughly parallel to and east of paunsaugunt fault erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on east facing rim of paunsaugunt plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create hoodoos streams on plateau do not contribute to formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from rim erosion continues in this fashion today hoodoo formation in bryce canyon right alt sequence showing progressively eroded rocks hoodoo formation pink member of claron formation is largely composed of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone when rain combines with carbon dioxide it forms a weak solution of carbonic acid this acid helps to slowly dissolve limestone in claron formation grain by grain it is this process of chemical weathering that rounds edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles in winter melting snow seeps into cracks and joints and freezes at night force of expanding ice helps to erode rock of claron formation over 200 of these freeze thaw cycles occur each year in bryce canyon adapted public domain text frost wedging exploits and widens nearly vertical joint planes that divide pink member of claron formation internal layers of mudstone conglomerate and siltstone interrupt limestone horizontally these layers are more resistant to attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective of fins windows and hoodoos many of more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium rich limestone called dolomite dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate and consequently protects weaker limestone underneath however same processes that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them in case of bryce canyon hoodoos rate of erosion is 2 4 feet 0 6 1 3 m every 100 years as canyon continues to erode to west it will eventually capture in perhaps 3 million years watershed of east fork of sevier river once this river flows through bryce amphitheater it will dominate erosional pattern replacing hoodoos with a v shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers a foreshadowing of this can be observed in water canyon while hiking mossy cave trail a diversion canal has been taking a portion of east fork of sevier river through this section of park for over 100 years notes references further reading
