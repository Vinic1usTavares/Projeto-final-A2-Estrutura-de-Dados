survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of character as game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience although combat can be part of gameplay player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition health speed and vision or through various obstructions of player s interaction with game mechanics player is also challenged to find items that unlock path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in game games make use of strong horror themes like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies term survival horror was first used for original japanese release of resident evil in 1996 which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989 s sweet home and 1992 s alone in dark name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles starting with release of resident evil 4 in 2005 genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third person shooter games this has led game journalists to question whether long standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as action horror definition thumb resident evil 1996 named and defined survival horror genre survival horror refers to a subgenre of action adventure video games player character is vulnerable and under armed which puts emphasis on puzzle solving and evasion rather than player taking an offensive strategy games commonly challenge player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition another major theme throughout genre is that of isolation typically these games contain relatively few non player characters and as a result frequently tell much of their story second hand through usage of journals texts or audio logs while many action games feature lone protagonists versus swarms of enemies in a suspenseful environment survival horror games are distinct from otherwise horror themed action games they tend to de emphasize combat in favor of challenges such as hiding or running from enemies and solving puzzles still it is not unusual for survival horror games to draw upon elements from first person shooters action adventure games or even role playing games according to ign survival horror is different from typical game genres in that it is not defined strictly by specific mechanics but subject matter tone pacing and design philosophy game design de emphasized combat survival horror games are a subgenre of horror games where player is unable to fully prepare or arm their avatar player usually encounters several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option such as a limited number of weapons or invulnerable enemies if weapons are available their ammunition is sparser than in other games and powerful weapons such as rocket launchers are rare if even available at all thus players are more vulnerable than in action games and hostility of environment sets up a narrative where odds are weighed decisively against avatar this shifts gameplay away from direct combat and players must learn to evade enemies or turn environment against them games try to enhance experience of vulnerability by making game single player rather than multiplayer and by giving player an avatar who is more frail than typical action game hero survival horror genre is also known for other non combat challenges such as solving puzzles at certain locations in game world and collecting and managing an inventory of items areas of game world will be off limits until player gains certain items occasionally levels are designed with alternative routes levels also challenge players with mazelike environments which test player s navigational skills levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility to challenge player and provide suspense although games in genre also make use of enormous spatial environments enemy design a survival horror storyline usually involves investigation and confrontation of horrific forces and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges early releases used camera angles seen in horror films which allowed enemies to lurk in areas that are concealed from player s view also many survival horror games make use of off screen sound or other warning cues to notify player of impending danger this feedback assists player but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty games typically feature a variety of monsters with unique behavior patterns enemies can appear unexpectedly or suddenly and levels are often designed with scripted sequences where enemies drop from ceiling or crash through windows survival horror games like many action adventure games are structured around boss encounter where player must confront a formidable opponent in order to advance to next area these boss encounters draw elements from antagonists seen in classic horror stories and defeating boss will advance story of game history origins 1980s 1996 origins of survival horror game can be traced back to earlier horror fiction archetypes have been linked to books of h p lovecraft which include investigative narratives or journeys through depths comparisons have been made between lovecraft s great old ones and boss encounters seen in many survival horror games themes of survival have also been traced to slasher film subgenre where protagonist endures a confrontation with ultimate antagonist another major influence on genre is japanese horror including classical noh theatre books of edogawa and japanese cinema survival horror genre largely draws from both western mainly american and asian mainly japanese traditions with western approach to horror generally favoring action oriented visceral horror while japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror nostromo was a survival horror game developed by akira takiguchi a tokyo university student and taito contractor for pet 2001 it was ported to pc 6001 by also known as hiromi ohba later joined game arts and published by ascii in 1981 exclusively for japan inspired by 1980 stealth game shoujo and 1979 sci fi horror film alien gameplay of nostromo involved a player attempting to escape a spaceship while avoiding sight of an invisible alien which only becomes visible when appearing in front of player gameplay also involved limited resources where player needs to collect certain items in order to escape ship and if certain required items are not available in warehouse player is unable to escape and eventually has no choice but be killed getting caught by alien another early example is 1982 atari 2600 game haunted house gameplay is typical of future survival horror titles as it emphasizes puzzle solving and evasive action rather than violence game uses creatures commonly featured in horror fiction such as bats and ghosts each of which has unique behaviors gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management along with areas that are inaccessible until appropriate item is found because it has

and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it golden age 1996 2004 success of resident evil in 1996 was responsible for its template being used as basis for a wave of successful survival horror games many of which were referred to as resident evil clones golden age of survival horror started by resident evil reached its peak around turn of millennium with silent hill followed by a general decline a few years later among resident evil clones at time there were several survival horror titles that stood out such as clock tower 1996 and clock tower ii

resident evils pre rendered graphics silent hill in particular was praised for moving away from b movie horror elements to psychological style seen in art house or japanese horror films due to game s emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror game also featured stealth elements making use of fog to dodge enemies or turning off flashlight to avoid detection original silent hill is considered one of scariest games of all time and strong narrative from silent hill 2 in 2001 has made silent hill series one of most influential in genre according to ign golden age of survival horror came to a crescendo with release of silent hill also in 1999 capcom released original dino crisis which was noted for incorporating certain elements from survival horror games it was followed

series has since gained a reputation as one of most distinctive in genre with first game in series credited as one of best written survival horror games ever made by ugo networks meanwhile capcom incorporated shooter elements into several survival horror titles such as 2000 s resident evil survivor which used both light gun shooter and first person shooter elements and 2003 s resident evil dead aim which used light gun and third person shooter elements western developers began to return to survival horror formula thing from 2002 has been called a survival horror game although it is distinct from other titles in genre due to its emphasis on action and challenge of holding a team together 2004 title doom 3 is sometimes categorized as survival horror although it is considered an americanized take on genre due to player s ability to directly confront monsters with weaponry thus it is usually considered a first person shooter with survival horror elements regardless genre s increased popularity led western developers to incorporate horror elements into action games rather than follow japanese survival style overall traditional survival horror genre continued to be dominated by japanese designers and aesthetics 2002 s clock tower 3 eschewed graphic adventure game formula seen in original clock tower and embraced full 3d survival horror gameplay in 2003 resident evil outbreak introduced a new gameplay element to genre online multiplayer and cooperative gameplay sony employed silent hill director toyama to develop siren game was released in 2004 and added unprecedented challenge to genre by making player mostly defenseless thus making it vital to learn enemy s patrol routes and hide from them however reviewers eventually criticized traditional japanese survival horror formula for becoming stagnant as console market drifted towards western style action games players became impatient with limited resources and cumbersome controls seen in japanese titles such as resident evil code veronica and silent hill 4 room transformation 2005 present thumb in recent years developers have combined traditional survival horror gameplay with other concepts left 4 dead 2008 fused survival horror with cooperative multiplayer and action in 2005 resident evil 4 attempted to redefine genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming broadening gameplay with elements from wider action genre its ambitions paid off earning title several game of year awards for 2005 and top rank on ign s readers picks top 99 games list however this also led some reviewers to suggest that resident evil series had abandoned survival horror genre by demolishing genre conventions that it had established other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action such as silent hill homecoming and 2008 version of alone in dark these changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay these changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that genre has deteriorated into conventions of other action games jim sterling suggests that genre lost its core gameplay when it improved combat interface thus shifting gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat leigh alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more western horror aesthetics which emphasize action and gore rather than psychological experience of japanese horror original genre has persisted in one form or another 2005 release of f e a r was praised for both its atmospheric tension and fast action successfully combining japanese horror with cinematic action while dead space from 2008 brought survival horror to a science fiction setting however critics argue that these titles represent continuing trend away from pure survival horror and towards general action release of left 4 dead in 2008 helped popularize cooperative multiplayer among survival horror games although it is mostly a first person shooter at its core meanwhile fatal frame series has remained true to roots of genre even as fatal frame iv transitioned from use of fixed cameras to an over shoulder viewpoint also in 2009 silent hill made a transition to an over shoulder viewpoint in silent hill shattered memories this wii effort was however considered by most reviewers as a return to form for series due to several developmental decisions taken by climax studios this included decision to openly break fourth wall by psychologically profiling player and decision to remove any weapons from game forcing player to run whenever they see an enemy examples of independent survival horror games are penumbra series and amnesia dark descent by frictional games nightfall escape by cry of fear by team and slender eight pages all of which were praised for creating a horrific setting and atmosphere without overuse of violence or gore in 2010 cult game deadly premonition by access games
