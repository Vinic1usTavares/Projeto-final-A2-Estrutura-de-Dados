done well and that ultimately game looks solid and creates atmosphere of a giant dark and tangible world he enjoyed characters varied fleshed out demeanour and good voice acting combat also appealed to wigmore who called it fun chris couper said in his pc review that nomad soul was by leaps bounds and great units of measurement his favorite game of 1999 he regarded story as fascinating graphics as amazing and soundtrack as breathtaking most innovative part of game according to couper was that it allowed player to reincarnate into other characters bodies eurogamer was impressed with omikron s atmospheric futuristic cityscape thinking well of general story game revolution declared nomad soul first game to approach total immersion thus calling it best single player gaming experience of 1999 game revolution termed story deeply engaging ability to solve individual problems through multiple paths refreshing graphical effects simply gorgeous character models striking and sound effects and voice acting generally excellent in game movie sequences were similarly praised like couper game revolution liked musical score dubbing it atmospheric gamepro evaluating it on dreamcast was pleased with setting and music having played pc version gamepros nash werner observed that at its best game was a fresh approach to a neglected adventure gaming genre he likened graphics to blade runner and tim burton s art style deemed score to be incredible and key to atmosphere and considered gameplay smooth ryan mac donald writing dreamcast review for gamespot found story good enough to maintain player s interest throughout he saw controls as adequate and agreed that game boasted impressive graphics as well as a wonderful soundtrack greg kasavin s pc review also for gamespot admired character models their realistic portrayal of emotion and voice acting kasavin additionally liked graphics engine for its high quality rendering of enemies weapon effects and architecture in first person view igns jeremy dunham reviewed dreamcast version which he noted as a unique experience saying graphics looked better than on pc he praised soundtrack calling it like something out of a modern day cyber punk flick he also echoed couper s view that reincarnation mechanic was one game s most innovative features vincent lopez s pc review at ign lauded fun but simple first person mode preferring unarmed combat for its combos and animation what impressed him most was adult manner in which he felt story was handled he too saw graphics as incredible soundtrack was similarly commended greg vederman of pc gamer thought gameplay was fun especially third person exploration conversely wigmore noted that some details were a tad rough while also faulting low colour palette he blamed character s lack of agility on sluggish controls and deducted game for its lengthy loading times eurogamer criticised uniformity of npcs vehicles and artificial intelligence like wigmore eurogamer disliked controls which were found to worsen first person sequences also subject to reproval were save game system pretentious silliness in narrative reincarnation mechanic substandard graphics and blocky and often poorly animated character models despite lauding story game revolution admitted it was a little cliched while also decrying armed and unarmed combat as noticeably low on flash compared to other games gamepro disparaged execution of game modes agreeing with others on universally awkward controls loading hiccups were also disapproved of werner stated that at its worst nomad soul was your typical puzzle hunt with non player characters that can often be annoying he thought models were blocky and their textures murky or blurry donald noted that quantic dream s incorporation of various styles was a failure and became disillusioned with promise of an immersive world judging it instead as little more than a polygonal prop action sequences were criticised for their repetitiveness kasavin took same view as donald on implementation of multiple gameplay styles calling them ineffective he questioned originality of world considered character animations stilted and unrealistic dismissed unarmed combat as silly compared to other fighting games and diverged from others on soundtrack saying it lacked variety dunham wrote that nomad soul was best described as messiah and illegitimate child disregarding dreamcast version as an obviously rushed port though initially impressed with reincarnation mechanic he grew tired of it near end lopez mentioned frame rate as one serious problem he encountered especially in first person mode vederman stated that first person and side on segments looked and played rather poorly suggesting game would have benefited from their removal sequel by january 2000 a sequel was in early stages of development then scheduled to be released by 2001 it went under titles nomad soul exodus and omikron 2 karma and was planned for microsoft windows playstation 3 and xbox
