march 13 2003 it was followed by final fantasy x 2 making it first final fantasy game to have a direct game sequel gameplay like previous games in series final fantasy x is presented in a third person perspective with players directly navigating main character tidus around world to interact with objects and people unlike previous games however world and town maps have been fully integrated with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale as tidus explores world he randomly encounters enemies when an enemy is encountered environment switches to a turn based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack gameplay of final fantasy x differs from that of previous final fantasy games in its lack of a top down perspective world map earlier games featured a miniature representation of expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations used for long distance traveling in final fantasy x almost all locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map regional connections are mostly linear forming a single path through game s locations though an airship becomes available late in game giving player ability to navigate spira faster like previous games in series final fantasy x features numerous minigames most notably fictional underwater sport blitzball combat thumb left a boss battle using a heads up display to illustrate battle information final fantasy x introduces conditional turn based battle system in place of series traditional active time battle system first used in final fantasy iv whereas atb concept features real time elements ctb system is a turn based format that pauses battle during each of player s turns thus ctb design allows player to select an action without time pressure a graphical timeline along upper right side of screen details who will be receiving turns next and how various actions taken will affect subsequent order of turns ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells items and abilities that inflict status effects upon controlled characters or enemies player can control up to three characters in battle though a swapping system allows player to replace them with a character outside active party at any time limit breaks highly damaging special attacks reappear in final fantasy x as overdrives in this new incarnation of feature most of techniques are interactive requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness while initially overdrives can be used when character receives a significant amount of damage player is able to modify requirements to unlock them final fantasy x introduces an overhaul of summoning system employed in previous games of series whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive perform one action and then depart aeons of final fantasy x arrive and entirely replace battle party fighting in their place until either aeon wins battle is defeated itself or is dismissed by player aeons have their own statistics commands special attacks spells and overdrives player acquires five aeons over course of game through completion of cloister of trials puzzles but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side quests sphere grid as with previous titles in series players have opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items though traditional experience point system is replaced by a new system called sphere grid instead of characters gaining pre determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after leveling up each character gains sphere levels after collecting enough ability points ap sphere levels allow players to move around sphere grid a pre determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses spheres are applied to these nodes unlocking its function for selected character sphere grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles such as turning white mage roled yuna into a healer and swordsman auron into a physical powerhouse international and pal versions of game include an optional expert version of sphere grid in these versions all of characters start in middle of grid and may follow whichever path player chooses as a trade off expert grid has fewer nodes in total thus decreasing total statistic upgrades available during game blitzball blitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics underwater sport is played in a large hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers player controls one character at a time as they swim through sphere performing passes tackles and attempts to score gameplay is similar to that of main game in way that controlled character moves through area until they encounter an enemy in this case enemy is a member of opposing team status effects are also implemented in minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in main game blitzball is first introduced in beginning of game during one of early cinematic sequences in which tidus main character who is described as a star blitzball player is part of an intense game it is only minigame that plays a role in overall plot line as it is not only a main part of tidus s character but it s also in first scene where game s main antagonist sin is shown unlike with other minigames playing blitzball is mandatory near beginning of game but it is later optional plot setting and characters final fantasy x is set in fictional world of spira consisting of one large landmass divided into three surrounded by small tropical islands it features diverse climates ranging from tropical besaid and kilika islands to temperate mi ihen region to frigid macalania and mt gagazet areas although predominantly populated by humans spira features a variety of races among them are al bhed a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub group of humans with distinctive

s sentient races are unsent strong willed spirits of dead that remain in corporeal form in spira dead who are not sent to farplane by a summoner come to envy living and transform into fiends monsters that are encountered throughout game however unsent with strong attachments to world of living may retain their human form other fauna in spira aside from those drawn from real animals such as cats dogs birds and butterflies include gigantic amphibious which are similar to elephants and emu like chocobo which appears in most final fantasy games spira is very different from mainly european style worlds found in previous final fantasy games being much more closely modeled on southeast asia most notably with respect to vegetation topography architecture and names there are seven main playable characters in final fantasy x starting with tidus a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from zanarkand who seeks a way home after an encounter with sin transported him to spira to do so he joins yuna a summoner on a journey to obtain final aeon and defeat enormous whale like sin journeying with them are kimahri ronso a young warrior of ronso tribe who watched over yuna during her

yuna group heads toward ruins of zanarkand seen in introduction of game shortly before arriving tidus learns that he jecht and zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on original zanarkand and its people long ago original zanarkand battled bevelle in a machina war in which former was defeated zanarkand s survivors became fayth so that they could use their memories of zanarkand to create a new city in their image removed from reality of spira one thousand years after its creation fayth have become exhausted sustaining dream zanarkand but are unable to stop due to sin s influence once they reach zanarkand yunalesca first summoner to defeat sin and unsent ever since tells group that final aeon is created from fayth of one close to summoner after defeating sin final aeon kills summoner and transforms into a new sin which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue yuna decides against using final aeon due to futile sacrifices it carries and fact that sin

and tidus disappear now that freed fayth stopped summoning afterward in a speech to citizens of spira yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of sin in a post credits scene tidus awakens under water he then swims towards ocean surface and screen fades to white development final fantasy xs development began in 1999 costing approximately y 4 billion approximately us million in dollars with a crew of over 100 people most of whom worked on previous games in series executive producer hironobu sakaguchi has stated that although he had concerns about transition from 2d to 3d backgrounds voice acting and transition to real time story telling success of final fantasy series can be attributed to constantly challenging development team to try new things producer yoshinori kitase was also chief director of final fantasy x while direction of events maps and battles was split up between motomu toriyama takayoshi nakazato and toshiro tsuchida respectively development of script for game took three to four months with same amount of time dedicated to voice recording afterwards kazushige nojima collaborated with daisuke watanabe toriyama and kitase on writing scenario for final fantasy x nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in relationship between player and main character thus he penned story such that player s progress through world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in tidus own understanding and narration influences thumb development team was interested in giving game a tropical flair basing game s setting spira on locations like okinawa in southern japan character designer tetsuya nomura has identified south pacific thailand and japan as major influences on cultural and geographic design of spira particularly concerning geographic location of southern besaid and kilika islands he has also said that spira deviates from worlds of past final fantasy games in level of detail incorporated something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during design process kitase felt that if setting went back to a medieval european fantasy it would not seem to help development team advance while he was thinking of different world environments nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated asian elements sub character chief designer fumi nakashima s focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub groups for example she has said that masks and goggles of al bhed give group a strange and eccentric appearance while attire of ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle tidus relationship with his father jecht was based stories throughout ages such as ancient greek legends this would eventually reveal key of sin s weakness and eventual defeat design left thumb final fantasy x used motion capture similar to this image for character animations final fantasy x features innovations in rendering of characters facial expressions achieved through motion capture and skeletal animation technology this technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements which were then programmed to match speech of game s voice actors nojima has revealed that inclusion of voice acting enabled him to express emotion more powerfully than before and he was therefore able to keep storyline simple he also said that presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to script in order to match voice actors personalities with characters they were portraying inclusion of voice however led to difficulties with game s cutscenes already programmed around japanese voice work english localization team faced difficulty of establishing english oriented dialogue and obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with rhythm and timing of characters lip movements localization specialist alexander o smith noted that they had to keep localized sound file within duration of original japanese as longer files would cause game to crash he described process of fitting natural sounding english speech into game as something akin to writing four or five movies worth of dialogue entirely in haiku form and of course actors had to act and act well within those restraints game was initially going to feature online elements offered through square s playonline service features however were dropped during production and online gaming would not become part of final fantasy series until final fantasy xi map director nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of traditional final fantasy game in line with realism of game s 3d backgrounds as opposed to pre rendered backgrounds as a player of games in final fantasy series battle director tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining which eventually led to removal of active time battle system and instead incorporated strategy focused conditional turn based battle system originally final fantasy x was going to feature wandering enemies visible on field map seamless transitions into battles and option for players to move around landscape during enemy encounters battle art director shintaro takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in final fantasy x come across as a natural part of story and not an independent element however due to hardware limitations this idea was not used instead a compromise was made whereby some transitions from field map to battle map were made relatively seamless with implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen at end of an event scene desire for seamless transitions also led to implementation of new summoning system seen in game kitase has explained that purpose behind sphere grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters attributes such that they will be able to observe development of those attributes firsthand developers experienced difficulty with scene of tidus and yuna kissing as they were not used to animating romance scenes visual works director kazuyuki stated that this was due to use of 3d models in scene because of negative response from female members of staff scene was remade multiple times music final fantasy x marks first time regular series composer nobuo uematsu has had any assistance in composing score for a game in main series his fellow composers for final fantasy x were masashi hamauzu and junya nakano they were chosen for soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from uematsu s style while still being able to work together playonline com first revealed that game s theme song was completed in november 2000 as square still had not revealed who would sing song gamespot personally asked uematsu who jokingly answered it s going to be rod stewart game features three songs with vocalized elements including j pop ballad suteki da ne which translates to isn t it wonderful lyrics were written by kazushige nojima and music was written by uematsu song is performed by japanese folk singer rikki whom music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an okinawan atmosphere suteki da ne is also sung in japanese in english version of final fantasy x like eyes on me from final fantasy viii and melodies of life from final fantasy ix an orchestrated version of suteki da ne is used as part of ending theme other songs with lyrics are
