right thumb 200px a typical dab digital radio receiver with digital radio development bureau dab digital radio marketing logo in united kingdom roll out of digital radio is proceeding since engineering test transmissions were started by bbc in 1990 followed by a public launch in september 1995 uk currently has world s biggest digital radio network with 103 transmitters three national dab ensembles and 48 local and regional dab ensembles broadcasting over 250 commercial and 34 bbc radio stations across uk in capital london there are already more than 64 different digital stations available in addition to dab and dab radio stations are also broadcast on digital television platform as well as internet radio in uk digital radio ensemble operators and stations need a broadcasting licence from uk s media regulator ofcom to broadcast in long term there will be a switchover from analogue to digital radio when am and fm services will cease government has set criteria on coverage and proportion of digital listening before this occurs in 2018 criteria of over 50 of digital radio listening was met which will now require uk government to review digital radio in view of a potential switchover in same year bbc stated it would keep some fm radio for foreseeable future digital radio in united kingdom is being promoted by radio stations and broadcasting industry on premise that it provides superior quality sound over am a wider choice of radio stations is easier to use and is resistant to interference which other broadcast media are susceptible to on other hand critics say that coverage is not yet sufficient and quality can be less than that of fm in uk 50 9 of all radio listening hours by first quarter of 2018 were through digital platforms with dab making up for majority of digital radio listening 72 3 and 63 7 of uk households claim to have access to a dab radio set however in second quarter digital listening had dropped back to 50 2 digital audio broadcasting experimental transmissions of dab eureka 147 standard from crystal palace transmitting station by bbc started in 1990 with permanent transmissions covering london in september 1995 with expansion of its single frequency network in spring of 1998 bbc national ensemble was available to 65 of uk population by 2001 85 by 2004 and 96 4 by 2015 dab full time broadcasts began in 2016 broadcasting act of 1996 allowed introduction of national regional and local commercial ensembles in united kingdom first national ensemble licence for dab from radio authority was advertised in 1998 and one applicant applied for licence licence was awarded to gwr group and ntl broadcast who since launch were renamed arqiva two companies formed digital one ensemble which began broadcasting on 15 november 1999 digital one ensemble has grown and is currently available to over 90 of uk population although an ofcom report into digital radio in 2015 puts robust household coverage at 89 8 of uk growth and benefits of dab in uk thumb 350px chart showing listening share of united kingdom s digital radio platforms dab digital tv and online through a device or smartphone tablet app in united kingdom uptake of dab has increased since launch of bbc national dab ensemble in 1995 lower prices new radio stations and marketing have increased uptake of dab radio in uk digital radios were first sold as car radios in 1997 priced around ps800 with hi fi tuners costing up to ps2 000 being released two years later in 2001 digital one invested in frontier silicon to produce a new processing chip which would allow cheaper portable radios to be produced roberts radio goodmans and in 2002 pure digital s award winning evoke series of radios broke ps100 price barrier and dab take up has increased since bbc and other dab broadcasters have been encouraging dab take up by promoting a number of features which are either new or improve upon former technology in their sales literature benefit of dab is that due to use of multiplexing technology and encoding technology broadcasters including bbc and emap have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside their existing analogue radio stations broadcasters also state that dab offers better reception without problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio dab radios also come with features such as station lists so listeners do not need to their receivers as well as scrolling text providing information such as breaking news travel information or latest track information dab has also been marketed as having two major advantages over analogue radio broadcasting in that using mpeg 1 audio layer ii lossy audio compression technology and more recently dab using high efficiency advanced audio coding parts of audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded meaning less data needs to be sent over air this as well as multiplexing technology allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts national local and regional dab ensembles use same frequency for area they cover using a single frequency network an ensemble broadcasting a number of stations can cover same area as a number of fm frequencies which would be required to cover same area for one station bbc carried out successful tests of a single frequency network in london before launching its national dab ensemble criticisms of dab in uk dab audibly provides worse audio quality than fm in uk because almost all stereo stations use a bit rate of 128 kbit s or around world with audio codec most commercial stations use 112 kbit s a bit rate of 256 kbit s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal bit rate of many stations has dropped still further in recent years with absolute radio formerly virgin radio with a bit rate of 160 has split its bit rate into 3 stations inc absolute 80s and 90s all now in mono at only even radio 4 dab is in mono most evenings after 7pm so in manchester steve wind up channel is broadcast with a higher bit rate than bbc radio 4 at in evenings radio 4 now broadcasts bbc world service in stereo on its dab multiplex at a higher bit rate than its own channel in evenings also a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono indeed bit rates used by radio stations on other digital platforms such as cable terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on dab so audio quality is also higher on other hand an ofcom survey which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor dab quality found that 94 of dab listeners thought dab was at least as good as fm ofcom estimates that even after extra spectrum has been allocated to dab around 90 local radio stations will be unable to transmit on dab either because there is no space for them on a local dab multiplex or because they cannot afford high transmission costs of dab that multiplex operators are charging ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded digital radio mondiale drm as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay high transmission costs of dab success of small scale dab multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree on 24 january 2009 ofcom allowed electrical retailers to be granted a licence to rebroadcast dab signals within their stores to demonstrate dab radio sets within their stores united kingdom consumer charity which warned that consumers who could not get an adequate dab signal could be misled by in store sets digital radio development bureau replied to which report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where dab signals are blocked out drdb recommended that consumers should check dab coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a dab radio to avoid disappointment on 24 november 2010 a number of commercial radio operators refused to run an advertisement promoting dab one operator stating that it would be fundamentally immoral and dishonest until dab coverage matches that of fm commercial radio executives have argued that bbc should pick up majority of cost of expanding dab network across united kingdom dab thumb right a dab transmission of virgin radio anthems on sound digital multiplex in uk being received by a compatible radio dab is a major upgrade to dab widely used in other countries in europe it was first tested in united kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016 dab is not backwards compatible with dab so older radios cannot receive dab stations there are no plans in foreseeable future for vast majority of bbc and commercial stations to transition from dab to dab estimates given by multiplex operator switch digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were dab compatible united kingdom government had previously ruled out any transition from dab to dab for foreseeable future a decision backed by radio industry and department for culture media and sport chief executive of drdb tony moretta mirrored calls by radio industry and experts to not adopt dab in uk in an interview with techradar website in 2009 he stated that dab was a red herring and may not be introduced in uk for foreseeable future due to growing number of digital radio sets currently being sold and used in future which cannot decode he aac and therefore access dab stations moretta also cited greater expense for broadcasters and overall satisfaction with current audio quality of dab stations of which a move to dab would only benefit a small number of audiophiles as other reasons independent radio analyst grant goddard also stated that there was an economic decision not to adopt dab for both industry and consumers despite opposition aired to government regarding introduction of dab in united kingdom by industry and experts ofcom began testing dab on brighton experimental ensemble in january 2013 for a period of one month in march 2014 bbc announced that it would undertake a trial of dab in uk later in year and on september 1 2014 folder media began a four month trial of dab on north east wales and west cheshire ensemble in early 2016 two new stations launched dab services on portsmouth trial multiplex sound digital operators of one of national multiplexes launched three full time

uk frequency finder dk digital updates in march 2017 brighton multiplex became uk s first to only broadcast dab department of culture media and sport published minimum specifications for digital radio receivers in uk in february 2013 which states that a receiver sold in uk must be capable of decoding a dab stream of up to 144 capacity units radios must support dab to receive digital tick mark dab frequency plan dab radio stations in united kingdom are broadcast on a number of frequency blocks on vhf band iii original plan devised in wiesbaden for framework of dab in europe was to allocate frequency blocks 11b to 12d for uk dab broadcasting however as part of its review of radio ofcom has expanded frequency allocations for dab and has advertised local and a national ensemble licence on blocks outside original wiesbaden plan on 10b to 10d and 11a block 5a has also been reserved for launch of local ensembles in 2015 additional blocks were opened up for small scale dab trials for an

trial sound quality from trial was better than am quality but not as good as average dab quality daytime coverage of drm trial extended further than discontinued am service however night time service as expected to be smaller than daytime coverage due to characteristics of medium wave broadcasting did cause problems with interference to drm trial bbc stated this interference can be avoided but

population and all major roads original interim report of digital radio working group published in 2008 specified that 50 threshold for listening figures should be based on those for dab this was subsequently watered down to incorporate listening via any digital platform so as to make it easier to meet criteria in 2010 government created a digital action plan which was delivered in november
