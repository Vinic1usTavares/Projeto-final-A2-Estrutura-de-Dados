seacology is a nonprofit 501 c 3 charitable organization headquartered in berkeley california that works to preserve island ecosystems and cultures around world founded in 1991 it began with work of ethnobotanist paul alan cox who researched tropical plants and their medicinal value in village of falealupo in samoa during mid 1980s when villagers were pressured into selling logging rights to their rainforest in 1988 to build a new school cox and his wife offered to help secure funds for new school in return for an agreement with villagers to protect their forest with help of his friends and family cox secured funds within six months later earning him and village chief fuiono senio goldman environmental prize for their efforts word spread throughout islands and with increasing demand for similar projects cox along with bill marre and ken murdock decided to form seacology and expand their work internationally for first few years organization operated on a volunteer basis duane silverstein became first employee in 1999 and headquarters were relocated to berkeley not far from his residence because of high risk of extinction for island fauna and decline in coral reef ecosystems seacology s primary focus is projects in which villagers sign contracts under which they agree to help protect either terrestrial or marine habitat for a specified time in return for new buildings or services operations are low cost averaging around us 20 000 to 25 000 construction is done with local labor and sometimes without use of machinery seacology selects its projects by reviewing recommendations of its field representatives and its scientific advisory board by mid 2018 seacology had initiated more than 300 projects globally and helped preserve of marine habitat and of terrestrial habitat at same time they had helped construct new facilities and provided programs including educational materials vital medical services and environmental training in addition to helping local people on islands like those in fiji philippines and many others their projects have helped protect mangrove forests sea turtles dugongs and one of rarest primates in world hainan black crested gibbon seacology also awards an annual seacology prize to indigenous islanders for their efforts in conservation and cultural preservation organization helps support island communities by fostering ecotourism and has helped raise emergency funds following destructive tsunamis and other natural disasters its budget is modest and it does not compensate its board members it has won awards from yahoo and travel leisure magazine and has been featured in music video what about now by american rock band daughtry history seacology was founded in 1991 by ethnobotanist paul alan cox in hawaii using prize money and consulting fees resulting from his efforts to preserve of rainforest outside village of falealupo on island of i in samoa he later recorded these events in his book nafanua saving samoan rain forest cox began his work in samoa in 1973 during his first mormon missionary service at which time he learned from local people about medicinal properties of native plants after working with local communities in other rainforests cox returned to samoa in 1984 with his family his aim was to find a cure for cancer which had claimed life of his mother earlier that year in return for help of local healers called cox offered to share revenue generated by his research with local villages over time his research identified five new drugs including therapeutic agent prostratin a potential treatment for hiv prostratin was isolated in a concoction made from bark of local tree nutans and shared with him by a healer named who used it to treat hepatitis cox set up royalty agreements to ensure that samoans will share in revenue thumb left upright alt paul alan cox and fuiono senio share circular trophy supported by cox and gripped by senio ethnobiologist paul alan cox left and village chief fuiono senio right won goldman environmental prize in 1997 for their conservation efforts at falealupo their work later led to founding of seacology in 1988 his research was threatened when samoan government pressured village of falealupo to pay 65 000 for a new school warning that if village did not provide a new school within a year they would withdraw teachers from village leaving children without an opportunity for a formal education shortly after receiving this notice from government a foreign owned logging company offered village exactly 65 000 to log entire surrounding falealupo lacking a source of revenue villages eventually sold logging rights to forest but when cox learned of situation and witnessed logging for himself he immediately sought an explanation from village elders and then requested that they halt logging so that he could raise money for school despite initial skepticism cox convinced high chief fuiono senio who then helped persuade rest of elders senio then drew his machete and raced to halt logging new school was built after cox and his wife barbara were able to raise money in six months partly by mortgaging their house cox also obtained financial support from others and took over payments on mortgage for school verne read a businessman and financial supporter of bat conservation international took over payments on mortgage for school ken murdock founder of herbal company nature s way and rex maughan owner of forever living products funded construction of school and repaid loggers for their 20 000 advance during a tribal ceremony held in february 1989 cox along with village chiefs signed falealupo covenant which legally protected forest for 50 years in exchange for their help during ceremony village chiefs also bestowed chief s titles on murdock and maughan and proclaimed that cox was a reincarnation of their god nafanua because like nafanua he did not come from samoa and both had fought to protect village and forest title bestowed upon him made cox responsible for well being of village and obligated that he return to visit thumb right upright alt a large wooden staircase in a tower shaped wooden frame climbs into canopy leading to a canopy walkway canopy walkway in falealupo seen from its base is a popular tourist attraction and has helped community generate revenue in 1992 cox and his friends had finished helping samoan villagers at falealupo as well as nearby which encountered same problem prior to that murdock who later became seacology s president suggested continuing their work by seeking out more villages with which they could exchange projects for marine and forest reserves as demand among island villages grew bill marre a business consultant and executive coach who later became a member of board of trustees and chairman s advisory council suggested establishing a nonprofit organization to continue their work he suggested name seacology to reflect organization s focus on island conservation and helped nonprofit in 1991 along with cox and murdock using his own funds marre paid costs of starting organization and covered its administrative costs for first three years together with his assistant marre helped advertise seacology by giving lectures at schools and universities visiting other island nations and writing articles about work for local media in falealupo seacology continued their work funding projects with a total of 485 000 as of 2005 when cyclone destroyed primary school at falealupo in 1990 seacology helped raise funds to rebuild it school was completely rebuilt again in 1991 following cyclone val several years after completing school organization helped establish trails and build a rainforest information center followed in 1997 by an elevated canopy walkway as part of an ecotourism project to help generate income for people and provide funds for a retirement system for village elders walkway has since become one of samoa s leading tourist attractions and was yielding an average of 1 000 each month for community in 2001 bringing in more money than villagers would have earned from selling their forest satisfied with results villagers at falealupo declared that they would honor contract they had made with cox to protect forest forever rather than just 50 years in 1997 both cox and senio village chief shared goldman environmental prize for their work for first six years of its existence seacology operated as a volunteer organization with no employees four years after being founded seacology s administrative office moved to ken murdock s office office moved again in 1999 to berkeley california after cox offered a job to duane silverstein then executive director of goldman fund which had previously honored cox with goldman environmental prize silverstein had been inspired by work cox had done in samoa and agreed to take position of executive director of seacology under condition that office be relocated to within walking distance of his house in 2007 seacology became an international organization with greater visibility despite their small staff international affiliate programs such as seacology germany and seacology japan were created to help raise funds to support island projects following year seacology u k was created followed by seacology scandinavia in 2009 for its global efforts seacology has received several awards including global vision award in travel leisure blue award in islands magazine and yahoo s pick for good in september 2006 organization has received numerous awards most recently prince s prize for innovative nonprofits laureate awarded by albert ii prince of monaco activities seacology is a nonprofit organization that works to preserve both island habitats and cultures by exchanging services for local assistance and cooperation with conservation efforts as of 2000 it was reported to be only conservation organization to focus entirely on island preservation seacology has 501 c 3 status providing federal income tax deductions for some donors because it is a charitable non profit organization according to its mission statement on its website seacology searches for win win situations where both local environment is protected and islanders receive some tangible benefit for doing so islands constitute a large portion of world s surface combined largest 125 islands cover an area size of europe and if economic zones that include marine resources found within a few miles of shore are included islands make up one sixth of earth s surface area and hold half of all marine species scientific surveys have shown that coral reefs are declining rapidly due to climate change dynamite and cyanide fishing and marine pollution according to evolutionary biologist e o wilson bird species that are endemic to islands face a greater risk of extinction 40 times greater than on continents at least 255 island bird species have become extinct since appearance of humans with 158 lost during prehistory and 97 lost between 1600 and 1994 in comparison between 17 and 20 species of continental birds became extinct between 1600 and 1994 because small land area of islands can only support small populations biggest threat to endemic wildlife is habitat loss other threats include direct exploitation hunting and pet trade disease and invasive species to save island habitats around world seacology staff initiate projects by first holding meetings with local villagers to determine their needs these needs often include schools a community center solar energy or freshwater delivery once their needs are determined seacology makes a deal with local community offering to provide needed service in return for a forest reserve or a no take fishing area around a coral reef facilities such as schools and community centers are built using local labor and seacology provides approximately 20 000 for supplies and to facilitate construction seacology has field representatives stationed around world who monitor and report progress of projects in their region as well as seek new projects in their respective regions or islands new project suggestions are reviewed by board of directors scientific advisory board provide additional recommendations based on latest research in addition to their projects seacology played an active role in creation of national park of american samoa through work of their scientists and donors in 2008 seacology started its carbon offset fund where donations of 40 00 went directly towards renewable energy and reforestation projects that same year they collaboratively funded creation of a nursery run by non governmental organization ngo in madagascar to raise 3 000 seedlings of endangered palm dypsis two organizations have also collaborated to protect forest in southeastern madagascar in and manado seacology was involved in testing a new method of restoring coral reef which involved planting white ceramic modules that were shaped like 3 dimensional snowflakes to maximize surface area for corals to grow projects according to their 2016 annual report seacology has funded over 276 projects globally island communities that have aided in these efforts have collectively received facilities including schools community centers and other important structures educational materials vital medical services and environmental training have been provided in many programs thumb left alt dozens of men from an indonesian village work on foundation of a new building seacology projects often involve machine free labor utilizing strength and skills of local community when projects are agreed upon with an island community local rituals often coincide with start of project particularly in pacific islands where a common custom involves drinking kava a mildly narcotic drink made from ground up root of a pepper plant ritual is hundreds of years old and has been described by seacology staff as being relaxing especially because of friendly environment seacology staff often dress in local attire villagers perform dances and staff are invited to join in often to amusement of villagers when projects begin work is done without machines with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from beach project costs range between 5 000 and 150 000 although average is between 20 000 and 25 000 protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20 to 30 year commitment seacology hopes that during that time local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress to a point where they are less dependent on natural resources according to marine biologist mark erdmann in a worst case scenario if people violate contract and destroy habitat seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low cost investment whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing immediate needs of people if project fails both lose that investment and not have helped community in one of seacology s projects villagers in fiji refused a 700 000 offer by foreign businessmen to buy one of islands and signed an agreement that prohibited development for 20 years and established a 10 year no take fishing reserve encompassing around island on island of kendhoo part of baa atoll
