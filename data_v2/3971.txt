everything he could to prevent such attacks incident drew fierce local criticism of hussein amid feelings he had been betrayed by israelis hussein also suspected that israel had changed its attitude towards jordan and was intending to escalate matters in order to capture west bank yitzhak rabin then israel defense forces chief of staff later admitted disproportionate reaction by israel and that operation would have been better directed at syria which was supporting such attacks we had neither political nor military reasons to arrive at a confrontation with jordan or to humiliate hussein events at samu triggered large scale anti hashemite protests in west bank for what they perceived as hussein s incompetency for defending them against israel rioters attacked government offices chanted pro nasser slogans and called on hussein to have same fate as nuri as iraqi prime minister who had been killed and mutilated in 1958 along with iraqi royal family jordanians believed that

travelled to cairo on 30 may 1967 and hastily signed an egyptian jordanian mutual defense treaty returning home to cheering crowds shlaim argues that hussein had possessed options but had made two

jordan suffered a severe setback with loss of west bank which contributed 40 to jordan s gdp in tourism industrial and agricultural sectors around 200 000 palestinian refugees fled to jordan destabilizing jordan s demographics loss of jerusalem was critical to jordan and specifically for hussein who held hashemite custodianship of muslim and christian holy sites in jerusalem al aqsa mosque is third holiest site in islam believed to be where muhammad ascended to heaven by 11 june israel had decisively won war by capturing west bank from jordan gaza and sinai from egypt and golan heights from syria nasser and hussein recognizing their defeat sought to work together towards a more moderate stance on 22 november 1967 united nations security council unanimously approved

meaning self sacrificers moved their bases to jordan and stepped up their attacks on israel and israeli occupied territories one israeli retaliation on a plo camp based in karameh a jordanian town along border with west bank developed into a full scale battle it is believed that israel had wanted to punish jordan for its perceived support for plo after failing to capture yasser arafat plo leader israeli forces withdrew or were repulsed but not before destroying karameh camp and sustaining relatively high casualties perceived joint jordanian palestinian victory in 1968 battle of karameh led to an upsurge of support in arab world for palestinian fighters in jordan plo in jordan grew in strength and by beginning of 1970 fedayeen groups started to openly call for overthrow of hashemite monarchy acting as a state within a state fedayeen disregarded local laws and regulations and even attempted to assassinate king hussein twice leading to violent confrontations between them and jordanian army hussein wanted to oust fedayeen from country but hesitated to strike because he did not want his enemies to use it against him by equating palestinian fighters with civilians plo actions in jordan culminated in dawson s field hijackings incident on 10 september 1970 in which fedayeen hijacked three civilian aircraft and forced their landing in zarqa taking foreign nationals as hostages and later bombing planes in front of international press hussein saw this as last straw and ordered army to move on 17 september jordanian army surrounded cities that had a plo presence including amman and irbid and began shelling fedayeen who had established themselves in palestinian refugee camps next day a force from syria with plo markings started advancing towards irbid which fedayeen declared a liberated city on 22 september syrians withdrew after jordanian army launched an air ground offensive that inflicted heavy syrian losses and after israeli air force jets flew over syrian units in a symbolic show of support of hussein but did not engage an agreement brokered by egyptian president nasser between arafat and hussein led to an end to fighting on 27 september nasser died following day of a heart attack on 13 october hussein signed an agreement with arafat to regulate fedayeen s presence but jordanian army attacked again in january 1971 fedayeen were driven out of

munich massacre against israeli athletes in a speech to jordanian parliament on 15 march 1972 hussein announced his united arab kingdom plan unlike unitary state that had existed between west bank and jordan during jordan s annexation of west bank 1950 1967 this plan envisaged two federal entities on each bank of jordan river according to proposal two districts of federation would be autonomous excluding military and foreign and security affairs that would be determined by an amman central government but implementation of plan was to be conditional upon achieving a peace agreement between israel and jordan ultimately hussein s proposal was ruled out after it was vehemently rejected by israel plo and several arab states yom kippur war after 1967 war gunnar jarring was appointed by un as a special envoy for middle east peace process leading jarring mission talks between arab countries and israel resulted in a deadlock jarring initiative and response israel s foreign relations selected documents vols 1 2 1947 1974 retrieved 9 june 2005 stalemate led to renewed fears of another war between arab countries and israel worried that jordan would be dragged into another war unprepared hussein sent zaid al rifai to egyptian president anwar sadat in december 1972 to inquire sadat informed al rifai that he had been planning a limited incursion in sinai that would allow some political manoeuvring sadat then invited al rifai and hussein to a summit on 10 september 1973 with him and hafez al assad who had become president of syria summit ended with a restoration of ties between jordan egypt and syria sadat disclosed to assad and hussein his intention to initiate military action hussein refused sadat s request to allow fedayeen s return to jordan but agreed that in case of a

minister golda meir in tel aviv on 25 september israeli leaks of meeting led to rumors in arab world that hussein had tipped off meir about arab intentions hussein only discussed with meir what both already knew that syrian army was on alert on 13 october jordan joined war and sent to assist syrians in golan heights some see it as ironic that it was same brigade that had been sent to deter syrian invasion during black september in 1970 subsequent peace talks with israel collapsed while jordan wanted a complete israeli withdrawal from west bank israel preferred to retain control but with jordanian administration in 1974 arab league summit held in morocco on 26 october a fatah plot to assassinate hussein upon his arrival was uncovered by moroccan authorities plot did not deter hussein from joining summit but at end jordan had to join all arab countries in recognizing plo as sole representative of palestinian people a diplomatic defeat for hussein relationship between jordan and

after 1970 repeated attacks and counter attacks occurred in southern lebanon between plo and israel two major israeli incursions into lebanon occurred in 1978 and other in 1982 latter conflict troubled hussein as idf had laid siege to beirut plo was to be expelled from lebanon and ariel sharon israeli defense minister suggested they be moved to jordan where monarchy would be toppled and jordan would serve as an alternative palestinian homeland sharon boasted one speech by me will make king hussein realize that time has come to pack his bags however arafat rejected sharon s suggestion and fedayeen were transported to tunisia under american cover thumb left hussein with american president jimmy carter iranian shah mohammad reza pahlavi and farah from left to right 31 december 1977 in 1983 american president ronald reagan suggested a peace plan that became known as reagan plan similar to hussein s 1972 federation plan hussein and arafat both agreed to plan on 1 april but plo s executive office rejected it a year and a half later a renewed effort by hussein to jumpstart peace process culminated in establishment of a jordan plo accord that sought a peaceful resolution to israeli palestinian conflict an unprecedented milestone for plo and a jordanian diplomatic victory accord was opposed by israel and garnered no international support from either united states or soviet union around same time hussein met israel prime minister shimon peres on 19 july 1985 in united kingdom where peres assented to accord but later rest of his government opposed it due to plo s involvement subsequent talks between plo and jordan collapsed after plo refused to make concessions in a speech hussein announced that after two long attempts i and government of jordan hereby announce that we are unable to continue to coordinate politically with plo leadership until such time as their word becomes their bond characterized by commitment credibility and constancy jordan started a crackdown on plo by closing their offices in amman after then israeli minister of defense yitzhak rabin requested it from hussein in a secret meeting jordan announced a 1 3billion five year

weapons to iran thereby lengthening conflict between iraq and iran both supporters of plo relationship between hussein and saddam became very visited baghdad 61 times between 1980 and 1990 and saddam used hussein to relay messages to several countries including us and britain in june 1982 after iran s victory seemed imminent hussein personally carried to saddam sensitive photographic intelligence forwarded to him by us in return saddam provided incentives for jordanian exports to iraq which accounted for a quarter of all jordan s exports valued at 212 3million in 1989 iraqi aid helped jordan s finances hussein had felt it humiliating to keep asking gulf countries for assistance hussein made a little known attempt to heal rift between two ba ath regimes of iraq and syria in april 1986 meeting between hafez al assad and saddam hussein occurred at an airbase in al in eastern jordanian desert talks lasted for a day after which no progress was made saddam was angry at al assad for supporting iran against an arab country iraq and al assad was adamant about establishing a union between iraq and syria which saddam rejected on 11 april 1987 after yitzhak shamir became prime minister of israel hussein engaged in direct talks with shamir s foreign minister peres in london after reaching an agreement between hussein and peres on establishing an international peace conference shamir and rest of ministers in his cabinet rejected proposal on 8 november 1987 jordan hosted an arab league summit hussein enjoyed good relations with rival arab blocs and he acted as

to achieve palestinian independence against israeli occupation turned into an upsurge of support for plo which had orchestrated uprising and consequently diminished jordanian influence in west bank jordanian policy on west bank had to be reconsidered following renewed fears that israel would revive its proposal for jordan to become an alternative palestinian homeland us secretary of state george p shultz set up a peace process that became known as initiative it called for jordan rather than plo to represent palestinians however when schultz contacted hussein about plan he reversed his position and told him it was a matter for plo to decide of intifada were unified national leadership of uprising which issued its 10th communique on 11 march 1988 urging its followers to intensify
