north turnpike which pennsylvania route 487 mostly follows through park had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851 northbound stagecoach left berwick in morning and stopped for lunch at long pond tavern on lake about noon petrillo pp 40 43 earliest settlers in what became park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber one squatter jesse dodson cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and dam for what became lake rose in 1842 dodson also built a dam south of mud pond near what became lake jean both dams were on ganoga glen branch of kitchen creek and each was used to make a log splash pond other squatter named sickler also built a mill and log dam at what became lake leigh on glen leigh branch of kitchen creek sickler was active from 1838 to about 1860 petrillo p 68 in 1865 a well was drilled at dodson mill site after a mr hadley fraudulently added oil to springs in what became park hadley who had hoped that investors would think petroleum was present got wheeler wilson sewing machine company to invest 40 000 in in his scheme in next two years they drilled two wells one deep at former dodson sawmill at

what is now lake ganoga and some of park as their own hunting preserve and built a stone house on lake shore by 1852 or 1855 stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern it was known as ricketts folly for its isolated location in wilderness clemuel died in 1858 and elijah bought his share of land and house ricketts family was not aware of glens and their waterfalls until about 1865 when they were discovered by two guests from stone house who went fishing and wandered down kitchen creek elijah s son robert bruce ricketts for whom park is named joined union army as a private at outbreak of american civil war and rose through ranks to become a colonel in artillery after war r bruce ricketts returned to pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing land around lake from his father by 1873 he controlled or owned and eventually this grew to more than including glens and waterfalls and most of park while stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction in 1872 r bruce ricketts built a three story wooden addition north of house addition used lumber from a sawmill ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875 about southeast of stone house north mountain house hotel opened in 1873 ricketts brother frank for whom a park waterfall is named managed it from then until 1898 many of hotel s guests were ricketts friends and relations who arrived after school let out in

into what is now park for over 20 years ricketts was land poor he owed much on mortgages on his vast land holdings and there were no good means to transport estimated of lumber from most of his land to sawmills large scale lumber operations of that time floated logs on major streams or used logging railroads but neither was available to ricketts his small sawmill near stone house closed by 1875 and he was only able to sell two major tracts of land in his lifetime in 1872 he sold north of park to a group of investors that included himself this deal seems to have been for shares of stock not cash and deed for sale was not recorded until 1893 ricketts sold along bowman creek including easternmost parts of park to albert lewis in 1876 lewis hoped to build a branch line of lehigh valley railroad along creek in 1870s and 1880s ricketts tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to find partners and investors who would help him cut lumber on his land and build a rail line to it petrillo pp 43

hydroelectric power within what became park forming lake leigh at site of sickler s mill lake rose at site of dodson s mill and lake jean which incorporated natural mud pond north of these lakes leigh and jean were named for ricketts daughters while rose was a ricketts family name lake leigh dam was made of concrete and cost 165 000 approximately in while other two dams were log cribs filled with earth and cost a total of 300 000 approximately in if project had been successful plan was to rebuild two log and timber dams in concrete however dams were poorly constructed and could not be used for hydroelectric purposes after panic of 1907 ricketts wife told him to stop hydroelectric project before he lost all of their money tomasak pp 351 352 this prompted him to say i used to be land poor but

helicopter dropped poles into glens to rebuild bridges in early 1997 in winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in ganoga glen section of park for first time that same year training was undertaken by local fire companies to rescue people injured in park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them especially treacherous in 1998 a project to repair and improve falls trail began with

africa collided with what became north america forming pangaea in years since up to 5 000 feet 1 500 m of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather at least three major glaciations in past million years have been final factor in shaping land that makes up park today shultz pp 372 374 391 399 818 effects of glaciation have made kitchen creek within park unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down allegheny front as it is only one with an almost continuous series of waterfalls before last ice age kitchen creek had a much smaller drainage basin during ice age glaciers covered all of park except grand view outcrop about 20 000 years ago glaciers retreated to northeast and glacial lakes formed drainage from melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway or channel that diverted headwaters of south branch bowman creek into glen leigh branch of kitchen creek glacial deposits of debris thick formed a dam blocking water from ganoga lake and what became lake jean from draining into big run a tributary of fishing creek water was instead diverted into ganoga glen branch of kitchen creek these diversions added about to kitchen creek drainage basin increasing it by just over 50 percent result was increased water flow in kitchen creek which has been cutting falls in glens since gradient or slope of kitchen creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin as phillips creek to east still does kitchen creek is now too steep for its present amount of water flow and over time erosion will decrease creek s slope and make it less
