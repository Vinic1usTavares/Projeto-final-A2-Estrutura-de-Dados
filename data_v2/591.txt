reputation as a jewelry artist creating works which were more like body sculptures than traditional jewelry her conception of pieces allowed her work to be displayed on body while simultaneously interacting with it rather than simply being worn as an adornment as one of innovators who moved jewelry craftsmanship away from metals in 1960s she experimented with a wide variety of materials including papier mache wooden dowels rubber string and canvas her large scale works were typically brightly colored and represented a modernist abstract aesthetic early life marjorie ann krask was born on august 29 1941 in taylorville illinois to eleanor nee curtin and edward p krask following her parents divorce before her second birthday she was raised by her mother rarely seeing her father

jeweller graduating with distinction in 1966 near end of her schooling an article she read about work of abstract sculptor david smith became influential for her work she began to conceptualize jewelry as a type of sculpture which could be worn career when couple graduated they began their teaching careers at university of kansas in lawrence with her husband teaching in history department while she taught art schick first began working in papier mache during time in lawrence using it as a lightweight alternative to metal allowing her to create larger pieces at time medium was unconventional and schick s experimentation evolved from creating frames of chicken wire coating them in pulp mixture and shaping them to form while her traditional jewelry pieces were readily accepted for juried exhibits her papier mache adornments were regularly rejected as too radical in 1967 both of were hired by pittsburg state university at time known as kansas state college at pittsburg in 1969 she went back to idea of putting her body through one of sculptures of david smith instead of flat two dimensional pieces she had made up to that time she molded a brass headpiece with tubes on which she welded blue lensed glasses at eye level nicknaming piece blue eyes head sculpture changed focus of her work from metalwork jewelry to wearable sculpture 1970s schick became part of modernist era creating works which explored abstraction through line mass space and volume she took account of difference between experiencing an object based on its presentation and materials used and its aesthetic significance her early jewelry designs were expressionistic evoking emotions of conflict and contact they made use of silver wire mixed with melted and pitted brass or bronze twisted into shapes many of them had feel of objet trouve artifacts pieces of her cycladic series featured polished shapes of brass and copper designed as oversized bracelets brooches and necklaces for a time she believed her metalwork was serious art and her experimentation with other media far less important thanks to its lightweight pliable qualities she experimented with papier mache as a means of extending forms away from body it also allowed volume and color to be used in ways that traditional metalwork could not schick produced pieces on wire frames encapsulated with molded pulp to surround body rather than creating conventional wrist or neck adornments her large creations were designed to be displayed on whole body from shoulder to foot in 1976 schick was contacted by mary ann bransby a jewelry instructor from kansas city s university of missouri to create jewelry pieces for school s modern dance troupe dancers used pieces in innovative ways putting rings on their toes or a bracelet on their foot which caused schick to recognize that pieces could be reinterpreted group gave performances and exhibitions of artwork at venues including albrecht gallery in st joseph missouri bronx museum of arts kansas city art institute and lindenwood college in saint charles missouri by end of 1970s schick grew tired of papier mache as a medium she took courses in ceramics and plastics and experimented with making jewelry from clay paper plastic thread and combinations of thread and paper 1980s at beginning of 1980s schick began working with fiber string and dowel rods submitting six small pieces to an alternative media exhibit jewelry redefined first international exhibition of multi media non precious jewellery hosted by british crafts centre in london in 1982 receiving a letter from paul derrez one of jurors and owner of ra gallery in amsterdam she created a solo exhibit for his gallery show brought her international recognition and she was asked to participate in art museum s international jewellery art exhibition in tokyo where she won an award in fine arts as her work began receiving international attention and became an influence on european jewelers american market began to accept her work her stick designs played with illusions of negative space with pieces of dowel riveted into pick up sticks spirals and zig zag shapes creating a dialogue between body and adornment utilizing wood rubber tubes and string she created interlocking geometric shapes bordering on outrageous and questioning need to create mass produced useful adornment taking a sabbatical from psu schick studied metalworking at sir john cass college of art beginning in 1983 leading to her first solo exhibition at derrez s gallery that same year in 1984 she worked as artist in residence of john cass schick was only american to participate in new jewelry movement which swept through england and netherlands at end of 1980s she began to make pieces of plywood and began to focus predominantly on however she did continue to make wooden bracelets during this time using dowel sticks which were painted with variegated colors her three dimensional pieces were more like sculpture than traditional flat jewelry and could as easily be displayed on a wall as worn schick also began exploring companion pieces making her jewelry part of paintings so that when they were not being worn they could be displayed as artworks she incorporated a whimsical series of into her pieces that took on form of bracelets brooches or frames around head and neck which could be shifted and disassembled creating hybrid pieces which blurred boundaries between handicrafts ornamentation painting and sculpture schick worked in round giving all sides of a work equal focus pressing boundaries of traditional jewelry conscious of sculptural notion that pieces would be viewed from any angle she focused not only on front and back of a piece but how it would appear on or off a wall on or off body or from any vantage point by 1986 she had participated in fourteen international showings at nine art museums throughout world in 1987 schick was one of featured artists in a traveling exhibit

years of her career it featured over a hundred works displayed without use of models or mannequins either protruding from walls or hanging from ceilings display showed that works were non functional as simple adornments and in a unique way were unfinished in absence of body of wearer 1990s schick returned to papier mache in 1990s using different painting techniques wishing to explore color she began to work with fabric just as painters use canvas disliking flatness of surface she created pockets stuffed with poly fil to add sculptural texture first piece in series necklace de la luna del sol was created in 1996 and inspired by peruvian archaeological sites of huaca del sol and huaca de la luna in 1998 schick and her husband planned a sabbatical in mexico with tours to europe she began a series of pieces related to their travels inspired by varied color palettes of differing landscapes in particular she was interested in exploring how different colors trigger memories of places and events glen brown an art historian from kansas state university likened these works to souvenir scrapbooks in a symbolist style which captured personal experiences of traveler without need for a photorealistic representation her work could also be considered pop surrealism as noted by graham shearing in his review of 1998 exhibition revelations new jewelry by members of society of north american goldsmiths snag her contribution was a piece called katella at times schick used canvas to allow light color washes to permeate fabric such as in piece brick street a homage to pittsburg kansas on others she used heavy coats of gesso to build form and texture before painting surfaces in her work quetzalcoatl completed after mexico trip she used heavily fabric pouches and paint to represent feathered snakes found in pre columbian sites they had visited at chichen itza palenque and teotihuacan she used vivid colors and muted grays to represent once vibrant murals completed in maya blue and terracotta which have faded over time in another piece chicago windows representing chicago skyline schick riveted black oak strips together to form panes around brightly colored rectangles of plywood adorned with string to create geometrical framework of black background another piece representative of this period was bound colors a necklace with ribbons of canvas laced through wood strips creating a design reminiscent of aztec calendar stone interwoven with a color wheel it was mounted on a painted plywood base from which it could be removed for wear allowing aesthetic of piece to transcend individual components of jewelry painting and sculpture large scale of her works was intentional so that pieces were not tucked away in a drawer but rather had multiple uses in different interconnected interpretations her work was designed to encompass body and rather than ornamental accessories became three dimensional drawings to wear 2000s thumb yellow ladderback chair 2001 in 2000s schick began experimenting with turning everyday items into wearable art she designed yellow ladderback chair in 2001 to evoke experience of being in a chair canvas necklace

scarf made of wood blocks mirror futuristic motifs of painter and are surrounded by wooden implements such as paint brushes and pans a needle scissors and thread which delaunay might have used in her work when piece is worn tools of artist s trade float around wearer s knees schick began a series of necklaces with autobiographical themes numbered pieces necklace 1 necklace 2 and so forth depict
