sms kronprinz was a unique german ironclad warship built for prussian navy in 1866 1867 kronprinz was laid down in 1866 at samuda brothers shipyard at cubitt town in london she was launched in may 1867 and commissioned into prussian navy that september ship was fourth ironclad ordered by prussian navy after and though she entered service before friedrich carl kronprinz was built as an armored frigate armed with a main battery of sixteen 21 cm 8 3 in guns several smaller guns were added later in her career kronprinz saw limited duty during franco prussian war of 1870 1871 engine troubles aboard ship along with two other armored frigates in her squadron prevented operations against french blockade only two sorties in which kronprinz participated were conducted both of which did not result in combat ship served in subsequent imperial navy until she was converted into a training ship for boiler room personnel in 1901 ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921 design following acquisition of small ironclad warships and which were only usable in coastal areas prussian navy sought to acquire armored vessels capable of operations on high seas purpose of new ships would be primarily directed against prussia s primary naval rival denmark which in recent second schleswig war had imposed a blockade of german ports that prussia had not been able to break ironclads were at that time a recent development and only option for sea going warships was armored frigate modeled on traditional sailing ships with a battery on broadside navy requested approval from landtag in 1865 for an expanded budget to acquire needed vessels but parliament refused prompting king wilhelm i to circumvent legislature with a decree on 4 july authorizing purchase of two armored frigates at that time britain and france had shipbuilders most experienced with type so navy decided to order one vessel from each country contract for kronprinz was placed on 13 january 1866 four days after that for from britain and france respectively british built kronprinz was modeled on and es general characteristics and propulsion kronprinz was long at waterline and long overall she had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft ship was designed to displace at a normal loading and up to with a combat load ship s hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames it contained nine watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 43 percent of length of vessel ship was an excellent sea boat ship was responsive to commands from helm but had a large turning radius ship s crew numbered 33 officers and 508 enlisted men kronprinz carried a number of smaller boats including a large tender two launches a pinnace two cutters two yawls and one dinghy ship s propulsion system was built by john penn and sons of greenwich england a horizontal two cylinder single expansion steam engine powered ship it drove a two bladed screw in diameter eight trunk boilers with four fireboxes in each were divided into two boiler rooms boilers supplied steam to engine at propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of though on trials kronprinz managed to make and ship carried up to of coal which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of and a range of at 14 knots a barque rig with a surface area of 1 980 square meters supplemented steam engine steering was controlled with a single rudder armament and armor as built kronprinz was equipped with thirty two rifled 72 pounder cannon after her delivery to germany these guns were replaced with a pair of l 22 guns and fourteen 21 cm l 19 guns l 22 gun could depress to 5 degrees and elevate to 13 degrees which provided a range of shorter barreled l 19 guns had a wider range of elevation from 8 to 14 5 degrees but shorter barrel imposed a lower muzzle velocity which correspondingly reduced range of gun to two types of gun fired same shell of which total supply numbered 1 656 rounds of ammunition fourteen l 19 guns were placed in a central battery amidships seven on either broadside l 22 guns were placed on either end of ship later in her career six hotchkiss revolver cannon in individual mounts were installed along with five torpedo tubes two of tubes were placed in bow two on ship s sides and one in stern on port side all were placed above water and were supplied with 12 torpedoes kronprinzs armor consisted of wrought iron backed with heavy teak planking iron component of waterline armored belt ranged in thickness from in stern to amidships and toward bow entire belt was backed with of teak central battery was protected by of sloped iron plating on 254 mm of timber battery s roof was protected by thick iron plating service history thumb kronprinz after her launching in 1867 kronprinz was laid down in 1866 at samuda brothers shipyard in london british naval architect edward reed designed ship and resulted in a vessel similar to contemporary french built prussian ironclad friedrich carl ship was launched on 6 may 1867 and commissioned into prussian navy four months later on 19 september crews for friedrich carl and kronprinz were carried to ships by screw frigate and screw corvette on voyage from england to prussia ship lost her main mast in a storm ship immediately went into dock for refitting upon arrival in kiel on 28 october mast was repaired and ship s armament was converted from initial arrangement as with friedrich carl completion of ship was delayed significantly by problems with new prussian guns weapons originally intended for ships used breech blocks that had proved to be prone to failure during a series of tests in 1867 1868 krupp designed guns were substituted delaying her recommissioning until 11 may 1869 franco prussian war kronprinz joined friedrich carl and new armored frigate latter serving as fleet flagship for training exercises in august and september in may 1870 three ships were joined by prinz adalbert for a visit to britain though friedrich carl was damaged after running aground in great belt kronprinz konig wilhelm and prinz adalbert continued on to plymouth while friedrich carl returned to kiel for repairs latter vessel quickly rejoined ships there and on 1 july they departed for a training cruise to fayal in azores portugal but as tensions with france over hohenzollern candidacy for vacant spanish throne while they cruised east through english channel they learned of increasing likelihood of war and prussians detached prinz adalbert to dartmouth to be kept informed of events rest of squadron joined her there on 13 july and as war seemed to be imminent prussians ended cruise and returned to home kronprinz had to take prinz adalbert under tow for voyage due to latter s slow speed thumb kronprinz on maneuvers with and ships arrived back in wilhelmshaven on 16 july three days before france declared war on prussia over ems dispatch initiating franco prussian war greatly numerically inferior prussian navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by french navy kronprinz friedrich carl and konig wilhelm were concentrated in north sea at port of wilhelmshaven with a view toward breaking french blockade of port they were subsequently joined there by turret ship arminius which had been stationed in kiel for duration of conflict kronprinz was commanded by captain reinhold von werner despite great french naval superiority french had conducted insufficient pre war planning for an assault on prussian naval installations and concluded that it would only be possible with danish assistance which was not forthcoming four ships under command of vizeadmiral vice admiral eduard von jachmann made an offensive sortie in early august 1870 out to dogger bank though they encountered no french warships kronprinz and other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble which left arminius alone to conduct operations kronprinz friedrich carl and konig wilhelm stood off island of wangerooge for majority of conflict while arminius was stationed in mouth of elbe river on 11 september three broadside ironclads were again ready for action they joined arminius for another major operation into north sea it too did not encounter french opposition as french navy had by this time returned to france prussians planned to send kronprinz which had been overhauled over winter of 1870 1871 on a raid of port of cherbourg in february but french signed armistice that ended war on 28 january later career thumb kronprinz in kiel in 1892 through 1870s german armored fleet typically saw active service during summer months over winter most of vessels were placed in reserve with one or two kept in a state of reduced commission as guard ships kronprinz towed a floating dry dock from swinemunde to kiel in june 1871 with assistance from gunboat and paddle steamer at same time screw corvette was in brazil while on an overseas cruise some of her crew had been arrested following a fistfight in country germans threatened to deploy kronprinz friedrich carl three more corvettes and two gunboats which convinced brazilian government to release crewmen for 1875 s summer training cruise kronprinz and konig wilhelm were joined by recently built ironclads and though ships remained in german waters next year ironclad squadron kronprinz friedrich carl kaiser and new were sent to mediterranean sea in response to murder of german consul in salonika in ottoman empire german ships were joined by french russian italian and austro hungarian warships in an international demonstration condemning murder germans returned home in august and after arriving in september were laid up for winter kronprinz remained laid up for 1878 training cruise that saw loss of brand new ironclad in an accidental collision with kaiser she returned to service following year when squadron was reactivated in may friedrich carl served as flagship and squadron also included ironclads and ships visited norway on cruise kronprinz was again left in reserve for 1880 but she was recommissioned in 1881 to replace new armored corvette which was suffering from unreliable engines once again ships remained in german waters next two years followed same pattern engine problems plagued ship throughout her career kronprinzs engines broke down during fleet maneuvers in may 1883 two of three other armored frigates also broke down which forced cancellation of maneuvers later that year training cycle concluded with a large scale simulated attack on kiel with kronprinz and other ironclads acting as an eastern opponent defenders led by corvettes and were judged to have been victorious armored fleet operated entirely under steam power that year first time it did so kronprinz was docked for modernization in late 1883 she received new boilers and six hotchkiss revolver cannon and six torpedo tubes were installed by 1884 four s had entered service and they formed training squadron that year kronprinz had anti torpedo nets installed in 1885 these were later removed in 1897 in 1887 she was present for ceremonies marking beginning of construction of kaiser wilhelm canal which was to link kiel with north sea ship served on active duty with fleet until 22 august 1901 when she was stricken from naval register she was reconstructed at imperial dockyard in kiel that year propulsion system was overhauled and eight j penn sons boilers were removed two durr and two thornycroft boilers were installed in their place her barque rig was cut down to after emerging from reconstruction kronprinz served as a training ship for engine room personnel based in kiel ship was ultimately sold to bonn a german ship breaking firm on 3 october 1921 for 5 000 000 marks kronprinz was broken up for scrap in rendsburg audorf later that year notes references external links category ships of prussian navy category ships built in cubitt town category ironclad warships of imperial german navy
