auxiliaries and porters and 150 soldiers joined with dhanis 26 000 men for an assault on fortified town in subsequent fighting belgian forces assisted by artillery killed 3 000 of slaver s men blew up their powder magazines and burnt town still in kasongo by february mohun had intended to take a force of some sixty soldiers 100 porters and 90 others to tanganyika where he planned to catch a steamer to south africa to arrange passage to congolese coast from there he planned to settle his affairs resign his post and return to america he hoped in process to intercept a slave caravan that had been fleeing eastwards from expedition loaded with slaves ivory and gold instead mohun recognised for leading role he played in many of engagements was in march 1894 appointed by dhanis to be second in command of an expedition to determine whether there was a navigable watercourse between lake tanganyika and upper lualaba river expedition encountered difficulties in traversing terrain and waterways of country and with hostile natives mohun discovered confluence of and rivers and was able to disprove existence of lake which had been marked on many maps at this location river itself proved to be highly variable ranging from to just 90m in width contained in gorges up to 1 200m deep and with one 110 km stretch proving entirely unnavigable by canoe mohun recorded that soil in valley was highly fertile local barua people quite numerous and named two new peaks mount dhanis and mount cleveland thumb expedition commander dr hinde depicted in 1897 expedition reached as far as mount buli on river when its commander dr sidney langford hinde fell ill with an abscess on liver mohun assumed command from 11 april and successfully completed remainder of task mohun delivered hinde who was incapable even of sitting upright or eating through native attacks to kasongo on 25 april hinde s abscess which could not be treated as there was no other doctor nearer than basoko successfully resolved itself

country mohun continued his work to eradicate slave trade made several surveying expeditions established new trade markets and assisted in suppression of cannibalism he estimated that there were 20 million cannibals in free state and spoke of witnessing both a cannibal feast and practice of burying people alive mohun s work in congo has been described as last spectacular contribution by an american in opening up country record he kept of this expedition was used by belgian author and cartographer aj to compose a map of lomami river which was published in 1901 thumb left a display of articles from congo arab war mohun had remained us commercial agent throughout this time and insisted on drawing no pay from belgian government for his services though he did receive 5000 from societe anonyme belge pour le commerce du haut congo although he never held a commission in belgian army during this and later expeditions he would often wear a uniform to maintain discipline amongst his men mohun is quoted as saying of reason for choosing to assist belgian military operations that i prefer killing arabs in interior to killing time at boma in 1894 he was awarded honorary membership of societe royale belge de geographie royal belgian geographical society and leopold i appointed him a chevalier of royal order of lion for his accomplishments in slaver war mohun also received decorations from united kingdom and france for his work in congo mohun s stated priority in congo was to improve conditions for inhabitants by bringing them within belgian sphere of influence he also claimed that popular image of belgian brutality in region was a lie spread by missionaries a statement contradicted by evidence of unnecessary cruelty by belgian troops it seems that mohun later had second thoughts about removal of arab slavers from congo and their replacement by pro belgian congolese village chiefs in late 1890s he made his views known to roger casement british irish diplomat who was then campaigning for reform in congo mohun stated we were all called upon to admire as an achievement of civilisation over barbarism removal of arab slavers but that i believe arabs when they permanently occupied a country did a very great deal of good much more than they will ever be given credit for it was then his and casement s belief that slavery still exists for native i believe change has been for worst as they certainly don t have same respect for a dirty native chief as they had for powerful arab always clean and even worst of them with manners of gentlemen mohun also recounts case of a town of 3 000 houses and up to 45 000 inhabitants that he encountered within a year of a free state army post being established there town had been completely destroyed in 1896 he noted that one of belgian generals had encouraged cruelty and that situation improved after he was recalled by king leopold zanzibar thumb 300px front cover of mohun s photographic portfolio of anglo zanzibar war due to frequent expeditions mohun carried out in congo mohun was unable to spend much time on his duties as commercial agent us state department was perhaps surprisingly pleased with mohun s undiplomatic conduct in assisting belgians this may have been because he did not receive a salary for his work and assisted in making congo more commercially stable mohun left congo and returned to united states where he married harriette louise barry from new york city and had his congo report presented to congress after a short period of leave mohun was appointed to be state department s consul to zanzibar on may 24 1895 his appointment which he then held until november 22 1897 may have been a reward for his work in free state mohun was not replaced as commercial agent and office ceased to exist in july 1895 next us government appointment to free state was not until 1906 when a consul general was appointed mohun arranged a period of five minutes between his resignation as commercial agent and acceptance of post of consul so that he could accept his order of lion without contravening us constitutions title of nobility clause that prohibits those holding public office from accepting gifts from foreign powers harriette accompanied mohun to zanzibar and on april 18 1896 gave birth to their first son reginald dorsey mohun casement served as reginald s

authorities on 6 july 1897 he informed his superiors of an outbreak of smallpox on island among indian and native population and that an english missionary had been attacked for carrying a victim around in his arms mohun was concerned that outbreak might spread to white population and noted that vaccination doses had been ordered from marseilles for native population during his time in africa

white nile mohun accepted position despite just months before condemning region as a wretched country in heart of africa mohun left antwerp belgium for africa at end of august 1898 overhead telegraph

free rein to choose his own staff and set out with five electricians engineers including some from britain and france dr horace castellote as medical officer and a military escort commanded by belgian

boxes of trade goods consisting of bells knives locks mirrors music boxes watches clocks fezzes and other odds and ends his diary also notes that spectacles arab made incense and american made cloth were popular and that he used latter to pay his askari escort expedition also included porters to carry equipment and to lay telegraph line in addition to laying telegraph mohun was instructed by

african interior for first time as a result mohun claimed to be known amongst indigenous peoples along route as big master of telephone mohun only white survivor of expedition returned to belgium from west coast congo ports and thus completed an east west traverse of continent mohun claimed to be first american to achieve feat a credit usually given to henry morton stanley for his 1874 77 expedition mohun s claim may have been due to knowing stanley was a naturalised american citizen born in wales he is regarded as one of three americans who played key roles in opening belgian congo to outsiders alongside stanley and missionary william henry sheppard after expedition thumb mohun pictured in 1907 mohun s contract was belgian crown came to an end in october 1901 and he returned to

suggested inclusion of an anthropological exhibit featuring in his words a few pygmies from congo cannibals of course would be amongst congo lot as it would be impossible to bring natives from interior africa without finding a large percentage of man eaters amongst them i am not proposing any dime museum or midway plaisance sort of show make it a part of equatorial african section an integral part of exhibition itself mohun was unsuccessful and never received a formal position with exposition though his suggestion might have led to inclusion of pygmy ota and other african tribesmen as part of exhibition he is believed to have written to roger casement during this time in an attempt to counter accounts of belgian abuses in congo that casement was then compiling for
