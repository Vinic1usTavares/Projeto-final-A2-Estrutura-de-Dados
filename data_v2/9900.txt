party developer for nintendo and was known for creating games in nintendo s long running donkey kong franchise as such game was originally titled diddy kong pilot a sequel to rare s 1997 game diddy kong racing and would feature characters from nintendo s donkey kong and mario franchises while it could be played using gba d pad diddy kong pilot allowed players to control characters by tilting system as cartridge contained same accelerometer technology used in kirby tilt n tumble 2000 rare chose to focus on planes rather than cars because it wanted game to stand out against other gba racers nintendo and rare announced game at e3 in may 2001 and presented demos to attendees there and at nintendo space world in august journalists reacted positively to demos with particular praise for visuals nintendo aimed to release diddy kong pilot on 4 march 2002 but became concerned with its quality around time of space world one programmer recalled that nintendo felt tilt was not working well that gba lcd only functioned as intended when aligned with a light source and that a racing game with planes was pointless without a 3d world rare was expected to finish game by october 2001 although it still had to implement numerous game modes programmer believed it should have been cancelled instead company politics also complicated development according to programmer rare was micro managing us into different directions disregarding any hardware or cartridge space limitations by september 2002 game was still unreleased and nintendo rival microsoft acquired rare as microsoft did not compete in handheld market buyout did not affect rare s plans to produce gba games but it lost access to nintendo s mario and donkey kong intellectual property ip after developing gba port of donkey kong country 2 rare staff were told they needed to finish diddy kong pilot but would have to retool it using elements from banjo series banjo was one of ips rare retained after microsoft buyout so project was retitled banjo pilot ip change came to light in july 2003 when microsoft trademarked banjo pilot title rare s paul said retooling took five months game underwent radical changes during transition graphics and presentation were altered and different racetracks were added rare also removed tilt controls as they were unable to improve them soundtrack composed by robin beanland and jamie hughes was unaltered as rare was unable to implement new music staff who developed nintendo 64 n64 banjo games had little involvement but lead designer supervised to make sure content was in line with n64 games both diddy kong pilot prototypes and final game use a mode 7 style game engine but at one point rare switched to one that rendered environments using voxels rare quickly discarded voxel engine due to frame rate problems that arose when characters and weapons were added on 11 august 2003 microsoft announced it would collaborate with thq to publish rare s gba projects including banjo pilot banjo kazooie grunty s revenge 2003 sabre wulf 2004 and it s mr pants 2005 thq released banjo pilot in north america on 12 january 2005 and in europe on 11 february 2005 years after banjo pilots release in 2011 a prototype of diddy kong pilot leaked online reception according to metacritic a video game review aggregator banjo pilot received mixed or average reviews many reviewers thought game lacked originality and believed placing characters in planes was not enough to set it apart from other kart racing games on gba gamespy and nintendo world report nwr noted planes still had behaviours traditionally associated with go karts such as slowing down when not on track nwr also argued manoeuvres planes could do were worthless and did not add anything to experience eurogamer thought planes made game feel more 3d but reduced it to favouring luck over skill additionally nwr believed banjo pilot lacked what made rare s prior racing games r c pro am 1988 and diddy kong racing great while videogamer com wrote that removing nintendo characters and tilt controls prevented game from bringing innovation to kart racing genre game was often labelled a clone of nintendo s mario kart games while critics generally felt banjo pilot was one of better mario kart clones cubed3 and ign both called it second best gba racer after super circuit 2001 they wrote that players would be better off playing a game from that series eurogamer thought players should try banjo pilot before deciding to buy it and gamespy and videogamer com said there was no reason to have it when better games like mario kart and konami krazy racers 2001 were already available on gba ign on other hand argued that similarities to mario kart were not necessarily a bad thing as it allowed for balanced game design and gamespot called game entertaining and favorably compared it to original super mario kart 1992 eurogamer and videogamer com also questioned how appealing game would be to players noting characters such as banjo were relatively obscure and would likely only be recognised by those who played n64 banjo games reviewers said that banjo pilot as a mario kart clone was fine gameplay wise but disagreed over whether this was enough to make it a successful game while ign argued banjo pilot improved upon kart racing formula because of its new features and believed its planes controlled better than go karts videogamer com said game modes were unfulfilling reviewers from cubed3 gamezone ign and nwr praised controls as intuitive and simple although ign believed they scream ed for compatibility with an analogue stick however gamespy called controls overly sensitive and noted they were set to those of a standard airplane which they called counter intuitive eurogamer characterised controls as hard to get used to reviewers singled out multiplayer mode as a highlight with gamespot and gamezone respectively calling it game s strongest feature and gba s best since legend of zelda four swords 2002 although eurogamer wrote it was challenging to find others who owned game boss fights received criticism for their inconsistent difficulties and some felt they distracted from overall experience although cubed3 and gamespy praised rare s effort to innovate difficulty of opponent ai enraged videogamer com critics were more generous towards presentation many praised amount of detail in visuals and animations cubed3 and gamespot respectively compared them to that of a low end n64 game and a mode 7 super nintendo game eurogamer felt they were impressive and used gba s otherwise subpar 3d capabilities to fullest and gamezone called them eye catching steady frame rate was also praised one of only problems ign noticed was pop up that occurred when weapons were picked up visual perception was an area many reviewers faulted as they noted sometimes other racers would block their line of sight videogamer com and gamezone both praised audio which they called one of bearable aspects of game and humorous ign felt music was well composed and fit banjo theme although they did note similarities tracks bore to those from other games and films like aladdin references category 2005 video games
