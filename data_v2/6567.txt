haruj also known as is a large volcanic field spread across in central libya it is one of several volcanic fields in libya along with tibesti and its origin has been attributed to effects of geologic lineaments in crust it contains about 150 volcanoes including numerous basaltic scoria cones and about 30 small shield volcanoes along with craters and lava flows most of field is covered by lava flows that originated in fissure vents rest of flows originated within small shield volcanoes stratovolcanoes and scoria cones some of these vents have large craters volcanism in haruj blocked ancient rivers and led to formation of lake megafezzan volcanic activity in haruj commenced about 6 million years ago and continued into late pleistocene there are a number of individual lava flow generations that were emplaced in haruj volcanic field most recent ones in holocene 2 310 810 years ago there are reports of solfataric activity geography and geomorphology haruj lies in central libya and its highest summit is garet es sebaa above sea level it was first identified as volcanic in 1797 and had a reputation for being difficult to access owing to its remoteness and hostile terrain and was thus avoided by explorers town of al is located northwest of margin of haruj and oil fields can be found north of field field is a low relief expanse of volcanic rocks occasionally interrupted by volcanic cones which covers an area of making it largest of basaltic volcanic fields of northern africa its eruption products reach a thickness of in central sector in form of stacked lava flows total volume of volcanic rocks has been estimated to be about al haruj al aswad black mountain field in northern part of haruj and al haruj al abyad white mountain south are considered to be subdivisions of main haruj volcanic field with aswad covering a much larger surface than abyad or even two separate volcanoes that started overlapping each other during pliocene older lava flows have been completely flattened by erosion while more recent ones still display fresh surface structures and some of recent flows flowed out of mountains into surrounding landscapes surface features include both aa lava traits and pahoehoe lava traits and there are lava channels skylights and tumuli volcanic rocks are usually not very thick their thickness decreasing from in central sector to only a few metres at margins and thus underlying sedimentary rocks often crop out between lava flows vents most of lavas appear to originate in fissure vents under influence of dykes and tectonic faults in addition there are about 150 individual volcanic massifs and more smaller volcanic cones many of which form rows of cones and sometimes have large craters and which occur mainly in al haruj al abyad part of haruj craters range from deep pits with steep inward walls to wide and shallow depressions and craters are often filled with material eroded from their flanks phreatomagmatic processes triggered by groundwater interacting with rising magma have generated some of these large craters while others formed when lava lakes drained through gaps in their rims like fissure vents position of individual cones and massifs is controlled by ground fractures and often reflect activity of dykes and some cones appear to have been active more than once there are about 30 shield volcanoes with heights of such as um el and um el and smaller stratovolcanoes with heights of such as garet el in field some stratovolcanoes are located on shield volcanoes scoria cones consist of lapilli lava bombs and tuffs with pyroclastic material exposed in crater rims formation of scoria cones was at times accompanied by subplinian eruptions that deposited tephra over large areas hydrology small depressions in lava fields contain clay filled ephemeral lakes and a drainage network has developed in parts of field which sometimes carries water during spring some craters show evidence of former and ephemeral crater lakes beginning in messinian growth of volcanic field blocked pre existing drainages forming a closed basin southwest of haruj that was filled by lake megafezzan although it is possible that lake at times overflowed across volcanic field geology haruj is not located close to a plate boundary rather volcanism there and in other african volcanic fields which are located on top of crustal domes has been explained by presence of hotspots but in case of haruj a mantle plume is considered unlikely alternatively volcanism at haruj may be consequence of intersection of three geological structures of paleozoic to tertiary age and melting of shallow mantle or of rifting process of sirte basin wau an namus is sometimes considered to be part of field other volcanic fields in libya are gabal as sawada gabal and tibesti some of which belong to a long line known as tibesti lineament volcanism in general has shifted southward over time although more recent radiometric dating efforts indicate that volcanic activity in fields was more contemporaneous than thought volcanic field overlies a high tertiary surface between paleozoic to tertiary murzuk and sirte basins embayment during miocene reached into haruj mountains a number of swells and tectonic lineaments some of which are located at margins between geologic blocks characterize basement beneath haruj and have influenced location of volcanic vents basement is of eocene to oligocene age and consists of conglomerate dolomite limestone marl and sandstone known as formation where lavas of haruj are thinner it often forms white outcrops composition eruptions at haruj have produced relatively uniform volcanic rocks consisting of olivine basalt that forms a tholeiitic to alkali basalt suite alkaline basalts were originally interpreted as hawaiite minerals contained within volcanic rocks include clinopyroxene olivine plagioclase and titanomagnetite with secondary calcite iddingsite serpentine and zeolite based on compositional differences volcanic rocks have been subdivided into an older and a younger family in some places in northern haruj a modified basalt has been found which is dense and whose olivine has been transformed into iddingsite lavas contain inclusions of lithic material as well as pyroxene and peridotite lherzolite phonolite and trachyte are absent magmas ultimately originated at depths of eruption history oldest volcanic rocks in haruj appear to be not older than pliocene although presence of buried miocene age flows in northern sector of field has been suggested oldest eruptions have been dated to be either 6 4 million years old or of late pliocene age and activity was originally thought to have continued to late pleistocene wau an namus may be 200 000 years old most of field is younger than 2 2 million years ago and output appears to have decreased over time some eruptions may have been large enough to impact regional environment volcanic activity in haruj has been subdivided into a variable number of phases including one six generation scheme and a four class scheme based on composition and age radiometric dating has yielded a late pliocene age for oldest lava flow generation and ages established by paleomagnetic analysis are coherent with those established on basis of degree of erosion of flows oldest generation of lava flows makes up bulk of field and has been completely flattened by erosion save some exceptions pre existent valleys have influenced emplacement of oldest generation lava flows and also that of second oldest albeit to a lesser degree an intermediary lava flow generation has most likely been emplaced during pleistocene lava flows of intermediate age crop out mainly in central part of haruj mountains and have recognizable flow forms their surfaces have lost original microstructures and are often covered with large blocks youngest generations of lava flows are little eroded although they can still be subdivided into an older generation that has lost most of its surface features and a younger generation with fresh surfaces this younger generation has been inferred to post date a wet period that commenced 4000 bce and neolithic youngest dates obtained on lava flows are 2 310 810 years bp prior to discovery of these youngest dates volcanic activity was believed to have ended 100 000 years ago haruj may still be active considering presence of partial melt at bottom of crust and seismic activity of hun graben some toponyms such as garet kibrit sulfur mountain refer to volcanic activity and solfataric activity has been reported in field climate animal life and vegetation temperatures in haruj fluctuate between in january and july respectively volcanic field lies within an arid climate with annual precipitation of but higher parts of mountains are wetter than surroundings 6 000 years ago region was much wetter and extent of sahara was approximately half size of today vegetation occurs in dry valleys barbary sheep birds foxes gazelles and rabbits live in valleys and haruj is used as a pasture by arabs and 4 000 year old petroglyphs in field show antelopes and cattle neolithic stone weapons made out of haruj rocks have been found and several millstones discovered in roman cities of leptis magna and cyrene did originate in volcanic field see also list of volcanoes in libya references
