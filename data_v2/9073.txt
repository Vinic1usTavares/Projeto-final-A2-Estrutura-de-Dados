thumb 500px right tea leaf processing methods for six most common types of tea tea processing is method in which leaves from tea plant camellia sinensis are transformed into dried leaves for brewing tea categories of tea are distinguished by processing they undergo in its most general form tea processing involves different manners and degree of oxidation of leaves stopping oxidation forming tea and drying it innate flavour of dried tea leaves is determined by type of cultivar of tea bush quality of plucked tea leaves and manner and quality of production processing they undergo after processing a tea may be blended with other teas or mixed with to alter flavour of final tea history thumb 300px an 1850 british engraving showing tea cultivation and tea leaf processing history of tea processing corresponds intimately with role that tea played in chinese society and preferred methods of its consumption in ancient chinese society variations of these processing techniques are still used in modern tea processing albeit being far more mechanized green ancient chinese society first encountered tea plant in what is now southern china and processed it as another medicinal herb for use in chinese herbology processing technique used to process fresh tea leaves was to immediately steam fresh tea leaves and dry them for preservation which is likely most ancient chinese form of tea leaf processing this processing method was perfected near end of han dynasty 206 bce 220 ce and produced a dried tea that would be classified today as green tea and quite similar to modern japanese sencha for consumption dried tea leaves were either with water around with other herbs or ground into a powder to be taken straight or in a liquid in manner of matcha with increase of tea s use in chinese herbology production methods changed where processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming rather steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form with paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea a technique well described by lu yu in his work classic of tea tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves which typically required use of a cooked rice slurry mi tang to bind tea brick together preference of producing tea in brick form possibly stems from fact that it can be more easily transported and stored yellow and fermented use of steam in fixation sha qing of tea leaf enzymes is an important step in processing tea with leaves quickly cooled down and then undergoing further processing less tightly controlled methods of it in past resulted in creation of yellow tea when tea leaves were over steamed for fixation or were not quickly spread out doused with water and cooled although green tea was most popular in lu yu s time he personally considered yellow tea to be superior to green even when leaves were quickly cooled if they are left in piles wo dui for too long before processing leaves will begin to undergo microbial fermentation to produce post fermented tea this technique is somewhat similar to composting albeit tightly controlled and still used in production of liu an tea an hui liu an lan cha and was more recently introduced for production of ripe type pu erh tea production of tea in brick forms and their storage also resulted in another type of post fermented tea which was produced by aging long transport and storage times of day unwittingly allowed tea bricks to undergo prolonged exposure to elements and to various microflora which resulted in aging oxidation and fermentation of green brick teas a brick of green tea that had been stored and aged into post fermented tea was charred over charcoal to rid it of layer of detritus dust and shiny multicoloured growths before being broken down into a powder cooked and then consumed by end of tang dynasty 618 green yellow and post fermented tea was commonly used in china and moved from purely being used in herbology to becoming a beverage drunk for pleasure oolong and white tang dynasty was also period when oolong tea was first developed in fujian province it was originally produced in thin brick form known then under name tea bei yuan cha importance of withering process for producing oolong tea was described by poet huang huang fu ran in his poem song lu hong jian qi xia si cai cha which indicated that processing of tea leaves is not a simple task requiring scaling of steep cliffs to pick choicest leaves and withering of leaves under sun and warm winds cai cha fei cai lu yuan yuan shang ceng ya bu xie chun feng nuan ying kuang bai ri xie white tea bai cha was also developed in fujian province with its first mentions in song dynasty document treatise on tea where delicate buds used for producing white tea difficulty in producing it its taste and its rarity were lauded production method of white tea was described by ming dynasty author tian tian yi heng in zhu quan xiao pin produced in 33rd year of jiajing emperor regarding fuding white tea fu ding bai cha in this work he stated that tea buds that have undergone fixation by panning over flames as with green tea is second to a white tea that was simply allowed to dry under sun since it is more natural in taste and lacks flavours imparted by smoke and flames ya cha yi huo zuo zhe wei ci sheng shai zhe wei shang yi geng jin zi ran qie duan yan huo qi er black technique for producing black tea was first developed during late ming dynasty wuyishan fujian either resulting from over oxidation of tea leaves during manufacture of oolong tea or indirectly from methods of manufacturing green and white teas in early 1600s tea producers in wuyi mountains began kneading sun withered tea leaves to them then allowed them to dry under sun thus reaching full oxidation and producing gongfu black tea gong fu hong cha when there was insufficient sun and temperatures were low withered leaves would be processed indoors in warmed rooms and allowed to fully oxidize then smoked dry over pine fires thus producing lapsang souchong according to oral traditions of region discovery of lapsang souchong processing was due to military troops passing through a wuyi s tea factory during last years of ming dynasty causing delays to tea leaf processing thus resulting in a completely oxidized leaf that producer salvaged by drying over a fire built from pine branches by qing dynasty both lapsang souchong and gongfu black tea were well recognized in china and noted in records on mountain wu yi shan zhi by scholar dong tiangong dong tian gong procedure general although each type of tea has different taste smell and visual appearance tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter fungi will grow on tea this form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate tea and may render tea unfit for consumption plucking tea leaves and flushes which includes a terminal bud and two young leaves are picked from camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early spring and early summer or late spring autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common though they occur when climate permits picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed or where labour costs are not prohibitive depending on skill of picker hand picking is performed by pulling flush with a snap of forearm arm or even shoulders with picker grasping tea shoot using thumb and forefinger with middle finger sometimes used in combination tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing quality of tea however it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for production of high quality teas withering wilting tea leaves will begin to wilt soon after picking with a gradual onset of enzymatic oxidation withering is used to remove excess water from leaves and allows a very slight amount of oxidation leaves can be either put under sun or left in a cool breezy room to pull moisture out from leaves appropriate conditions for withering such as temperature and relative humidity are not readily defined in literature as it can vary depending on climate producing region and type of process used however variations in rate of withering such as a hard or soft wither has been shown to influence flavor compounds leaves sometimes lose more than a quarter of their weight in water during withering process is also important in promoting breakdown of leaf proteins into free amino acids and increases availability of freed caffeine both of which change taste of tea disruption known in western tea industry as disruption or leaf maceration teas are bruised or torn in order to promote and quicken oxidation leaves may be lightly bruised on their edges by shaking and tossing in a bamboo tray or tumbling in baskets more extensive leaf disruption can be done by kneading rolling tearing and crushing usually by machinery bruising breaks down structures inside and outside of leaf cells and allows from co mingling of oxidative enzymes with various substrates which allows for beginning of oxidation this also releases some of leaf juices which may aid in oxidation and change taste profile of tea oxidation for teas that require oxidation leaves are left on their own in a climate controlled room where they turn progressively darker this is accompanied by agitation in some cases in this process chlorophyll in leaves is enzymatically broken down and its tannins are released or transformed tea producer may choose when oxidation should be stopped which depends on desired qualities in final tea as well as weather conditions heat and humidity for light oolong teas this may be anywhere from 5 40 oxidation in darker oolong teas 60 70 and in black teas 100 oxidation oxidation is highly important in formation of many taste and aroma compounds which give a tea its liquor colour strength and briskness depending on type of tea desired under or over oxidation can result in grassy flavours or overly thick flavours this process is sometimes referred erroneously as fermentation in tea industry fixation kill green kill green or is done to stop tea leaf oxidation at a desired level this process is accomplished by moderately heating tea leaves thus deactivating their oxidative enzymes and removing unwanted scents in leaves without damaging flavour of tea traditionally tea leaves are panned in a wok or steamed but with advancements in technology kill green is sometimes done by baking or panning in a rolling drum in some white teas and some black teas such as ctc blacks kill green is done simultaneously with drying sweltering yellowing unique to yellow teas warm and damp tea leaves from after kill green are allowed to be lightly heated in a closed container which causes previously green leaves to turn yellow resulting leaves produce a beverage that has a distinctive yellowish green hue due to transformations of leaf chlorophyll through being sweltered for 6 8 hours at close to human body temperatures amino acids and polyphenols in processed tea leaves undergo chemical changes to give this tea its distinct briskness and mellow taste rolling shaping damp tea leaves are then rolled to be formed into wrinkled strips by hand or using a rolling machine which causes tea to wrap around itself this rolling action also causes some of sap essential oils and juices inside leaves to ooze out which further enhances taste of tea strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes such as being rolled into spirals kneaded and rolled into pellets or tied into balls cones and other elaborate shapes in many types of oolong rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing damp leaves in large cloth bags which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner tea can also be pressed into bricks through use of heavy stones or presses thumb glass lantern slide circa 1910 showing a hydraulic tea press of type supplied to co of china for pressing dried tea leaves into flat 2 1 2 pound cakes for shipping to asiatic russia drying drying is done to finish tea for sale this can be done in a myriad of ways including panning sunning air drying or baking baking is usually most common great care must be taken to not over cook leaves drying of produced tea is responsible for many new flavour compounds particularly important in green teas aging curing while not always required some teas required additional aging fermentation or baking to reach their drinking potential for instance a green tea prior to curing into a post fermented tea is often bitter and harsh in taste but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness additionally oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their sorting tea sorting can help remove physical impurities such as stems and seeds using a sorting equipment to improve tea production efficiency is very common in a tea processing plants especially in black tea processing a color sorter may also be used to classify final product grades according to color and shape type specific tea is traditionally classified based on degree or period of oxidation or fermentation leaves have undergone green tea this tea has undergone least amount of oxidation oxidation process is halted by quick application of heat after tea picking either with steam method preferred in japan or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans preferred in chinese tea processing tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea this process is time consuming and is typically done with of higher quality tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting and if done correctly retains most of chemical composition of fresh leaves from which it was produced variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering flavour for types of green tea green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting panning or steaming generally roasted varieties are richer in flavor while steamed varieties are more vivid in color yellow tea this tea is processed in a similar manner to green tea but instead of immediate drying after fixation it is stacked covered and gently heated in a humid environment this initiates oxidation in chlorophyll of leaves through non enzymatic and non microbial means which results in a yellowish or greenish yellow colour white tea young leaves or new growth buds that have undergone limited oxidation through a slight amount of withering while naturally sun dried or specifically withered and then halting oxidative processes by baking with optimal withering conditions at 30 degrees celsius 65 relative humidity for 26 hours withering of leaves can last from around one to three days depending on season and temperature of processing environment buds may be shielded from sunlight to prevent formation of chlorophyll tea leaves meant for white teas are not kneaded nor undergo fixation which preserves much of white hair on leaves and gives tea a relatively mild flavour white tea is produced in lesser quantities than most other styles and can be correspondingly more expensive than tea from same plant processed by other methods it is less well known in countries outside of china though this is changing with increased western interest in tea there is an international disagreement on definition of white tea between china and other producing countries where in china term is applied primarily to tea varieties made through white tea process while in other countries term is used generally for teas made through process oolong tea this tea s oxidation is stopped somewhere between standards for green tea and black tea processing typically takes two to three days from withering to drying with a relatively short oxidation period of several hours in this regard most darjeeling teas with light oxidation levels is more similar to green or oolong teas in chinese semi oxidized teas are collectively grouped as blue tea qing cha literally blue green tea celadon tea while term oolong is used specifically as a name for certain semi oxidized teas common wisdom about lightly oxidized teas in taiwan a large producer of oolong is that too little oxidation upsets stomach of some consumers even so some producers attempt to minimize oxidation in order to produce a specific taste or allow tea leaves to be easily rolled into spherical or half sphere form demanded by buyers in market black tea tea leaves are allowed to completely oxidize black tea is first withered to induce protein breakdown and reduce water content 68 77 of original leaves then undergo a process known in industry as disruption or leaf maceration which through bruising or cutting disrupts leaf cell structures releasing leaf juices and enzymes that activate oxidation oxidation process takes between 45 90 minutes to 3 hours and is done at high humidity between 20 30 degrees celsius transforming much of of leaves into complex tannin orthodox processed black teas are further graded according to post production leaf quality by orange system while crush tear curl ctc teas use a different grading system orthodox tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically on a cylindrical rolling table or a rolling table consists of a ridged table top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves of which leaves are pressed down onto table top process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves and particles which are then sorted oxidized and dried rotovane consisted of an auger pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder which crushes and evenly cuts leaves crush tear curl is a production method developed by william in 1930 which uses machines with contra rotating rotors with surfaces patterning that cut and tear leaves producing a product popular for use in tea bags rotovane to often use to precut withered tea prior to ctc and to create broken orthodox processed black tea post fermented tea teas that are allowed to undergo a second oxidation after fixation of tea leaves such as pu erh liu an and are collectively referred to as secondary or post fermentation teas in english in chinese they are categorized as dark tea or black tea this is not to be confused with english term black tea known in chinese as red
