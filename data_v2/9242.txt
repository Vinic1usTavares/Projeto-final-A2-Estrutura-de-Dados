him that thing is a friend that s all he wanted that s what he was trying to protect so i brought him here here he can have all friends in world i mean come on isn t friendship what foster s is all about instantaneously bloo shouts no it s all about me promptly herriman slaps him with a glove to delight of everyone else world adapts to new environment and lives as a stuffed rag doll in home

respectively destination imagination was co written by foster s home for imaginary friends co creator lauren faust along with tim mckeon other series co founder craig mccracken directed it along with rob renzetti special was conceived by four along with darrick bachman edward baker vaughn tada and alex kirwan as a means of creating an adventure story to send gang on a fantastic quest character of world was created as a means to have an imaginary friend that was an entire world instead of usual sentient being that you hang out with baker suggested that character should be portrayed as a young child which mccracken agreed because it brought originality to story and allowed him to be more emotional to not understand bigger picture to be confused and vulnerable and like a kid to throw a fit when they don t get their way special was written with goal of telling story in most honest and sincere way writers attempted to continue tense and unpleasant relationship between frankie and mr herriman which they had begun developing since series began but approaching it in a believable and sensible fashion with heavy plot running through special writers tried to use bloo and his companions as a means to add humor into it they wrote bloo to be more obnoxious and demanding than previously but did not want him to be cruel or malicious a lot of special was more edgy and dark than what had been done previously on foster s home for imaginary friends a major reason behind this was peril danger and conflict that constructed plot so heavily mccracken explains when we start a show one of first things we think about is tone is this a goofy one is it a serious one whatever it may be we stay true to that tone this one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way this was
