61st infantry division was an infantry division of british army raised in 1939 as part of expansion of territorial army in response to german occupation of czechoslovakia division was created as a duplicate of 48th south midland infantry division and was assigned to home defence duties while division was never deployed overseas its headquarters staff was deployed to norway and briefly fought in norwegian campaign afterwards division was deployed to northern ireland for almost three years as a result of rumours of a german intention to invade in northern ireland division manned static defences conducted internal security and trained for future operations returning to england division participated in military exercises and was scheduled to join 21st army group for operation overlord allied invasion of german occupied france it lost this role in late 1943 and was assigned to train replacements for combat units throughout 1944 division aided overlord in various deception formats while most of men were posted to combat formations within 21st army group in late 1945 division was reorganised as a light division and was going to be deployed to far east to fight imperial japan move was cancelled following japanese surrender and division was disbanded in november 1945 background in 1930s tensions increased between germany and united kingdom and its allies during late 1937 and throughout 1938 german demands for annexation of czechoslovakia s sudetenland led to an international crisis in an attempt to avoid war britain s prime minister neville chamberlain met with german chancellor adolf hitler in september and brokered munich agreement agreement averted immediate war and allowed germany to annexe sudetenland chamberlain had intended agreement to lead to peaceful resolution of further issues but relations between both countries continued to deteriorate on 15 march 1939 germany breached terms of agreement by invading and occupying remaining provinces of bohemia and moravia in response on 29 march british secretary of state for war leslie hore belisha announced plans to increase territorial army ta from 130 000 men to 340 000 and in so doing double number of ta divisions plan of action was for existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments aided by an increase in pay for territorials removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during preceding years construction of better quality barracks and an increase in rations and then form second line divisions from small cadres that could be built upon as a result 61st infantry division was to be created as a second line unit a duplicate of first line 48th south midland infantry division in april limited conscription was introduced this involved 34 500 militiamen all aged 20 who were conscripted into regular army initially to be trained for six months before being deployed to forming second line units despite intention for army to grow programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on expansion and duplication process and issues regarding lack of facilities equipment and instructors history initial service it was envisioned that duplicating process and recruiting required numbers of men would take no more than six months some ta divisions had made little progress by time second world war began others were able to complete this work within a matter of weeks by outbreak of war division was active under general officer commanding major general robert j collins and was composed of 182nd 183rd and 184th infantry brigades and supporting elements following division s formation it was assigned to southern command at end of november major general adrian carton de wiart took command division was spread out ranging from birmingham to portsmouth and cheltenham to reading and with headquarters in oxford on 15 april carton de wiart as well as divisional staff were deployed to norway major general edmond schreiber assumed command of 61st division and was assigned a new divisional staff headquarters deployed to norway thumb right upright alt major general adrian carton de wiart held command of division from november 1939 until april 1941 in their opening assault upon norway german troops had seized trondheim in response british army planned to launch a two pronged pincer attack to retake city troops to undertake this attack came from 49th west riding infantry division a first line ta division which had already been earmarked for service in norway prior to german invasion division was temporarily broken up its brigades acting as individual commands 146th infantry brigade which would make up bulk of mauriceforce and form northern pincer began landing on 17 april due to time restraints and troops already assigned to expedition 61st division was not deployed to norway instead carton de wiart was given command of mauriceforce and was allowed to select his staff which he drew from his headquarters southern pincer to south and separated by mountainous terrain and rivers was to be undertaken by major general bernard paget s that had landed at andalsnes soon after arriving 146th brigade s leading battalions began to move south on 21 april carton de wiart s troops engaged in first encounter of war between british and german troops british largely confined to road network and advancing in deep snow were engaged by a slightly larger german force that was supported by artillery and air support germans utilizing sledges motorcycles and ski troops were able to outmanoeuvre and force back british german follow up attacks did not materialise but luftwaffe heavily bombed small port at namsos carton de wiart cabled war office and stated with my lack of equipment i was quite incapable of advancing on trondheim and could see very little point in remaining in that part of norway sitting out like rabbits in snow evacuation was not ordered until end of month and then completed in early days of may after loss of 157 men of mauriceforce lack of success in norway and withdrawal of forces attempting to retake trondheim resulted in collapse of chamberlain s government carton de wiart considered a daring and aggressive commander was per historian jack adams hampered by climatic and geographic conditions and his troops were inexperienced poorly prepared and badly backed up deployment to northern ireland thumb left alt men of 6th battalion royal berkshire regiment undertaking battle training at coleraine northern ireland 16 june 1941 as early as mid may 1940 while battle of france was still being waged british government began to fear that germany would immediately launch an invasion of british isles this fear was compounded by as historian paul mcmahon commented catastrophic allied defeats that soon followed which produced two hysterias in summer of 1940 first fear of imminent invasion and second a fifth column panic initial fear of invasion was aroused by alleged capture of german documents by dutch which contained plans for a german invasion as well as information regarding a simultaneous attack on ireland by paratroopers who were to be assisted by irish republican army ira this document which no longer exists caused panic within british government information was reinforced in following months by reports warning of a german intent to invade ireland from diplomatic missions and secret intelligence service sis on 14 may following his return to united kingdom carton de wiart resumed command of 61st infantry division schreiber had left division two days previously to take command of 45th infantry division after british expeditionary force bef was evacuated from france british acted on rumours of german intent to invade ireland and decision was made to reinforce garrison 53rd welsh infantry division by deploying 61st infantry division in ensuing 12 months division would be followed by 5th and 48th south midland divisions and 71st and 72nd independent infantry brigades thumb right alt men of 6th royal berkshire regiment manning a roadblock practice attacking german tanks mcmahon commented that sis had a history of furnish ing unreliable information on ira s foreign intrigues but these past failures were ignored as reports reinforced fears of invasion mcmahon suggested that it is even possible that plans discovered in holland were planted whether deliberate deception or not british intelligence was well and truly deceived historian o halpin argued that while dutch document could be seen as a british fabrication it is now known that german deception operations prepared in anticipation of operation sealion included manufacturing of rumours and stories of plans to attack ireland as a feint during build up to an invasion of southern england nicholas mansergh commented that ireland had no place in initial sealion plans and it was not until 3 december 1940 that german planners even looked at possibility before concluding that such an operation was not possible or if launched would result in failure in his memoirs carton de wiart commented i can never believe germans had any intention of invading ireland but i am very grateful for any reason which sent us there for it was an ideal training ground for troops and division improved enormously from moment of our arrival 61st moved to northern ireland and came under command of northern ireland district on 20 june division was responsible for manning static defences across northern ireland and defending belfast as well as being responsible for internal security of country while based across most of northern ireland it was largely positioned within county antrim county londonderry and county tyrone with divisional headquarters at division trained to repel seaborne invasions from german forces as well as airborne landings and small raids beaches of county antrim and londonderry were seen as most likely areas for an invasion and by end of autumn concrete pillars barbed wire entanglements and camouflaged firing positions had been constructed during division s stay in northern ireland lieutenant general henry pownall took command of british forces in country his appointment resulted in carton de wiart losing command of division on grounds of his age one month shy of his 61st birthday carton de wiart was replaced by major general charles fullbrook leggatt who assumed command on 6 april 1941 in june 1942 division took part in first major joint anglo american exercise with newly arrived u s army troops this exercise a 10 day event

exercise was designed to analyse problems that would arise after a force had landed on a hostile shore and was advancing from a bridgehead exercise revealed weaknesses in elements of senior leadership in particular officers in overall command of armies deployed for exercise and highlighted improvements made in general by infantry spartan was followed in april and may by exercise jantzen this was an administrative undertaking by division and headquarters of i corps aimed at improving support techniques that would be used in upcoming invasion of europe in may division was transferred to ii corps and moved to kent after which major general charles wainwright took command holding this position until end of war division was earmarked for a role in operation overlord and marcus cunliffe wrote that exercise spartan seemed to be every indication that division was to be a front line unit in september division in conjunction with 1st polish armoured division was placed under control of ii canadian corps for exercise link in months following exercise division was relegated to lower establishment status this meant that division was now to be strictly used for home defence in a static role compared to higher establishment divisions that were intended for deployment overseas and combat as part of this change in priorities division also became a training formation and one intended to find suitable replacements for fighting formations by october division had also been assigned to anti invasion duties in kent while based there german cross channel guns periodically shelled area and

845 men of this number around 13 000 were available as replacements for 21st army group fighting in france remaining 4 800 men were considered ineligible at that time for service abroad for a variety of reasons including a lack of training or being medically unfit over following six months up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce 21st army group following completion of their training and certification of fitness for example those eligible for overseas service from 9th battalion worcestershire regiment were transferred to 21st army group battalion was then tasked with training those who were considered unfit re training soldiers who had recovered from wounds and training men from anti aircraft units to become infantry on 18 july hq residue concentration area

transferred to europe to reinforce 21st army group on 1 september 184th infantry brigade while remaining part of division was transferred to orkney and shetland islands for a two month stint as defensive garrison over remainder of year and into 1945 makeup of division changed but its role remained same for example role of 4th battalion devonshire regiment was to find drafts for other battalions fighting overseas light division and disbandment in august 1945 at conclusion of war in europe 61st division was reorganised as a light division light division concept had been undertaken during burma campaign following initial defeats historian f w perry commented that indian army concluded that existing indian formations were over mechanised and road bound therefore surviving 17th indian division was reorganised as a light division this included being reduced to two infantry brigades all non cross country capable vehicles being replaced with mules jeeps and four wheel drive trucks and field artillery either completely replaced by pack howitzers or mechanised these changes greatly increased off road mobility and increase in pack animals allowed it to operate away from a road network for an extended period of time 61st division retained its three infantry brigades although there were changes to divisional troops along above lines it was intended that division would be able to be transferred by air to any theatre of war and its personnel trained to fight in any terrain encountered once on ground entire division would be mobile utilizing only jeeps to help adapt to this new role training exercises were carried out initial destination for division was far east to support fight against imperial japan but japanese surrender resulted in move being cancelled and
