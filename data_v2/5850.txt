considered to have been most extensive of fatimid builders credited with at least thirteen major landmarks including completion of great palaces cairo mosque a fortress a belvedere a bridge and public baths fatimid caliphs competed with rulers of abbasid and byzantine empires and indulged in luxurious palace building their palaces their greatest architectural achievements are known only by written descriptions however several surviving tombs mosques gates and walls mainly in cairo retain original elements although they have been extensively modified or rebuilt in later periods notable extant examples of fatimid architecture include great mosque of mahdiya and al azhar mosque al hakim mosque juyushi and lulua of cairo although heavily influenced by architecture from mesopotamia and byzantium fatimids introduced or developed unique features such as four centred keel arch and squinch connecting square interior volumes to dome their mosques followed hypostyle plan where a central courtyard was surrounded by arcades with their roofs usually supported by keel arches initially resting on columns with leafy corinthian capitals they typically had features such as portals that protrude from wall domes above mihrabs and qiblas and facade ornamentation with iconographic inscriptions and stucco decorations woodwork of doors and interiors of buildings was often finely carved fatimids also made considerable development towards mausoleum building mashad a shrine that commemorates a descendant of prophet muhammad was a characteristic type of fatimid architecture three fatimid era gates in cairo bab al nasr 1087 bab al futuh 1087 and bab zuweila 1092 built under orders of vizier badr al jamali r 1074 1094 have survived though they have been altered over centuries they have byzantine architectural features with little trace of eastern islamic tradition recently a neo fatimid style has emerged used in restorations or in modern shia mosques by dawoodi bohra which claims continuity from original fatimid architecture background origins thumb 240px fatimid caliphate after conquest of egypt around 969 ce fatimid caliphate originated in an ismaili shia movement launched in salamiyah on western edge of syrian desert by abd allah al akbar a claimed eight generation descendant of islamic prophet muhammad through prophet s daughter fatimah in 899 his grandson to be known as abd allah al mahdi became leader of movement he fled from his enemies to sijilmasa in morocco where he proselytized under guise of being a merchant he was supported by a militant named abu abd allah al shi i who organized a berber uprising that overthrew tunisian aghlabid dynasty and then invited al mahdi to assume position of imam and caliph empire grew to include sicily and to stretch across north africa from atlantic to libya fatimid caliphs built three capital cities which they occupied in sequential order mahdia 921 948 and al mansuriya 948 973 in ifriqiya and cairo 973 1169 in egypt ifriqiya mahdia was a walled city located on a peninsula that projected into mediterranean from coast of what is now tunisia then part of ifriqiya carthaginian port of zella had once occupied site mahdia was founded in 913 by abdullah al mahdi billah first fatimid imam and later was port from which fatimid invasion of egypt was launched al mahdi built great mosque of mahdiya earliest fatimid mosque in new city other buildings erected nearby at that time have since disappeared but monumental access gate and portico in north of mosque are preserved from original structure al mansuriya near kairouan tunisia was capital of fatimid caliphate during rules of imams al mansur billah r 946 953 and al mu izz li din allah r 953 975 built between 946 and 972 it was a circular walled city holding elaborate palaces surrounded by gardens artificial pools and water channels caliph al mu izz moved from city to new city of al qahira cairo in 973 but al mansuriya continued to serve as provincial capital in 1057 it was abandoned and destroyed any useful objects or materials were scavenged during centuries that followed today only faint traces remain egypt 1830 view of gate of bab al nasr cairo built by badr al jamali in 1087 thumb 240px fatimid general jawhar al siqilli built a new palace city near to fustat upon conquering egypt in 969 which he at first called al mansuriyya after capital in tunisia when al mu izz arrived in 973 name was changed to al qahira cairo new city incorporated elements of design of al mansuriya although it was rectangular rather than circular in plan both cities had mosques named al azhar after prophet s daughter fatima al azhar and both had gates named bab al futuh and bab both cities had two palaces for caliph and for his heir opposite and facing each other al aziz billah 955 996 is generally considered to have been most extensive of fatimid builders aided in part by funds generated through his father al mu izz s tax reforms al aziz is credited with at least 13 major building works during this reign from 975 until his death including golden palace cairo mosque a fortress a belvedere a bridge and public baths his mother durzan widow of al mu izz was also responsible for ordering commencement of building projects mainly in qarafa area ordering construction of second mosque in cairo jami al qarafa mosque in 975 similar to first mosque al azhar mosque it had some fourteen gates but was later destroyed by fire leaving only its green mihrab durzan is also credited with ordering construction of qarafa palace a public bath cistern or pool and a royal garden and hydraulic pump for abu l ma lum fortress she also ordered a well to be built in courtyard of ibn tulun mosque in 995 a pavilion overlooking nile called al izz and her own mausoleum in qarafa badr al jamali was also a noted builder sponsoring numerous state architectural projects and restoration works during his rule from 1074 1094 particularly with mosques restoring minarets in upper egypt and building mosques in lower egypt he also built many of gates and fortifications in cairo architectural style thumb 240px entrance gate of great mosque of mahdiya in this early structure arch is round rather than keel shaped according to ira m lapidus public architecture under fatimids was an extension of ceremonial aspects of royal court and was also intricately made fatimid architecture drew together decorative and architectural elements from east and west and spanned from early islamic period to middle ages making it difficult to categorize architecture that developed as an indigenous form under fatimids incorporated elements from samarra seat of abbasids as well as coptic and byzantine features most early buildings of fatimid period were of brick although from 12th century onward stone gradually became chief building material fatimids combined elements of eastern and western architecture drawing on abbasid north african greek and indigenous coptic traditions and bridged between early islamic styles and medieval architecture of mamluks fatimids were unusually tolerant of people with different ethnic origins and religious views and were adept at exploiting their abilities thus many of works of fatimid architecture reflect architectural details imported from northern syria and mesopotamia probably in part due to fact that they often employed architects from these places to construct their buildings fatimid architecture in egypt drew from earlier tulunid styles and techniques and used similar types of material while also consciously adhering to abbasid architectural concepts architecture is more influenced by mediterranean cultures and less by iranian while fatimid architecture followed traditional plans and aesthetics it differed in architectural details such as massive portals of some mosques and their elaborate facades scholars such as dogan kuban describe fatimid architecture as inventive more in decoration than in broad architectural concept although he acknowledges that fatimids contributed to a distinct style of mosque fatimids introduced or developed usage of four centred keel arch and muqarnas squinch a feature connecting square to dome muqarnas squinch was a complex innovation in it a niche was placed between two niche segments over which there was another niche it is possible that this design had iranian inspiration a similar system was applied to window building according to de lacy o leary horse shoe arch was developed in egypt under fatimid rule and is not of persian origin as is commonly thought this architectural style can be witnessed in north african fatimid mosques as well as al jame al a mosque of which central dome and courtyard has been constructed long after fatimids relocated their capital to egypt palaces palaces of caliphs their greatest architectural achievements have been destroyed and are known only from written descriptions heartland of architectural activity and expression during fatimid rule was at al qahira on outskirts of cairo on eastern side of nile where many of palaces mosques and other buildings were built caliphs competed with their rivals of abbasid and byzantine empires and were known to indulge in furnishing their palaces with extraordinary splendor palaces had gold rafters to support ceilings and caliphs typically asked for a golden throne encased with a curtain similar to those of rulers of abbasids and byzantines furniture and ceramics were elegantly adorned with motifs of birds and animals which were said to bring good luck and depictions of hunters and musicians and dancers of court which reflected exuberance of fatimid palace life fountains were installed in palaces to cool atmosphere mausoleums thumb 240px ruqayya mashhad in cairo mashad is a characteristic type of fatimid building a shrine that commemorates a descendant of prophet muhammad tombs of fatimid caliphs were also treated as shrines most of were straightforward square structures with a dome but a few of mausoleums at aswan were more complex and included side rooms during rule of al hafiz r 1130 1149 several mausoleums and mosques were rebuilt to honour notable female figures in shi i history caliphs also built tombs for their wives and daughters most of fatimid mausoleums have either been destroyed or have been greatly altered through later renovations mashad al juyushi also called mashad badr al jamali is an exception this building has a prayer hall covered with cross vaults with a dome resting on squinches over area in front of mihrab it has a courtyard with a tall square minaret it is not clear whom mashhad commemorates two other important from fatimid era in cairo are those of sayyida ruqayya and al shabib in fustat cemetery sayyida ruqayya a descendant of ali never visited egypt but mashhad was built to commemorate her it is similar to al juyushi but with a larger fluted dome and with an elegantly decorated mihrab mosques plan and decoration of fatimid mosques reflect shiite doctrine and that mosques were often used for royal ceremonial purposes characteristic architectural styles of fatimid mosques include portals that protrude from wall domes above mihrabs and qiblas porches and arcades with keel shaped arches supported by a series of columns facade ornamentation with iconographic inscriptions and stucco decorations mosques followed hypostyle plan where a central courtyard was surrounded by arcades with their roofs usually supported by keel arches initially resting on columns with corinthian capitals arches held inscription bands a style that is unique to fatimid architecture later columns often had a bell shaped capital with same shape mirrored to form base prayer niche was architecturally more elaborate with features such as a dome or transept fatimid architects built modified versions of coptic keel arched niches with radiating fluted hoods and later extended concept to fluted domes woodwork of doors and interiors of buildings was often finely carved early fatimid mosques such as mosque of qarafa did not have a minaret later mosques built in egypt and in ifriqiya incorporated brick minarets which were probably part of their original designs these were derived from early abbasid forms of minaret minarets later evolved to characteristic incense burner shape where a lower rectangular shaft supported an octagon section that was capped by a ribbed helmet almost all of cairo s fatimid minarets were destroyed by an earthquake in 1303 some floating mosques were located above shops for first time facade of mosque was aligned with street and was elaborately decorated decorations were in wood stucco and stone including marble with geometrical and floral patterns and arabesques with samarran and byzantine origins decorations were more complex than earlier islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints imposing architecture and decoration of fatimid buildings such as al hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported dual role of fatimid caliph as both religious and political leader thumb 240px interior of great mosque of mahdiya showing twinned columns great mosque of mahdiya great mosque of mahdiya was built in mahdia tunisia in 916 ce 303 304 in islamic calendar on an artificial platform reclaimed from sea as mentioned by andalusian geographer al bakri after founding of city in 909 by first fatimid imam abdullah al mahdi billah internally great mosque had a layout similar to other mosques in region a transverse aisle paralleled qibla wall with nine aisles at right angles to transverse original qibla wall was destroyed by sea erosion and had to be rebuilt reducing size of prayer hall like other mosques in region orientation of qibla differs significantly from true great circle route to mecca unlike other north african mosques great mosque did not have minarets and had a single imposing entrance this is first known example of a projecting monumental porch in a mosque which may have been derived from architecture of secular buildings mosque at ajdabiya in libya had a similar plan although it did not have same monumental entrance like mahdiya mosque for same ideological reasons ajdabiya mosque did not have a minaret al azhar mosque thumb 240px al azhar mosque and university al azhar mosque was commissioned by caliph al mu izz li din allah for newly established capital city of cairo its name is a tribute to name of fatima al azhar daughter of prophet mohammed jawhar al siqilli commander of fatimid army started construction of mosque in 970 it was first mosque established in city first prayers were held there in 972 and in 989 mosque authorities hired 35 scholars making it a teaching centre for shia theology a waqf for mosque was established in 1009 by caliph al hakim al azhar mosque in cairo seems to have had a similar projecting entrance to great mosque of mahdiya original building had an open central courtyard with three arcades its layout was similar to kairouan and samarra mosques these had round arches on pre islamic columns with corinthian capitals there were three domes indicative of location of prayer hall two at corners of qibla wall and one over prayer niche and a small brick minaret over main entrance gallery around courtyard had series of columns and prayer hall which had domes built over it had five more rows of five pillars minor alterations were made by caliphs al hakim bi amr allah in 1009 and al amir bi ahkami l lah in 1125 caliph al hafiz 1129 1149 made significant further changes adding a fourth arcade with keel arches and a dome with elaborate carved stucco decorations in front of transept since then mosque has been greatly enlarged and modified over years of original building little remains other than arcades and some of stucco decoration mosque of qarafa thumb 240px chamfered corner of aqmar mosque in cairo an unusually detailed description of mosque of qarafa in cairo built by two noblewomen in 976 has been left by historian al i who died around 1062 1065 he said it seems probable from this description that mosque had a portal that projected from wall as did earlier great mosque of mahdiya in other respects it seems to have resembled al azhar mosque in layout architecture and decoration although geographers al muqaddasi and ibn hawqal both praised this mosque neither left specific descriptions of this or any other mosque thus ibn hawqal says of it only that it is one of mosques distinguished by spaciousness of its court elegance of construction and fineness of its ceilings al hakim mosque thumb 240px interior courtyard of al hakim mosque cairo al hakim mosque is named after imam al hakim bi amr allah 985 1021 third fatimid caliph to rule in egypt construction of mosque started in 990 in 1002 3 caliph al hakim ordered completion of building southern minaret has an inscription with his name and date of 393 1003 significant changes were made to minarets in 1010 at first mosque was outside city walls but when badr al jamali rebuilt walls he enclosed a larger area and north wall of mosque became part of new stone city wall mosque was badly damaged in 1303 earthquake and suffered further damage in later years by nineteenth century it was ruined but has since been reconstructed mosque is an irregular rectangle with four arcades that surround courtyard as with ibn tulun mosque arches are pointed and rest on brick piers it resembles al azhar mosque in having three domes along qibla wall one at each corner and one over mihrab also like al azhar prayer hall is crossed by a transept at right angles to qibla this wide and tall central aisle leading to prayer niche borrows from mahdiya mosque s design al hakim mosque differs from al azhar and ibn tulun mosques in having two stone minarets at corners of stone facade which has a monumental projecting portal like mosque of mahdiya other cairo mosques lulua mosque located in southern cemetery of hills was built in 1015 16 during reign of third caliph al hakim mosque was built on a promontory of limestone and consisted originally of a three storey tower like structure built over a rectangular plan it exhibited typical aspects of fatimid architectural style with portals with slight protrusions mihrabs and qibla walls several domes and columned porches with triple arches or keel shaped arches mosque partially collapsed in 1919 but was later refurbished in 1998 by dawoodi bohras juyushi mosque was built by badr al jamali amir al juyush commander of forces of fatimids mosque was completed in 1085 under patronage of then caliph and imam ma ad al mustansir billah it was built on an end of hills which would ensure a view of cairo city aqmar mosque was built in under vizier al ma mun al bata ihi during caliphate of imam al amir bi ahkami l lah mosque is located on north muizz street it is notable for its facade which is elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric carving it is both first mosque in cairo to have such decoration and also first to have a facade which follows line of street built at an angle to rectangular hypostyle hall whose orientation is dictated by qibla direction cairo fortifications thumb 240px walls in cairo between bab al nasr and bab al futuh gates these gates were rebuilt by badr al jamali using stone in 1087 a new city wall was built around cairo on orders of vizier badr al jamali r 1074 1094 cairo had expanded beyond original city walls and city faced threats from east notably by turkoman ibn commander of seljuk army in fact fortifications were never put to test three of gates in new walls have survived bab al nasr 1087 bab al futuh 1087 and bab zuweila 1092 bab al futuh and bab zuweila were built at northern and southern ends of muizz street main axis of fatimid cairo al jamali an armenian in origin is said to have employed armenians from north of mesopotamia as well as syrians in his extensive building works each gate was said to have been built by a different architect gates have byzantine architectural features with little trace of islamic tradition according to maqrizi gates were built by three christian monks from edessa who had fled from there are no surviving structures similar to gates near edessa or in armenia but stylistic evidence indicates that byzantine origins for design are entirely plausible al jamali preferred stone as medium for his building works introducing a new style into cairo architecture all three gates have massive towers linked by curtain walls above passageways they introduced architectural features new to egypt including pendentives that support domes above passageways of bab al futuh and bab zuweila gates and intersecting barrel vaults use of semi circular and horizontal arches and lack of pointed arches represented a departure from normal fatimid architecture probably taken from syrian examples and were never widely used during fatimid period use of stone also reflects syrian tastes passageways through each of gates are long and have vaulted ceilings with hidden openings in their ceilings lower part of each tower is of solid stone while upper third has a vaulted room with arrowslits an unusual feature of wall near bab al nasr is a stone latrine which appears like a balcony wall between bab al nasr and bab al futuh contains an inscription of quranic texts in kufic characters bab al futuh thumb right 240px bab al futuh in cairo 2008 bab al futuh is a gate in north wall of old city built in 1087 it stands at northern end of muizz street name futuh means conquest gate had rounded towers with both of their facades incorporating a design of two parallel carved lines with loops between them no earlier use of this decorative style is known although it became common in mamluk period there are carved brackets above entrance arch two of which have head of a ram this appears to be a survival of pre islamic symbolism however fatimid arabesques decorate brackets bab al nasr bab al nasr is a massive fortified gate built in 1087 with rectangular stone towers name means gate of victory entrance vestibule is cross vaulted there are two shallow domes over upper levels of towers walls are decorated with shields and swords possibly byzantine in design many french inscriptions on bab al nasr indicate use of fort by napoleon s soldiers including tour courbin and tour julien bab zuweila bab zuweila or zuwayla is a medieval gate built in 1092 it is last remaining southern gate from walls of fatimid cairo gate is today commonly called el its name comes from bab meaning door and zuwayla name of a north african tribe towers are semi circular their inner flanks have lobed arches as decorations a north african motif introduced to egypt by fatimids vestibule to right contains a half domed recess with elegantly carved arches at each corner gates were massive weighing four tons gates today have two minarets open to visitors from which area may be viewed additions were made during 15th century restorations and modern mosques thumb 240px lulua mosque completely rebuilt by dawoodi bohra and refurbished in 1998 fatimid buildings have gone through many renovations and in different styles from early mamluk period to modern times mosque exemplifies this process it was built in fatimid period either as a suspended mosque one with shops underneath it or with a high basement after earthquake of 1302 it was rebuilt in 1440 an ablution basin was added and early in ottoman period a minaret was built amir ahmad katkhuda al in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction almost all of original building being replaced apart from two doors these finely carved doors were registered as a historical monument in 1908 by committee of conservation and building itself was registered in 1937 dawoodi bohra a group of around one million ismaili shi ites who trace their faith back to converts from hindu faith during time of fatimid caliph al mustansir billah 1029 1094 have been engaged in restorations of cairo mosques since 1970s aside from respecting their heritage purpose of campaign to restore fatimid architecture in cairo is to encourage a pilgrimage which aims to increase cohesion of bohra community internationally these activities have drawn negative comments from critics in europe and america who believe that mosques should be preserved in their current state in november 1979 first newsletter of society for preservation of architectural resources of egypt wrote a scathing report of bohras renovation of al hakim mosque saying though their method of financing project is intriguing their concrete arcades can only be deplored however when mosque was re opened a year later egyptian gazette was complimentary about transformation of run down building achieved without resort to public aid restorations have significantly changed buildings from their prior state marble has been used extensively on both interior and exterior surfaces and inscriptions in interior have been gilded motifs and designs have been copied from one mosque to another qibla bay of al hakim mosque which had been irreparably damaged was replaced by a version in marble and gilt of mihrab of al azhar mosque lu lu a mosque formerly a ruin has been rebuilt as a three story building somewhat like bab al nasr with decorative elements from al aqmar and al hakim silver and gold grilles now enclose tombs in mosques and mausoleums arches particularly in groups of three are considered fatimid regardless of their shape result is what could be termed neo fatimid architecture now found in new bohra mosques around world aga sir sultan muhammad shah leader of ismaili sect was buried in 1957 in a mausoleum built in this neo fatimid style in some cases this style incorporates elements that are clearly from a different period all but one of fatimid minarets were destroyed by an earthquake in 1303 and later rebuilt by mamluks but replicas of these minarets are used in neo fatimid mosques see also fatimid art further reading al aqmar living
