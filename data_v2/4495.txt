incarnations with appeal of lead characters being noted as primary factor of series success voice acting in both japanese and english versions and soundtracks especially those composed by yuji ohno of anime adaptations have also received similar compliments however several of franchise s installments most specifically television specials have been criticized for being formulaic manga has also been noted by fans and critics for its darker tone compared to anime with its explicit depictions of sex and violence as well as its black fourth wall breaking sense of humor contrasting with mostly family friendly animated versions for several years issues relating to copyright of maurice leblanc s intellectual property meant that lupin name was removed from its releases outside japan usually changed to rupan or wolf however copyright has since expired allowing foreign releases to use lupin name premise arsene lupin iii grandson of fictional gentleman thief arsene lupin is considered world s greatest thief known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to their owners his right hand man and closest ally is daisuke jigen an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0 3 seconds although lupin and jigen frequently work as a two man team they are often joined by goemon ishikawa xiii a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything or fujiko mine a femme fatale and lupin s love interest although fujiko usually works together with others she occasionally exploits lupin s interest in her to steal treasure for herself lupin and his gang are constantly chased by inspector koichi zenigata of interpol who has made it his life s work to arrest them pursuing lupin across globe production thumb left main cast of lupin third as drawn by monkey punch from top to bottom lupin fujiko jigen goemon zenigata series was created by japanese manga artist kazuhiko kato under pen name monkey punch his inspiration for series was fictional french gentleman thief arsene lupin created by maurice leblanc before creating series he read 15 of leblanc s stories aim of lupin iii series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected traits of leblanc s character originally intention was to keep blood ties between two fictional characters secret however he was convinced by others not to do so monkey punch combined elements of arsene lupin with james bond to develop character of lupin iii and made him a carefree fellow lupin was given a red color jacket which monkey punch believes is a flashy sexy color as series was to be published in a magazine targeted at adults fujiko mine was created to add a female presence and to fulfill a bond girl role her name was inspired by a picture of mount fuji monkey punch added ko female suffix to create her first name and chose mine for her family name because of its meaning as summit at beginning of series many of women lupin encounters are all named fujiko but are treated as different characters from chapter to chapter creating a new female each week was too difficult for monkey punch so she evolved into a single character who changes style frequently jigen was based on james coburn especially his role in magnificent seven and his name was chosen to reflect his unconventional personality goemon was created to give an oriental element into an otherwise western series despite lupin and goemon originally being enemies monkey punch decided that they were on same wavelength while lupin fujiko jigen and goemon frequently operate together for their own goals author considers them not to be a true group as they have their own individual interests in manga they operated individually however in anime adaptations group tend to work together inspector zenigata was conceived as lupin s archrival to create a human tom and jerry when monkey punch began lupin iii he was already working on another series pinky punky monkey punch enjoys writing outlaw characters and both lupin iii and pinky punky made use of outlaws as central characters according to him this made it easy for him to write two series without much pressure monkey punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as columbo and agatha christie novels and was also inspired by three musketeers and movies of alfred hitchcock he believes characters of lupin and fujiko are similar to characters of d artagnan and milady de winter and describes them as not necessarily lovers not necessarily husband and wife but more just having fun as man and woman with each other another influence on manga was mad magazine monkey punch said appeal of drawing lupin comes from character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants whenever he wants however this is contrasted by appeal of zenigata s strict personality originally series was only expected to last three months but due to its popularity monkey punch continued to draw it however despite his happiness at its success he has expressed confusion over its popularity monkey punch has said that he believes story can never end but that if he had to both zenigata and lupin would have to end as equals they would either both fail both win or both get very old copyright issues monkey punch did not ask permission to use arsene lupin name and at time japan did not enforce trade copyrights by time leblanc s estate launched legal action in japan name was considered to have entered into common use however this was not case in north america and europe and several foreign releases of lupin iii media dropped lupin iii title and character himself was renamed to rupan or wolf in france series was known as edgar detective edgar detective burglar with lupin himself renamed edgar de la edgar of burglary monkey punch has stated that using same character design behavior and face would be illegal but using a name alone is not illegal in 2012 leblanc s original arsene lupin entered public domain in france due to 70 years passing since his death in 1941 and is in public domain for any country that enforces rule of shorter term media manga lupin iii was written and illustrated by monkey punch it was serialized by
