interactive part of his vaudeville act frisky childlike gertie did tricks at command of her master mccay s employer william randolph hearst curtailed mccay s vaudeville activities so mccay added a live action introductory sequence to film for its theatrical release mccay abandoned a sequel gertie on tour after producing about a minute of footage although gertie is popularly thought to be earliest animated film mccay had earlier made little nemo 1911 and how a mosquito operates 1912 american j stuart blackton and french emile cohl had experimented with animation even earlier gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished mccay s film from these earlier trick films gertie was first film to use animation techniques such as registration marks tracing paper mutoscope action viewer and animation loops it influenced next generation of animators such as fleischer brothers otto messmer paul terry and walt disney john randolph bray unsuccessfully tried to patent many of mccay s animation techniques and is said to have been behind a plagiarized version of gertie that appeared a year or two after original gertie is best preserved of mccay s films some of which have been lost or survive only in fragments and has been preserved in u s library of congress national film registry as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant in 1991

signature strip little nemo 1905 14 in 1906 mccay began performing on vaudeville circuit doing chalk talks performances in which he drew before live audiences inspired by flip books his son brought home mccay came to see possibility of making moving pictures of his cartoons he claimed that he was first man in world to make animated cartoons though he was preceded by american james stuart blackton and french emile cohl mccay s first film starred his little nemo characters and debuted in movie theatres in 1911 he soon incorporated it into his vaudeville act he followed it in 1912 with how a mosquito operates in which a giant naturalistically animated mosquito sucks blood of a sleeping man mccay gave mosquito a personality and balanced humor with horror of nightmare situation his animation was criticized as being so lifelike that he must have traced characters from photographs or resorted to tricks using wires to show that he had not mccay chose for his next film a creature that could not have been photographed mccay conferred with american historical society in 1912 and announced plans for presentation of pictures showing great monsters that used to inhabit earth he spoke of serious and educational work that animation process could enable mccay had earlier introduced dinosaurs into his comic strip work such as a march 4 1905 episode of dream of rarebit fiend in which a brontosaurus skeleton took part in a horse race and a may 25 1913 rarebit fiend episode in which a hunter unsuccessfully targets a dinosaur layout of background to latter bore a strong

does tricks much like a trained elephant she is animated in a naturalistic style unprecedented for time she breathes rhythmically she shifts her weight as she moves and her abdominal muscles undulate as she draws water mccay imbued her with a personality while friendly she could be capricious ignoring or rebelling against her master s commands synopsis when her master mccay calls her frisky childlike gertie appears from a cave her whip wielding master has her do tricks such as raising her foot or bowing on command when she feels she has been pushed too far she nips back at her master she cries when he scolds her and he placates her with a pumpkin throughout act prehistoric denizens such as a flying lizard continually distract gertie she tosses a mammoth in lake when it teases her by spraying her with water she hurls a boulder at it as it swims away after she quenches her thirst by draining lake mccay has her carry him offstage while he bows to audience production thumb alt a black and white drawing from an animated cartoon with small crosses marked a dinosaur lifts a man in its mouth mccay used registration marks in corners of drawings to reduce jittering gertie was mccay s first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds main production began in mid 1913 working in his spare time mccay drew thousands of frames of gertie on sheets of rice paper a medium good for drawing as it did not absorb ink and as it was translucent it was ideal for laborious retracing of backgrounds a job that fell to art student neighbor john a fitzsimmons drawings themselves occupied a area of paper marked with registration marks in corners to reduce jittering of images when filmed they were photographed mounted on large pieces of stiff cardboard mccay was concerned with accurate timing and motion he timed his own breathing to determine timing of gertie s breathing and included subtle details such as ground sagging beneath gertie s great weight mccay consulted with new york museum staff to ensure accuracy of gertie s movements staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position so in a scene in which gertie stood up mccay had a flying lizard come on screen to draw away viewers attention when drawings were finished they were photographed at vitagraph studios in early 1914 thumb left alt a black and white film still in four corners three men in center stand by a table on right stacked with thousands of sheets of paper preparing thousands of drawings for film from film s introduction mccay pioneered mccay split system of animation in which major poses or positions were drawn first and intervening frames drawn after this relieved tedium and improved timing of film s actions mccay was open about techniques that he developed and refused to patent his system reportedly saying any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join club during production of gertie he showed details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation visitor was animator john randolph bray who sued mccay in 1914 after taking advantage of mccay s lapse to patent many of techniques including use of registration marks tracing paper and mutoscope action viewer and cycling of drawings to create repetitive action suit was unsuccessful and there is evidence that mccay may have countersued he received royalty payments from bray for licensing techniques release thumb upright alt black and white poster announcing winsor mccay and his wonderful trained dinosaur

vaudeville act first performance was on february 8 1914 in chicago at palace theater mccay began show making his customary live sketches which he followed with how a mosquito operates he then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured audience on making of animation standing to right of film screen he introduced only dinosaur in captivity as film started gertie poked her head out of a cave and mccay encouraged her to come forward he reinforced illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at screen at which point he turned his back to audience and pocketed apple as it appeared in film for gertie to eat for finale mccay walked offstage from where he reappeared in film gertie lifted up animated mccay placed him on her back and walked away as mccay bowed to audience show soon moved to new york though reviews were positive mccay s employer at new york american newspaper magnate william randolph hearst was displeased that his star cartoonist s vaudeville schedule interrupted his work illustrating editorials at hearst s orders reviews of mccay s shows disappeared from americans pages shortly after hearst refused to run paid advertisements from victoria theater where mccay performed in new york on march 8 hearst announced a ban on artists in his employ from performing in vaudeville mccay s contract did not prohibit him from his vaudeville performances but hearst was

called barnyard band and a film about americans role in world war i in 1927 mccay attended a dinner in his honor in new york after a considerable amount of drinking mccay was introduced by animator max fleischer mccay gave gathered group of animators some technical advice but when he felt audience was not giving him attention he berated them saying animation is an art that is how i conceived it

praised mccay s admirably drawn films and gertie in particular after seeing them in new york before he returned to europe upon its theatrical release variety magazine wrote film had plenty of comedy throughout and that it would always be remarked upon as exceptionally clever a fake version of gertie dinosaur appeared a year or two after original it features a dinosaur performing most of gertie s tricks but with less skillful animation using cels on a static background it is not known for certain who produced film though its style is believed to be that of bray productions filmmaker buster keaton rode back of a clay animated dinosaur in homage to gertie in three ages 1923 mccay s first three films were earliest animated works to have a commercial impact their success motivated film studios to join in infant animation industry other studios used mccay s combination of live action with animation such as fleischer studios series out of inkwell 1918 1929 and walt disney s alice comedies series 1923 1927 mccay s clean line high contrast realistic style set pattern for american animation to come and set it apart from abstract open forms of animation in europe this legacy is most apparent in feature films of walt disney animation studios such as fantasia 1940 which included anthropomorphic dinosaurs animated in a naturalistic style with careful attention to timing and

storage space of what he kept much has not survived as it was photographed on 35mm nitrate film which deteriorates and is flammable a pair of young animators discovered film in 1947 and preserved what they could in many cases only fragments could be saved if anything at all of all of mccay s films gertie is best preserved mendelsohn and brotherton tried fruitlessly to find an institution to store

that disney s magic though sometimes scary was always contained mccay s approached necromancy eder compared mccay s artistic vision to that of poet william blake saying it was too strange and personal
