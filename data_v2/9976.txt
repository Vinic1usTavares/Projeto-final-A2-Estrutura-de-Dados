thumb right papua new guinea and solomon islands battle of kaiapit was an action fought in 1943 between australian and japanese forces in new guinea during markham and ramu valley finisterre range campaign of world war ii following landings at nadzab and at lae allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance into upper markham valley starting with kaiapit japanese intended to use kaiapit to threaten allied position at nadzab and to create a diversion to allow japanese garrison at lae time to escape australian 2 6th independent company flew in to markham valley from port moresby in 13 usaaf c 47 dakotas making a difficult landing on a rough airstrip unaware that a much larger japanese force was also headed for kaiapit company attacked village on 19 september to secure area so that it could be developed into an airfield company then held it against a strong counter attack during two days of fighting australians defeated a larger japanese force while suffering relatively few losses australian victory at kaiapit enabled australian 7th division to be flown in to upper markham valley it accomplished 7th division s primary mission for japanese could no longer threaten lae or nadzab where a major airbase was being developed victory also led to capture of entire ramu valley which provided new forward fighter airstrips for air war against japanese background geography markham valley is part of a flat elongated depression varying from wide that cuts through otherwise mountainous terrain of interior of new guinea running from mouth of markham river near port of lae to that of ramu river away two rivers flow in opposite directions separated by an invisible divide about from lae area is flat and suitable for airstrips although it is intercut by many tributaries of two main rivers between ramu valley and madang lies rugged and aptly named finisterre ranges military situation following landing at nadzab general sir thomas blamey allied land forces commander intended to exploit his success with an advance into upper markham valley which would protect nadzab from japanese ground attack and serve as a jumping off point for an overland advance into ramu valley to capture airfield sites there on 16 september 1943 same day that lae fell lieutenant general sir edmund herring commander of i corps major general george alan vasey commander of 7th division and major general ennis whitehead commander of advanced echelon fifth air force met at whitehead s headquarters whitehead wanted fighter airstrips established in kaiapit area by 1 november 1943 in order to bring short range fighters within range of major japanese base at wewak 7th division s mission was to prevent japanese at madang from using markham and ramu valleys to threaten lae or nadzab vasey and herring considered both an overland operation to capture dumpu and an airborne operation using paratroops of us army s 503rd parachute infantry regiment blamey did not agree with their idea of capturing dumpu first insisting that kaiapit be taken beforehand until a road could be opened from lae kaiapit area could only be supplied by air and there were a limited number of transport aircraft even flying in an airborne engineer aviation battalion to improve airstrip would have involved taking aircraft away from operations supporting 7th division at nadzab moreover whitehead warned that he could not guarantee adequate air support for both kaiapit and upcoming finschhafen operation at same time however herring calculated that 7th division had sufficient reserves at nadzab to allow maintenance flights to be suspended for a week or so after capture of kaiapit he planned to seize kaiapit with an overland advance from nadzab by independent companies papuan infantry battalion and 7th division s 21st infantry brigade fifth air force commander lieutenant general george kenney later recalled that colonel david w photo hutchison who had been air task force commander at and had moved over to nadzab to take charge of air activities there was told to work out problem with vasey i didn t care how it was done but i wanted a good forward airdrome about a hundred miles further up markham valley photo hutchison and vasey were a natural team they both knew what i wanted and vasey not only believed that air force could perform miracles but that 7th division and fifth air force working together could do anything airstrip at kaiapit was reconnoitred on 11 september 1943 by no 4 squadron raaf which reported that it was apparently in good condition

2 6th independent company arrived in port moresby from australia on 2 august 1943 unit had fought in papua in 1942 in battle of buna gona and had since conducted intensive training in queensland company was under command of captain gordon king who had been its second in command at buna king received a warning order on 12 september alerting him to prepare for capture of kaiapit and had access

a conventional infantry company it was organised into three platoons each of three sections each of which contained two subsections it had considerable firepower each subsection had a bren light machine gun gunner s two assistants carried rifles and extra 30 round bren magazines a sniper also carried a rifle as did one man equipped with rifle grenades remaining four or five men carried owen submachine guns each platoon also had a section of 2 inch mortars company was self supporting with its own engineer signals transport and quartermaster sections signals section had a powerful but cumbersome wireless set no 11 for communicating with 7th division powered by lead acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators it required multiple signallers to carry and noise was liable to attract attention of enemy platoons were equipped with new army no 208 wireless sets these were small portable sets developed for communication needs of units on move in jungle warfare however 2 6th independent company had not had time to work with them operationally for three days in a row 2 6th independent company prepared to fly out from port moresby only to be told that its flight had been cancelled due to bad weather on 17 september 1943 13 dakotas of us 374th troop carrier group finally took off for leron king flew in lead plane which was piloted by captain frank c

its undercarriage collapsed and it made a belly landing former was subsequently salvaged but latter was a total loss king sent out patrols that soon located captain j a chalk s b company papuan infantry battalion which was operating in area that evening chalk and king received airdropped messages from vasey instructing them to occupy kaiapit as soon as possible and prepare a landing strip for troop carrying aircraft vasey informed them that only small japanese parties that had escaped from lae were in area and their morale was very low vasey flew in to leron on 18 september to meet with king vasey s orders were simple go to kaiapit quickly clean up japs and inform division as it happened japanese commander major general nakai of 20th division had ordered a sizeable force to move to kaiapit under command of major yonekura tsuneo yonekura s force included 9th and 10th companies of 78th infantry regiment 5th company of 80th infantry regiment a heavy machine gun section a signals section and an engineer company a total of about 500 troops from kaiapit it was to threaten allied position at nadzab creating a diversion to allow japanese garrison at lae time to escape main body left in finisterre range on 6 september but was delayed by heavy rains that forced troops to move soaking wet through muddy water for much of way only advance party of this force had reached kaiapit by 18 september by which time lae had already fallen yonekura s main body moving by night to avoid being sighted by allied aircraft was by this time no further from kaiapit than king but had two rivers to cross since both were heading for same objective a clash was inevitable battle thumb japanese dead at kaiapit after battle 214 japanese bodies were counted by australians around their positions alt two grass huts and some palm trees one dead japanese soldier lies at base of a palm tree king assembled his troops at sangan about south of kaiapit except for one section under lieutenant e f maxwell that had been sent ahead to scout village on morning of 19 september king set out for kaiapit leaving behind his quartermaster transport and engineering sections which would move stores left behind at leron river first to sangan and then to kaiapit on 20th he took one section of papuans with him leaving chalk and rest of his men to escort native carriers bringing up stores king s men walked for fifty minutes at a time and then rested for ten going was relatively easy insofar as ground was fairly flat but high kunai grass trapped heat and humidity and men were heavily loaded with ammunition company reached a village within striking distance of kaiapit at 14 45 while his men had a brief rest king attempted to contact large army no 11 wireless set he had left behind at sangan and from there vasey back at nadzab with new army no 208 wireless sets he had brought with him unfortunately king found that their range was insufficient he also heard shots being fired in distance and guessed that maxwell s section had been discovered 2 6th independent company formed up at 15 15 in kunai grass about from kaiapit as company advanced it came under fire from foxholes on edge of village a 2 inch mortar knocked out a light machine gun foxholes were outflanked and taken out with hand grenades and bayonets japanese withdrew leaving 30 dead behind australians suffered two killed and seven wounded including king who was lightly wounded thumb left brigadier i n dougherty centre and h p seale of angau right congratulate left of royal papuan constabulary for

when radio contact had been lost and he had been sent to find out what was going on king ordered him to bring papuans up from sangan with extra ammunition and no 11 set at around 17 30 a native appeared with a message for japanese commander paper was taken from him and he was shot when he tried to escape later a japanese patrol returned to kaiapit unaware that it was now in australian hands they were killed when they stumbled across a bren gun position four more japanese soldiers returned after midnight one of them escaped yonekura and his men had reached kaiapit after an exhausting night march yonekura was aware that australians had reached kaiapit but his main concern was not to be caught in open by allied aircraft spotting australian positions in pre dawn light japanese column opened fire a torrent of fire descended on australians who replied sporadically attempting to conserve their ammunition although he was running low on ammunition king launched an immediate counter attack on japanese which took them by surprise lieutenant derrick watson s c platoon set out at around 06 15 and advanced to edge of village 3 a distance of about before becoming pinned down by heavy japanese fire king then sent captain gordon blainey s a platoon around right flank towards high ground on mission hill which overlooked battlefield it was secured by 07 30 in meantime some of 2 6th independent company s signallers and headquarters personnel gathered together what ammunition they could and delivered it to c platoon at around 07 00 c platoon then fixed bayonets and continued its advance commander of no 9 section of c platoon lieutenant bob was nicked by a bullet apparently fired by one of his own men he led his section in an advance across of open ground and attacked three japanese machine gun posts with hand grenades he was later awarded military cross for his high courage and leadership lieutenant reg hallion led his no 3 section of a platoon against japanese positions at base of mission hill he was killed in an attack on a machine gun post but his section captured position and killed twelve japanese by 10 00 action was over after action king s men counted 214 japanese bodies and estimated that another 50 or more lay dead in tall grass yonekura was among dead australians suffered 14 killed and 23 wounded abandoned equipment included 19 machine guns 150 rifles 6 grenade throwers and 12 japanese swords aftermath consolidation 2 6th independent company had won a significant victory but now had 23 wounded and was very low on ammunition frazier landed on newly captured airstrip in his piper cub at 12 30 he rejected airstrip as unsuitable for dakotas and oversaw preparation of a new airstrip on better ground near mission hill this was still a difficult approach as aircraft had to land upwind while avoiding mission hill although it was not known if airstrip would be ready hutchison flew in for a test landing there next day 21 september at 15 30 he collected wounded and flew them to nadzab and returned an hour later with a load of rations and ammunition he also brought with him brigadier ivan dougherty commander of 21st infantry brigade and his headquarters who took charge of area around 18 00 six more transports arrived vasey was concerned about security of kaiapit area as he believed that japanese were inclined to continue with a plan once it was in motion taking advantage of good flying weather on 22 september 99 round trips were made between nadzab and kaiapit most of 2 16th infantry battalion and some american engineers were flown in 2 14th infantry battalion and a battery of 2 4th field regiment arrived on 25 september and brigadier kenneth eather s 25th infantry brigade began to arrive two days later freeing dougherty to advance on dumpu base development thumb 24 september 1943 a bulldozer arrives for use on kaiapit strip on a dakota of 65th troop carrier squadron small light bulldozers of us airborne aviation engineer battalions were designed to be air portable in order to perform work on strips in forward areas alt a tiny bulldozer emerges from rear door of an aircraft onto a grass airstrip three men stand around watching kaiapit did not become an important airbase by time engineering surveys of area had been completed as a direct consequence of victory at kaiapit dougherty s men had captured gusap there engineers found a well drained area with soil conditions suitable for construction of all weather airstrips an unobstructed air approach and a pleasant climate it was therefore decided to limit construction at swampy and malarial kaiapit and concentrate on gusap where us 871st and 875th airborne aviation engineer battalions constructed ten airstrips and numerous facilities although some equipment was carried on trek overland most had to be flown in and nearly all of it was worn out by time work was completed first p 40 kittyhawk fighter squadron began operating from gusap in november and an all weather fighter runway was completed in january 1944 airstrip at gusap paid for itself many times over in quantity of japanese aircraft equipment and personnel destroyed by allied attack missions projected from it war crimes three natives were found at kaiapit who had been tied with rope to uprights of a native hut and had then been bayoneted as a result of moscow declaration minister for external affairs dr h v evatt commissioned a report by william webb on war crimes committed by japanese webb took depositions from three members of 2 6th independent company about kaiapit incident which formed part of his report which was submitted to united nations war crimes commission in 1944 results 2 6th independent company had defeated vanguard of nakai s force and stopped his advance down markham valley battle of kaiapit accomplished vasey s primary mission for japanese could no longer threaten nadzab it opened gate to ramu valley for 21st infantry brigade provided new forward fighter airstrips for air war against japanese and validated australian army s new training methods and organisational emphasis on firepower thumb left members of 2 6th independent company display japanese flags they captured at kaiapit alt a crowd of men some shirtless some wearing slouch hats hold up two rising sun flags one has japanese writing on it vasey later told king that we were lucky we were very lucky king countered that if you re inferring that what we did was luck i don t agree with you sir because i think we weren t lucky we were just bloody good vasey replied that what he meant was that he vasey was lucky he confided to herring that he felt that he had made a potentially disastrous mistake it is quite wrong to send out a small unit like 2 6th independent company so far that they cannot be supported japanese believed that they had been attacked by an australian force in unexpected strength japanese historian tanaka kengoro said that mission of nakai detachment achieved objective of threatening nadzab so as to draw allied attention away from troops escaping from lae however nakai failed in his intention to hold kaiapit while allies secured it as a base for future operations australian historian david dexter said that leisurely nakai was outwitted by quick thinking and aggressive vasey in end vasey had moved faster catching japanese off balance credit for getting to kaiapit went first to usaaf aircrews that managed to make a difficult landing on rough airstrip at leron 2 6th independent company proved to be an ideal unit for mission as it combined determined leadership with thorough training and effective firepower for his part in battle king was awarded distinguished service order on 20 january 1944 he considered it a form of unit award and later regretted not asking whitehead for an american distinguished unit citation such as was awarded to d company of 6th battalion royal australian regiment for a similar action in battle of long tan
