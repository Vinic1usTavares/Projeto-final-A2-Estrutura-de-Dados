number of central europeans including vuilleumier and bruno trojani asked for top speed this was protested by scandinavian and united states jumpers and a 40 minute discussion broke out at one point one of facilitators at in run received a telephone call confirming top speed facilitator was skeptical and chose to call back to judges who could confirm that they had not given such a go ahead in end judges chose to allow higher speeds with a compromise of 5 0 meters more distance however facilitator only moved rope 4 5 meters this made swiss furious and they used their knives to cut rope they then accused participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards andersen and ruud skied down in run in a standing position to reduce their speed and had two longest standing jumps event is regarded as international break through for ruud thams gave full speed and landed at 73 0 meters but fell and ended on a 28th place had he stood it would have been a new world record wounds were serious enough that he had to be taken to hospital afterwards he stated i at least showed those guys that we are not cowards also and trojani became subject to higher speeds both falling and ending
