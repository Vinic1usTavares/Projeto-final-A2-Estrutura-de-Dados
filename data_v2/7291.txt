outside parliament and admitted to setting fire to two others sentenced to six months in holloway prison she did not go on hunger strike at first but authorities required that she be force fed between 29 february and 7 march 1912 because they considered her health and appetite to be in decline in june she and other suffragette inmates barricaded themselves in their cells and went on hunger strike authorities broke down cell doors and force fed strikers following force feeding davison decided on what she described as a desperate protest made to put a stop to hideous torture which was now our lot and jumped from one of interior balconies of prison she later wrote as soon as i got out i climbed on to railing and threw myself out to wire netting a distance of between 20 and 30 feet idea in my mind was one big tragedy may save many others i realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was iron staircase when a good moment came quite deliberately i walked upstairs and threw myself from top as i meant on to iron staircase if i had been successful i should undoubtedly have been killed as it was a clear drop of 30 to 40 feet but i caught on edge of netting i then threw myself forward on my head with all my might she cracked two vertebrae and badly injured her head shortly afterwards and despite her injuries she was again force fed before being released ten days early she wrote to pall mall gazette to explain why she attempted to commit suicide i did it deliberately and with all my power because i felt that by nothing but sacrifice of human life would nation be brought to realise horrible torture our women face if i had succeeded i am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again as a result of her action davison suffered discomfort for rest of her life her arson of postboxes was not authorised by wspu leadership and this together with her other actions led to her falling out of favour with organisation sylvia pankhurst later wrote that wspu leadership wanted to discourage davison in such tendencies she was condemned and ostracized as a self willed person who persisted in acting upon her own initiative without waiting for official instructions a statement davison wrote on her release from prison for suffragette second official newspaper of wspu was published by union after her death davison spent

other injuries he spent evening of 4 june in london before returning home following day he could recall little of event she seemed to clutch at my horse and i felt it strike her he recovered sufficiently to race anmer at ascot racecourse two weeks later inquest into davison s death took place at epsom on 10 june jones was not well enough to attend davison s half brother captain henry davison gave evidence about his sister saying that she was a woman of very strong reasoning faculties and passionately devoted to women s movement coroner decided that in absence of evidence to contrary davison had not committed suicide coroner also decided that although she had waited until she could see horses from evidence it was clear that woman did not make for his majesty s horse in particular verdict of court was that miss emily wilding davison died of fracture of base of skull caused by being accidentally knocked down by a horse through wilfully rushing on to racecourse on epsom downs during progress of race for derby death was due to misadventure davison s purpose in attending derby and walking onto course is unclear she did not discuss her plans with anyone or leave a note several theories have been suggested including that she intended to cross track believing that all horses had passed that she wanted to pull down king s horse that she was trying to attach one of wspu flags to a horse or that she intended to throw herself in front of one of horses historian elizabeth crawford considers that subsequent explanations of davison s action have created a tangle of fictions false deductions hearsay conjecture misrepresentation and theory in 2013 a channel 4 documentary used forensic examiners who digitised original nitrate film from three cameras present film was digitally cleaned and examined their examination suggests that davison intended to throw a suffragette flag around neck of a horse or attach it to horse s bridle a flag was gathered from course this was put up for auction and as at 2017 it hangs in houses of parliament michael tanner horse racing historian and author of a history of 1913 derby doubts authenticity of item sotheby s auction house who sold it describe it as a sash that was reputed to have been worn by davison seller stated that her father richard burton was clerk of course at epsom tanner s search of records shows burton

folded up and pinned to inside of her jacket they measured 44 5 by 27 inches 113 x 69 cm sash displayed at houses of parliament measures 82 by 12 inches 210 x 30 cm tanner considers that davison s choice of king s horse was pure happenstance as her position on corner would have left her with a limited view examination of newsreels by forensic team employed by channel 4 documentary determined that davison was closer to start of bend than had been previously assumed and would have had a better view of oncoming horses contemporary news media were largely unsympathetic to davison and many publications questioned her sanity and characterised her actions as suicidal pall mall gazette said it had pity for dementia which led an unfortunate woman to seek a grotesque and meaningless kind of martyrdom while daily express described davison as a well known malignant suffragette who has a long record of convictions for complicity in suffragette outrages journalist for daily telegraph observed that deep in hearts of every onlooker was a feeling of fierce resentment with miserable woman unnamed writer in daily mirror opined that it was quite evident that her condition was serious otherwise many of crowd would have fulfilled their evident desire to lynch her wspu were quick to describe her as a martyr part of a campaign to identify her as such suffragette newspaper marked davison s death by issuing a copy showing a female angel with raised arms standing in front of guard rail of a racecourse paper s editorial stated that davison has proved that there are in twentieth century people who are willing to lay down their lives for an ideal religious phraseology was used in issue to describe her act including greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends which gullickson reports as being repeated several times in subsequent discussions of events a year after derby suffragette included price of liberty an essay by davison in it she had written to lay down life for friends that is glorious selfless inspiring but to re enact tragedy of calvary for generations yet unborn that is last consummate sacrifice of militant funeral thumb alt a

them on equal terms with male voters crawford sees events at 1913 derby as a lens through which davison s whole life has been interpreted and uncertainty of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history carolyn collette a literary critic who has studied davison s writing identifies different motives ascribed to davison including uncontrolled impulses or a search for martyrdom for women s suffrage collette also sees a more current trend among historians to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed that davison s actions that day were deliberate and that she attempted to attach suffragette colours to king s horse cicely hale a suffragette who worked at wspu and who knew davison described her as a fanatic who was prepared to die but did not mean to other observers such as purvis and ann morley and liz stanley davison s biographers agree that davison did not mean to die davison was a staunch feminist and a passionate christian whose outlook invoked both medieval history and faith in god as part of armour of her militancy her love of english literature which she had studied at oxford was shown in her identification with geoffrey chaucer s knight s tale including being nicknamed faire much of davison s writing reflected doctrine of christian faith and referred to martyrs martyrdom and triumphant suffering according to collette use of christian and medieval language and imagery directly reflects politics and rhetoric of militant suffrage movement purvis writes that davison s committed anglicanism would have stopped her from committing suicide because it would have meant that she could not be buried in consecrated ground davison wrote in price of liberty about high cost of devotion to cause in new testament master reminded his followers that when merchant had found pearl of great price he sold all that he had in order to buy it that is parable of militancy it is that which women warriors are doing to day some are truer warriors than others but perfect amazon is she who will sacrifice all even unto last to win pearl of freedom for her sex davison held a firm moral conviction that socialism was a moral and political force for good she attended annual may day rallies in hyde park and according to historian krista cowman directly linked her militant suffrage activities with socialism her london and morpeth funeral processions contained a heavy socialist presence in appreciation of her support for cause legacy thumb alt plaque dedicated to davison in addition to her name and dates text reads it
