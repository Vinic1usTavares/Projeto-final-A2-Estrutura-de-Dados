version and later playstation releases of game introduced a new character to oddworld mythos character was reputedly part of an early advertising campaign which included television commercials but was eventually abandoned development oddworld abe s oddysee began production in january 1995 under working title of soul storm gamepro 95 august 1996 page 34 after gt interactive acquired publishing rights on september 12 1996 title was changed first to oddworld inhabitants epic 1 starring 99 december 1996 pages 58 60 and eventually to oddworld abe s oddysee ballistic publishing art of oddworld first ten years 1994 2004 page 99 game had a private showing at e3 96 and journalists in attendance hailed it as one of highlights of show a more large scale unveiling took place at e3 97 though original release date of may was pushed back to september version of game shown at e3 97 in june was remarkably similar to release version and abe s oddysee had a reportedly smooth development cycle with few late changes first footage creator lorne lanning saw of abe s oddysee involved a pack of meeches chasing abe he said he was happy with animation at time but when development was nearing completion studio discovered that there was not enough disk space to include all of species featured in game meeches were removed from final game and identified in story as extinct another sequence under time and budget constraints concerned moon that abe witnesses after his escape from stockyards lanning explained that cg sequence that occurs between abe escaping rupturefarms and entering stockyards was originally accompanied by footage of a meteor shower creating shape of abe s handprint in order to imply greater forces that are really behind it that are trying to send him symbols budget for game was 4 million and gt interactive dedicated 10 million to its marketing budget publisher s largest to date according to lanning gamespeak mechanic was partially inspired by audio puzzles of loom abe s oddysee was first major gt title that uk development team that had been taken in by gt following acquisition of warner interactive became involved with testing process of game was unusual for gt interactive as british team did gameplay testing whilst normally american games were only tested in europe for language and other compatibility issues soundtrack features mostly ambient music composed by ellen because of lack of testing final version of game left behind a ledge clipping through floor glitch a glitch which allows abe to jump backwards behind screens which is also known as a stop turn and an invincibility glitch all of these glitches can result in skipping of paramonia and scrabania which was first discovered in june 2014 on microsoft windows version of game similar glitches are also found in oddworld abe s exoddus but invincibility death delay glitch could only work using a hidden cheat in game there are several other glitches that can cause abe s mudokons not to follow abe and some glitches related to levers and manual lifts another type of invincibility glitch is found in remake oddworld new n tasty ledge glitch and stop turn glitches were fixed also windows version has some sound bugs where sound effects and music were played around a semitone lower than psx port abe s exoddus also featured this bug when abe s oddysee was in production developers found that an executive at publisher gt interactive tried to sabotage production because he didn t like game being made he took footage of game to his boss who loved direction game had and chose to provide more funding at expense of executive that wanted to shut it down lanning later explained that in 1997 during oddysee s production video game industry was seen as making toys and not taken seriously they were happy to make a living but they weren t necessarily going out and bragging about it games began to be more about shooting and violence and blood but oddworld inhabitants was antithesis to that and said we can make people feel better rather than just feel like they won a sega saturn version of game was announced but never released release thumb left on left is original mudokon pops packaging in u s and eu versions with altered version to right as seen in abe s exoddus that was seen in japanese version game saw its first release on playstation dos and windows first

worldwide japanese version followed in october for release in japan title of abe s oddysee was changed to abe a gogo by publisher softbank other changes included art for mudokon pops packaging which originally consisted of a severed mudokon head speared on a stick due to undisclosed current events in japan design was changed to a more ambiguous happier image of a popsicle ballistic publishing art of oddworld first ten years 1994 2004 page 58 design for protagonist abe and other mudokons was also significantly altered certain japanese pressure groups were offended by mudokons having four fingers and most of them working in a meat packing factory due to a historic japanese subclass of meat packers who were looked down upon in society four fingers or showing four fingers to another person came to insinuate other was a member of subclass because it suggested meat packers who lost fingers at work oddworld inhabitants had to alter design of mudokons to three fingers or else face legal battles and large fines ballistic publishing art of oddworld first ten years 1994 2004 page 45 also in japanese version game won t let player choose to play scrabania or paramonia instead player is forced to play through paramonia first oddworld inhabitants made altered designs a permanent feature subsequent versions of abe s oddysee released outside japan included both changed packaging and changed mudokon hand future games and media including new n tasty also recognise these changes as canon although abe s exoddus features four fingered mudokon sprites and scenes from abe s oddysee shown in game were not altered game boy port was released as oddworld adventures it was developed by saffire corporation and published by gt interactive in 1998 game is a significantly cut down

platformer that s packed with great innovative touches and some great character design edge april 1998 page 102 gamespot called it ideal platformer balancing its action and puzzle elements perfectly to make game intelligent engaging and best yet fun animation world magazine applauded multiple aspects of game saying it features some of best graphics and animation we ve ever seen and commenting on sophisticated gameplay gamepro gave it a perfect 5 0 out of 5 for graphics and sound and a 4 5 out of 5 for control and funfactor asserting that it bursts onto scene with kind of unique gameplay and killer graphics that will rocket it straight into playstation hall of fame full review text appears only in printed version pc gamer said that charming and innovative oddworld abe s oddysee reminds us that any genre can be revived if you put enough care and creativity into it graphics struck many reviewers as being excellent pc zone remarked that developers have created an outstanding visual environment for abe to leap around in however imaginative ai and visual designs of assorted creatures drew more extensive praise gamespot found ai goes a long way towards making you feel as if you re interacting with an actual world and its inhabitants game s difficulty agreed upon to be extremely high was its most controversial aspect some reviewers lauded intelligent nature of challenge and said frequent checkpoints and unlimited lives keep game from becoming too frustrating next generation for example commented that action gamers are likely to be disappointed by occasionally slow pace but speed is traded for a considerably more cerebral set of challenges that require a great amount of persistence observation and thought however others found that flaws such as sensitive controls slowdown and trial and error level designs make difficulty frequently annoying though gamespot reported that playstation and pc versions of game are virtually identical most reviews for pc version directed criticism at lack of an ability to save at any point since this was a standard feature in pc games edge said that oddworld demands a certain level of commitment to progress while science fiction weekly claimed game s innovative game play makes for a steep learning curve this initial difficulty in figuring out how to play is aggravated by a save feature that often forces players to redo difficult sections pc zone stated that progress does seem to rely on trial and error which involves much replaying of levels and gnashing of teeth all this can be frustrating at times especially when abe is plonked right back at start of a level when he dies abe s oddysee proved to be a commercial hit lorne lanning reported global sell through in excess of one million units by late january
