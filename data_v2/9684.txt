tank farms on site as well as potential for future groundwater contamination beneath currently contaminated soils in 2011 doe federal agency charged with overseeing site interim stabilized 149 single shell tanks by pumping nearly all of liquid waste out into 28 newer double shell tanks solids known as salt cake and sludge remained doe later found water intruding into at least 14 single shell tanks and that one of them had been leaking about per year into ground since about 2010 in 2012 doe discovered a leak also from a double shell tank caused by construction flaws and corrosion in bottom and that 12 double shell tanks have similar construction flaws since then doe changed to monitoring single shell tanks monthly and double shell tanks every three years and also changed monitoring methods in march 2014 doe announced further delays in construction of waste treatment plant which will affect schedule for removing waste from tanks intermittent discoveries of undocumented contamination have slowed pace and raised cost of cleanup in 2007 hanford site represented 60 of high level radioactive waste by volume managed by us department of energy and 7 9 of all nuclear waste in united states doe manages 15 of nuclear waste in us with remaining 85 being commercial spent nuclear fuel hanford is currently most contaminated nuclear site in united states and is focus of nation s largest

white bluffs and richland manhattan project during world war ii s 1 section of federal office of scientific research and development osrd sponsored an intensive research project on plutonium research contract was awarded to scientists at university of chicago metallurgical laboratory met lab at time plutonium was a rare element that had only recently been isolated in a university of california laboratory met lab researchers worked on producing chain reacting piles of uranium to convert it to plutonium and finding ways to separate plutonium from uranium program was accelerated in 1942 as united states government became concerned that scientists in nazi germany were developing a nuclear weapons program on march 10 1945 hanford plutonium works had been temporarily shut down due to japanese bomb carrying balloon attacks which had been ongoing since november 3 1944 general public was not made aware of it until 31 august 1945 when such information was released to public world war

brigadier general leslie r groves charging him with construction of industrial size plants for manufacturing plutonium and uranium groves recruited dupont company to be prime contractor for construction of plutonium production complex dupont recommended that it be located far away from existing uranium production facility at oak ridge tennessee ideal site was described by these criteria a large and remote tract of land a hazardous manufacturing area of at least space for laboratory facilities at least from nearest reactor or separations plant no towns of more than 1 000 people closer than from hazardous rectangle no main highway railway or employee village closer than from hazardous rectangle a clean and abundant water supply a large electric power supply ground that could bear heavy loads in december 1942 groves dispatched his assistant colonel franklin t matthias and dupont engineers to scout potential sites matthias reported that hanford was ideal in virtually all respects except for farming towns of white bluffs and hanford general groves visited site in january 1943 and established hanford engineer works codenamed site w federal government quickly acquired land under its war powers war powers act 56 stat 176 1942 and relocated some 1 500 residents of hanford white bluffs and nearby settlements as well as wanapum people confederated tribes and bands of

immediately launched a massive and technically challenging construction project dupont advertised for workers in newspapers for an unspecified war construction project in southeastern washington offering attractive scale of wages and living facilities construction workers who reached a peak of 44 900 in june 1944 lived in a construction camp near old hanford townsite administrators and engineers lived in government town established at richland village which eventually had accommodation in 4 300 family units and 25 dormitories nichols k d road to trinity page 138 1987 morrow new york construction of nuclear facilities proceeded rapidly before end of war in august 1945 hew built 554 buildings at hanford including three nuclear reactors 105 b 105 d and 105 f and three plutonium processing canyons 221 t 221 b and 221 u each long to receive radioactive wastes from chemical separations process hew built tank farms consisting of 64 single shell underground waste tanks 241 b 241 c 241 t and 241 u project required of roads of railway and four electrical substations hew used of concrete and 40 000 short tons 36 000 t of structural steel and consumed 230 million between 1943 and 1946 plutonium production b reactor 105 b at hanford was first large scale plutonium production reactor in world it was designed and built by dupont based on an experimental design by enrico fermi and originally operated at 250 megawatts thermal reactor was graphite moderated and water cooled it consisted of a graphite cylinder lying on its side penetrated through its entire length horizontally by 2 004 aluminium tubes 180 t of uranium slugs diameter by long sealed in aluminium cans went into tubes cooling water was pumped through aluminium tubes around uranium slugs at rate of per minute thumb left b reactor during construction construction on b reactor began in august 1943 and was completed on september 13 1944 reactor went critical in late september and after overcoming neutron poisoning produced its first plutonium on november 6 1944 plutonium was produced in hanford reactors when a uranium 238 atom in a fuel slug absorbed a neutron to form uranium 239 u 239 rapidly undergoes beta decay to form neptunium 239 which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form plutonium 239 irradiated fuel slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called canyons that were about away a series of chemical processing steps separated small amount of plutonium that was produced from remaining uranium and fission waste products this first batch of plutonium was refined in 221 t plant from december 26 1944 to february 2 1945 and delivered to los alamos laboratory in new mexico on february 5 1945 material was used in trinity first nuclear explosion on july 16 1945 two identical reactors d reactor and f reactor came online in december 1944 and february 1945 respectively by april 1945 shipments of plutonium were headed to los alamos every five days and hanford soon provided enough material for bombs tested at trinity and dropped over nagasaki throughout this period manhattan project maintained a top secret classification until news arrived of bomb dropped on hiroshima fewer than one percent of hanford s workers knew they were working on a nuclear weapons project general groves noted in his memoirs that we made certain that each member of project thoroughly understood his part in total effort that and nothing more initially six reactors or piles were proposed when plutonium was to be used in gun type thin man bomb in mid 1944 a simple gun type bomb was found to be impractical for plutonium and more advanced fat man bomb an implosion device required less plutonium number of piles was reduced to four and then three and number of chemical separation plants from four to three technological innovations in short time frame of manhattan project hanford engineers produced many significant technological advances as no one had ever built an industrial scale nuclear reactor before scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations seeking greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin dupont engineers installed ammonia based refrigeration systems with d and f reactors to further chill river water before its use as reactor coolant another difficulty engineers struggled with was how to deal with radioactive contamination once canyons began processing irradiated slugs machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for replacement of any component via remote control they came up with a modular cell concept which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane this method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use teflon used as a gasket material and closed circuit television used to give crane operator a better view of process cold war expansion thumb right decommissioning d reactor in september 1946 general electric company assumed management of hanford works under supervision of newly created atomic energy commission as cold war began united states faced a new strategic threat in rise of soviet nuclear weapons program in august 1947 hanford works announced funding for construction of two new weapons reactors and research to develop a new chemical separations process entering a new phase of expansion by 1963 hanford site was home to nine nuclear reactors along columbia river five reprocessing plants on central plateau and more than 900 support buildings and radiological laboratories around site extensive modifications and upgrades were made to original three world war ii reactors and a total of 177 underground waste tanks were built hanford was at its peak production from 1956 to 1965 over entire 40 years of operations site produced about of plutonium supplying majority of 60 000 weapons in u s arsenal uranium 233 was also produced in 1976 a hanford technician named harold mccluskey received largest recorded dose of americium following a laboratory accident due to prompt medical intervention he survived incident and died eleven years later of natural causes decommissioning most of reactors were shut down between 1964 and 1971 with an average individual life span of 22 years last reactor n reactor continued to operate as a dual purpose reactor being both a power reactor used to feed civilian electrical grid via washington public power supply system and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons n reactor operated until 1987 since then most of

1977 although uranium enrichment and plutonium breeding were slowly phased out nuclear legacy left an indelible mark on tri cities since world war ii area had developed from a small farming community to a booming atomic frontier to a powerhouse of nuclear industrial complex decades of federal investment created a community of highly skilled scientists and engineers as a result of this concentration of specialized skills hanford site was able to diversify its operations to include scientific research test facilities and commercial nuclear power production operational facilities located at hanford site included pacific northwest national laboratory owned by department of energy and operated by battelle memorial institute fast flux test facility a national research facility in

53 truckloads about of soil were used to fill in hole environmental concerns thumb right hanford reach of columbia river where radioactivity was released from 1944 to 1971 a huge volume of water from columbia river was required to dissipate heat produced by hanford s nuclear reactors as much as 75 000 gallons per minute was diverted from columbia river to cool reactor from 1944 to 1971 pump systems drew cooling water from river and after treating this water for use by reactors returned it to river before its release into river used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours longer lived isotopes were not affected by this retention and several entered river every day federal government kept knowledge about these radioactive releases secret radiation was later measured downstream as far west as washington and oregon coasts plutonium separation process resulted in release of radioactive isotopes into air which were carried by wind throughout southeastern washington and into parts of idaho montana oregon and british columbia downwinders were exposed to radionuclides particularly iodine 131 with heaviest releases during period from 1945 to 1951 these radionuclides entered food chain via dairy cows grazing on contaminated fields hazardous fallout was ingested by communities who consumed radioactive food and milk most of these airborne releases were a part of hanford s routine operations while a few of larger releases occurred in isolated incidents in 1949 an intentional release known as green run released 8 000 curies of iodine 131 over two days another source of contaminated food came from columbia river fish an impact felt disproportionately by native american communities who depended on river for their customary diets a u s government report released in 1992 estimated that 685 000 curies of radioactive iodine 131 had been released into river and air from hanford site between 1944 and 1947 thumb left salmon spawning in hanford reach near h reactor beginning in 1960s scientists with u s public health service published reports about radioactivity released from hanford and there were protests from health departments of oregon and washington in response to an article in spokane spokesman review in september 1985 department of energy announced to declassify environmental records and in february 1986 released 19 000 pages of previously unavailable historical documents about hanford s operations washington state department of health collaborated with citizen led hanford health information network hhin to publicize data about health effects of hanford s operations hhin reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from hanford or who used columbia river downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases particularly forms of thyroid disease a mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand hanford downwinders against federal government spent many years in court system in 2005 two of six plaintiffs who went to trial were awarded 500 000 in damages in october 2015 department of energy resolved final cases they paid more than 60 million in legal fees and 7 million in damages since 2003 radioactive materials are known to be leaking from hanford into environment highest tritium concentration detected in riverbank springs during 2002 was 58 000 pci l 2 100 bq l at hanford townsite highest iodine 129 concentration of 0 19 pci l 0 007 bq l was also found in a hanford townsite spring who guidelines for radionuclides in drinking water limits levels of iodine 129 at 1 bq l and tritium at 10 000 bq l concentrations of radionuclides including tritium technetium 99 and iodine 129 in riverbank springs near hanford townsite have generally been increasing since 1994 this is an area where a major groundwater plume from 200 east area intercepts river detected radionuclides include strontium 90 technetium 99 iodine 129 uranium 234 235 and 238 and tritium other detected contaminants include arsenic chromium chloride fluoride nitrate and sulfate in february 2013 governor jay inslee announced that a tank storing radioactive waste at site had been leaking liquids on average of 150 to 300 gallons per year he said that though leak posed no immediate health risk to public it should not be an excuse for not doing anything on february 22 2013 governor stated that 6 more tanks at hanford site were leaking radioactive waste there are 177 tanks at hanford 149 of which have a single shell historically single shell tanks were used for storing radioactive liquid waste and designed to last 20 years by 2005 some liquid waste was transferred from single shell tanks to safer double shell tanks a substantial amount of residue remains in older single shell tanks with one containing an estimated 447 000 gallons 1 700 m3 of radioactive sludge for example it is believed that up to six of these empty tanks are leaking two tanks are reportedly leaking at a rate of 300 gallons 1 136 liters per year each while remaining four tanks are leaking at a rate of 15 gallons 57 liters per year each occupational health concerns since 1987 workers have reported exposure to harmful vapors after working around underground nuclear storage tanks with no solution found more than 40 workers in 2014 alone reported smelling vapors and became ill with headaches watery eyes burning skin contact dermatitis increased heart rate difficulty breathing coughing sore throats dizziness and nausea several of these workers have long term disabilities doctors checked workers and cleared them to return to work monitors worn by tank workers have found no samples with chemicals close to federal limit for occupational exposure in august 2014 osha ordered facility to rehire a contractor and pay 220 000 in back wages for firing them for whistleblowing on safety concerns at site on november 19 2014 washington attorney general bob ferguson said state planned to sue doe and its contractor to protect workers from hazardous vapors at hanford a 2014 report by doe savannah river national laboratory initiated by washington river protection solutions found that doe s methods to study vapor releases were inadequate particularly that they did not account for short but intense vapor releases they recommended proactively sampling air inside tanks to determine its chemical makeup accelerating new practices to prevent worker exposures and modifying medical evaluations to reflect how workers are exposed to vapors cleanup under superfund thumb right 280px spent nuclear fuel stored underwater and uncapped in hanford s k east basin on june 25 1988 hanford site was divided into four areas and proposed for inclusion on national priorities list on may 15 1989 washington department of ecology united states environmental protection agency and department of energy entered into tri party agreement which provides a legal framework for environmental remediation at hanford agencies are engaged in world s largest environmental cleanup with many challenges to be resolved in face of overlapping technical political regulatory and cultural interests cleanup effort is focused on three outcomes restoring columbia river corridor for other uses converting central plateau to long term waste treatment and storage and preparing for future cleanup effort is managed by department of energy under oversight of two regulatory agencies a citizen led hanford advisory board provides recommendations from community stakeholders including local and state governments regional environmental organizations business interests and native american tribes citing 2014 hanford lifecycle scope schedule and cost report 2014 estimated cost of remaining hanford clean up is 113 6 billion more than 3 billion per year for next six years with a lower cost projection of approximately 2 billion per year until 2046 about 11 000 workers are on site to consolidate clean up and mitigate waste contaminated buildings and contaminated soil originally scheduled to be complete within thirty years cleanup was less than half finished by 2008 of four areas that were formally listed as superfund sites on october 4 1989 only one has been removed from list following cleanup while major releases of radioactive material ended with reactor shutdown in 1970s and many of most dangerous wastes are contained there are continued concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward columbia river and about workers health and safety most significant challenge at hanford is stabilizing of high level radioactive waste stored in 177 underground tanks by 1998 about a third of these tanks had leaked waste into soil and groundwater most of liquid waste had been transferred to more secure double shelled tanks however of liquid waste together with of salt cake and sludge remains in single shelled tanks doe lacks information about extent to which 27 double shell tanks may be susceptible to corrosion without determining extent to which factors that contributed to leak in ay 102 were similar to other 27 double shell tanks doe cannot be sure how long its double shell tanks can safely store waste that waste was originally scheduled to be removed by 2018 revised deadline was 2040 nearby aquifers contain an estimated of contaminated groundwater as a result of leaks of radioactive waste is traveling through groundwater toward columbia river this waste is expected to reach river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule site includes of solid radioactive waste thumb right grand opening of environmental restoration disposal facility erdf under tri party agreement lower level hazardous wastes are buried in huge lined pits that will be sealed and monitored with sophisticated instruments for many years disposal of plutonium and other high level wastes is a more difficult problem that continues to be a subject of intense debate as an example plutonium 239 has a half life of 24 100 years and a decay of ten half lives is required before a sample is considered to cease its radioactivity in 2000 department of energy awarded a 4 3 billion contract to bechtel a san francisco based construction and engineering firm to build a vitrification plant to combine dangerous wastes with glass to render them stable construction began in 2002 plant was originally scheduled to be operational by 2011 with vitrification completed by 2028 economist nuclear waste from bombs to 800 handbags march 19 2011 p 40 according to a 2012 study by general accounting office there were a number of serious unresolved technical and managerial problems estimated costs were 13 4 billion with commencement of operations estimated to be in 2022 and about 3 decades of operation in may 2007 state and federal officials began closed door negotiations about possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting focus of cleanup to urgent priorities such as groundwater remediation those talks stalled in october 2007 in early 2008 a 600 million cut to hanford cleanup budget was proposed washington state officials expressed concern about budget cuts as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at site and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that department of energy was in violation of environmental laws they appeared to step back from that threat in april 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement during excavations from 2004 to 2007 a sample of purified plutonium was uncovered inside a safe in a waste trench and has been dated to about 1940s making it second oldest sample of purified plutonium known to exist analyses published in 2009 concluded that sample originated at oak ridge and was one of several sent to hanford for optimization tests of t plant until hanford could produce its own plutonium documents refer to such a sample belonging to watt s group which was disposed of in its safe when a radiation leak was suspected chemical
