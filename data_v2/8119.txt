second naval law in 1900 under direction of vizeadmiral vadmvice admiral alfred von tirpitz secured funding for construction of twenty new battleships over next seventeen years first group five s were laid down in early 1900s and shortly thereafter design work began on a follow on design which became deutschland class ships were broadly similar to braunschweigs and featured incremental improvements in armor protection they also abandoned gun turrets for secondary battery guns moving them back to traditional casemates to save weight british battleship armed with ten 12 inch 30 5 cm gunswas commissioned in december 1906 dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered obsolete every capital ship of german navy including hannover hannover was long overall with a beam of and a draft of she

construction of a second member of deutschland class were included in 1904 budget contract for new vessel was awarded to kaiserliche werft imperial shipyard in wilhelmshaven on 1june 1904 under contract name p which denoted an addition to fleet hannover was laid down on 7november experiences of russo japanese war then being fought suggested that naval armor was too thin to protect against modern guns and so german designers increased thickness of main belt and central citadel this change was repeated in three subsequent members of class ship was launched on 29may 1905 and president of province of hanover richard von wentzel gave speech after completing fitting out ship was commissioned for sea trials on 1october 1907 but they were interrupted so that hannover could join fleet exercises in skagerrak in november trials resumed after maneuvers were completed and by 13february 1908 hannover was ready to join active fleet she was assigned to ii battle squadron of high seas fleet joining her sisters and she replaced older battleship from may to june 1908 hannover took part in maneuvers in north sea from following month until august fleet conducted a training cruise into atlantic during cruise hannover stopped in ponta delgada in azores part of portugal from 23july to 1august annual autumn exercises began in september after these were completed hannover was

tender in november fleet and unit exercises were conducted in baltic sea thumb upright 1 4 map of north and baltic seas in 1911 alt north sea is bordered germany to southeast great britain to west and norway to northeast baltic is bordered by germany to south russia to east and sweden to north two seas are connected by skagerrak and danish straits training regimen in which hannover participated followed a similar pattern over next five years this included another cruise into atlantic from 7july to 1august 1909 followed immediately by annual autumn maneuvers in august and september on 1october vadm hugo von pohl replaced holtzendorff as squadron commander aboard hannover squadron conducted exercises in february 1910 and on 1april unit was transferred from kiel to wilhelmshaven on its arrival squadron was reinforced by new dreadnought battleships and which replaced kaiser karl der grosse and kaiser barbarossa respectively westfalen also replaced hannover as squadron s flagship she later replaced wittelsbach as flagship of squadron s deputy commander konteradmiral admiral gunther von krosigk ship won kaiser s schiesspreis shooting prize for excellent gunnery in isquadron

november and from february through april 1912 she then took s place as deputy command flagship on 27april and kadm ehrhard schmidt hoisted his flag aboard ship that day fleet maneuvers in north and baltic seas followed because of agadir crisis with britain and france summer cruise in july went only to baltic to avoid exposing fleet to a possible attack autumn maneuvers took place as usual in august and september after which kadm wilhelm von souchon replaced schmidt year 1913 followed a pattern similar to 1912 though summer cruise returned to norway that year after autumn maneuvers souchon was relieved by kapitan zur see at sea so he could be sent to command mediterranean division hannover joined rest of fleet for maneuvers in baltic in november that year year 1914 began as previous years had with squadron training on 14july annual summer cruise to norway began threat of war during july crisis caused kaiser to end cruise early after only two weeks and by end of july fleet was back in port preparing for hostilities at midnight on 4august united kingdom declared war on germany for violating belgium s neutrality world war i following outbreak of world war i hannover was tasked with guard duty in altenbruch roadstead at mouth of elbe river during period of mobilization for rest of fleet in late october ships were sent to kiel to have modifications made to their underwater protection systems to make them more resistant to torpedoes and mines hannover then joined battleship support for battlecruisers that bombarded scarborough hartlepool and whitby on 15 16 december 1914 during operation german battle fleet of 12 dreadnoughts and eight pre dreadnoughts came within of an isolated squadron of six british battleships however skirmishes between rival destroyer screens in darkness convinced german fleet commander vadm friedrich von ingenohl that entire grand fleet was deployed before him under orders from wilhelm ii to avoid battle if victory was not certain ingenohl broke off engagement and turned battle fleet back towards germany hannover put to sea during battle of dogger bank on 24january 1915 to support beleaguered german battlecruisers but quickly returned to port on 17 18 april hannover supported a minelaying operation off swarte bank by light cruisers of iireconnaissance group a fleet advance to dogger bank followed on 21 22 april on 16may hannover was sent to kiel to have one of her 28 cm guns replaced ship returned to kiel on 28june to have supplemental oil firing installed for her boilers work lasted until kzs gottfried von dalwigk zu lichtenfels replaced mauve on 11august raising his flag aboard hannover on 20th on 11 12 september iireconnaissance group conducted another minelaying operation off swarte bank with hannover and rest of iisquadron in support this was followed by another fruitless sweep by fleet on 23 24 october during fleet advance of 5 7 march 1916 hannover and rest of iisquadron remained in german bight ready to sail in support they then rejoined fleet during operation to bombard yarmouth and lowestoft on 24 25 april during this operation battlecruiser was damaged by a british mine and had to return to port prematurely visibility was poor so operation was quickly called off before british fleet could intervene battle of jutland thumb upright 1 4 diagram of battle of jutland showing major movements alt german fleet sailed to north and met british fleet sailing from west both fleets conducted a series of turns and maneuvers during chaotic battle admiral reinhard scheer commander of german fleet immediately planned another advance into north sea but damage to seydlitz delayed operation until end of may hannover was flagship in ivdivision of iibattle squadron which was positioned at rear of german line iibattle squadron was commanded by mauve on 31 may at 02 00 cet hipper s battlecruisers steamed out towards skagerrak followed by rest of high seas fleet an hour and a half later during run to north scheer ordered fleet to pursue retreating battleships of british squadron at top speed hannover and her sisters were significantly slower than faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind during this period scheer directed hannover to place herself at rear of german line so he would have a flagship on either end of formation by 19 30 grand fleet had arrived on scene and confronted scheer with significant numerical superiority german fleet was severely hampered by presence of slower deutschland class ships if scheer ordered an immediate turn towards germany he would have to sacrifice slower ships to make good his escape scheer decided to reverse course of fleet with gefechtskehrtwendung a maneuver that required every unit in german line to turn 180deg simultaneously as a result of their having fallen behind ships of iibattle squadron could not conform to new course following turn hannover and other five ships of squadron were therefore located on disengaged side of german line mauve considered moving his ships to rear of line astern of iiibattle squadron dreadnoughts but decided against it when he realized movement would interfere with maneuvering of admiral franz von hipper s battlecruisers instead he attempted to place his ships at head of line later on first day of battle hard pressed battlecruisers of iscouting group were being pursued by their british opponents hannover and other so called five minute ships came to their aid by steaming in between opposing battlecruiser squadrons ships were only very briefly engaged owing in large part to poor visibility hannover fired eight rounds from her 28 cm guns during this period british battlecruiser fired on hannover several times until latter was obscured by smoke hannover was struck once by fragments from one of shells fired by princess royal mauve decided it would be inadvisable to continue fight against much more powerful battlecruisers and so ordered an 8 point turn to starboard late on 31st fleet organized for night voyage back to germany deutschland pommern and hannover fell in behind and other dreadnoughts of iiibattle squadron towards rear of line hannover was then joined by other members of her unit schlesien and hessen situated herself between hannover and pommern while other two ships fell in at rear of line shortly after 01 00 leading ships of german line came into contact with armored cruiser which was quickly destroyed in a hail of gunfire from german dreadnoughts nassau was forced to fall out of line to avoid sinking british ship and an hour later rejoined formation directly ahead of hannover at around 03 00 british destroyers conducted a series of attacks against fleet some of which targeted hannover shortly thereafter pommern was struck by at least one torpedo from destroyer hit detonated an ammunition magazine which destroyed ship in a tremendous explosion hannover was astern of pommern and was forced to turn hard to starboard to avoid wreck simultaneously a third torpedo from onslaught passed closely astern of hannover which forced ship to turn away shortly after 04 00 hannover and several other ships fired repeatedly at what were thought to be submarines in one instance firing from hannover and hessen nearly damaged light cruisers and which prompted scheer to order them to cease firing hannover and several other ships again fired at imaginary submarines shortly before 06 00 despite ferocity of night fighting high seas fleet punched through british destroyer forces and reached horns reef by 04 00 on 1june german fleet reached wilhelmshaven a few hours later where undamaged dreadnoughts of and es took up defensive positions while damaged ships and survivors of iisquadron retreated within harbor over course of battle hannover had fired eight 28 cm shells twenty one 17 cm rounds and forty four shells from her 8 8 cm guns she emerged from battle completely unscathed later actions experience at jutland convinced scheer that pre dreadnoughts of iisquadron could no longer be used as front line battleships accordingly they were detached from high seas fleet and returned to guard duty in elbe now kadm dalwigk hauled down his flag on and a replacement was not appointed though iisquadron remained in at least administrative existence until 15august 1917 in meantime hannover went to kiel for maintenance on 4november 1916 before resuming guard ship duties in elbe from 10february to 23april 1917 she served as flagship for vadm hubert von rebeur paschwitz during this period on ship had some

4november 1918 as a wider mutiny aboard high seas fleet spread from wilhelmshaven to kiel on 11november germany entered into armistice with western allies according to terms of armistice most modern components of germany s surface fleet were interned in british naval base at scapa flow while rest of fleet was demilitarized on day armistice took effect hannover was sent briefly to swinemunde before returning to kiel on 14 15november along with schlesien hannover was decommissioned a month later on 17december in accordance with terms of armistice postwar service following german defeat in world war i german navy was reorganized as reichsmarine according to treaty of versailles new navy was permitted to retain eight pre dreadnought battleships under article of which would be in coastal defense this amounted to three of deutschland class battleships hannover schleswig holstein and well as five braunschweig class battleships hannover was modernized between 1920 and 1921 to prepare her for active service with fleet on 10february 1921 she was recommissioned as flagship of commander of naval forces of baltic sea kzs und kommodore kzs and commodore hugo von rosenberg unit was based in swinemunde and at time it also included light cruiser survey ship and boat flotilla in june and july unit held first major post war exercises in western baltic later that year hannover visited gotland in march 1922 hannover was tasked with clearing paths in heavy sea ice in eastern baltic on 1april she and rest of unit were transferred to kiel during night fighting exercises on 23may hannover collided with torpedo boat s18 killing ten men aboard torpedo boat later that year during summer training cruise hannover visited several ports in finland and in september she took part in major training exercises she visited stockholm from 18 to 22october where rosenberg was received by gustaf v of sweden thumb left ships of reichsmarine in 1929 alt two large warships steaming in opposite directions close together with several other vessels are in distance in 1923 hannover visited ornskoldsvik and karlskrona in sweden she lost her role as flagship on 22september and fleet was reorganized from north sea and baltic sea commands to create battleship division to which hannover was assigned in mid 1924 battleship division made its first major overseas cruise to spain and hannover stopped in from 6 to 13july paul behncke commander of reichsmarine came aboard ship during autumn maneuvers in august and september which concluded with a fleet review off hel poland on 10september while from wilhelmshaven to kiel in december hannover collided with a tugboat that had been torn from its moorings hannover was damaged in accident and water flooded engine room forcing her to return to wilhelmshaven for repairs that lasted until february 1925 fleet cruised norwegian waters during summer cruise and visited oslo and ulvik and in september ships conducted training in north sea on 1october hannover once again became a flagship this time for of battleship division kzs und kommodore wilhelm prentzel at that time active german fleet consisted of hannover braunschweig
