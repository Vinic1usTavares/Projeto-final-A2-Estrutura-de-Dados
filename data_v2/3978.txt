thumb upright 1 3 this image from frontispiece of a book on subject depicts a dutch reformed service of lord s supper in reformed theology lord s supper or eucharist is a sacrament that spiritually nourishes christians and strengthens their union with christ outward or physical action of sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine reformed confessions which are official statements of beliefs of reformed churches teach that christ s body and blood are really present in sacrament but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence early reformed theologians such as john calvin and huldrych zwingli rejected medieval belief in transubstantiation that bread and wine of eucharist change into christ s body and blood but taught that christ s person including his body and blood are presented to christians who partake of it in faith they also disagree with martin luther and lutheran tradition which taught that christ s body is physically eaten with mouth in sacrament later reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views similar to that of calvin and zwingli in modern period karl barth espoused a symbolic view that sacrament only communicates god s promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises other reformed theologians continued to teach traditional view history background from beginning of christianity through tenth century christian theologians saw eucharist as church s participation in christ s sacrifice christ was believed to be present in eucharist but there were differences over way in which this occurred school of antioch in eastern roman empire along with hilary of poitiers and ambrose in western roman empire taught a realist metabolic or somatic view where elements of eucharist were believed to be changed into christ s body and blood influential fourth century western theologian augustine of hippo on other hand held that christ is really present in elements of eucharist but not in a bodily manner because his body remains in heaven augustine believed eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows christians to become part of christ s body western theologians in three centuries following augustine did not elaborate on way christ is present in eucharist but emphasized transforming power of sacrament in ninth century hrabanus maurus and also defended augustine s view of nonmetabolic real presence during high and late middle ages metabolic view became increasingly dominant to exclusion of nonmetabolic view to point that it was considered only orthodox option doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in high middle ages to explain change of elements into christ s body and blood transubstantiation is belief that eucharistic elements are transformed into christ s body and blood in a way only perceivable by intellect not by senses reformation thumb left this seventeenth century medal commemorating john calvin depicts a hand holding a heart to heaven calvin believed christians were lifted up to heaven by holy spirit in lord s supper martin luther instigator of protestant reformation and leader of protestant movement which would be called lutheranism rejected doctrine of transubstantiation but continued to hold that christ is bodily present under bread and wine luther insisted that christ s words during institution of sacrament this is my body be taken literally he believed that anyone who ate and drank during eucharist often called lord s supper by protestants physically ate christ s body and drank his blood regardless of their faith huldrych zwingli first theologian in reformed tradition also rejected view of transubstantiation but he disagreed with luther by holding that christ s body is not physically present in eucharist he held following augustine that christ s whole person body and spirit is presented to believers in eucharist but that this does not occur by christ s body being eaten with mouth this view has been labeled mystical real presence meaning that those who partake have a direct experience of god s presence or spiritual real presence because christ s presence is by his spirit zwingli also did not believe that sacrament actually confers grace which is offered in sacrament but that outer signs of bread and wine testify to that grace and awaken memory of christ s death john calvin a very influential early reformed theologian believed lord s supper fed christians with spiritual food of union with christ he believed that in supper christians feed on christ s flesh which he saw as an inexplicable miracle calvin taught that supper confirms promises communicated to christians in preaching of gospel he also saw its purpose as provoking praise for god and love for other people he believed it necessary for christians to partake of christ s humanity in supper as well as his spirit and that bread and wine really present rather than simply symbolize or represent christ s body and blood calvin spoke of communication involved in lord s supper as spiritual meaning that it originates in holy spirit calvin s teaching on lord s supper was followed by many others in reformed tradition including martin bucer and peter martyr vermigli calvin like zwingli and against luther did not believe that christ is bodily present in elements of eucharist he taught that christ remains in heaven and that we commune with him in lord s supper by being raised up to him rather than him descending to us calvin believed elements of supper to be used by god as instruments in communicating promises which they represent a view called symbolic instrumentalism heinrich bullinger zwingli s successor went beyond zwingli by teaching that there is a union between sacrament of supper and grace symbolized in them bullinger s view was not identical to calvin s because he did not see sacraments as instrumental in communicating grace bullinger s view has been called symbolic parallelism because inward feeding on christ occurs at same time as outward eating of bread and wine but is not caused by it in any way reformed confessions of faith official statements of beliefs of reformed churches followed view that christ is really present in supper they either took calvin s view that signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace or bullinger s symbolic parallelism some of german language reformed confessions seem hesitant to make sacrament a means of grace but they all maintain that there is a union between outward signs of sacrament and inward grace signified reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on christ s real presence in supper while denying against lutherans that his body is locally present modern influential eighteenth century reformed theologian friedrich schleiermacher saw problems with all of reformation positions on christ s presence in eucharist and hoped that a new articulation of doctrine would be made he emphasized function of supper of confirming christians union with christ as well as union they have with one another in nineteenth century doctrine of lord s supper became a point of controversy between american reformed theologians john williamson nevin and charles hodge nevin influenced by german lutheran isaak august dorner wrote that through lord s supper christians are mystically united to christ s whole person and that this union is through christ s flesh hodge thought that nevin overemphasized idea of mystical union and argued that when christians are said to commune with christ in supper it is christ s virtue as a sacrifice for their sins which is meant rather than a mystical union with his flesh hodge also taught that nothing is communicated in lord s supper which is not communicated in preaching of god s word american presbyterians generally agreed with hodge nineteenth century reformed congregationalist followers of new england theology generally held a symbolic memorial view of supper twentieth century reformed theologian karl barth did not follow reformed belief that sacraments are used by god as means of grace instead he saw lord s supper as purely symbolic and functioning to proclaim god s promises his position has been called symbolic because he saw sacraments function as memorializing christ s death another twentieth century reformed theologian donald baillie took a position similar to that of john calvin baillie argued that though god is omnipresent he is present in a special way in lord s supper because he is present by virtue of believer s faith christ s presence is even more real to believer in sacrament than is physical reality meaning in reformed confessions lord s supper is a meal that provides spiritual nourishment eating body and drinking blood of christ in sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen christians believers are already believed to be united with christ but supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim death and resurrection of christ partakers are to express gratitude and praise to god in thanks for his death and benefits it provides supper is believed to assure christians of their salvation and union with christ which has been communicated to them in preaching of gospel supper is also believed to enhance christians union with one another it calls christians to love and obey christ and to live in harmony with other christians reformed confessions reject catholic doctrine that eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation or sacrifice to satisfy god s wrath and attain forgiveness of sins instead they teach that christ s body is only to be received not re presented to god as a sacrifice confessions do sometimes speak of supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for gift of propitiation which has been received in twentieth century scottish reformed theologian t f torrance developed a strong doctrine of eucharistic sacrifice he argued that christ s person and work could not be separated and that eucharist mediated his sacrificial death in reformed churches only believing christians are expected to partake of lord s supper further partakers are expected to examine and prepare themselves for sacrament this involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in christ to forgive them christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation but they are at least to be aware of their sin and have a desire to have faith christ s presence thumb a scottish sacrament by henry john dobson reformed confessions teach that christ s true body and blood are really present in lord s supper regarding what is received in supper reformed tradition does not disagree with position of catholicism or lutheranism reformed confessions teach that partakers of supper in words of belgic confession partake of proper and natural body and proper blood of christ however they deny explanations for this eating and drinking made by lutherans and catholics against catholics reformed confessions teach that bread and wine of supper do not become blood and body of christ as in catholic view of transubstantiation against lutherans reformed confessions do not teach that partakers of supper physically eat christ s body and drink his blood with their mouths while reformed confessions teach that in supper christ is received in both his divine and human natures manner of eating is believed to be spiritual body and blood of christ remain fleshly substance but they are communicated to in a spiritual manner see also receptionism reformed baptismal theology references bibliography category calvinist theology
