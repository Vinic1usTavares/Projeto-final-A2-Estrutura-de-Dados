third anglo maratha war 1817 1818 was final and decisive conflict between british east india company eic and maratha empire in india war left company in control of most of india it began with an invasion of maratha territory by british east india company troops largest such british controlled force massed in india troops were led by governor general hastings no relation to warren hastings first governor general of bengal supported by a force under general thomas hislop operations began against pindaris a band of muslim mercenaries and marathas from central india peshwa baji rao ii s forces supported by those of ii bhonsle of nagpur and holkar iii of indore rose against east india company pressure and diplomacy convinced fourth major maratha leader shinde of gwalior to remain neutral even though he lost control of rajasthan british victories were swift resulting in breakup of maratha empire and loss of maratha independence peshwa was defeated in battles of khadki and koregaon several minor battles were fought by peshwa s forces to prevent his capture peshwa was eventually captured and placed on a small estate at bithur near kanpur most of his territory was annexed and became part of bombay presidency maharaja of satara was restored as ruler of his territory as a princely state in 1848 this territory was also annexed by bombay presidency under doctrine of lapse policy of lord dalhousie bhonsle was defeated in battle of sitabuldi and holkar in battle of mahidpur northern portion of bhonsle s dominions in and around nagpur together with peshwa s territories in bundelkhand were annexed by british india as saugor and territories defeat of bhonsle and holkar also resulted in acquisition of maratha kingdoms of nagpur and indore by british along with gwalior from shinde and jhansi from peshwa all of these territories became princely states acknowledging british control british proficiency in indian war making was demonstrated through their rapid victories in khadki sitabuldi mahidpur koregaon and satara marathas and british thumb 200px map of india after second anglo maratha war 1805 maratha empire was founded in 1674 by chatrapati shivaji maharaj of bhosle dynasty common elements among citizens of chatrapati shivaji s maratha empire were marathi language hindu religion a strong sense of belonging and a national feeling shivaji led resistance efforts to free hindus from mughals and muslim sultanate of bijapur and established rule of hindus this kingdom was known as swarajya hindu self rule in marathi language chatrapati shivaji s capital was located at raigad chatrapati shivaji successfully defended his empire from attacks by mughal empire and his maratha empire went on to defeat and overtake it as premier power in india within few decades a key component of maratha administration was council of eight ministers called ashta pradhan council of eight senior most member of ashta pradhan was called peshwa or pradhan prime minister growing british power while marathas were fighting mughals in early 18th century british held small trading posts in mumbai madras and calcutta british fortified naval post of mumbai after they saw marathas defeat portuguese at neighbouring in may 1739 in an effort to keep marathas out of mumbai british sent envoys to negotiate a treaty envoys were successful and a treaty was signed on 12 july 1739 that gave british east india company rights to free trade in maratha territory in south nizam of hyderabad had enlisted support of french for his war against marathas in reaction to this peshwa requested support from british but was refused unable to see rising power of british peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal maratha conflicts despite lack of support marathas managed to defeat nizam over a period of five years during period 1750 1761 british defeated french east india company in india and by 1793 they were firmly established in bengal in east and madras in south they were unable to expand to west as marathas were dominant there but they entered surat on west coast via sea marathas marched beyond indus as their empire grew responsibility for managing sprawling maratha empire in north was entrusted to two maratha leaders shinde and holkar as peshwa was busy in south two leaders did not act in concert and their policies were influenced by personal interests and financial demands they alienated other hindu rulers such as rajputs jats and rohillas and they failed to diplomatically win over other muslim leaders a large blow to marathas came in their defeat on 14 january 1761 at panipat against a combined muslim force that gathered for jihad holy battle led by afghan ahmad shah abdali an entire generation of maratha leaders lay dead on battlefield as a result of that conflict however between 1761 and 1773 marathas regained lost ground in north anglo maratha relations maratha gains in north were undone because of contradictory policies of holkar and shinde and internal disputes in family of peshwa which culminated in murder of narayanrao peshwa in 1773 due to this marathas virtually disappeared from north india raghunathrao was ousted from seat of peshwa due to continuing internal maratha rivalries he sought help from british and they signed treaty of surat with him in march 1775 this treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of salsette island and bassein fort treaty set off discussions amongst british in india as well as in europe because of serious implications of a confrontation with powerful marathas another cause for concern was that bombay council had exceeded its constitutional authority by signing such a treaty treaty was cause of start of first anglo maratha war this war was virtually a stalemate with no side being able to defeat other war concluded with treaty of salabai in may 1782 mediated by shinde foresight of warren hastings was main reason for success of british in war he had destroyed anti british coalition and created a division between shinde bhonsle and peshwa marathas were still in a very strong position when new governor general of british controlled territories cornwallis arrived in india in 1786 after treaty of salabai british followed a policy of coexistence in north british and marathas enjoyed more than two decades of peace thanks to diplomacy of nana a minister in court of 11 year old peshwa sawai madhavrao situation changed soon after nana s death in 1800 power struggle between holkar and shinde caused holkar to attack peshwa in pune in 1801 since peshwa sided with shinde peshwa baji rao ii fled pune to safety on a british warship baji rao feared loss of his own powers and signed treaty of bassein this made peshwa in effect a subsidiary ally of british in response to treaty bhonsle and shinde attacked british refusing to accept betrayal of their sovereignty to british by peshwa this was start of second anglo maratha war in 1803 both were defeated by british and all maratha leaders lost large parts of their territory to british british east india company british had travelled thousands of miles to arrive in india they studied indian geography and mastered local languages to deal with indians at time they were technologically advanced with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally chhabra hypothesizes that even if british technical superiority were discounted they would have won war because of discipline and organization in their ranks after first anglo maratha war warren hastings declared in 1783 that peace established with marathas was on such a firm ground that it was not going to be shaken for years to come british believed that a new permanent approach was needed to establish and maintain continuous contact with peshwa s court in pune british appointed charles malet a senior merchant from bombay to be a permanent resident at pune because of his knowledge of languages and customs of region prelude maratha empire had partly declined due to second anglo maratha war efforts to modernize armies were half hearted and undisciplined newer techniques were not absorbed by soldiers while older methods and experience was outdated and obsolete maratha empire lacked an efficient spy system and had weak diplomacy compared to british maratha artillery was outdated and weapons were imported foreign officers were responsible for handling of imported guns marathas never used their own men in considerable numbers for purpose although maratha infantry was praised by likes of wellington they were poorly led by their generals and heavily relied on mercenaries known as pindaris confederate like structure that evolved within empire created a lack of unity needed for wars left thumb mountstuart elphinstone at time of war power of british east india company was on rise whereas maratha empire was on decline british had been victorious in previous anglo maratha war and marathas were at their mercy peshwa of maratha empire at this time was baji rao ii several maratha leaders who had formerly sided with peshwa were now under british control or protection british had an arrangement with gaekwad dynasty of maratha province of baroda to prevent peshwa from collecting revenue in that province gaekwad sent an envoy to peshwa in pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection envoy gangadhar shastri was under british protection he was murdered and peshwa s minister dengle was suspected of crime british seized opportunity to force baji rao into a treaty treaty treaty of pune was signed on 13 june 1817 key terms imposed on peshwa included admission of dengle s guilt renouncing claims on gaekwad and surrender of significant swaths of territory to british these included his most important strongholds in deccan seaboard of konkan and all places north of narmada and south of tungabhadra rivers peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in india british resident mountstuart elphinstone also asked peshwa to disband his cavalry maratha planning thumb ruins of old palace at raigad fort peshwa disbanded his cavalry but secretly asked them to stand by and offered them seven months advance pay baji rao entrusted bapu gokhale with preparations for war in august 1817 forts at sinhagad raigad and purandar were fortified by peshwa gokhale secretly recruited troops for impending war many and ramoshis were hired efforts were made to unify bhonsle shinde and holkar even mercenary pindaris were approached peshwa identified unhappy marathas in service of british resident elphinstone and secretly recruited them one such person was rao ghorpade efforts were made to secretly recruit europeans as well which failed some people such as balaji pant natu stood steadfastly with british several of sepoys rejected peshwa s offers and others reported matter to their superior officers on 19 october 1817 baji rao ii celebrated festival in pune where troops were assembled in large numbers during celebrations a large flank of maratha cavalry pretended they were charging towards british sepoys but wheeled off at last minute this display was intended as a slight towards elphinstone and as a scare tactic to prompt defection and recruitment of british sepoys to peshwa s side peshwa made plans to kill elphinstone despite opposition from gokhale elphinstone was fully aware of these developments thanks to espionage work of balaji pant natu and ghorpade burton provides an estimate of strength of various maratha powers in or around 1817 he estimated various maratha powers totals to 81 000 infantry 106 000 horse or cavalry and 589 guns of these peshwa had highest number of cavalry at 28 000 along with 14 000 infantry and 37 guns peshwa headquarters was in pune which was southernmost location amongst other maratha powers holkar had second largest cavalry amounting to 20 000 and an infantry force of 8 000 his guns totaled to 107 guns shinde and bhonsle had similar numbers of cavalry and infantry with each having 15 000 and 16 000 cavalry respectively shinde had 16 000 infantry and bhonsle 18 000 shinde had larger share of guns amounting to 140 whereas bhonsle had 85 holkar shinde and bhonsle were headquartered in indore gwalior and nagpur respectively afghan leader amir khan was located in tonk in rajputana and his strength was 12 000 cavalry 10 000 infantry and 200 guns pindaris were located north of narmada valley in chambal and malwa region of central india three pindari leaders sided with shinde these were setu karim khan and dost mohammad they were mostly horsemen with strengths of 10 000 6 000 and 4 000 rest of pindari chiefs tulsi imam baksh sahib khan kadir baksh nathu and bapu were allied with holkar tulsi and imam baksh each had 2 000 horsemen kadir baksh 21 500 sahib khan nathu and bapu had 1 000 750 and 150 horsemen commencement thumb richard wellesley 1st marquess wellesley who rapidly expanded company s territories with victories in anglo maratha wars peshwa s territory was in an area called desha now part of modern state of maharashtra region consists of valleys of krishna and godavari rivers and plateaus of sahyadri mountains shinde s territory around gwalior and bundelkhand was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes down toward indo gangetic plain to north pindari territory was valleys and forests of chambal north western region of modern state of madhya pradesh it was a mountainous region with a harsh climate pindaris also operated from malwa a plateau region in north west of state of madhya pradesh north of vindhya range holkar was based in upper narmada river valley war was mostly a mopping up operation intended to complete expansion of earlier anglo maratha war which was stopped due to economic concerns of british war began as a campaign against pindaris seeing that british were in conflict with pindaris peshwa s forces attacked british at 16 00 on 5 november 1817 with maratha left attacking british right maratha forces comprised 20 000 cavalry 8 000 infantry and 20 guns whereas british had 2 000 cavalry 1 000 infantry and eight guns on maratha side an additional 5 000 horse and 1 000 infantry were guarding peshwa at parvati hill british numbers include captain ford s unit which was en route from to khadki british had also asked general smith to come to khadki for battle but they did not anticipate he would arrive in time three hills in region were parvati hill hill and khadki hill peshwa watched battle from parvati hill whereas british east india company troops were based on khadki hill two hills are separated by a distance of four kilometres river mula is shallow and narrow and could be crossed at several locations a few canals in marathi joined river and though these were not obstacles some of them were obscured due to vegetation in area maratha army was a mix of rohillas rajputs and marathas it also included a small force of portuguese under their officer de pinto left flank of maratha army commanded by moropant dixit and raste was stationed on flat ground on which university of pune stands today centre was commanded by bapu gokhale and right was under vinchurkar british troop movements began on 1 november 1817 when colonel burr moved his forces towards what is now bund garden via holkar bridge maratha were successful initially in creating and exploiting a gap in british left and centre these successes were nullified by maratha horses being thrown into disarray by a hidden canal and temporary loss of command by gokhale whose horse was shot marathas were rendered leaderless when moropant dixit on right was shot dead british infantry advanced steadily firing volley after volley causing maratha cavalry to retreat in a matter of four hours british soon claimed victory british lost 86 men and maratha about 500 pindaris thumb location of malwa in an 1823 depiction of india malwa was headquarters of some of pindaris in early 19th century after second anglo maratha war shinde and holkar had lost many of their territories to british they encouraged pindaris to raid british territories pindaris who were mostly cavalry came to be known as shindeshahi and holkarshahi after patronage they received from respective defeated maratha leaders pindari leaders were setu karim khan dost mohammad tulsi imam baksh sahib khan kadir baksh nathu and bapu of these setu karim khan and dost mohammad belonged to shindeshahi and rest to holkarshahi total strength of pindaris in 1814 was estimated at 33 000 pindaris frequently raided villages in central india result of pindari raids was that central india was being rapidly reduced to condition of a desert because peasants were unable to support themselves on land they had no option but to join robber bands or starve in 1815 25 000 pindaris entered madras presidency and destroyed over 300 villages on coromandel coast another band swept nizam s kingdom while a third entered malabar other pindari raids on british territory followed in 1816 and 1817 francis rawdon hastings saw that there could not be peace or security in india until predatory pindaris were extinguished british planning to lead an army against pindaris in hope of engaging them in a regular battle was not possible to effectively crush pindaris they would have to be surrounded so that they could have no means of escape francis rawdon hastings obtained authority from british government to take action against pindaris while performing diplomacy with principal maratha leaders to act in concert with him pindaris continued to have sympathy of almost all maratha leaders in 1817 rawdon hastings collected strongest british army which had yet been seen in india numbering roughly 120 000 men army was assembled from two smaller armies grand army or bengal army in north under his personal command and army of deccan under general hislop in south british plan was to normalize relations with shinde holkar and amir khan three were known to be well disposed towards pindaris and harboured them in their territories shinde was secretly planning with peshwa and nepal ministry to form a coalition against british his correspondence with nepal was intercepted and presented to him in durbar he was forced to enter into a treaty by which he pledged to assist british against pindaris and to prevent any new gangs being formed in his territory diplomacy pressure and treaty of gwalior kept shinde out of war amir khan disbanded his army on condition of being guaranteed possession of principality of tonk in rajputana he sold his guns to british and agreed to prevent predatory gangs from operating from his territory army for war was composed of two armies grand army or bengal army with a strength of 40 000 troops and army of deccan with a strength of 70 400 grand army was divided into three divisions and a reserve left division was led by major general marshall and central division was under francis rawdon hastings reserve was under general ochterlony second army army of deccan was composed of five divisions divisions were led by general hislop brigadier general doveton general malcolm brigadier general smith lieutenant colonel adams army of deccan comprised 70 400 troops bringing total strength of entire composite british east india company army to 110 400 in addition madras and pune residencies each had two battalions and a detail of an artillery unit madras residency had an additional three troops of 6th bengal cavalry in october and early november first division of grand army was sent to sind second to chambal third to eastern narmada reserve division was used to pressurise amir khan effect of dispatching of first and second divisions was to cut off shinde from his potential allies he and amir khan were thus pressured into signing a treaty first and third division of army of deccan were concentrated at to hold fords of narmada second division was used placed at to keep a watch on berar ghats fourth division marched to occupying region between pune and amravati berar administrative divisions whereas fifth division was placed at and reserve division was placed between bhima and krishna rivers attack on pindaris attack on pindaris was carried out as planned pindaris were attacked and their homes were surrounded and destroyed general hislop from madras residency attacked pindaris from south and drove them beyond narmada river where governor general francis rawdon hastings was waiting with his army karim khan surrendered to british and was given lands in gorakhpur principal routes from central india were occupied by british detachments pindari forces were completely broken up scattered in course of a single campaign they made no stand against regular troops and even in small bands they were unable to escape ring of forces drawn around them pindaris rapidly dispersed over country pindari chiefs were reduced to condition of hunted outlaws desperate pindaris expected marathas to help them but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families karim and setu had still 23 000 men between them but such a force was no match for armies that surrounded them in whatever direction they turned they were met by british forces defeat followed defeat one gang made their escape to south leaving all their baggage behind them many fled to jungles and perished others sought refuge in villages but were killed without mercy by villagers who had not forgotten sufferings they had been inflicted upon by pindaris pindari chiefs karim khan and wasil mohammed had been present with their at battle of mahidpur since by this time maratha powers had been reduced significantly pursuit of setu and other leaders was resumed with vigor all leaders had surrendered before end of february and pindari system and power was brought to a close they were removed to where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence karim khan became a farmer on small estate he received beyond ganges in wasil mohammed attempted to escape he was found and committed suicide by taking poison setu a jat by caste was hunted by john malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left he vanished into jungles of central india in 1819 and was killed by a tiger flight of peshwa on orders of elphinstone general smith arrived in yerwada near pune on 13 november at site of present deccan college smith and his troops crossed river on 15 november and took up positions at on morning of 16 november marathas were engaged in a battle with british while maratha generals such as purandare raste and bapu gokhale were ready to advance on to british forces they were demoralized after learning that peshwa and his brother had fled to purandar a force of 5 000 additional marathas was located at confluence of two rivers mula and mutha under leadership of vinchurkar but they remained idle bapu gokhale retreated to guard peshwa in flight next morning general smith advanced towards city of pune and found that peshwa had fled towards city of satara during day pune surrendered and great care was taken by general smith for protection of peaceful part of community order was soon re established british forces entered wada on 17 november and union flag was hoisted by balaji pant natu however saffron flags of peshwa were not removed from chavdi until defeat of baji rao at ashti it might seem that british still believed that war was not raised by baji rao but he was forced to do so under pressure from bapu gokhle trimabkji dengle and moreshwar peshwa now fled to town of koregaon battle of koregaon also known as battle of koregaon bhima took place on 1 january 1818 on banks of river bhima north west of pune captain stauton arrived near koregaon along with 500 infantry two six pounder guns and 200 irregular horsemen only 24 of infantry were of european origin they were from madras artillery rest of infantry was composed of indians employed by british village of koregaon was on north bank of river which was shallow and narrow at this time of year village had a fortified enclosure constructed in standard maratha fashion stauton occupied village but was unable to take fortified enclosure which was occupied by marathas british were cut off from river their only source of water a fierce battle ensued that lasted entire day streets and guns were captured and recaptured changing hands several times baji rao s commander trimabkji killed lt thereby avenging death of gokhle only son of bapu gokhle peshwa watched battle from atop a nearby hill about two miles away marathas evacuated village and retreated during night this move on part of marathas may seem justifiable because they were employing tactics of kawa rather than british lost 175 men and about a third of irregular horse with more than half of european officers wounded marathas lost 500 to 600 men when british found village evacuated in morning staunton took his battered troops and pretended to march on to pune but actually went to first authentic information about koregaon battle shows that it was a narrow escape rather than a heroic victory for british accounts have been received from lt col burr dated 3rd january 1818 intimating that capt staunton commanding 2nd battalion 1st regiment of bombay native infantry had been fortunately able to commence his march back to with 125 wounded having buried 50 at sic and left 12 or 15 there badly wounded that peshwa had proceeded southward general smith in pursuit which had probably saved battalion interesting intelligence from london gazette june 1818 page 550 after battle british forces under general pritzler pursued peshwa who fled southwards towards karnataka with raja of satara peshwa continued his flight southward throughout month of january not receiving support from raja of mysore peshwa doubled back and passed general pritzler to head towards solapur until 29 january pursuit of peshwa had not been productive whenever baji rao was pressed by british gokhale and his light troops hovered around peshwa and fired long shots some skirmishes took place and marathas were frequently hit by shells from horse artillery there was however no advantageous result to either party on 7 february general smith entered satara and captured royal palace of marathas he symbolically raised british flag next day zenda flag of shivaji and marathas was raised in its place to gain support of population british declared that they would not interfere with tenets of any religion they announced that all pensions and annual allowances would be continued provided that recipients withdrew from service of baji rao during this time baji rao remained in vicinity of solapur on 19 february general smith got word that peshwa was headed for pandharpur general smith s troops attacked peshwa at ashti en route during this battle gokhale died while defending peshwa from british raja of satara was captured along with his brother and mother maratha king first imprisoned by tarabai in 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by madhav rao peshwa in 1763 after tarabai s death since then king had retained a titular position of appointing peshwas emperor ii in his farman to peshwa had complimented them for looking after chhatrapati family bharat mandal quarterly july 1920 chhatrapati declared in favour of british and this ended peshwa s legal position as head of maratha confederacy this was done by a jahirnama which stated peshwas were no longer head of maratha confederacy however baji rao ii challenged jahirnama of removing him from his position as peshwa by issuing another jahirnama removing mountstuart elphinstone as british resident to his state death of gokhale and skirmish at ashti hastened end of war soon after this baji rao was deserted by by 10 april 1818 general smith s forces had taken forts of sinhagad and purandar mountstuart elphinstone mentions capture of in his diary entry for 13 february 1818 garrison contained no marathas but consisted of 100 arabs 600 and 400 konkani killadar was a boy of eleven real governor punt a mean looking garrison was treated with great liberality and though there was much property and money in place killadar was allowed to have whatever he claimed as his own on 3 june 1818 baji rao surrendered to british and negotiated sum of eight lakhs as annual maintenance baji rao obtained promises from british in favor of his family brahmins and religious institutions peshwa was sent to bithur near kanpur while downfall and banishment of peshwa was mourned all over maratha empire as a national defeat peshwa seemed unaffected he contracted more marriages and spent his long life engaged in religious performances and excessive drinking events in nagpur thumb 250px sitabardi fort today thumb 250px battle of 1817 bhonsle also known as appa saheb consolidated his power in nagpur after murder of his cousin imbecile ruler bhonsle he entered into a treaty with british on 27 may 1816 he ignored request of british resident jenkins to refrain from contact with baji rao ii jenkins asked appa saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to residency which he also refused to do appa saheb openly declared support for peshwa who was already fighting british near pune as it was now clear that a battle was in offing jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby british east india company troops he already had about 1 500 men under lieutenant colonel scott jenkins sent word for colonel adams to march to nagpur with his troops like other maratha leaders appa employed arabs in his army they were typically involved in holding fortresses while they were known to be among bravest of troops they were not amenable to discipline and order total strength of marathas was about 18 000 residency was to west of sitabardi hill a hillock running north south british east india company troops occupied north end of hillock marathas fighting with arabs made good initial gains by charging up hill and forcing british to retreat to south british commanders began arriving with reinforcements lieutenant colonel on 29 november major pittman on 5 december and colonel doveton on 12 december british counterattack was severe and appa saheb was forced to surrender british lost 300 men of which 24 were europeans marathas lost an equal number a treaty was signed on 9 january 1818 appa saheb was allowed to rule over nominal territories with several restrictions most of his territory including forts was now controlled by british they built additional fortifications on sitabardi hill a few days later appa saheb was arrested he was being escorted to allahabad when he escaped to punjab to seek refuge with sikhs they turned him down and he was captured once again by british near jodhpur raja mansingh of jodhpur stood surety for him and he remained in jodhpur where he died on 15 july 1849 at 44 years of age subjugation of holkar thumb 200px map of india after third anglo maratha war 1819 holkar was offered terms similar to those offered to shinde only difference was that holkar accepted and respected independence of amir khan court of holkar was at this time practically nonexistent when jog an official of holkar urged acceptance of offer he was suspected of being in collusion with british in reality he made suggestion because he was aware of power of british as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in past holkar responded to peshwa s call for insurrection against british by initiating a battle in mahidpur battle of mahidpur between holkar and british was fought on 21 december 1817 charge on british side was led by malcolm himself a deadly battle ensued lasting from midday until 3 00 am lieutenant general thomas hislop was commander in chief of madras army hislop came in sight of holkar army about 9 00 am british east india company s army lost 800 men but holkar s force was destroyed british east india company s losses were 800 killed or wounded but holkar s loss was much larger with about 3 000 killed or wounded these losses meant holkar was deprived of any means of rising in arms against british and this broke power of holkar dynasty battle of mahidpur proved disastrous for maratha fortunes henry durand wrote after battle of mahidpur not only peshwa s but real influence of mahratta states of holkar and shinde were dissolved and replaced by british supremacy although power of holkar family was broken remaining troops remained hostile and a division was retained to disperse them ministers made overtures of peace and on 6 january 1818 treaty of mandeswar was signed holkar accepted british terms in totality holkar came under british authority as an independent prince subject to advice of a british resident end of war and its effects 250px thumb nassak diamond was seized from peshwa by british and sent to london at end of war all of maratha powers had surrendered to british shinde and afghan amir khan were subdued by use of diplomacy and pressure which resulted in treaty of on 5 november 1817 under this treaty shinde surrendered rajasthan to british and agreed to help them fight pindaris amir khan agreed to sell his guns to british and received a land grant at tonk in rajputana holkar was defeated on 21 december 1817 and signed treaty of mandeswar on 6 january 1818 under this treaty holkar state became subsidiary to british young malhar rao was raised to throne bhonsle was defeated on 26 november 1817 and was captured but he escaped to live out his life in jodhpur peshwa surrendered on 3 june 1818 and was sent off to bithur near kanpur under terms of treaty signed on 3 june 1818 of pindari leaders karim khan surrendered to malcolm in february 1818 wasim mohammad surrendered to shinde and eventually poisoned himself and setu was killed by a tiger war left british under auspices of british east india company in control of virtually all of present day india south of sutlej river famed nassak diamond was acquired by company as part of spoils of war british acquired large chunks of territory from maratha empire and in effect put an end to their most dynamic opposition terms of surrender malcolm offered to peshwa were controversial amongst british for being too liberal peshwa was offered a luxurious life near kanpur and given a pension of about 80 000 pounds a comparison was drawn with napoleon who was confined to a small rock in south atlantic and given a small sum for his maintenance was captured after war and was sent to fortress of bengal where he spent rest of his life with all active resistance over john malcolm played a prominent part in capturing and pacifying remaining fugitives peshwa s territories were absorbed into bombay presidency and territory seized from pindaris became central provinces of british india princes of rajputana became symbolic feudal lords who accepted british as paramount power thus francis rawdon hastings redrew map of india to a state which remained more or less unaltered until time of lord dalhousie british brought an obscure descendant of shivaji founder of maratha empire to be ceremonial head of maratha confederacy to replace seat of peshwa an infant from holkar family was appointed as ruler of nagpur under british guardianship peshwa adopted a son nana sahib who went on to be one of leaders of rebellion of 1857 after 1818 elphinstone reorganized administrative divisions for revenue collection thus reducing importance of patil deshmukh and deshpande new government felt a need to communicate with local marathi speaking population
