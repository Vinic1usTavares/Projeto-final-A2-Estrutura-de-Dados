marasmius funalis is a species of marasmiaceae fungus known only from japan species produces small mushrooms with reddish brown caps up to in diameter and dark brown threadlike stems of up to in length species has a number of distinctive microscopic features including very long cystidia on stem visible as bristles described in 2002 by haruki takahashi species grows on dead wood closest relative of m funalis is m liquidambari known from mexico and papua new guinea and it is also similar in appearance to m hudonii and setulipes funaliformis latter of which was named after m funalis taxonomy marasmius funalis was first described and named in a 2002 article in mycoscience by haruki takahashi takahashi 2002 p 343 based on specimens collected in 2000 specific name funalis is latin for rope like and is in reference to shape and character of stem within genus marasmius species has traits that suggest that it belongs in section and within section it seems most closely related to m liquidambari japanese common name for species is description marasmius funalis produces fruit bodies in form of mushrooms each mushroom has a convex sometimes completely hemispherical cap of between in diameter unlike caps of other mushrooms it does not change shape to a flatter convex with age cap is fairly smooth but can have small parallel furrows towards edge which are arranged radially takahashi 2002 fig 2 colour differs slightly depending on age of mushroom while younger specimens sport reddish brown caps they are a paler brown in older mushrooms cap s surface is dry and dull and free from hair threadlike stem attaches centrally to cap measures from long by thick it is cylindrical but may taper slightly and is covered in short white hairs base of stem enters substrate and there are no rhizomorphs visible majority of stem is blackish brown but it is a lighter brown at very top takahashi 2002 p 345 white gills can be adnate or adnexed that is they can be attached to stem by their whole depth or only part of it individual gills are distantly spaced with between 8 and 12 reaching stem each gill is up to thick and edges are even there are sometimes lamellulae short gills that do not reach cap there is a thin layer up to thick of whitish flesh in cap it is tough but it can be bent without breaking flesh has no smell or taste microscopic characteristics marasmius funalis mushrooms leave a white spore print individual basidiospores are ellipsoidal and measure 6 5 to 8 by 4 to 5 micrometres mm they have thin cell walls and they are smooth and colourless spores are inamyloid meaning that they do not stain when they come into contact with iodine from melzer s reagent or lugol s solution spores are borne on club shaped basidia measuring 20 to 25 by 4 5 to 7 mm with two spores per basidium there are also club shaped basidioles under developed basidia edge of gill is sterile made up of a mass of cystidia cheilocystidia club shaped cheilocystidia measure from 10 to 25 by 7 to 12 mm and sport multiple cylindrical appendages on their tips measuring 1 to 7 by 1 to 1 5 mm cheilocystidia are colourless with cell walls of variable thickness and are inamyloid there are no pleurocystidia cystidia on face of gills takahashi 2002 p 346 caulocystidia cystidia in stem measure 60 to 200 by 4 to 7 um takahashi 2002 p 347 antonina and buyck 2007 p 920 they are cylindrical and erect forming visible bristles tip is either pointed or rounded and cell walls are smooth and colourless up to 2 um thick they are dextrinoid meaning they stain a reddish brown when they come into contact with iodine from melzer s reagent or lugol s solution takahashi 2002 p 347 8 pileipellis top layer of hyphae in cap is a cutis cutis is made up of cylindrical hyphae between 2 and 5 um thick inamyloid and thin walled hyphae are covered in brown granules flesh in cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7 um wide with thin cell walls they are all generative hyphae and run parallel to one another they can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid flesh in gills is basically same as flesh in cap but for fact that it is completely inamyloid hyphae of stipitipellis uppermost layer in stem also form a cutis cylindrical hyphae making up cutis run parallel to one another and measure from 2 5 to 4 5 um in width with walls up to 1 um thick they are encrusted with a brown pigment and are dextrinoid takahashi 2002 p 347 flesh of stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways that is up and down stem cells are 5 to 8 um wide and are smooth and colourless cell walls up to 1 um thick they are dextrinoid all m funalis hyphae lack clamp connections takahashi 2002 p 348 similar species marasmius funalis differs from its closest relative m liquidambari due to presence of cheilocystidia lack of clamp connections and fact that caulocystidia of m liquidambari do not form bristles instead they are club shaped to cylindrical species is known from mexico and papua new guinea m hudonii known from europe is similar in appearance to m funalis however former has a cap covered in hairs or bristles and differs microscopically for instance hyphae feature clamp connections malagasy species setulipes funaliformis was named after m funalis due to morphological similarities between two species can be differentiated by fact that basidiospores of s are slightly larger and narrower measuring from 7 to 10 by 3 5 to 4 5 mm and caulocystidia of m funalis are significantly longer antonina and buyck 2007 p 920 distribution and ecology marasmius funalis is known only from kawasaki kanagawa and machida tokyo japan mushrooms grow in groups on dead plant matter and have been recorded on japanese cedar cryptomeria japonica wood and leaf litter in woodland mostly made up of s hornbeam carpinus and bamboo leaf oak quercus mushrooms can be encountered from may to july see also list of marasmius species references bibliography category fungi of asia category
