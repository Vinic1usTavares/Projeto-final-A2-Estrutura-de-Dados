mountains of byzantine theme district of paristrion all contemporaneous chronicles describe asen i and his brothers as vlachs asen and peter who was still known as theodor at that time went to see byzantine emperor isaac ii angelos in thrace in 1185 to demand an estate in balkan mountains after emperor had refused them brothers persuaded their compatriots to rise up against byzantine empire peter was crowned emperor before end of year after isaac ii defeated them in early 1186 asen and peter fled over danube but they returned in autumn accompanied by cuman reinforcements they captured paristrion and began pillaging nearby byzantine territories asen became his brother s co ruler in 1187 or 1188 peter made a peace with byzantines but asen continued fight they divided their realm with asen receiving tarnovo and its region asen made a series of raids against byzantine territories and expanded his rule over lands along struma river in early 1190s a boyar aristocrat ivanko stabbed him to death in 1196 early life careers of asen and his brother theodor suggest they were descended from a prominent family they could directly approach monarch and mobilize their compatriots simpson 2016 pp 6 7 according to historian alicia simpson historian alexandru madgearu says their father was most probably a wealthy man who owned herds in balkan mountains asen s birth date is unknown of tsar boril calls him ioan asen belgun one of lives of ivan of rila confirms that ivan or ioan was his baptismal name his other two names are of turkic origin asen came from a turkic word meaning sound safe healthy belgun from a word for wise ethnic background of asen and his brothers is still a source of controversy among historians chronicles written in late 12th and early 13th centuries unanimously described them as vlachs their close relationship with cumans and turkic etymology of asan s names implies they were of cuman or pecheneg stock according to a scholarly theory multiethnic character of their homeland byzantine theme or district of paristrion makes it probable that vlachs bulgarians and cumans were among their ancestors robert of clari author of a chronicle of early history of latin empire of constantinople stated that asen whom clari confused with his younger brother kaloyan had once been a sergeant of emperor having charge of one of emperor s horse farms conquest of constantinople robert of clari ch 64 p 63 he noted that asen was obliged to send sixty to one hundred horses to imperial army at emperor s order according to simpson clari s report may only show that asen was not a landowner but a pastoralist in autumn of 1185 byzantine emperor isaac ii angelos encamped at kypsela in thrace now in turkey during his campaign against normans of sicily who had invaded byzantine empire theodor and asen came to camp to meet with emperor byzantine historian niketas choniates suggests they came only to provide grounds for their uprising clari says asen as manager of an imperial horse farm was to come to imperial court once a year theodor and asen requested a grant from emperor but its nature is uncertain words of choniates who recorded events suggest they applied for a pronoia revenues of an imperial estate on other hand a pronoia of little value was seldom granted personally by monarch this implies brothers demanded something more such as governorship of a district or administration of a semi independent territory according to modern scholarly theories emperor rebuffed brothers request but they dared to argue with his decision asen whom choniates characterized as more insolent and savage of two was especially impertinent and was struck across face and rebuked for impudence o city of byzantium annals of niketas choniates 5 1 369 p 204 at command of isaac ii s uncle john doukas they were not detained and could leave emperor s camp uprising beginnings thumb right 300px byzantine themes or districts of bulgaria and paristrion a special tax levied to finance emperor s marriage to margaret of hungary had brought bulgarian and vlach population to edge of an uprising before public humiliation of asen and his brother at imperial camp in spite of general discontent brothers were initially unable to stir up a rebellion because their compatriots did not believe they had any chance against imperial troops theodor and asen took advantage of sack of thessaloniki by normans during which icons of demetrius of thessaloniki patron saint of town were taken to bulgaria they built a house of prayer o city of byzantium annals of niketas choniates 5 1 371 p 205 and summoned bulgarian and vlach shamans to site brothers instructed these as choniates called them to declare before mob that god had consented to their freedom and saint demetrius would come over to them from thessaloniki to be their helper and assistant against byzantines theodor was crowned and assumed name peter thus adopting name of a 10th century tsar or emperor of bulgaria coronation and theodor s new name are evidence brothers wanted to demonstrate from beginning they had established a state which was political successor of first bulgarian empire they laid siege to preslav old capital of bulgarian empire but could not capture it during first months of 1186 brothers made plundering raids against thrace seizing captives and cattle isaac ii led a counteroffensive against rebels in person but they resisted invaders hiding in inaccessible places o city of byzantium annals of niketas choniates 5 1 372 p 205 in mountains it was only solar eclipse of 21 april 1186 that enabled imperial troops to mount an unexpected attack and defeat rioters peter and asen fled from their homeland and crossed lower danube seeking military assistance from cumans isaac ii thought his victory was decisive and returned to constantinople without securing defense of paristrion peter and asen made an alliance with some cuman chieftains who helped them to return to byzantine empire in autumn choniates wrote contradictory reports about negotiations between brothers and cumans in a formal speech he attributed alliance to peter s efforts in his chronicle he emphasized asen s role shortly after their return brothers took control of paristrion and launched a plundering expedition against thrace asen s military tactics application of sudden raids and quick withdrawals prevented imperial troops from making successful counterattacks choniates emphasized brothers were not simply content to seize mysia or paristrion but had decided to unite political power of mysia and bulgaria into one empire as of old o city of byzantium annals of niketas choniates 5 1 374 p 206 referring to their attempt to restore first bulgarian empire co ruler thumb right 300px second bulgarian empire from 1185 to 1196 according to a bulgarian historical atlas theory that bulgaria included oltenia and as it is presented on map is not universally accepted by historians seals bearing inscription ivan basileus or emperor of bulgarians were found in constantinople and other places according to george akropolites asen ruled over bulgarian race as emperor for nine years before he died in 1196 george akropolites history ch 12 p 137 this suggests asen became his brother s co ruler in 1187 or 1188 byzantines launched a series of unsuccessful campaigns against rebellious bulgarians and vlachs but they could not prevent peter and asen from securing their rule in paristrion isaac ii personally led his troops against brothers realm and laid siege to lovech in spring of 1188 although he could not occupy fortress byzantines captured asen s wife helen and his younger brother kaloyan he was held hostage in constantinople for years arrival of crusader army of holy roman emperor frederick barbarossa in balkan peninsula in july 1189 enabled peter and asen to occupy new territories of byzantine empire one of chronicles of barbarossa s crusade history of expedition of emperor frederick explicitly mentions that they seized region where danube flows into sea history of expedition of emperor frederick p 64 present day dobruja and parts of thrace when writing of negotiations between barbarossa and brothers envoys during march of crusaders across balkans primary sources mention only peter suggesting he was regarded as senior ruler of bulgaria crusaders left balkans for asia minor in march 1190 shortly after crusaders departure isaac ii angelos moved into lands under rule of peter and asen he could not defeat vlachs and bulgarians because they avoided a pitched battle forcing emperor to start to retreat imperial army was ambushed and defeated at a mountain pass victorious vlachs and bulgarians along with their cuman allies launched new raids against thrace pillaging anchialos now pomorie in bulgaria and other towns isaac ii defeated cumans near adrianople now edirne in turkey in april 1191 thereafter his cousin constantine angelos doukas routed peter and asen s troops in a series of battles a eulogy delivered in praise of isaac ii in 1193 referred to asen as a reckless and obdurate rebel surrounded by imperial traps while describing peter as a stumbling block and an adverse wind to his brother speech shows byzantine intrigues stirred up a conflict between brothers in 1192 madgearu says peter was allegedly willing to make peace with byzantines but asen wanted to continue war akropolites knew that peter moved from tarnovo to preslav at an unspecified date a region known as peter s land even in 13th century historians madgearu and paul stephenson agree sources provide evidence brothers divided their realm around 1192 with asen retaining tarnovo and its region after constantine angelos doukas was blinded during rebellion against isaac ii vlachs and bulgarians resumed their attacks against byzantine empire emperor dispatched alexios and basil vatatzes to wage war against invaders but their united armies were almost annihilated in battle of arcadiopolis peter and asen conquered new territories in thrace including plovdiv isaac ii decided to launch a new campaign to recover thrace himself while he was mustering his troops at kypsela his brother alexios captured and blinded him on 8 april 1195 alexios iii sent envoys to peter and asen proposing to make peace with them brothers refused new emperor s proposal asen moved into byzantine territory and defeated alexios he captured byzantine fortresses along river struma leaving vlach and bulgarian troops to garrison them a new byzantine army under command of emperor s son in law isaac komnenos launched a asen s vlach bulgarian and cuman troops surrounded invaders and defeated them near serres komnenos was captured by a cuman warrior who secretly tried to hold him to ask for a huge ransom from emperor when asen was informed of komnenos s capture he ordered cuman to hand over his captive death a boyar ivanko stabbed asen in 1196 but motive for this act is uncertain choniates who narrated events recorded two versions according to one account captive isaac komnenos persuaded ivanko to kill tsar promising to give his daughter in marriage to him second version claims ivanko had clandestine sexual relations with sister of asen s wife o city of byzantium annals of niketas choniates 6 1 469 p 257 but their affair was revealed to asen he decided to have his sister in law executed for illicit love affair which insulted his family but his wife persuaded him to punish ivanko instead of her sister asen ordered ivanko to come to his tent late at night ivanko who had been informed about tsar s decision came with a sword hidden under his garments he killed asen during meeting choniates stated ivanko wanted to rule more justly and equitably than asan who had governed everything by sword o city of byzantium annals of niketas choniates 6 1 470 p 258 stephenson concludes choniates words show that asen had introduced a reign of terror intimidating his subjects with assistance of cuman mercenaries however says byzantines encouraged ivanko to kill asen ivanko attempted to assume control in tarnovo with byzantine support but peter forced him to flee to byzantine empire peter charged kaloyan with governing of asen s realm family asen fathered at least two sons ivan asen and alexander ivan asen who was born around 1193 became emperor of bulgaria in
