caracal caracal caracal is a medium sized wild cat native to africa middle east central asia and india it is characterised by a robust build long legs a short face long tufted ears and long canine teeth its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy while ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings it reaches at shoulder and weighs it was first scientifically described by german naturalist johann christian daniel von schreber in 1776 three subspecies are recognised since 2017 typically nocturnal caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe it is territorial and lives mainly alone or in pairs caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals birds and rodents it can leap higher than and catch birds in midair it stalks its prey until it is within of it after which it runs it down prey being killed by a bite to throat or to back of neck both sexes become sexually mature by time they are one year old and breed throughout year gestation lasts between two and three months resulting in a litter of one to six kittens juveniles leave their mothers at age of nine to ten months though a few females stay back with their mothers average lifespan of captive caracals is nearly 16 years caracals have been tamed and used for hunting since time of ancient egypt taxonomy and phylogeny felis caracal was scientific name used by johann christian daniel von schreber in 1776 who described a cheetah skin from cape of good hope in 1843 british zoologist john edward gray placed it in genus caracal it is placed in family felidae and subfamily in 19th and 20th centuries several caracal specimens were described and proposed as subspecies since 2017 three subspecies are recognised as valid southern caracal c c caracal occurs in southern and east africa northern caracal c c occurs in north and west africa asiatic caracal c c schmitzi occurs in asia phylogeny results of a phylogenetic study indicates that caracal and african golden cat caracal aurata diverged between 2 93 and 1 19 million years ago these two species together with serval leptailurus serval form caracal lineage which diverged between 11 56 and 6 66 million years ago ancestor of this lineage arrived in africa between 8 5 and 5 6 million years ago relationship of caracal is considered as follows clade style font size 90 line height 75 1 clade 1 2 none font size 50 line height 50 3

recorded use of this name dates back to 1760 an alternative name for caracal is persian lynx local names in tigrinya language cheke ch ok which means bearded lion characteristics thumbnail left a close facial view of a caracal note tufted ears and black and white facial markings caracal is a slender moderately sized cat characterised by a robust build a short face long canine teeth tufted ears and long legs it reaches nearly at shoulder head and body length is typically for males and for females while males weigh females weigh tan bushy tail measures and extends to hocks caracal is sexually dimorphic females are smaller than males in most bodily parameters prominent facial features include 4 5 cm long black tufts on ears two black stripes from forehead to nose black outline of mouth distinctive black facial markings and white patches surrounding eyes and mouth eyes appear to be narrowly open due to lowered upper eyelid probably an adaptation to shield eyes from sun s glare ear tufts may start drooping as animal ages coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy though black caracals are also known underbelly and insides of legs are lighter often with small reddish markings fur soft short and dense grows coarser in summer ground hairs basal layer of hair covering coat are denser in winter than in summer length of guard hairs hair extending above ground hairs can be up to long in winter but shorten to in summer these features indicate onset of moulting in hot season typically in october and november hind legs are longer than fore legs so body appears to be sloping downward from rump caracals possess distinctive black markings on their faces and some individuals may have pronounced eyebrow markings caracal is often confused with lynx as both cats have tufted ears however a notable point of difference between two is that lynx is spotted and blotched while caracal shows no such markings on coat african golden cat has a similar build as caracal s but is darker and lacks ear tufts sympatric serval can be distinguished from caracal by former s lack of ear tufts white spots behind ears spotted coat longer legs longer tail and smaller footprints skull of caracal is high and rounded featuring large auditory bullae a well developed supraoccipital crest normal to sagittal crest and a strong lower jaw caracal has a total of 30 teeth dental formula is deciduous dentition is striking canines are up to long heavy and sharp these are used to give killing bite to prey caracal lacks second upper premolars and upper molars are diminutive large paws similar to those of cheetah consist of four digits in hind legs and five in fore legs first digit of fore leg remains above ground and features dewclaw claws sharp and retractable able to be drawn in are larger but less curved in hind legs distribution and habitat thumb caracals inhabit dry areas with some cover in africa caracal is widely distributed south of sahara but considered rare in north africa in asia it occurs from arabian peninsula middle east turkmenistan uzbekistan to western india it inhabits forests savannas marshy lowlands semideserts and scrub forests but prefers dry areas with low rainfall and availability of cover in montane habitats such as ethiopian highlands it occurs up to an altitude of in benin s pendjari national park caracals were recorded by camera traps in 2014 and 2015 in ethiopia such as in degua tembien massif they can be seen along roads sometimes as road kills in emirate of abu dhabi a male caracal was recorded by camera traps in jebel hafeet national park in al ain region abu dhabi in february 2019 first such record since 1984 in uzbekistan caracal has been recorded only in desert regions of plateau and desert between 2000 and 2017 15 individuals were sighted alive and at least 11 were killed by herders ecology and behaviour thumb right caracals are efficient climbers caracal is typically nocturnal active at night though some activity may be observed during day as well however cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that its activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed a study in south africa showed that caracals are most active when air temperature drops below activity typically ceases at higher temperatures a solitary cat caracal mainly occurs alone or in pairs only groups seen are of mothers with their offspring females in oestrus temporarily pair with males a territorial animal caracal marks rocks and vegetation in its territory with urine and probably with dung which is not covered with soil claw scratching is prominent and dung middens are typically not formed in israel males are found to have territories averaging while that of females averaged male territories vary from in saudi arabia in mountain zebra national park south africa female territories vary between these territories overlap extensively conspicuous ear tufts and facial markings often serve as a method of visual communication caracals have been observed interacting with each other by moving head from side to side so that tufts flicker rapidly like other cats caracal meows growls hisses spits and purrs diet and hunting thumb right a caracal feeding a carnivore caracal typically preys upon small mammals birds and rodents studies in south africa have reported that it preys on cape grysbok common duiker sheep goats bush vlei rats rock hyraxes hares and birds a study in western india showed that rodents comprise a significant portion of diet they will feed from a variety of sources but tend to focus on most abundant one grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites larger antelopes such as young kudu bushbuck impala mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted mammals generally comprise at least 80 of diet lizards snakes and insects are infrequently eaten they are notorious for attacking livestock but rarely attack humans its speed and agility make it an efficient hunter able to take down prey two to three times its size powerful hind legs allow it to leap more than in air to catch birds on wing it can even twist and change its direction mid air it is an adroit climber it stalks its prey until it is within following which it can launch into a sprint while large prey such as antelopes are suffocated by a throat bite smaller prey are killed by a bite on back of neck kills are consumed immediately and less commonly dragged to cover it returns to large kills if undisturbed it has been observed to begin feeding on antelope kills at hind parts it may scavenge at times though this has not been frequently observed it often has to compete with foxes wolves leopards and hyaena for prey reproduction thumb left caracal mother and kitten both sexes become sexually mature by time they are a year old production of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months however successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months breeding takes place throughout year oestrus one to three days long recurs every two weeks unless female is pregnant females in oestrus show a spike in urine marking and form temporary pairs with males mating has not been extensively studied limited number of observations suggest that copulation that lasts nearly four minutes on an average begins with male smelling areas urine marked by female which rolls on ground following this he approaches and mounts female pair separates after copulation gestation lasts about two to three months following which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born births generally peak from october to february births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvarks and porcupines kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and claws not retractable unable to be drawn inside coat resembles that of adults but abdomen is spotted eyes open by ten days but it takes longer for vision to become normal ears become erect and claws become retractable by third or fourth week around same time kittens start roaming their birthplace and start playing among themselves by fifth or sixth week they begin taking solid food around same time they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill as kittens start moving about by themselves mother starts shifting them everyday all milk teeth appear in 50 days and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months though a few females stay back with their mothers average lifespan of caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years in 1990s a captive caracal spontaneously mated with a domestic cat in moscow zoo resulting in a felid hybrid offspring threats caracal is listed as least concern on iucn red list since 2002 as it is widely distributed in over 50 range countries where threats to caracal populations vary in extent habitat loss due to agricultural expansion building of roads and settlements is a major threat in all range countries it is thought to be close to extinction in north africa critically endangered in pakistan endangered in jordan but stable in central and southern africa local people kill caracal to protect livestock or in retaliation for its preying on small livestock additionally it is threatened by hunting for pet trade on arabian peninsula in turkey and iran caracals are frequently killed in road accidents in uzbekistan major threat to caracal is killing by herders in retaliation for livestock losses guarding techniques and sheds are inadequate to protect small livestock like goats and sheep from being attacked by predators additionally heavy traffic roads crossing through caracal habitat pose a potential threat conservation thumb right a caracal in san diego zoo african caracal populations are listed under cites appendix ii while asian populations come under cites appendix i hunting of caracal is prohibited in afghanistan algeria egypt india iran israel jordan kazakhstan lebanon morocco pakistan syria tajikistan tunisia turkey turkmenistan and uzbekistan in namibia and south africa it is considered a problem animal and its hunting is allowed for protecting livestock caracals occur in a number of protected areas across their range central asian caracal population is listed as critically endangered in uzbekistan since 2009 and in kazakhstan since 2010 in culture chinese emperors used caracals as gifts in 13th and 14th centuries yuan dynasty rulers bought numerous caracals cheetahs and tigers from muslim merchants in western parts of empire in return for gold silver cash and silk according to ming shilu subsequent ming dynasty continued this practice until as recently as 20th century caracal was used in hunts by indian rulers to hunt small game while cheetah was used for larger game in those times caracals were exposed to a flock of pigeons and people would bet on which caracal would kill largest number of pigeons this probably gave rise to expression to put cat among pigeons caracal appears to have been religiously significant in egyptian culture as it occurs in paintings and as bronze figurines sculptures were believed to guard tombs of pharaohs embalmed caracals have also been discovered its pelt was used for making fur coats references external links cats for africa caracal distribution category caracal
