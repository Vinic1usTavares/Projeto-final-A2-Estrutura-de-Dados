of their human depravity original sin and their consequent need for redemption parts ii and iii emphasize more worldly lessons such as etiquette and virtuous consumerism cutt 76 during nineteenth century fairchild family was renowned for its realistic portrayal of childhood and its humor but sherwood s book fell from favor as britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children s literature came to dominate literary scene represented by works such as lewis carroll s alice s adventures in wonderland in twentieth century books have most often been viewed as quintessential examples of didactic style of children s writing popular before alice dawson 270 harper 2 3 publication history sherwood published first part of fairchild family in 1818 with firm of john hatchard in piccadilly thereby assuring it social distinction hatchard was associated with clapham sect of evangelicals which included hannah more and his customers were wealthy businessmen gentry and members of

1847 respectively structure of text alt a woman a man and a child sit outside on a wall under trees with water in background left thumb frontispiece to an 1853 edition of fairchild family fairchild family part i tells story of a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by fairchild parents to their three children emily lucy and henry regarding not only proper orientation of their souls towards heaven but also proper earthly morality envy greed lying disobedience and fighting for example are immoral text incorporates a series of tract like stories into an overarching narrative in order to illustrate these moral lessons stories of deaths of two neighborhood children charles trueman and miss augusta noble for instance help fairchild children to understand how and why they need to prepare their own hearts for salvation faithful and true charles has a transcendent deathbed experience much like charles dickens s little nell in old curiosity

overarching narrative of fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales both are noticeably less evangelical than part i part ii begins with recognition by fairchild parents that their children have a new and divine nature which works against your evil natures causing you to know when you have done wrong and making you truly and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin sherwood history of fairchild family part ii 9 10 emily lucy and henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls parts ii and iii focus to a greater extent on good breeding virtuous consumption and one s duty to poor than does part i one of most important lessons that children learn for instance is respect for their elders moreover gibbet to which children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in part i has disappeared in part ii henry and his father walk by spot where it used to stand and note its absence in all three books thematically relevant prayers and hymns by likes of philip doddridge isaac watts charles wesley william cowper and ann and jane taylor follow each chapter cutt 77 themes evangelicalism theme that dominates fairchild family part i is evangelical need to recognize one s innate depravity and prepare oneself for eternity cutt 38 39 demers mrs sherwood and hesba stretton 133 in this volume most important lessons in life are faith resignation and implicit obedience to will of god cutt 38 39 sherwood articulates this theology in very first pages of book mr and mrs fairchild loved and feared god and had done so by mercy of god ever since their younger days they knew that their hearts were very bad and that they could not be saved by any good thing they could do on contrary that they were by nature fitted only for everlasting punishment but they believed in lord jesus christ and loved him for having died for them and they knew he would save them because he saves all those who trust in him sherwood history of fairchild family 2 3 book encourages its readers to adopt these beliefs not only through its stories but also through its prayers hear therefore my prayer o lord and send thy holy spirit to shew unto me wickedness of my own heart that i may hate myself and know that had i my deserts i should now be living with devil in hell sic sherwood fairchild family 19 but unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes such as john bunyan s pilgrim s progress 1678 sherwood domesticated her story all of actions in children s day to day lives are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation cutt 66 emily for example succumbs to temptation to eat some forbidden plums no eye was looking at her but eye of god who sees every thing we do and knows even secret thoughts of heart but emily just at that moment did not think of god sherwood fairchild family 115 as sherwood scholar m nancy cutt argues great overriding metaphor of all sherwood s work is representation of divine order by harmonious family relationship inevitably set in its own pastoral eden no writer made it clearer to her readers that child who is dutiful within his family is blessed in sight of god or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to very throne of god cutt 41 see also vallone 85 and harper 4 this is made clear in fairchild parents description of their own authority whilst you are a little child you must tell your sins to me and i will shew sic you way by which only you may hope to overcome them when you are bigger and i and your papa are removed from you then you must tell all your sins to god sherwood fairchild family 48 children s literature scholar patricia demers has referred to this connection between family and divine as romantic element in sherwood s writing arguing that her characters zeal in finding and defining an earthly home prompts their almost automatic longing for a heavenly home sherwood s is a consciously double vision eternal in natural sublime in quotidian demers mrs sherwood and hesba stretton 131 all three parts of fairchild family taught lessons of personal endurance reliance on providence and acceptance of one s earthly status peterson 416 7 emphasizing individual experience and one s personal relationship with god they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to larger economic and political forces this is particularly true for poor characters in texts such as in first volume and beggar children jane and edward in second volume victorianism parts ii and iii reflect sherwood s changing values as well as those of victorian period significantly servants in part i who are almost part of family are pushed aside in part iii by their gossiping flattering counterparts in fine manor house second two volumes also outline narrower roles for each sex dawson 277 in part i lucy and emily learn to sew and keep house while henry tends garden and learns latin but in part ii henry s scrapes involve letting loose a bull while girls focus intently on how to make purchases in an economical yet fair fashion most extensive thematic change in series however was disappearance of its strident evangelicalism whereas all of lessons in part i highlight children s human depravity and encourage reader to think in terms of afterlife in parts ii and iii other victorian values such as respectability and filial obedience are brought to fore children s literature scholar janis dawson describes difference in terms of parental indulgence in parts ii and iii fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in part i reception and legacy alt a drawing of a woman watching three children

fairchild family continued to be a bestseller despite increasingly popular image of childhood innocence and sentimental picture of childhood presented in novels such as charles dickens s oliver twist 1837 39 one scholar has suggested that it influenced dickens s depictions of pip s fears of convict gibbet and horrible young man at close of chapter 1 in great expectations 1860 61 chaney lois e pip and fairchild family dickensian 79 3 1983 162 3 children s literature scholar gillian avery has argued that fairchild family was as much a part of english childhood as alice was later to become qtd in harper 3 as late as 1900s lord frederic hamilton states that he attended a party at which each guest dressed up as a character from book harper 3 although book was popular some scraps of evidence have survived suggesting that readers did not always interpret it as sherwood would have wanted lord hamilton writes for instance that there was plenty about eating and drinking one could always skip prayers and there were three or four very brightly written accounts of funerals in it qtd in cutt 67 when series was republished later in century books were severely edited often mr fairchild s sermons were removed from part i and phrase human depravity was replaced with word naughtiness many of changes also served to further emphasize authority of parents as religious framework was weakened or removed parent became ultimate authority and victorian cult of family was reinforced in a way that mrs sherwood had never intended cutt 80 although fairchild family has gained a reputation in twentieth century as an oppressively didactic book in early nineteenth century it was viewed as delightfully realistic cutt 67 it was often described as humorous and charlotte yonge 1823 1901 a critic who also wrote children s literature praised gusto with which sherwood dwells on new dolls and absolutely sensational naughtiness of children qtd in dawson 277 see also rosman 114 5 although twentieth century critics have tended to view tale as harsh john rowe townsend described it as unspeakably cruel often pointing to visit to gibbet cutt and others argue that positive depiction of nuclear family in text particularly sherwood s emphasis on parents responsibility to educate their own children was an important part of book s appeal cutt 68 see also harper 5 she argues that sherwood s influence via books such as fairchild family upon domestic pattern of victorian life can hardly be overestimated cutt 41 george orwell had a very negative view this evil book is now issued in pretty pretty expurgated editions but it is well worth reading in original version it gives one some idea of lengths to which child discipline was sometimes carried mr fairchild for instance when he catches his children quarrelling first thrashes them reciting dr watts s let dogs delight to bark and bite between blows of cane and then takes them to spend afternoon beneath a gibbet where rotting corpse of a
