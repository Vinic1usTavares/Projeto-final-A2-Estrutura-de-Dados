haroutune krikor daghlian jr may 4 1921 september 15 1945 was an american physicist with manhattan project which designed and produced atomic bombs that were used in world war ii he accidentally irradiated himself on august 21 1945 during a critical mass experiment at remote omega site of los alamos laboratory in new mexico resulting in his death 25 days later thumb herbert lehr left and haroutune krikor harry daghlian jr right loading assembled tamper plug containing plutonium pit and initiator into a sedan for transport from mcdonald ranch house to shot tower on 13 july 1945 alt daghlian was irradiated as a result of a criticality accident that occurred when he accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a 6 2 kg plutonium gallium alloy bomb core this core subsequently nicknamed demon core was later involved in death of another physicist louis slotin early life haroutune krikor daghlian jr of armenian american descent was born in waterbury connecticut on may 4 1921 one of three children of margaret rose born as currie and haroutune krikor daghlian he had a sister helen and a brother edward soon after his birth family moved across state to coastal town of new london connecticut he was educated at harbor elementary school where he played violin in school orchestra and at bulkeley high school in 1938 at age of 17 he entered massachusetts institute of technology intending to study mathematics but became interested in physics particularly particle physics then emerging as an exciting new field this interest led him to transfer to west lafayette indiana campus of purdue university where he graduated with a bachelor of science degree in 1942 he then commenced work on his doctorate assisting marshall holloway with cyclotrons in 1944 while still a graduate student he joined otto frisch s critical assembly group at los alamos laboratory of manhattan project left thumb two physicists louis slotin with sun glasses harry daghlian jr seated middle

experiment during an experiment on august 21 1945 daghlian was attempting to build a neutron reflector manually by stacking a set of tungsten carbide bricks in an incremental fashion around a plutonium core purpose of neutron reflector was to reduce mass required for plutonium core to attain criticality he was moving final brick over assembly but neutron counters alerted daghlian to fact that addition of that brick would render system supercritical as he withdrew his hand he inadvertently dropped brick onto center of assembly since assembly was nearly in critical state accidental addition of that brick caused reaction to go immediately into prompt critical region of neutronic behavior this resulted in a criticality accident daghlian reacted immediately after dropping brick and attempted to knock brick off assembly without success he was forced to disassemble part of tungsten carbide pile in order to halt reaction daghlian was estimated to have received a dose of 510 rem 5 1 sv of neutron radiation from a yield of 1016 fissions despite intensive medical care he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning and his mother and sister were flown out to care for him his father had died in 1943 he fell into a coma and died 25 days after accident he was first known fatality caused by a criticality accident his body was returned to new london where he was buried at cedar grove cemetery thumb harry k daghlian s blistered and burnt hand taken on 30 august 1945 after he received his fatal radiation dose he died 16 days after this photo was taken alt 262x262px legacy as a result of incident safety regulations for project were scrutinized and revised a special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures this change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments additionally discussions and designs for remote controlled test devices were initiated eventually leading to creation of godiva device these changes did not prevent another criticality accident from happening at los alamos following year louis slotin a colleague of daghlian s was killed in 1946 while performing criticality tests on same plutonium core after these two incidents it became known as demon core and all similar criticality experiments were halted until remote controlled assembly devices were more fully developed and available daghlian was memorialized on may 20 2000 by city of new london with erection of a memorial stone and flagpole in calkins park which was unveiled by his brother and sister it read though not in uniform he died in service to his country references external links category 1921 births category 1945 deaths category accidental deaths in new
