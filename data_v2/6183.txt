including humans elves dwarves mermaids dragons and robots most non human races have only one town in game although individuals are sometimes found in human towns or other areas as well four hundred years prior to start of game lefeinish people who used power of wind to craft airships and a giant space station called floating castle in game watched their country decline as wind crystal went dark two hundred years later violent storms sank a massive shrine that served as center of an ocean based civilization and water crystal went dark earth crystal and fire crystal followed plaguing earth with raging wildfires and devastating agricultural town of melmond as plains and vegetation decayed some time later sage tells of a prophecy that four light warriors will come to save world in a time of darkness story game begins with appearance of four youthful light warriors heroes of story who each carry one of darkened orbs initially light warriors have access to kingdom of coneria and ruined temple of fiends after warriors rescue princess sara from evil knight garland king of coneria builds a bridge that enables light warriors passage east to town of there light warriors liberate town

time loop by which he could live forever light warriors defeat chaos thus ending paradox and return home by ending paradox however light warriors have changed future to one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend development thumb left hironobu sakaguchi thought that final fantasy would be his final game alt a man sitting in a chair and speaking into a microphone creation hironobu sakaguchi had intended to make a role playing game rpg for a long time but his employer square refused to give him permission as it expected low sales of such a product however when rpg dragon quest was released and proved to be a hit in japan company reconsidered its stance on genre and approved sakaguchi s vision of an rpg inspired by ultima and wizardry only three of his colleagues volunteered to join this project headed by him because he was thought of as a rough boss in spite of his unsuccessful creations eventually final fantasy was developed by a team of seven core staff members within square referred to as a team sakaguchi convinced fellow game designers koichi ishii and akitoshi kawazu to join project kawazu was mainly responsible for battle system and sequences which he based heavily on tabletop game dungeons dragons and rpg wizardry for example enemies weaknesses to elements such as fire and ice had not been included in japanese rpgs up until that point kawazu had grown fond of such aspects of western rpgs and decided to incorporate them into final fantasy he also advocated player s option to freely choose their own party member classes at beginning of game as he feels fun in an rpg begins when you create a character scenario was written by freelance writer kenji terada based on a story by sakaguchi ishii heavily influenced game s setting with his idea of crystals he also suggested illustrator yoshitaka amano as character designer but sakaguchi declined at first as he had never heard artist s name before when sakaguchi showed ishii some drawings on magazine clippings and told him that this was art style he was looking for ishii revealed to him that these were actually created by amano hence leading to his involvement in game music for final fantasy was composed by nobuo uematsu and marked his 16th video game music composition iranian american programmer nasir gebelli was hired to code game he initially tried to understand all aspects of gameplay but was soon advised by sakaguchi to just program design concepts so he did not have to explain everything to gebelli in detail gebelli was also responsible for creating what is considered to be first rpg minigame a sliding puzzle which he added into game despite it not being part of original game design among other developers were graphic designer kazuko shibuya programmers kiyoshi yoshii and ken narita as well as debugger hiroyuki ito when project started to show promise designer hiromichi tanaka and his b team joined to aid development lack of faith in sakaguchi s team as well as its unpopularity within company motivated staff members to give their best release sakaguchi took an in development rom of game to japanese magazine famicom tsushin but it would not review it however famitsu gave game extensive coverage initially only 200 000 copies were to be shipped but sakaguchi pleaded with company to make 400 000 to help spawn a sequel and management agreed then original nes version successfully shipped 520 000 copies in japan following successful north american localization of dragon quest nintendo of america translated final fantasy into english and published it in north america in 1990 north american version of final fantasy met with modest success partly due to nintendo s then aggressive marketing tactics no version of game was marketed in pal region until final fantasy origins in 2003 title over years several theories emerged as to why game was called final fantasy in 2015 sakaguchi stated that from beginning team had wished for a name that could be shortened to that way game s title could be abbreviated in latin script and pronounced in four syllables in japanese language original working title for sakaguchi s rpg concept was fighting fantasy but it was changed to avoid issues with a tabletop game of same name that had already been released reason for choosing word final to form eventual title of final fantasy was explained as twofold by uematsu for one thing it stemmed from sakaguchi s personal situation as he would have quit game industry and gone back to university had game not sold well and for another square was under threat of bankruptcy at time which meant game could have been company s last although sakaguchi confirmed some of theories he later downplayed rationale for choosing word final saying that it was definitely a back to wall type situation back then but any word that starts with an f would have been fine versions and re releases final fantasy has been remade several times for different platforms and has frequently been packaged with final fantasy ii in various collections while all of these remakes retain same basic story and battle mechanics various changes have been made

character classes final fantasy was one of most influential early console role playing games and played a major role in legitimizing and popularizing genre according to ign s matt casamassina final fantasys storyline had a deeper and more engaging story than original dragon quest known as dragon warrior in north america modern critics have pointed out that game is poorly paced by contemporary standards and involves much more time wandering in search of random battle encounters to raise their experience levels and money than it does exploring and solving puzzles other reviewers find level building and exploration portions of game as most amusing ones in 1987 famitsu initially described original final fantasy as one of many that imitated dragon quest formula game is considered by some to be weakest and most difficult installment of series subsequent versions of final fantasy have garnered mostly favorable reviews from media peer schneider of ign enjoyed wonderswan color version
