dimetrodon or dimetrodon dictionary com dictionary com unabridged random house inc http www dictionary com browse dimetrodon accessed february 12 2018 meaning two measures of teeth is an extinct genus of synapsids that lived during cisuralian early permian around 295 272 million years ago ma it is a member of family sphenacodontidae most prominent feature of dimetrodon is large neural spine sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending from vertebrae it walked on four legs and had a tall curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along jaws most fossils have been found in southwestern united states majority coming from a geological deposit called red beds of texas and oklahoma more recently fossils have been found in germany over a dozen species have been named since genus was first described in 1878 dimetrodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or as a contemporary of dinosaurs in popular culture but it became extinct some 40 million years before first appearance of dinosaurs reptile like in appearance and physiology dimetrodon is nevertheless more closely related to mammals than to modern reptiles though it is not a direct ancestor of mammals dimetrodon is assigned to non mammalian synapsids a group traditionally called mammal like reptiles this groups dimetrodon together with mammals in a clade evolutionary group called synapsida while placing dinosaurs reptiles and birds in a separate clade sauropsida single openings in skull behind each eye known as temporal fenestrae and other skull features distinguish dimetrodon and mammals from most of earliest sauropsids dimetrodon was probably one of apex predators of cisuralian ecosystems feeding on fish and tetrapods including reptiles and amphibians smaller dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles sail of dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation some recent studies argue that sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from body due to large species being discovered with small sails and small species being discovered with large sails essentially ruling out heat regulation as its main purpose sail was most likely used in courtship display with methods such as threatening rivals or showing off to potential mates description thumb restoration of d giganhomogenes with exposed neural spine tips dimetrodon was a quadrupedal sail backed synapsid most dimetrodon species ranged in length from and are estimated to have weighed between largest known species of dimetrodon is d angelensis at and smallest is d teutonis at larger species of dimetrodon were among largest predators of early permian although closely related known from skeletal fragments in slightly younger rocks may have been even larger at an estimated in total body length although some dimetrodon species could grow very large many juvenile specimens are known skull 300px 300px a single large opening on either side of back of skull links dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of earliest sauropsids which either lack openings or have two openings features such as ridges on inside of nasal cavity and a ridge at back of lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early four limbed land dwelling vertebrates to mammals skull of dimetrodon is tall and compressed laterally or side to side eye sockets are positioned high and far back in skull behind each eye socket is a single hole called an infratemporal fenestra an additional hole in skull supratemporal fenestra can be seen when viewed from above back of skull occiput is oriented at a slight upward angle a feature that it shares with all other early synapsids upper margin of skull slopes downward in a convex arc to tip of snout tip of upper jaw formed by premaxilla bone is raised above part of jaw formed by maxilla bone to form a maxillary step within this step is a diastema or gap in tooth row its skull was more heavily built than a dinosaur s teeth size of teeth varies greatly along length of jaws lending dimetrodon its name which means two measures of tooth in reference to sets of small and large teeth one or two pairs of caniniforms large pointed canine like teeth extend from maxilla large incisor teeth are also present at tips of upper and lower jaws rooted in premaxillae and dentary bones small teeth are present around maxillary step and behind caniniforms becoming smaller further back in jaw thumb left a skull of d grandis many teeth are widest at their and narrow closer to jaws giving them appearance of a teardrop teardrop shaped teeth are unique to dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids and help distinguish them from other early synapsids as in many other early synapsids teeth of most dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges serrations of dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks abler w l 2001 a kerf and drill model of tyrannosaur tooth serrations p 84 89 in mesozoic vertebrate life ed s tanke d h carpenter k skrepnick m w indiana university press dinosaur albertosaurus had similarly crack like serrations but at base of each serration was a round void which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent stresses of feeding from causing crack to spread through tooth unlike albertosaurus dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations teeth of d teutonis lack serrations but still have sharp edges a 2014 study shows that dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey smaller species d milleri had no serrations since it ate small prey as prey grew larger several dimetrodon species started developing serrations on their teeth and increasing in size for instance d limbatus had enamel serrations that helped it cut through flesh which were similar to serrations that can be found on secodontosaurus second largest species d grandis has denticle serrations similar to those of sharks and theropod dinosaurs making its teeth even more specialized for slicing through flesh this study demonstrates that as dimetrodons prey grew larger various species responded by evolving into larger sizes and developing ever sharper teeth nasal cavity on inner surface of nasal section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals which may have supported cartilage that increased area of olfactory epithelium layer of tissue that detects odors these ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from late permian and triassic whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air thus nasal cavity of dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals jaw joint and ear another transitional feature of dimetrodon is a ridge in back of jaw called reflected lamina reflected lamina is found on articular bone which connects to quadrate bone of skull to form jaw joint in later mammal ancestors articular and quadrate separated from jaw joint while articular developed into malleus bone of middle ear reflected lamina became part of a ring called tympanic annulus that supports ear drum in all living mammals tail thumb an outdated restoration of dimetrodon from 1908 showing a short tail made before discovery of skeletons with complete tails tail of dimetrodon makes up a large portion of its total body length and includes around 50 caudal vertebrae tails were missing or incomplete in first described skeletons of dimetrodon only caudal vertebrae known were eleven closest to hip since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from hip many paleontologists in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries thought that dimetrodon had a very short tail it was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of dimetrodon was described sail thumb left two d grandis skeletons royal tyrrell museum sail of dimetrodon is formed by elongated neural spines projecting from vertebrae each spine varies in cross sectional shape from its base to its tip in what is known as differentiation near vertebra body spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape and closer to tip it takes on a figure eight shape as a groove runs along either side of spine figure eight shape is thought to reinforce spine preventing bending and fractures a cross section of spine of one specimen of dimetrodon giganhomogenes is rectangular in shape but preserves figure eight shaped rings close to its center indicating that shape of spines may change as individuals age microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip indicating where it was embedded in muscles of back and where it was exposed as part of a sail lower or proximal portion of spine has a rough surface that would have served as an anchoring point for epaxial muscles of back and also has a network of connective tissues called sharpey s fibers that indicate it was embedded within body higher up on distal outer portion of spine bone surface is smoother periosteum a layer of tissue surrounding bone is covered in small grooves that presumably supported blood vessels that vascularized sail large groove that runs length of spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels but since bone does not contain vascular canals sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought some specimens of dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of neural spines that appear to be healed over fractures cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on sail to supply site with blood vessels layered lamellar bone makes up most of neural spine s cross sectional area and contains lines of arrested growth that can be used to determine age of each individual at death in many specimens of d distal portions of spines bend sharply indicating that sail would have had an irregular profile in life their suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all way to tips of spines meaning that sail s webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined skin no fossil evidence of dimetrodons skin has yet been found impressions of skin of a related animal indicate that it would have been smooth and well provided with glands however this form of skin may not have applied to dimetrodon as its lineage is fairly distant dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on underside of its tail and belly as other synapsids did recent evidence from suggests that some early synapsids had squamate like scales thumb dimetrodon grandis in an upright posture based on tracks with scaleless skin and scutes on its underside classification history first descriptions by cope fossils now attributed to dimetrodon were first studied by american paleontologist edward drinker cope in 1870s cope had obtained fossils along with those of many other permian tetrapods from several collectors who had been exploring a group of rocks in texas called red beds among these collectors were swiss naturalist jacob boll texas geologist w f cummins and amateur paleontologist charles hazelius sternberg most of cope s specimens went to american museum of natural history or to university of chicago s walker museum most of walker fossil collection is now housed in field museum of natural history sternberg sent some of his own specimens to german paleontologist ferdinand broili at munich university although broili was not as prolific as cope when it came to describing specimens cope s rival othniel charles marsh also collected some bones of dimetrodon which he sent to walker museum first use of name dimetrodon came in 1878 when cope named species dimetrodon incisivus dimetrodon rectiformis and dimetrodon gigas in scientific journal proceedings of american philosophical society however first description of a dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier when cope named species clepsydrops limbatus from texas red beds name clepsydrops was first coined by cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from vermilion county illinois and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from texas many new species of sphenacodontids from texas were assigned to either clepsydrops or dimetrodon in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries c limbatus was reclassified as a species of dimetrodon in 1940 meaning that cope s 1877 paper was first record of dimetrodon cope was first to describe a sail backed synapsid with naming of clepsydrops natalis in his 1878 paper although he called sail a fin and compared it to crests of modern basilisk lizard basilicus sails were not preserved in specimens of d incisivus and d gigas that cope described in his 1878 paper but elongated spines were present in d rectiformis specimen he described cope commented on purpose of sail in 1886 writing utility is difficult to imagine unless animal had aquatic habits and swam on its back crest or fin must have been in way of active movements limbs are not long enough nor claws acute enough to demonstrate arboreal habits as in existing genus basilicus where a similar crest exists early 20th century descriptions thumb restoration of dimetrodon and edaphosaurus background charles r knight 1897 in first few decades of twentieth century american paleontologist e c case authored many studies on dimetrodon and described several new species he received funding from carnegie institution for his study of many dimetrodon specimens in collections of american museum of natural history and several other museums many of these fossils had been collected by cope but had not been thoroughly described as cope was known for erecting new species on basis of only a few bone fragments beginning in late 1920s paleontologist alfred romer restudied many dimetrodon specimens and named several new species in 1940 romer coauthored a large study with llewellyn ivor price called review of in which species of dimetrodon named by cope and case were reassessed most of species names considered valid by romer and price are still used today new specimens in decades following romer and price s monograph many dimetrodon specimens were described from localities outside texas and oklahoma first was described from four corners region of utah in 1966 and another was described from arizona in 1969 in 1975 olson reported dimetrodon material from ohio a new species of dimetrodon called d occidentalis meaning western dimetrodon was named in 1977 from new mexico specimens found in utah and arizona probably also belong to d occidentalis before these discoveries a theory existed that a midcontinental seaway separated what is now texas and oklahoma from more western lands during early permian isolating dimetrodon to a small region of north america while a smaller sphenacodontid called sphenacodon dominated western area while this seaway probably did exist discovery of fossils outside texas and oklahoma show that its extent was limited and that it was not an effective barrier to distribution of dimetrodon in 2001 a new species of dimetrodon called d teutonis was described from lower permian bromacker locality at thuringian forest of germany extending

price reassigned c limbatus to genus dimetrodon making d limbatus type species of dimetrodon dimetrodon incisivus first use of name dimetrodon came in 1878 when cope named species dimetrodon incisivus along with dimetrodon rectiformis and dimetrodon gigas dimetrodon rectiformis dimetrodon rectiformis was named alongside dimetrodon incisivus in cope s 1878 paper and was only one of three named species to preserve elongated neural spines in 1907 paleontologist e c case moved d rectiformis into species d incisivus d incisivus was later synonymous with type species dimetrodon limbatus making d rectiformis a synonym of d limbatus dimetrodon semiradicatus described in 1881 on basis of upper jaw bones dimetrodon semiradicatus was last species named by cope in 1907 e c case synonymized d semiradicatus with d incisivus based on similarities in shape of teeth and skull bones d incisivus and d semiradicatus are now considered synonyms of d limbatus dimetrodon dollovianus was first described by edward drinker cope in 1888 as embolophorus dollovianus in 1903 e c case published a lengthy description of e dollovianus which he later referred to dimetrodon dimetrodon grandis thumb restoration of dimetrodon grandis paleontologist e c case named a new species of sail backed synapsid theropleura grandis in 1907 in 1940 alfred romer and llewellyn ivor price reassigned theropleura grandis to dimetrodon erecting species d grandis dimetrodon gigas in his 1878 paper on fossils from texas cope named clepsydrops gigas along with first named species of dimetrodon d limbatus d incisivus and d rectiformis case reclassified c gigas as a new species of dimetrodon in 1907 case also described a very well preserved skull of dimetrodon in 1904 attributing it to species dimetrodon gigas in 1919 charles w gilmore attributed a nearly complete specimen of dimetrodon to d gigas dimetrodon gigas is now recognized as a synonym of d grandis dimetrodon giganhomogenes thumb restoration of dimetrodon giganhomogenes was named by e c case in 1907 and is still considered a valid species of dimetrodon dimetrodon macrospondylus was first described by cope in 1884 as clepsydrops macrospondylus in 1907 case reclassified it as dimetrodon macrospondylus dimetrodon platycentrus was first described by case in his 1907 monograph it is now considered a synonym of dimetrodon macrospondylus dimetrodon natalis thumb restoration of dimetrodon natalis paleontologist alfred romer erected species dimetrodon natalis in 1936 previously described as clepsydrops natalis d natalis was smallest known species of dimetrodon at that time and was found alongside remains of larger bodied d limbatus dimetrodon booneorum was first described by alfred romer in 1937 on basis of remains from texas dimetrodon kempae was named by romer in 1937 in same paper as d booneorum d loomisi and d milleri dimetrodon kempae was named on basis of a single humerus and a few vertebrae and may therefore be a nomen dubium that cannot be distinguished as a unique species of dimetrodon in 1940 romer and price raised possibility that d kempae may not fall within genus dimetrodon preferring to classify it as sphenacodontidae incertae sedis dimetrodon loomisi thumb restoration of dimetrodon loomisi was first described by alfred romer in 1937 along with d booneorum d kempae and d milleri remains have been found in texas and oklahoma dimetrodon milleri thumb restoration of dimetrodon milleri was described by romer in 1937 it is one of smallest species of dimetrodon in north america and may be closely related to d occidentalis another small bodied species d milleri is known from two skeletons one nearly complete mcz 1365 and another less complete but larger mcz 1367 d milleri is oldest known species of dimetrodon besides its small size d milleri differs from other species of dimetrodon in that its neural spines are circular rather than figure eight shaped in cross section its vertebrae are also shorter in height relative to rest of skeleton than those of other dimetrodon species skull is tall and snout is short relative to temporal region a short vertebrae and tall skull are also seen in species d booneorum d limbatus and d grandis suggesting that d milleri may be first of an evolutionary progression between these species dimetrodon angelensis thumb restoration of dimetrodon angelensis was named by paleontologist everett c olson in 1962 specimens of species were reported from san angelo formation of texas it is also largest species of dimetrodon dimetrodon occidentalis was named in 1977 from new mexico its name means western dimetrodon because it is only north american species of dimetrodon known west of texas and oklahoma it was named on basis of a single skeleton belonging to a relatively small individual small size of d occidentalis is similar to that of d milleri suggesting a close relationship dimetrodon specimens found in utah and arizona probably also belong to d occidentalis dimetrodon teutonis was named in 2001 from saar nahe basin of germany and was first species of dimetrodon to be described outside north america it is also smallest species of dimetrodon species assigned to different genera dimetrodon cruciger in 1878 cope published a paper called reptilia in which he described dimetrodon cruciger d cruciger was distinguished by small projections that extended from either side of each neural spine like branches of a tree in 1886 cope moved d cruciger to genus naosaurus because he considered its spines so different from those of other dimetrodon species that species deserved its own genus naosaurus would later be synonymized with edaphosaurus a genus which cope named in 1882 on basis of skulls that evidently belonged to herbivorous animals given their blunt crushing teeth dimetrodon longiramus e c case named species dimetrodon longiramus in 1907 on basis of a scapula and elongated mandible from belle plains formation of texas in 1940 romer and price recognized that d longiramus material belonged to same taxon as another specimen described by paleontologist samuel wendell williston in 1916 which included a similarly elongated mandible and a long maxilla williston did not consider his specimen to belong to dimetrodon but instead classified it as an romer and price assigned case and williston s specimens to a newly erected genus and species secodontosaurus longiramus that was closely related to dimetrodon phylogenetic classification dimetrodon is an early member of a group called synapsids which include mammals and many of their extinct relatives though it is not an ancestor of any mammal which appeared millions of years mammals appear it is often mistaken for a dinosaur in popular culture despite having become extinct some 40 million years ma before first appearance of dinosaurs in triassic period as a synapsid dimetrodon is more closely related to mammals than to dinosaurs or any living reptile by early 1900s most paleontologists called dimetrodon a reptile in accordance with linnean taxonomy which ranked reptilia as a class and dimetrodon as a genus within that class mammals were assigned to a separate class and dimetrodon was described as a mammal like reptile paleontologists theorized that mammals evolved from this group in what they called a reptile to mammal transition phylogenetic taxonomy of synapsida thumb left d grandis skeleton north american museum of ancient life under phylogenetic systematics descendants of last common ancestor of dimetrodon and all living reptiles would include all mammals because dimetrodon is more closely related to mammals than to any living reptile thus if it is desired to avoid clade that contains both mammals and living reptiles then dimetrodon must not be included in that clade nor any other mammal like reptile descendants of last common ancestor of mammals and reptiles which appeared around 310 ma in late carboniferous are therefore split into two clades synapsida which includes dimetrodon and mammals and sauropsida which includes living reptiles and all extinct reptiles more closely related to them than to mammals within clade synapsida dimetrodon is part of clade sphenacodontia which was first proposed as an early synapsid group in 1940 by paleontologists alfred romer and llewellyn ivor price along with groups ophiacodontia and all three groups are known from late carboniferous and early permian romer and price distinguished them primarily by postcranial features such as shapes of limbs and vertebrae ophiacodontia was considered most primitive group because its members appeared most reptilian and sphenacodontia was most advanced because its members appeared most like a group called therapsida which included closest relatives to mammals romer and price placed another group of early synapsids called varanopids within sphenacodontia considering them to be more primitive than other sphenacodonts like dimetrodon they thought varanopids and dimetrodon like sphenacodonts were closely related because both groups were carnivorous although varanopids are much smaller and more lizard like lacking sails modern view of synapsid relationships was proposed by paleontologist robert r reisz in 1986 whose study included features mostly found in skull rather than in postcranial skeleton dimetrodon is still considered a sphenacodont under this phylogeny but are now considered more basal synapsids falling outside clade sphenacodontia within sphenacodontia is group which in turn contains sphenacodontidae and therapsida sphenacodontidae is group containing dimetrodon and several other sail backed synapsids like sphenacodon and secodontosaurus while therapsida includes mammals and their mostly permian and triassic relatives below is cladogram clade synapsida which follows this phylogeny of synapsida as modified from analysis of benson 2012 thumb restoration of various dimetrodon species to scale below cladogram shows relationships of a few dimetrodon species from brink et al 2015 paleobiology function of neural spines thumb d grandis warming up at sunrise paleontologists have proposed many ways in which sail could have functioned in life some of first to think about its purpose suggested that sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while dimetrodon waited for prey or as an actual boat like sail to catch wind while animal was in water another is that long neural spines could have stabilized trunk by restricting up and down movement which would allow for a more efficient side to side movement while walking thermoregulation in 1940 alfred romer and llewellyn ivor price proposed that sail served a thermoregulatory function allowing individuals to warm their bodies with sun s heat in following years many models were created to estimate effectiveness of thermoregulation in dimetrodon for example in a 1973 article in journal nature paleontologists c d bramwell and p b fellgett estimated that it took a individual about one and a half hours for its body temperature to rise from in 1986 steven c haack concluded that warming was slower than previously thought and that process probably took four hours using a model based on a variety of environmental factors and hypothesized physiological aspects of dimetrodon haack found that sail allowed dimetrodon to warm faster in morning and reach a slightly higher body temperature during day but that it was ineffective in releasing excess heat and did not allow dimetrodon to retain a higher body temperature at night in 1999 a group of mechanical engineers created a computer model to analyze ability of sail to regulate body temperature during different seasons and concluded that sail was beneficial for capturing and releasing heat at all times in year thumb left comparatively small d milleri most of these studies give two thermoregulatory roles for sail of dimetrodon one as a means of warming quickly in morning and another as a way to cool down when body temperature becomes high dimetrodon and all other early permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold blooded or poikilothermic relying on sun to maintain a high body temperature because of its large size dimetrodon had high thermal inertia meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller bodied animals as temperatures rose in mornings small bodied prey of dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something size of dimetrodon many paleontologists including haack have proposed that sail of dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in morning in order to keep pace with its prey sail s large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into surroundings useful if animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from sun dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to sail to maintain heat at night in 1986 j scott turner and c richard tracy proposed that evolution of a sail in dimetrodon was related to evolution of warm bloodedness in mammal ancestors they thought that sail of dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic maintaining a constant albeit low body temperature mammals are also homeothermic although they differ from dimetrodon in being endothermic controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism turner and tracy noted that early therapsids a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals had long limbs which can release heat in a manner similar to that of sail of dimetrodon homeothermy that developed in animals like dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape which would eventually develop into warm bloodedness of mammals thumb sphenacodon had a low crest along its back recent studies on sail of dimetrodon and other sphenacodontids support haack s 1986 contention that sail was poorly adapted to releasing heat and maintaining a stable body temperature presence of sails in small bodied species of dimetrodon such as d milleri and d teutonis does not fit idea that sail s purpose was thermoregulation because smaller sails are less able to transfer heat and because small bodies can absorb and release heat easily on their own moreover close relatives of dimetrodon such as sphenacodon have very low crests that would have been useless as thermoregulatory devices large sail of dimetrodon is thought to have developed gradually from these smaller crests meaning that over most of sail s evolutionary history thermoregulation could not have served an important function larger bodied specimens of dimetrodon have larger sails relative to their size an example of positive allometry positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that as individuals get larger surface area increases faster than mass larger bodied animals generate a great deal of heat through metabolism and amount of heat that must be dissipated from body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller bodied animals effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area however a 2010 study of allometry in dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass actual scaling exponent of sail was much larger than exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation researchers concluded that sail of dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation and suggested that sexual selection was primary reason for its evolution sexual selection allometric exponent for sail height is similar in magnitude to scaling of interspecific antler length to shoulder height in cervids furthermore as bakker 1970 observed in context of dimetrodon many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays and positively allometric sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards echelle et al 1978 christian et al 1995 there is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in robustness of skeleton and in relative height of spines of d limbatus romer and price 1940 sexual dimorphism dimetrodon may have been sexually dimorphic meaning that males and females had slightly different body sizes some specimens of dimetrodon have been hypothesized as males because they have thicker bones larger sails longer skulls and more pronounced maxillary steps than others based on these differences mounted skeletons in american museum of natural history amnh and field museum of natural history may be males and skeletons in denver museum of nature and

diversity of fossil tetrapods or four limbed vertebrates in addition to dimetrodon most common tetrapods in red beds and throughout early permian deposits in southwestern united states are amphibians diplocaulus eryops and trimerorhachis reptiliomorph seymouria reptile captorhinus and synapsids and edaphosaurus these tetrapods made up a group of animals that paleontologist everett c olson called permo carboniferous a fauna that dominated continental ecosystem for several million years based on geology of deposits like red beds fauna is thought to have inhabited a well vegetated lowland deltaic ecosystem food web thumb left restoration of d grandis and temnospondyl eryops both found in red beds of texas olson made many inferences on paleoecology of texas red beds and role of dimetrodon within its ecosystem he proposed several main types of ecosystems in which earliest tetrapods lived dimetrodon belonged to most primitive ecosystem which developed from aquatic food webs in it aquatic plants were primary producers and were largely fed upon by fish and aquatic invertebrates most land vertebrates fed on these aquatic primary consumers dimetrodon was probably top predator of red beds ecosystem feeding on a variety of organisms such as shark xenacanthus aquatic amphibians trimerorhachis and diplocaulus and terrestrial tetrapods seymouria and insects are known from early permian red beds and were probably involved to some degree in same food web as dimetrodon feeding small reptiles like captorhinus red beds assemblage also included some of first large land living herbivores like edaphosaurus and feeding primarily on terrestrial plants these herbivores did not derive their energy from aquatic food webs according to olson best modern analogue for ecosystem dimetrodon inhabited is everglades exact lifestyle of dimetrodon amphibious to terrestrial has long been controversial but bone microanatomy supports a terrestrial lifestyle which implies that it would have fed mostly on land on banks or in very shallow water evidence also exists for dimetrodon preying on aestivating diplocaulus during times of drought with three partially eaten juvenile diplocaulus in a burrow of eight bearing teeth marks from a dimetrodon that unearthed and killed them only species of dimetrodon found outside southwestern united states is d teutonis from germany its remains were found in formation in a fossil site called bromacker locality bromacker s assemblage of early permian tetrapods is unusual in that there are few large bodied synapsids serving role of top predators d teutonis is estimated to have been only in length too small to prey on large herbivores that are abundant in bromacker assemblage it more likely ate small vertebrates and insects only three fossils can be attributed to large predators and they are thought to have been either large varanopids or small sphenacodonts both of which could potentially prey on d teutonis in contrast to lowland deltaic red beds of texas bromacker deposits are thought to have represented an upland environment with no aquatic species it is possible that large bodied carnivores were not part of bromacker assemblage because they were dependent on large aquatic amphibians for food references external links dimetrodon palaeos page on dimetrodon introduction to pelycosaurs university of
