32x is an add on for sega genesis video game console codenamed project mars 32x was designed to expand power of genesis and serve as a transitional console into 32 bit era until release of sega saturn independent of genesis 32x uses its own rom cartridges and has its own library of games add on was distributed under name in japan genesis 32x in north america mega drive 32x in pal region and mega 32x in brazil unveiled by sega at june 1994 s consumer electronics show 32x was presented as a low cost option for consumers looking to play 32 bit games developed in response to atari jaguar and concerns that saturn would not make it to market by end of 1994 product was conceived as an entirely new console at suggestion of sega of america executive joe miller and his team console was converted into an add on to existing genesis and made more powerful final design contained two 32 bit central processing units and a 3d graphics processor to bring new add on to market by its scheduled release date of november 1994 development of new system and its games was rushed console failed to attract third party video game developers and consumers because of announcement of sega saturn s simultaneous release in japan sega s efforts to rush 32x to market cut into available time for game development resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use add on s hardware including genesis ports sega produced 800 000 units of 32x and managed to sell an estimated 665 000 by end of 1994 selling rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as sega turned its focus to saturn 32x is considered a commercial failure reception after add on s unveiling and launch was positive highlighting low price of system and power expansion to genesis later reviews both contemporary and retrospective for 32x have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library poor market timing and resulting market fragmentation for genesis history sega genesis initially released in japan as mega drive in 1988 was sega s entry into 16 bit era of video game consoles console was then released as genesis in 1989 for north american market with releases in other regions following a year later although earlier release of sega cd add on had been commercially disappointing sega began to develop a stop gap solution that would bridge gap between genesis and sega saturn serving as a less expensive entry into 32 bit era decision to create a new system was made by sega ceo hayao nakayama and broadly supported by sega of america employees according to former sega of america producer scot bayless nakayama was worried that saturn would not be available until after 1994 and about recent release of 64 bit atari jaguar as a result direction given was to have this second release to market by end of year development during winter consumer electronics show in january 1994 sega of america research and development head joe miller took a phone call in his las vegas hotel suite from nakayama in which nakayama stressed importance of coming up with a quick response to jaguar included on this call were bayless sega hardware team head hideki sato and sega of america vice president of technology marty franz one potential idea for this came from a concept from sega of japan later known as project jupiter an entirely new independent console project jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of genesis with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than upcoming saturn as well as with some limited 3d capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from development of sega virtua processor chip miller suggested an alternative strategy citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months according to former sega of america producer michael latham miller said oh that s just a horrible idea if all you re going to do is enhance system you should make it an add on if it s a new system with legitimate new software great but if only thing it does is double colors miller however insists that decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions one idea was to leverage existing genesis as a way to keep from alienating sega customers who would otherwise be required to discard their genesis systems entirely to play 32 bit games and to control cost of new system this would come in form of an add on from these discussions project jupiter was discontinued and new add on codenamed project mars was advanced at suggestion from miller and his team sega designed 32x as a peripheral for existing genesis expanding its power with two 32 bit 2 processors sh 2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between sega and japanese electronics company hitachi original design for 32x add on according to bayless was created on a cocktail napkin but miller insists that this was not case at end of consumer electronics show with basic design of 32x in place sega of japan invited sega of america to assist in development of new add on although new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed it was not compatible with saturn games this was justified by sega s statement that both platforms would run at same time and that 32x would be aimed at players who could not afford more expensive saturn bayless praised potential of this system at this point calling it a coder s dream for day with its twin processors and 3d capabilities sega of america headed up development of 32x with some assistance from sato s team at sega of japan shortages of processors due to same 32 bit chips being used in both 32x and saturn hindered development of 32x as did language barrier between teams in japan and united states before 32x could be launched release date of saturn was announced for november 1994 in japan coinciding with 32x s target launch date in north america sega of america now was faced with trying to market 32x with saturn s japan release occurring simultaneously their answer was to call 32x a transitional device between genesis and saturn to which bayless describes of strategy f it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers pre launch promotion release and marketing thumb right japanese sega saturn released in november 1994 32x was incompatible with saturn software unveiling of 32x to public came at summer consumer electronics show in june 1994 in chicago promoted as poor man s entry into next generation games 32x was marketed for its us 159 price point as a less expensive alternative to saturn however sega would not answer as to whether or not a genesis console equipped with a sega cd and a 32x would be able to run saturn software founder of 3do company trip hawkins was willing to point out that it would not stating everyone knows that 32x is a band aid it s not a next generation system it s fairly expensive it s not particularly high performance it s hard to program for and it s not compatible with saturn in response to these comments sega executive richard lindner pointed out that 32x would play genesis titles and had same system architecture as saturn in august of that year gamepro highlighted advantages of upcoming add on in its 32 bit processors and significantly lower price noting that n o doubt gotta get it now gamers will spend big bucks to grab saturn or playstation systems and games from japan for rest of us however 32x may well be system of choice in 94 in promotion for new system sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third party developers 32x was released on november 21 1994 in north america in time for holiday season that year as announced it retailed for 159 99 and had a reasonably successful launch in marketplace demand among retailers was high and sega could not keep up with orders for new system over 1 000 000 orders had been placed for 32x units but sega had only managed to ship 600 000 units by january 1995 launching at about same price as a genesis console price of 32x was less than half of what saturn s price would be at launch despite sega s initial promises only six titles were available at its north american launch including doom star wars arcade virtua racing deluxe and cosmic carnage although virtua racing was considered a strong title cosmic carnage looked and played so poorly that reporters made jokes about it games were available at a retail price of 69 95 advertising for system included images of 32x being connected to a genesis console to create an arcade system japan received 32x on december 3 1994 at a cost of jpy 16 800 system s pal release came in january 1995 at a price of 99 and also experienced initial high demand decline despite lower price console s positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32 bit gaming sega had a difficult time convincing third party developers to create games for new system top developers were already aware of coming arrival of sega saturn nintendo 64 and playstation and did not believe 32x would be capable of competing with any of those systems quick development time of 32x also made game development difficult according to franz not wanting to create games for an add on that was a technological dead end many developers decided not to make games for system issues also plagued titles developed in house due to time crunch to release 32x according to bayless games in queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way even from outset designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of time crunch by time they shipped they were even more conservative they did nothing to show off what hardware was capable of journalists were similarly concerned about sega s tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both likening sega s approach to that of general motors and segmenting market for its consoles in order to convince press that 32x was a worthwhile console sega flew in journalists from all around country to san francisco for a party at a local nightclub event featured a speech from tom kalinske live music with a local rapper praising 32x and 32x games on exhibition however event turned out to be a bust as journalists attempted to leave party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display only to find that buses that brought them to nightclub had just left and would not return until scheduled end of party though system had a successful launch demand soon disappeared over first three months of 1995 several of 32x s third party publishers including capcom and konami cancelled their 32x projects so that they could focus on producing games for saturn and playstation 32x failed to catch on with public and is considered a commercial failure by 1995 genesis had still not proven successful in japan where it was known as mega drive and saturn was beating playstation so sega ceo hayao nakayama decided to force sega of america to focus on saturn and cut support for genesis products executing a surprise early launch of saturn in early summer of 1995 sega was supporting five different consoles before this saturn genesis game gear pico and master system as well as sega cd and sega 32x add ons sales estimates for 32x stood at 665 000 units at end of 1994 despite assurances from sega that many games would be developed for system in early 1996 sega finally conceded that it had promised too much out of add on and decided to discontinue 32x in order to focus on saturn in september 1995 retail price for 32x dropped to 99 and later remaining inventory was cleared out of stores at 19 95 with 800 000 units sold in total sega neptune sega neptune is an unproduced two in one genesis and 32x console which sega planned to release in fall 1995 with retail price planned to be something less than us 200 sega cancelled neptune in october 1995 citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for saturn while being priced too close to saturn to be a viable competitor electronic gaming monthly used sega neptune as an april fools day prank in its april 2001 issue issue included a small article in which writers announced that sega had found a warehouse full of old sega neptunes and were selling them on a website for 199 technical aspects and specifications thumb twin hitachi s 32 bit sh2 chips power 32x 32x can be used only in conjunction with a genesis system it is inserted into system like a standard game cartridge add on requires its own separate power supply a connection cable linking it to genesis and an additional conversion cable for original model of genesis as well as playing its own library of cartridges 32x is backwards compatible with genesis games and can also be used in conjunction with sega cd to play games that use both add ons 32x also came with a spacer so it would fit properly with second model of genesis an optional spacer was offered for use with sega genesis cdx system but ultimately never shipped due to risks of electric shock when 32x and cdx were connected installation of 32x also requires insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into genesis cartridge slot seated on top of a genesis 32x measures 32x contains two hitachi sh2 32 bit risc processors with a clock speed of 23 mhz which sega claimed would allow system to work 40 times faster than a stand alone genesis its graphics processing unit is capable of producing 32 768 colors and rendering 50 000 polygons per second which provides a noticeable improvement over polygon rendering of genesis 32x also includes 256 kilobytes of random access memory ram along with 256 kilobytes of video ram sound is supplied through a pulse width modulation sound source input output is supplied to a television set via a provided a v cable that supplies composite video and stereo audio or through an rf modulator stereo audio can also be played through headphones via a headphone jack on attached genesis game library thumb right 32x version of doom 32x s game library consists of forty titles including six that required both sega 32x and sega cd among titles for 32x were ports of arcade games after burner space harrier and star wars arcade a with a hummingbird as a main character in and a 32x exclusive game in sonic hedgehog series titled knuckles chaotix several of games released for 32x are enhanced ports of genesis games including nfl quarterback club and world series baseball 95 in a retrospective review of console star wars arcade was considered best game for 32x by ign for its cooperative play soundtrack and faithful reproduction of experiences of star wars in a separate review ign s buchanan praised 32x title shadow squadron as superior to star wars arcade see retro gamer writer damien mcferran however praised virtua fighter as jewel in 32x s crown cf and gamesradar named knuckles chaotix as best game for system next generation called virtua fighter colorful wreath on 32x s coffin reflecting consensus among contemporary critics that game was at once arguably 32x s best release and a clear harbinger of platform s imminent discontinuation since it was clearly inferior to saturn versions of virtua fighter remix which had already been released and virtua fighter 2 which was due out in just a few months in response to fan inquiries sega stated that 32x architecture was not powerful enough to handle a port of virtua fighter 2 although console used 32 bit processing and was capable of better graphics and sound than genesis alone most games for 32x did not take advantage of its hardware doom for 32x received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch but was later criticized for being an inferior version of game compared to releases for pc and atari jaguar with 32x version criticized for missing levels poor graphic and audio quality jerky movement and running within a window on screen though system had enhanced audio capabilities 32x games did not use this which franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with new audio enhancements one source of these issues was rush to release games on time for 32x s launch former sega of america executive producer michael latham explained in reference to 32x launch title cosmic carnage we were rushed we had to get games out for 32x and it was going to be such a close cycle when cosmic carnage showed up we didn t even want to ship it it took a lot of convincing you know to ship that title likewise with doom id software s john carmack rushed to have port ready for release at 32x s launch and had to trim out a third of game s levels in order to meet deadline for port to be published on time because of time limitations game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what 32x hardware was able to do in an interview at end of 1995 sega vice president of marketing mike ribero while insisting that sega was not abandoning 32x acknowledged that first party software support for system had been lackluster i won t lie to you we screwed up with 32x we and reception and legacy thumb right sega genesis with both 32x and cd add ons initial reception to 32x and its games upon launch of add on was very positive four reviewers from electronic gaming monthly scored add on 8 7 8 and 8 out of 10 in their 1995 buyer s guide highlighting add on s enhancements to genesis but questioning how long system would be supported gamepro commented that 32x s multiple input and power cords make it as complicated as setting up your vcr and noted some performance glitches with prototype such as freezes and overheating but expressed confidence that production models would perform well and gave add on their overall approval reviews of its launch titles such as doom were likewise positive by late 1995 feedback to add on had soured in its 1996 buyer s guide electronic gaming monthly s four reviewers scored add on 3 3 3 and 2 out of 10 criticizing game library and sega s abandonment of system in favor of saturn a review in next generation panned 32x for its weak polygon processing tendency of developers to show off its capabilities with garishly colored games and its apparent function as simply a way of grabbing extra 1994 mind and market share while waiting for saturn review gave it one out of five stars retrospectively 32x is widely criticized as having been under supported and a poor idea in wake of release of sega saturn 1up com s jeremy parish stated that 32x tainted just about everything it touched gamesradar also panned system placing it as their ninth worst console with reviewer mikel reparaz criticizing that it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under bus when sega saturn came out six months later and everyone seemed to know it except for die hard sega fans and company itself retro gamer s damien mcferran offered some praise for power increase of 32x to offer ports of space harrier after burner and virtua fighter that were accurate to original arcade versions as well as add on s price point stating if you didn t have deep enough pockets to afford a saturn then 32x was a viable option it s just a shame that it sold so poorly because potential was there for true greatness levi buchanan writing for ign saw some sense in move for sega to create 32x but criticized its implementation according to buchanan i actually thought 32x was a better idea than sega cd 32x while underpowered at least advanced ball maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library but at least idea was right one in particular console s status as an add on and poor timing after announcement of saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing audience for sega s video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers allgame s scott alan marriott states that e very add on whittled away at number of potential buyers and discouraged third party companies from making games necessary to boost sales gamepro criticized concept of add on noting expenses involved in purchasing system according to reviewer blake snow just how many 16 bit attachments did one need all in all if you were one of unlucky souls who completely bought into sega s add on frenzy you would have spent a whopping 650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog writing for gamesradar reparaz noted that developers not wanting to waste time on a technological dead end abandoned 32x in droves gamers quickly followed suit turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn t split their user base with pricey add ons reparaz went on to criticize sega s decision to release 32x noting that u 32x was product of boneheaded short sightedness its existence put sega into competition with itself once saturn rolled out writing for ign buchanan points out notice that we haven t seen many add ons like 32x since 1994 i think 32x killed idea of an add on like this a power booster permanently and that s a good thing because add ons if not implemented properly just splinter an audience former executives at sega have mixed opinions of 32x bayless believes firmly that 32x serves as a warning to video game industry not to risk splintering market for consoles by creating add ons and was critical of kinect and playstation move for doing so franz places 32x s commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached genesis and lack of a cd drive despite its compatibility with sega cd stating 32x was destined to die because it didn t have a cd drive and was an add on an add on device is never as well thought out as a built from scratch device miller on other hand remembers 32x positively stating i think 32x actually was an interesting viable platform timing was wrong and certainly our ability to stick with it given what we did with saturn was severely limited there were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform without third party support and with timing of saturn but i still think project was a success for a bunch of other reasons in hindsight it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons see also 3do interactive multiplayer philips cd i notes references category fifth generation video game consoles category products introduced in 1994 category products introduced in 1995
