day and is known worldwide simply as braille blinded in both eyes as a result of an early childhood accident braille mastered his disability while still a boy he excelled in his education and received a scholarship to france s royal institute for blind youth while still a student there he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently inspired by military cryptography of charles barbier braille constructed a new method built specifically for needs of blind he presented his work to his peers for first time in 1824 in adulthood braille served as a professor at institute and had an avocation as a musician but he largely spent remainder of his life refining and extending his system it went unused by most educators for many years after his death but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide early life thumb left birthplace of louis

of tools trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl squinting closely at surface he pressed down hard to drive point in and awl glanced across tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes a local physician bound and patched affected eye and even arranged for braille to be met next day in paris by a surgeon but no treatment could save damaged organ in agony young boy suffered for weeks as wound became severely infected an infection which then spread to his other eye likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia louis braille survived torment of infection but by age of five he was completely blind in both eyes due to his young age braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight and often asked why it was always dark davidson margaret 1971 louis braille boy who invented books for blind his parents made many efforts quite uncommon for era to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion and he prospered in their care he learned to navigate village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability braille s bright and creative mind impressed local teachers and priests and he was accommodated with higher education kugelmass 1951 pp 24 39 education braille studied in coupvray until age of ten because of his combination of intelligence and diligence braille was permitted to attend one of first schools for blind children in world royal institute for blind youth since renamed to national institute for blind youth in paris farrell p 98 braille last of family s children to leave household departed for school in february 1819 mellor p 26 at that time royal institute was an underfunded ramshackle affair but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together kugelmass 1951 pp 34 35 mellor p 29 hauy system children were taught how to read by a system devised by school s founder valentin hauy not blind himself hauy was a philanthropist who devoted his life to helping blind he designed and manufactured a small library of books for children using a technique of embossing heavy paper with raised imprints of latin letters readers would trace their fingers over text comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which hauy could appreciate kugelmass 1951 pp 37 38 thumb right bust and awl exhibit at braille birthplace museum in coupvray alt a bust of braille next to items in a display case braille was helped by hauy books but he also despaired over their lack of depth amount of information kept in such books was necessarily small because raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire children could not hope to write by themselves so that young louis could send letters back home simon rene provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather it was a slow and cumbersome process but boy could at least trace letters outlines and write his first sentences kugelmass 1951 p 48 handcrafted hauy books all came in uncomfortable sizes and weights for children they were laboriously constructed very fragile and expensive to obtain when hauy s school first opened it had a total of three books nonetheless hauy promoted their use with zeal to him books presented a system which would be readily approved by educators and indeed they seemed to sighted to offer best achievable results braille and his schoolmates however could detect all too well books crushing limitations nonetheless hauy s efforts still provided a breakthrough achievement recognition of sense of touch as a workable strategy for sightless reading hauy system s main drawback was that it was talking to fingers with language of eye farrell p 96 teacher and musician braille read hauy books repeatedly and he was equally attentive to oral instruction offered by school he proved to be a highly proficient student and after he had exhausted school s curriculum he was immediately asked to remain as a teacher s aide by 1833 he was elevated to a full professorship for much of rest of his life braille stayed at institute where he taught history geometry and algebra pp 161 162 braille s ear for music enabled him to become an accomplished cellist and organist in classes taught by jean nicolas later in life his musical talents led him to play organ for churches all over france a devout catholic mellor p 5 braille held position of organist in paris at church of saint nicolas des champs from 1834 to 1839 and later at church of saint vincent de paul mellor p 78 braille system thumb right first version of braille composed for french alphabet alt letters of alphabet printed in braille braille was determined to invent a system of reading and writing that could bridge gap in communication between sighted and blind in his own words access to communication in widest sense is access to knowledge and that is vitally important for us if we blind are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people we do not need pity nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable we must be treated as equals and communication is way this can be brought about thumb right three forms of letters a and z alt same two letters printed in different formats origins in 1821 braille learned of a communication system devised by captain charles barbier of french army some sources depict braille learning about it from a newspaper account read to him by a friend kugelmass 1951 pp 108 115 while others say officer aware of its potential made a special visit to school in either case barbier willingly shared his invention called night writing which was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper these impressions could be interpreted entirely by fingers letting soldiers share information on battlefield without having light or needing to speak captain s code turned out to be too complex to use in its original military form but it inspired braille to develop a system of his own kugelmass 1951 pp 117 118 farrell pp 96 97 design braille worked tirelessly on his ideas and his system was largely completed by 1824 when he was fifteen years old from barbier s night writing he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency he made uniform columns for each letter and he reduced twelve raised dots to six he published his system in 1829 and by second edition in 1837 he had discarded dashes because they were too difficult to read crucially braille s smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger braille created his own raised dot system by using an awl same kind of implement which had blinded him in process of designing his system he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it based on barbier s own slate and stylus tools by soldering two metal strips across slate he created a secure area for stylus which would keep lines straight and readable by these modest means braille constructed a robust communication system it bears stamp of genius wrote dr richard slating french former director of california school for blind like roman alphabet itself bickel p 185 musical adaptation system was soon extended to include braille musical notation passionate about his own music braille took meticulous care in its planning to ensure that musical code would be flexible enough to meet unique requirements of any instrument mellor p 82 in 1829 he published first book about his system method of writing words music and plain songs by means of dots for use by blind and arranged for them ironically this book was first printed by raised letter method of hauy system publications braille produced several written works about braille and as general education for blind method of writing words music and plain songs 1829 was revised and republished in 1837 his mathematics guide little synopsis of arithmetic for beginners entered use in 1838 and his monograph new method for representing by dots form of letters maps geometric figures musical symbols etc for use by blind was first published in 1839 many of braille s original printed works remain available at braille birthplace museum in coupvray decapoint new method for representing by dots 1839 put forth braille s plan for a new writing system with which blind people could write letters that could be read by sighted people called decapoint system combined his method of dot punching with a new specialized grill which braille devised to overlay paper when used with an associated number table also designed by braille and requiring memorization grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce standard alphabet weygand p 288 after introduction of decapoint braille gave assistance to his friend pierre francois victor foucault who was working on development of his a device that could emboss letters in manner of a typewriter foucault s machine was hailed as a great success and was exhibited at world s fair in paris in 1855 farrell p 121 later life although braille was admired and respected by his pupils his writing system was not taught at institute during his lifetime successors of valentin hauy who had died in 1822 showed no interest in altering established methods of school and indeed they were actively hostile to its use dr alexandre francois rene headmaster at school was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille in braille had always been a sickly child and his condition worsened in adulthood a persistent respiratory illness long believed to be tuberculosis dogged him and by age of forty he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher despite lack of a cure at time braille lived with illness for 16 years when his condition reached mortal danger he was admitted to infirmary at royal institution where he died in 1852 two days after he had reached age of forty three weygand p 289 legacy thumb braille s memorial

braille was championed by dr thomas rhodes armitage and thereafter its international use increased rapidly by 1882 dr armitage was able to report that there is now probably no institution in civilized world where braille is not used except in some of those in north america farrell pp 103 104 eventually even these holdouts relented braille was officially adopted by schools for blind in united states
