and developed by american video game designer and critic anna anthropy also known as auntie in 2008 james harvey provided artwork for game while andrew toups created music anthropy designed mighty jill off to feature dykes and perverts to make up for distinct lack of real dyke characters and dyke desire in games she argued that while supposed dykes are seen in commercials these characters are written and drawn by men she said that they don t look like us they don t express themselves like us they don t lust like us anthropy compared challenge of players who lead jill through game as similar to challenges of a top who leads bottom through a scene art design right thumb 200px concept art for jill drawn by james harvey showing multiple concepts for jill that he created before deciding on final one while character artwork for mighty jill off was created by james harvey anthropy first designed jill in sprite form harvey was initially wary of doing work that was bdsm themed he felt that it was easy for something that is both cartoony and sexual to make viewers feel uncomfortable and used japanese harem anime genre as an example he added that in humorous sexually oriented cartoons there is a fine line between cute and funny and repulsive he wanted to design relationship between queen and jill in a way that people in bdsm community could identify with it while also avoiding putting people off who were not into bdsm he used european comics as a model for his art work which he admired for permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons he also cited as inspiration specific japanese cartoonists who he felt had successfully portrayed sex in animation such as monkey punch creator of lupin iii harvey designed queen based on a loose description by anthropy he wanted to make her sexy and authoritative and to look like a fully grown human with relatively realistic proportions he designed her to be an amalgamation of every lesbian friend he had secretly been attracted to he initially designed her with a veil but felt that this was too superfluous and girly he decided to adorn her with spikes instead he attempted to design title screen s background to emphasise drama of situation or to sic symbolise characters in scene however there were some hurdles he originally envisioned queen s tower to be a smooth straight one but felt that it would be too phallic which would be meaningless symbolism given game s content anthropy and harvey held a contest for people to contribute fan art for game five winners won hand made mighty jill off activity books which included activities such as creating make out partners for a group of repulsive tongue waggling oafs as well as writing a poem for game s queen he scanned one of books and posted it online allowing others to contribute and send in their drawings book features several bdsm related themes harvey was split between two designs for jill he either wanted to depict her as a funny little megaman character or a grown woman however both approaches had their own pitfalls he felt that former could come off as too much like japanese lolicon styled art while latter could make story seem too serious queen s more realistic design made him question whether a child like jill would be appropriate he designed several versions of jill with different proportions and sent them to anthropy so she could pick her favourite he compared two of designs to nintendo characters mario and link mario like design he called a standard video game design while link like design he called slightly realistic link like design was most realistic design that he did because he felt that making it too realistic could make it too difficult for players to identify with and could diminish humorous elements of game he also intended to design her as dumpy and to make her more lovable anthropy told harvey that she preferred characters with more realistic proportions as a result he ended up with a design that was three and a half heads tall due to her submissive position he designed her to be an innocent who looked eager to please with benign wide eyed facial expressions evolution of her design resulted in harvey having to redesign her appearance on title screen he employed different colors to demonstrate jill s feelings for queen he used a rose tint to demonstrate her blissful display of affection while using a grey wash to demonstrate her sadness harvey intended to add some red to her rubber body suit order to make her stand out from background however he felt that this made suit look more like a crazy wrestler costume he later thought to include grey in design or to put her initials on her chest but decided on using an all black design one of difficulties of designing suit was to make it look shiny without resembling gross lolicon manga porn follow ups a harder version called mighty jill off jill off harder edition was released in october 2008 8 months after original version anthropy compared it to nintendo game super mario bros lost levels which was noticeably more difficult than its predecessor super mario bros she made it with intention of reusing assets from original game such as sprites and backgrounds but making sure that none of challenges were recycled she also made a follow up called jill off with one hand which features gameplay a type of gameplay which requires only one button to play it was created over course of buy nothing day and was created with intent of making it playable on mobile phones protagonist jill was featured

cover and called it a hypersexualized bondage themed platformer with which anthropy explores power dynamics of sexuality and disassembles essentialist male and female sex roles as portrayed in video games as well as significance of difficulty and reward as a design method references external links official website category 2008 video games category macos games category windows games category
