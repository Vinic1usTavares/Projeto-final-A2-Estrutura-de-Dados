operation barras was a british army operation that took place in sierra leone on 10 september 2000 during late stages of that nation s civil war operation aimed to release five british soldiers of royal irish regiment and their sierra leone army liaison officer who were being held by a militia group known as west side boys soldiers were part of a patrol that was returning from a visit to jordanian peacekeepers attached to united nations mission in sierra leone unamsil at masiaka on 25 august 2000 when they turned off main road and down a track towards village of magbeni there patrol of twelve men was overwhelmed by a large number of heavily armed rebels taken prisoner and transported to gberi bana on opposite side of rokel creek british army negotiated release of six men but were unable to gain freedom of their sierra leone army liaison officer and other men before west side boys demands became increasingly unrealistic negotiators concluded that these were delaying tactics rather than an effort to resolve crisis by 9 september soldiers had been held for over a fortnight fearing that soldiers would be killed or moved to a location from which it would be more difficult to extract them british government authorised an assault on west side boys base to take place at dawn following day 10 september ground operation was conducted by d squadron 22 regiment special air service who assaulted gberi bana in a bid to extract royal irish and elements of 1st battalion parachute regiment 1 para who launched a diversionary assault on magbeni operation freed five soldiers as well as twenty one sierra leonean civilians who had been held prisoner by west side boys at least twenty five west side boys were killed in assault as was one british soldier while eighteen west side boys including gang s leader foday kallay were taken prisoner and later transferred to custody of sierra leone police many west side boys fled area during assault and over 300 surrendered to unamsil forces within a fortnight operation restored confidence in british forces operating in sierra leone which had been undermined by capture of royal irish patrol after operation british government increased its support of unamsil and its efforts to bring civil war to an end both politically through united nations security council and through provision of staff officers to support unamsil successful use of 1 para in operation barras influenced creation of special forces support group a permanent unit initially built around 1 para whose role is to act as a force multiplier for british special forces on large or complex operations background sierra leone is a former british colony in west africa close to equator with an area of similar in size to south carolina or scotland by 2000 country had been consumed by a civil war which had begun in 1991 west side boys were a militia group who had been involved in civil war they were initially loyal to revolutionary united front ruf rebel army opposing government they later fought for government against ruf and were involved in at least one operation directed by british officers in exchange for weapons and medical supplies fowler 2004 p 110 but west side boys refused to integrate into reconstituted sierra leone army and began operating as bandits from abandoned villages of magbeni and gberi bana on opposite sides of rokel creek fowler 2010 pp 7 9 british forces were deployed to sierra leone in may 2000 initially for a non combatant evacuation operation under codename operation palliser in which they were tasked with evacuating foreign nationals particularly those from united kingdom other commonwealth countries and others for whom british government had accepted consular responsibility as part of mission british forces secured sierra leone s main airport lungi having secured freetown and lungi and evacuated foreign nationals who wished to leave initial forces left and were replaced by a short term training team sttt whose mission was to train and rebuild sierra leone army sttt was initially formed from a detachment from 2nd battalion royal anglian regiment who were replaced in july 2000 by 1st battalion royal irish regiment 1 r irish special air service sas is a corps of british army and part of united kingdom s special forces it consists of three regiments of which two are drawn from territorial army and one regular regiment 22 regiment which was involved in operation barras sas was formed by colonel david stirling in africa in 1941 at height of second world war s north african campaign its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory first in north africa and later around mediterranean and in occupied europe stirling established principle of using small teams having realised that small well trained teams could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers sas first entered public eye after operation nimrod operation to end iranian embassy siege in 1980 fremont barnes pp 6 7 1st battalion parachute regiment 1 para is part of british army s infantry and as in sas applicants must undergo an additional level of scrutiny in order to be accepted unlike in sas new recruits to army can apply to join parachute regiment directly from infantry training centre at catterick in yorkshire in case of soldiers or royal military academy sandhurst for officers regiment whose personnel are commonly known as paras specialises in parachute and other types of airborne insertion and has close ties to sas providing more of its personnel than any other regiment fowler 2010 p 24 capture of royal irish patrol thumb a land rover with weapons mount installation kit similar to vehicles used by royal irish patrol this one in service with raf regiment alt desert coloured land rover with mounted machine gun on 25 august 2000 a patrol led by major allan marshall consisting of 11 men from 1 r irish an official from sierra leone army acting as interpreter lieutenant musa bangura left their base in waterloo to visit jordanian peacekeepers attached to united nations mission in sierra leone unamsil and based at masiaka over lunch they were informed that west side boys had begun to disarm despite their initial reluctance and marshall decided to take patrol to investigate en route back to their base fowler 2010 pp 10 12 patrol turned off main road onto a dirt track that led to village of magbeni where west side boys were based as they approached base they were surrounded by a large group of west side boys who used an anti aircraft gun mounted on a bedford truck to block patrol s route marshall dismounted his vehicle then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten he and rest of patrol were then forced into canoes at bank of rokel creak and transported to gberi bana a village on other side of river just upstream from point of initial confrontation british forces in sierra leone were operating on authority of sierra leone government but president ahmad kabbah allowed british forces to negotiate for soldiers release themselves as his government lacked requisite expertise negotiations were led by lieutenant colonel simon fordham commanding officer of 1 r irish who was assisted by a small team which included hostage negotiators from metropolitan police dorman p 106 west side boys would not allow negotiators any closer to village of magbeni than end of track from main road so fordham met there with self styled brigadier foday kallay gang s leader to negotiate for soldiers release on 29 august fordham demanded proof that captive soldiers were still alive and kallay brought with him to that day s meeting two officers from group marshall company commander and captain flaherty regimental signals officer during meeting flaherty shook hands with fordham and covertly passed him a sketch map of gberi bana which detailed layout of village and building in which soldiers were being held fowler 2010 pp 13 16 two days later on 31 august five of eleven hostages were released in exchange for a satellite telephone and medical supplies connaughton p 111 oc of captured soldiers had originally decided to release youngest first but this was changed to married men last minute however out of married men west side boys wanted two of them to remain due to their signals experience released soldiers included sergeant major two corporals and two rangers west side boys told british negotiators that remaining captured soldiers which included oc a captain a sergeant a lance corporal and two rangers that they would not be released until gang s remaining demands were met released soldiers were flown for debriefing to rfa sir percivale of royal fleet auxiliary off coast after release of soldiers west side boys spokesman self styled colonel cambodia used satellite telephone to contact british broadcasting corporation bbc for a lengthy interview in which they outlined a series of demands including a re negotiation of lome peace accord and release of prisoners held by sierra leone authorities bbc had prior warning from foreign office that interview would take place colonel cambodia quickly depleted batteries in telephone but his call to bbc enabled specialists from royal corps of signals to determine exact position of telephone deterioration west side boys were unstable possibly due to use of cannabis and cocaine and their behaviour during crisis was erratic after their release five soldiers described an incident in which kallay dissatisfied with their explanation conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot soldiers unless they told him why they had entered west side boys territory gang s drug habits also posed a problem for british negotiators as their cannabis use caused them to forget previous discussions and cocaine made them distrustful during negotiations relatives of several of west side boys were brought to gang s camp to ask them to release british soldiers gang responded that they had nothing against soldiers but that holding them had brought attention to their demands which now included immunity from prosecution safe passage to uk to take up university courses and guaranteed acceptance to re formed sierra leone army military planning around time that five soldiers were released two negotiators from sas joined fordham s negotiating team one of them joined fordham in several meetings with west side boys posing as a royal irish major in order to provide reconnaissance and gather intelligence in case an assault was required shortly after patrol s capture surgeon lieutenant jon carty rn medical officer on board hms argyll which was operating off coast was brought ashore to assess soldiers should they be freed or to provide immediate care in event of an assault resulting in casualties argyll also served as a temporary base for two army air corps lynx attack

british forces in sierra leone in 2000 alt an officer in warm weather uniform as planning for a potential military operation to release captive soldiers progressed it became clear that given number of west side boys and their separation between two locations gberi bana as well as village of magbeni see below operation could not be conducted by special forces alone dorman p 108 thus headquarters of 1st battalion parachute regiment 1 para was ordered to assemble an enhanced company group which would support special forces if such an operation was launched battalion s commanding officer selected a company led by major matthew lowe which had been on exercise in jamaica at time of initial british deployment to sierra leone several members of a company were new recruits who had only completed basic training two weeks prior lowe decided that replacing them with more experienced soldiers would risk undermining cohesion and morale of company but several specialist units from elsewhere in 1 para were attached to a company to bring company group up to required strength including a signals group snipers heavy machine gun sections and a mortar section fowler 2010 pp 21 27 fowler 2004 p 115 additional firepower was included to maximise options available to planners given that west side boys had a numerical advantage and that additional resources would not be immediately available should operation run into difficulties dorman p 109 on 31 august company group was ordered to move to south in gloucestershire under cover story that they were conducting a readiness to move exercise it was only at this point and after all mobile telephones had been confiscated to ensure operational security that entire company was briefed on operation that was being planned with operation becoming more likely to be launched lowe and his planning group flew to dakar senegal on 3 september to continue planning and to study intelligence gathered from sas patrols operating near west side boys camp british government feared that deployment of forces to sierra leone might precipitate an adverse reaction by west side boys against captive soldiers they calculated that it would take 14 hours to launch an assault from united kingdom should it be required in an emergency so remainder of company group was also moved to dakar in order to reduce response time fowler 2004 p 123 in order to further reduce response time political authority to launch assault in an emergency was delegated to british high commissioner in freetown alan jones while military decision was delegated to brigadier david richards commander of british forces in sierra leone two days later a pair of sas observation teams one on each side of rokel creek were inserted near villages by assault boats manned by special boat service sbs royal navy s special forces unit they began monitoring west side boys movements and gathering intelligence such as details of weapons as well as identifying viable landing sites for helicopters with progression of plans enhanced a company was tasked with planning for an assault on village of magbeni to south of rokel creek while sas would aim to release captive royal irish soldiers by assaulting gberi bana on north bank magbeni assault had several purposes to neutralise weapons in village which could disrupt sas operation to distract west side boys in magbeni and prevent them from crossing rokel creek to interfere with operation in gberi bana to defeat west side boys and destroy their military capabilities and to recover royal irish patrol s vehicles dorman p 113 several methods of insertion were considered both for paras and special forces personnel including an overland approach using four wheel drive vehicles and a water borne insertion using same method by which sas observation teams had arrived at their position planning group decided that overland approach would not allow troops to enter village undetected largely due to west side boys roadblocks on road into village and that insertion from rokel creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to sandbanks and powerful currents in river thus it was decided that insertions would be made from three royal air force chinook helicopters from no 7 squadron which had been in sierra leone since beginning of operation palliser fowler 2010 pp 26 29 deployment to sierra leone by 5 september british media was openly speculating on possibility that an operation would be launched to free remaining soldiers having picked up on 1 para s heightened readiness following day media was reporting that british forces had arrived in sierra leone as a contingency british special forces kept a low profile as was traditional and media interest surrounding 1 para allowed d squadron 22 sas to enter sierra leone unnoticed fowler 2010 p 28 enhanced a company group approximately 130 troops in total arrived in country in several groups and joined sas who had already established a base in hastings a village 30 miles 50 kilometres south of freetown where several of paras recognised former colleagues among troopers from d squadron at hastings paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of magbeni which had been constructed at camp connaughton p 112 as well as learning layout of village and refining battle technique rehearsals allowed soldiers to acclimatise to tropical heat and led commanders to decision that paras would go into battle with minimal equipment to reduce risk of heat exhaustion excluding weapons and ammunition they would carry only water and field dressings some officers feared that weight of body armour would increase risk of heat exhaustion but commanders hoped that cooler temperatures of early morning when operation was planned to be launched would mitigate effects of weight and decided to order its use fowler 2010 pp 29 30 a day after arrival of paras director special forces dsf brigadier john holmes arrived in freetown with a headquarters staff which included commanding officer of 22 sas and officer commanding d squadron as well as three personnel from royal air force s tactical communications wing holmes based himself at seaview house british military headquarters in freetown near british high commission from there his staff established contact with sas observation teams on either side of rokel creek and with cobra british government s emergency committee in london fowler 2004 pp 123 2010 p 31 dsf who usually attends cobra meetings during crises which may require use of special forces was represented by his chief of staff and by lieutenant colonel tim collins operations officer at headquarters special forces fowler 2004 p 124 collins p 13 operation decision to launch on 9 september colonel cambodia stated that remaining six members of royal irish patrol who had now been held for over a fortnight would be released only after a new government was formed in sierra leone negotiators concluded that west side boys increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude crisis at around same time sas teams near west side boys base reported that they had seen no sign of captive soldiers during four days they had been in position there were also concerns that west side boys might move further inland and either kill soldiers or move them to a location from which it would be more difficult for british forces to extract them combination of these factors led cobra to order an assault fowler 2010 pp 32 33 operation was to commence at first light next day 10 september intervening time was spent securing political and legal basis for raid final approval was gained from sierra leonean president ahmad kabbah and british prime minister tony blair while army legal corps secured approval from sierra leonean police fordham who had been leading negotiations telephoned west side boys and was able to establish that captive soldiers were alive and final orders were issued in evening of 9 september two villages were to be assaulted simultaneously gberi bana where royal irish were held by sas and magbeni by paras in addition to remaining royal irish soldiers sas were also tasked with extracting lieutenant musa bangura patrol s sla liaison whose extraction was given same priority as that of royal irish and a group of sierra

remaining members of royal irish patrol including bangura had been evacuated from area as sas operation concluded chinooks ferried prisoners and bodies from gberi bana to jordanian battalion of

made no mention of sas but when it was made public that brad tinnion was a lance bombardier originally from 29 commando regiment royal artillery it became clear to experts that tinnion had been serving with special forces operation barras was tinnion s first operational deployment as an sas trooper also confirmed to have died in operation were 25 west side boys although true figure is probably far higher gang s resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in jungle fowler 2010 p 51 several other west side boys were

political television programme hosted by sir david frost first public knowledge of operation barras came from guthrie s interview with frost which took place while operation was still concluding guthrie told frost w e didn t want to have to assault because it s a very difficult operation there are big risks in it but we have done it because our negotiations were getting nowhere hostages had been there for three weeks they west side boys were threatening to kill them or they were threatening to move them to other parts of sierra leone and once they d done that we d never be able to recover soldiers with ease which i hope we ve done this morning fowler 2010 pp 56 57 mod issued a press release with more details later in day fowler 2010 p 58 several decorations were awarded to

original intervention in sierra leone by british forces alt a photograph of a man with greying hair speaking into a microphone and gesturing with his left hand capture of royal irish patrol had undermined confidence of sierra leonean population in british operation which they hoped would help to bring an end to country s civil war and embarrassed british government which had been critical of similar previous incidents involving unamsil personnel operation barras restored confidence in british forces prompting military historian william fowler to call operation a necessarily spectacular endorsement of rule of law and elected government of sierra leone fowler 2004 p 158 british media struck a celebratory note at success of operation barras but some suggested that marshall had erred in diverting patrol off main road to visit west side boys both marshall and bangura patrol s sierra leone army liaison were adamant that patrol had been asked by jordanian peacekeepers serving with unamsil to in bangura s words take a closer look however commander of unamsil general mohamed of nigeria initially denied that royal irish had met jordanians and both unamsil hq and jordanian commanding officer denied that patrol were asked to investigate west side boys camp fowler 2010 p 18 fowler 2010 pp 59 60 an investigation into capture of patrol was launched by land command and a senior officer was despatched to freetown to debrief members of patrol report was critical of marshall stating that he made an error of professional judgement in diverting from a planned and authorised journey to make an unauthorised visit to village of magbeni risks of operation barras were acknowledged by mod and by officers involved in planning and assault it was described by an sas soldier as not a clinical black balaclava princes gate type operation it was a very grubby green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong richard connaughton observed in journal small wars insurgencies that operation showed that tony blair s government was not averse to possibility of casualties where they felt cause was just connaughton p 116 geoff hoon british secretary of state for defence summed up effect of operation at a press conference stating that operation barras sends a number of powerful messages firstly it is a yet further demonstration of refusal of successive british governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers secondly we hope west side group sic and other rebel units in sierra leone will now accept rule of law and authority of democratically elected government of sierra leone thirdly we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against uk armed forces will think carefully about possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action andrew m dorman of king s college london suggested that fate of wider british operation in sierra leone depended heavily on success or failure of operation barras and that had british forces been defeated united kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from sierra leone dorman also suggests that a defeat would have raised questions regarding tony blair s policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention dorman pp 113 114 dorman p 9 success of operation barras was a factor in decision to form special forces support group sfsg a permanent unit whose role is to act as a force multiplier for british special forces on large or complex operations sfsg was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion originally 1 para which was first battalion to serve in role with supporting elements from royal marines and royal air force regiment sfsg went on to support special forces operations in afghanistan and iraq fowler 2010 p 61 capture of royal irish patrol and effectiveness of operation to free them prompted british government to increase its support of unamsil both politically and through provision of staff officers to assist unamsil s operational headquarters though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers despite considerable lobbying british also applied political pressure through united nations security council on revolutionary united front ruf second main party to civil war after government and on sierra leone s neighbour liberia which had provided support to ruf new approach combined with a larger and more powerful unamsil hastened demobilisation of ruf and thus end of sierra leone civil war dorman pp 115 122 fowler 2004 p 177 see also operation similar operation to
