distrest poet is an oil painting produced sometime around 1736 by british artist william hogarth reproduced as an etching and engraving it was published in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740 dobbs p vol 2 p 165 scene was probably inspired by alexander pope s satirical poem dunciad it depicts a scene in a small dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in dormer and scratching his head stares at papers on desk before him evidently looking for inspiration to complete poem he is writing near him sits his wife darning clothes surprised by entrance of a milkmaid who impatiently demands payment of debts background right thumb enraged musician engraving of distrest poet in its third state was issued on 15 december 1741 as a companion piece to enraged musician a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by noise from street outside his practice room initial plate for distrest poet was produced soon after hogarth had completed oil painting but third state plate was not completed until late in 1740 at which time hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three image set provok d musician distrest poet and a third image on subject of painting provok d musician renamed enraged musician was produced in 1741 but third image was never completed barlow p 199 picture right thumb third state print completed in 1740 and issued in 1741 featured a different bill above poet s head scene is set in a small and messy garret sparsely furnished by a few pieces of crude furniture room is poorly kept with cracking plaster a broken window and uneven floor and a bare cupboard in this way hogarth underlines desperate circumstances of occupants and poverty of family starved of inspiration and suffering writer s block poet sits on end of his bed in his night gown quill in hand scratching his head a copy of edward bysshe s art of english poetry a guide to composition published in 1702 lies open on table a copy of pope s satirical grub street journal lies on floor near his feet a few feet to his right sits his wife darning clothes on her lap and those sprawled on floor where a cat sits while a crying infant who is upset and hungry goes unattended in only bed next to poet s wife by open door an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill demanding payment for milk underlining poet s refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job cupboard stands open and empty save for a mouse near door a dog steals last of family s food from a plate other less obvious elements of painting reveal more about poet s personality and ideas poem he is attempting to write is entitled upon riches which suggests that poet lives in a fantasy world while his wife and child go hungry p 256 ned ward s first published poem in 1691 was poet s ramble after riches which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet and hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced picture earlier impressions showed poem as poverty a poem which hinted at a connection to theobald who had written cave of poverty a poem written in imitation of shakespeare in 1714 poet s dreams of riches are further suggested by map that hangs over his head entitled a view of gold mines of peru replacing image of pope that appears in earlier states of print poet s self interest is hinted by presence of his pipe and tobacco on window sill mug of beer sitting on chair in back of room lace cuffs drying by fire his ill fitting wig and gentleman s sword lying at his feet it may be that despite his family s circumstances he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects alternatively his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him as they will be required when his fantasies are realized alexander pope thumb right upright hogarth reproduced this image of pope alexander in painting but whether his intention was to mock pope or pope s opponents is unclear by time print was issued image of pope had been removed scene shown in distrest poet was probably inspired by alexander pope s satirical poem dunciad most likely by prefatory matter of second version dunciad variorum which had been published in 1735 and in which pope confirmed his authorship of original painting and early states of print included a quotation from pope s work bill stuck to wall above poet s head originally featured a reference to pope in which he was mocked as his holiness pope alexander depicted as an ape wearing a papal tiara with an ass as his prime minister initial states of print kept quotation but replaced genuine bill with a representation which appears to have been entirely invented by hogarth rather than copied from a real bill of pope clashing with edmund curll over unauthorised publication of poet s correspondence although hogarth and pope had never met this literary inspiration led to speculation as to identity of hogarth s poet as one of targets of pope s satire ned ward author of london spy was a strong contender hallett p 137 as was lewis theobald to whom lines quoted from pope in hogarth s original print referred paulson vol 2 pp 119 20 how far hogarth sympathised with pope is questionable original bill mocked him but it featured in an image that at least poked fun at poor poet who was subject hogarth may have been suggesting either that poet was showing contempt for pope or that he placed pope s image above his head as a model to which to aspire in second image which shows pope and curll locked in battle it is not clear who has upper hand and by time print was issued direct reference to pope had been removed completely ronald paulson preeminent modern authority on hogarth suggests that hogarth would have viewed pope through his roman catholicism as having been implicitly tied to continental influences that hogarth despised and would have seen pope s refusal to accept patronage of great men of time while still cultivating them as friends and still reaping rewards they had to offer as hypocritical pope was part of circle that included william kent and richard boyle 3rd earl of burlington who had displaced hogarth s father in law james thornhill from commissions and hogarth also had ties to lewis theobald a possible target of satire through illustrations he had produced for theobald s perseus and andromeda and through his subscription to theobald s edition of works of shakespeare paulson suggests that real villain of distrest poet may be pope unseen but representing successful great poet whom deluded aspiring artist hopes to emulate rather than distressed poet himself paulson vol 2 pp 120 22 hogarth had featured pope picking john gay s pocket in foreground of print on south sea scheme an early print he had produced on theme of south sea bubble both pope and gay had invested money in scheme wharton p 191 at same time within satire of painting poet who is distressed is going to be one of pope s dunces lines by pope though referring to theobald hero of dunciad are a characterisation of a grub street hack a stereotype popular in 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature therefore particular scribbler depicted in painting would be one of this fraternity of who banded together to protest pope s poem in this context it would make sense therefore for poet to have scabrous anti pope print or an emblem of pope s fight with hack writers patron above him just as moll hackabout has a picture of macheath on her wall in a harlot s progress this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero edmund curll and an anti pope print emblem in other words identifies poet s side in battle between dunces and men of wit hogarth was well acquainted with struggles of grub street hack though through travails of his own father richard who had been unable to make a living as writer and had eventually ended up at fleet prison as a bankrupt paulson vol 1 p 23 hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to dunce struggling with his rhymes jenny uglow in her biography of hogarth posits that gradual alteration of prints above poet s head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards pope and his attack on class of writer to which hogarth s father had belonged and perhaps evidence of hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful uglow pp 29 30 notes references category prints by william hogarth category 1736 paintings category 1740 works category collections of
