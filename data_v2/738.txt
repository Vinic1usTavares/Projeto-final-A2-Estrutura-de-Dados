mainstreeter which operated on a slower schedule with fewer amenities northern pacific main line mirrored that of its great rival great northern railway gn running through northern montana and north dakota from 1920s onward however np gn and chicago burlington and quincy railroad cb q shared closer relations culminating in their 1970 merger as burlington northern railroad after merger service continued on both ex northern pacific and ex great northern when passenger service was transferred to amtrak new provider chose empire builder former flagship train of great northern as its chicago pacific northwest route amtrak based this decision on several factors including overall higher speed of ex great northern route and better availability of alternative transportation options along ex northern pacific operation thumb left north coast hiawatha at missoula in may 1974 amtrak s decision to discontinue ex np trains caused consternation in montana mike mansfield d montana then senate majority leader pointed out that empire builder bypassed montana s major population centers and had no difficulty in making his displeasure felt he demanded that amtrak find a way to serve montana s larger cities new company reacted to pressure and announced a resumption of service over ex northern pacific line to begin on june 14 this service took form of an unnamed section of empire builder which split in minneapolis en route to spokane washington mansfield s intervention earned train nickname mike mansfield limited northern pacific route which included yellowstone river homestake pass and bitterroot mountains was praised for its scenery amtrak considered route one of company s six most beautiful train also provided a convenient connection to yellowstone national park at livingston montana on november 14 1971 amtrak formally named this service north coast hiawatha for four days a week it ran independently of empire builder from twin cities to spokane on other three days of week it combined with empire builder in spokane for trip to seattle amtrak initially named minneapolis train hiawatha but adopted twin cities hiawatha name on january 16 1972 amtrak reverted to hiawatha on october 29 and this name remained until north coast hiawatha went daily for first time on may 19 1974 this joint operation ended on june 11 1973 when amtrak extended north coast hiawatha to seattle over great northern s route which included stevens pass and cascade tunnel this new routing served northern washington communities of wenatchee and everett which had previously been without service train remained on a tri weekly schedule west of minneapolis for summer of 1974 amtrak added a second train expo 74 named for expo 74 then being held in spokane to seattle spokane segment schedule fluctuated over next three years with train operating daily between chicago and seattle in summers and reverting to tri weekly west of minneapolis rest of year amtrak would also run a daily service during holiday season as in 1975 when train operated daily december 12 january 12 but train never operated a daily schedule for a full calendar year in early 1976 north coast hiawatha was threatened with discontinuance along with pacific international and three daily portland oregon seattle trains after ford administration proposed budget cuts several members of congress protested proposed cuts including representative max d montana and senators warren magnuson d washington and bob packwood r oregon in end congress approved a budget for amtrak 62 million above administration s request saving all three services amtrak announced in october 1976 that north coast hiawatha would be second train after empire builder to receive new bi level superliner coaches then on order from pullman standard in end train was cancelled before superliners entered long distance service in spring of 1977 amtrak added seven hours to schedule increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes change was prompted by new speed restrictions on amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving new emd sdp40f diesel locomotives in september amtrak eliminated off day chicago st paul service leaving north coast hiawatha with three trips a week amtrak reduced empire builder to quad weekly service as well twin cities hiawatha returned as a daytime service between chicago and minneapolis in november amtrak reduced running time to 46 hours 40 minutes after replacement of sdp40fs permitted an easing of speed restrictions even as this improved service began train was threatened with cancellation facing a budget deficit of 60 million amtrak identified a half dozen routes which it considered financially troubled amtrak proposed merging north coast hiawatha and empire builder or even cancelling both throughout 1978 no decision was taken and two trains continued to provide between them daily service between chicago and seattle discontinuance in january 1979 secretary of transportation brock adams announced plans to cut from amtrak s network north coast hiawatha was one of many routes scheduled for elimination train had faced cancellation before but after eight years of federal subsidies members of congress favored retrenchment once vocal supporters such as senator magnuson expressed regret but made no public commitment adams noted that service recovered only 6 million against expenses of 24 million and that per passenger cost was 178 in july an attempt by representative and future vice president al gore d tennessee to impose a one year moratorium on proposed system wide cuts failed 214 197 in end senate approved a smaller cutback citing a 24 spike in amtrak ridership after an oil shock during summer but north coast hiawatha remained on chopping block in late september railway labor executives association along with senator john melcher d montana and representative pat williams d montana sued u s department of transportation to prevent discontinuance of service then scheduled for october 1 a federal judge temporarily restrained amtrak from ending service but last north coast hiawathas ran on october 6 1979 arriving in chicago on 7th and seattle on 8th proposed return end of north coast hiawatha severed much of populated portion of montana from national rail network and also spelled end of intercity rail service in southern north dakota over years there have been periodic attempts to restore service in these areas a proposed plan from 1982 1983 would have involved north dakota and montana paying 45 of costs in first year and 65 thereafter of a new section of empire builder operating tri weekly between fargo and sandpoint this proposal went nowhere when neither state approved needed subsidy another proposal mooted in 1991 would have required an additional yearly federal appropriation of 12 15 million plus new equipment in this scenario portland section would operate over old route again nothing came of it in 2008 congress directed amtrak to study resumption of service which rekindled hope of restoration amtrak published a feasibility study in october 2009 which proposed restoring north coast hiawatha to its 1979 route where possible with a daily schedule amtrak projected a yearly ridership of 359 800 some of whom would be drawn from empire builder amtrak estimated that 1 billion in funds would be necessary to relaunch service including over 300 million for new locomotives and rolling stock corporation estimated it would take four to five years to reintroduce service if a decision was made to move forward equipment north coast hiawatha saw a variety of motive power and rolling stock during its eight years as amtrak disposed of its inherited equipment as best it could and gradually replaced older equipment with its own stock in early 1970s a typical train might feature as many as four dome cars pulled by ex milwaukee road emd e9s in summer of 1972 train maxed out at 18 cars including five dome coaches an ex california zephyr dome lounge and a dome sleeper lounge 1970 burlington great northern merger notwithstanding cars carried both big sky blue livery characteristic of late great northern passenger trains and cascade green of burlington northern railroad train was one of many routes to receive new emd sdp40f which worked route between 1974 1977 although older emd e8 and emd e9s continued to be used a series of derailments involving sdp40f prompted their replacement and by late 1977 amtrak had introduced emd f40ph these sometimes ran with an e9 b unit as well in late 1976 a typical north coast hiawatha departed seattle with two sdp40fs a baggage car two 44 seat long distance coaches a budd dome coach one of dormitory coffee shop cars formerly used on california zephyr an ex north coast limited dining car and a
