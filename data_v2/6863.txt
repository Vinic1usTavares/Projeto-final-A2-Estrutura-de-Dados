concealing coloration in animal kingdom an exposition of laws of disguise through color and pattern being a summary of abbott h thayer s discoveries is a book published ostensibly by gerald h thayer in 1909 and revised in 1918 but in fact a collaboration with and completion of his father abbott handerson thayer s major work book illustrated artistically by abbott thayer sets out controversial thesis that all animal coloration has evolutionary purpose of camouflage thayer rejected charles darwin s theory of sexual selection arguing in words and paintings that even such conspicuous animal features as peacock s tail or brilliant pink of flamingoes or roseate spoonbills were effective as camouflage in right light book introduced concepts of disruptive coloration to break up an object s outlines of masquerade as when a butterfly mimics a leaf and especially of countershading where an animal s tones make it appear flat by concealing its self shadowing book was criticised by big game hunter and politician theodore roosevelt for its central assertion that every aspect of animal coloration is effective as camouflage roosevelt s detailed reply attacked biased choice of examples to suit abbott thayer s thesis and book s reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher hugh cott who valued thayer s work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage thayer was mocked to a greater or lesser extent by other scientific reviewers overview thumb upright angel oil painting by abbott thayer 1887 abbott thayer 1849 1921 was an american artist known for his figure paintings often of virginal spiritual beauty which were sometimes as in his most famous painting angel modeled on his children meryman 1999 he had studied at an art school in paris but unlike james mcneill whistler he returned to united states along with seeking timeless beauty thayer also became obsessed with nature which he felt contained pure beauty that he was seeking to capture in his paintings thayer s close observation led him to notice what scientists such as edward bagnall poulton were just beginning to describe poulton 1890 this was that many animals were painted opposite way to how painters create appearance of solidity in figures a canvas is flat and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat to make a body appear to have depth and solidity artist paints in shadows on body itself top of an animal s back facing sky remains bright while it must become darker towards its underside thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading nature could and did make animals appear flat he was so passionate about this concealing coloration theory that he called it his second child poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars but he had not realized that phenomenon was widespread and he championed thayer s theory in a 1902 article in nature forbes 2009 p 74 however thayer was not a scientist and he lacked a scientist s inclination to attempt to test and disprove every aspect of a new theory instead thayer came to believe that theory belonged to artists with their trained perception whole basis of picture making consists in contrasting against its background every object in picture he argued obsession led him to deny that animals could be colored for other reasons for protection by mimicry as naturalist henry walter bates had proposed supported by many examples of butterflies from south america through sexual selection as charles darwin had argued again supported by many observations unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in concealing coloration in animal kingdom encapsulates thayer s partial understanding and his rejection of other theories forbes 2009 pp 73 84 same obsession led him later to attempt to persuade military to adopt camouflage based on his ideas traveling to london in 1915 and writing passionate letters to assistant secretary to us navy franklin delano roosevelt in 1917 approach thumb 237px abbott thayer introduced concept of countershading in book thumb title page of first edition text gerald thayer describes book as having two main purposes to present abbott thayer s research to naturalists and to make subject available to a wider readership thayer 1909 p viii book s list of contents reveals thayer s heavy reliance on bird examples filling 16 of 27 chapters other vertebrates occupy 5 chapters insects receive 3 chapters of which two are dedicated to lepidoptera one to caterpillars one to adult butterflies and moths remaining one devotes 14 pages to all other insects starting with orthoptera including leaf mimic grasshoppers illustrations book has 16 colored plates of paintings by abbott thayer and richard s meryman including well known frontispiece peacock amid foliage and heavily criticised images of wood ducks blue jays against snow roseate spoonbills and flamingoes at dawn or sunset and skies they picture last 4 colored plates are of caterpillars gerald thayer claims that illustrations are of particular importance inasmuch as they include what we believe to be first scientific paintings ever published of animals lighted as they actually are in nature there are 140 black and white figures mainly photographs with a few diagrams and drawings half photographs are of birds photographs are from various sources gleaned from periodicals or secured by special advertising thayer 1909 p ix contents introduction by abbott h thayer an

lepidoptera butterflies and moths outline thumb fig 7 white fowl lacking counter shading against a flat white cloth to show that a monochrome object can not be obliterated no matter what its background chapter 1 sets out long ignored laws of protective coloration an act which has waited for an artist to perceive thayer explains principle of countershading with a diagram arguing that a naive view of being colored like their surroundings does not explain how animal camouflage works he acknowledges prior work of edward bagnall poulton colours of animals 1890 in identifying countershading in caterpillars quoting some passages where poulton describes how larvae and pupae can appear flat countershading is named as law which underlies protective coloration rather than as one of several principles chapter 2 defines book s terms equating mimicry with protective resemblance so that it becomes a form of protective or disguising coloration thayer distinguishes concealing colors mainly countershading for invisibility from other branch of protective coloration which includes most kinds of mimicry for deceptive visibility two branches are then named obliterative coloration and mimicry mimicry is dismissed as playing a very insignificant part in higher orders i e it is limited mainly to invertebrates a fine photograph of a white fowl lacking counter shading against a flat white cloth demonstrates that camouflage is more than color matching thayer then gives several examples of what he considers countershaded animals chapter 3 describes combination of markings with countershading with photographs of a model bird and of a woodcock showing how in correct position these are well camouflaged with wonderful obliterative picture patterns but wrongly positioned or upside down with a photograph of a dead woodcock they are easily visible chapters 4 and 5 illustrate more picture patterns in well camouflaged birds including wilson s snipe and whip poor will nighthawks and goatsuckers thayer describes these as showing obliteration or merging with background but that their patterning is close to mimicry as they perfectly resemble objects such as a stone or mossy log chapter 6 argues that some birds such as ruffed grouse have patterns designed as camouflage against distant backgrounds with a painting of a bird against a forest background as evidence bird is in plain sight but invisible for great horned owl a piece of wing is super imposed on a photograph of a wood to show how closely owl s patterns reproduce such a forest interior text describes owl as having a highly developed forest vista pattern chapter 7 similarly argues for grass and heather patterns on terrestrial as opposed to arboreal birds disruptively patterned white tailed ptarmigan is shown in a very remarkable photograph by evan lewis thayer attempts to classify camouflage types for example writing chapter 8 continues theme with scansorial or tree climbing birds chapter 9 claims that obliterative shading pure and simple is rule among shore birds such as sandpipers and curlew chapter 10 describes background picturing of bitterns birds which live in reedbeds where chapter 11 argues in a way that was heavily criticised when book appeared see below that water birds some of them highly conspicuous like jacana and notoriously male wood duck are colored for camouflage beautifully contrasted black and white bars on flanks of wood duck aix sponsa are ripple pictures and as potent as camouflage in their place as most elaborate markings of land birds thayer 1909 p 62 chapter 12 argues that pure white of ocean birds such as gulls and terns equally functions as camouflage thayer admits that these often appear conspicuous but argues that against varied backgrounds white offers greatest average inconspicuousness against ocean his italics or against bright sky when seen from below chapter 13 analyses markings and patterns in detail starting with a color plate that shows effect of disruptive patterning which thayer calls strong secant and ruptive patterns using a photograph of an oystercatcher at its nest by cherry and richard kearton thayer argues that boldly marked bird mainly black above white below with red beak is both countershaded and patterned chapter 14 discusses barred markings of hawks and owls with further fine plates of photographs by of disruptively patterned waders and their cryptic chicks ringed plover is described as having eye masking and obliterative shadow and hole picturing pattern chapter 15 describes leg feather patterns of hawks asserting that these pantaloons mask these dangerous talons to facilitate attack just as their beaks like beaks of wading birds are masked paradoxically with gaudy colors chapter 16 controversially claims that iridescent colours of for example speculum wing patch of mallard and other ducks is obliterative brightly changeable plumage serving to camouflage wearer in varying conditions thayer asserts that such brightly colored species as european kingfisher and purple gallinule are camouflaged chapter 17 argues that bird plumage has many devices to conceal animals outlines even enormously developed feather appendages of birds of paradise are argued to provide camouflage in this way sexual display is mentioned but dismissed as not being sole reason for colours outlines and patterns of male birds chapter 18 briefly discusses mimicry before returning to evident paramount importance of obliterative function this time of brilliant heads of hummingbirds one case that thayer admits is mimetic is of trinidad a plant mimic that perches by day and night on a tree stump or branch where purpose of mimicry is crypsis chapter 19 concludes description of bird plumage claiming that birds from tropical forests to snowy north including woodpeckers and blue jay are all colored for inconspicuousness chapters 20 21 and 22 discuss disguising coloration of mammals including whales which are equipped with a full obliterative shading of surface colors bats are admitted to have very little in way of countershading unlike all other families in order thayer notes that a few species with strong of these species also have deimatic displays deliberately making themselves conspicuous such as hedgehogs porcupines echidnas pangolins and some armadillos are exceptions along with some beasts which enjoy a like security by virtue of their gigantic bigness including elephants rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses domestic hare is shown to be strongly countershaded with a pair of photographs from life one sitting and one laid on its back outdoors so that obliterative shading is reversed chapter 21 asserts that zebras must be extraordinarily inconspicuous against vegetation a claim derided by theodore roosevelt see below chapter 22 addresses problem of few beasts whose bold clear patterns seem to defy that foremost obliterative law these include skunks african zoril striped polecat and stink badger of java which all have dark underparts and white upperparts thayer dismisses aposematism of these species instead asserting effectiveness of their camouflage thumb copperhead snake full page card cutout to fit over painting of same snake among leaves thumb copperhead snake among leaves painting showing effective disruptive pattern several photographs using stuffed skins of skunks attempt to prove point chapter goes on to claim that roseate spoonbills flamingoes and prongbuck are all obliteratively colored raccoon s head resembles end of a hollow stump or log while its tail is said to be distractive strong banding serving like an eyespot to divert attention of a predator to tail rather than head while animal dives down a hole but thayer is unable to resist arguing that when quiet their tail bands act obliteratively chapter 23 looks at fish admitting frankly that authors know next to nothing about fishes from standpoint of systematic science but saying that they have gathered a trustworthy general estimate of their disguising coloration from market stalls museums and books many fish are countershaded bioluminescence of some deep sea fish and other animals is seen as a problem as it is not obliterative possibility of counterillumination camouflage is not considered chapter 24 considers reptiles and amphibians these are noted to be predominantly green often with ruptive patterns plate 11 treats a copperhead snake on dead leaves caption explaining that this is a bona fide study of a copperhead snake among dead leaves its normal situation there is a full page sheet of card cut out in shape of snake lying on a bed of leaves when this is folded back a painting by rockwell kent and abbott thayer also g h thayer and e b thayer is revealed showing snake s outline powerfully disrupted by its zigzag pattern among light and shade of leaf litter thumb larger spotted beech leaf edge caterpillar both on leaf and detached other way up revealing strong countershading chapter 24 mentions that some terrestrial salamanders are rather brightly pied with black and whitish or yellow while other amphibians are extremely gaudy wearing much bright blue green purple and sometimes red it suggests that some of these markings are baits or targets again to distract predators from striking at head while salamander markings are left as a problem as authors know too little about habits of these species it is admitted that disguising coloration of many of them is very obscure final chapters 25 26 and 27 turn to insects chapter 25 looks at caterpillars with as poulton had earlier noted convincing examples of countershading plate 13 shows caterpillars including larger spotted beech leaf edge caterpillar both in position passing for a part of leaf on which it is feeding strongly cryptic and flattened like a slightly browning leaf and inverted when its countershading makes it appear conspicuously solid chapter 26 looks at other insects and spiders noting famous leaf mimicking kallima is spelled in text butterfly of india but again claiming that even conspicuous butterflies are in fact obliterative eye spots are mentioned but instead of noting that these might be distractive they are asserted to be dazzling appearing as holes and thus functioning as disruptive camouflage text ends with a paragraph that asks if it is any wonder that artists should feel keen delight in looking at disguising patterns worn by animals these are triumphs of art where student can find in epitome painted and perfected by nature herself typical color and pattern scheme of each kind of landscape an appendix provides extracts from a very remarkable addition to our subject poulton s 1907 observations of color change in chameleons reception contemporary reviews theodore roosevelt thayers views were vigorously criticised in 1911 by theodore roosevelt an experienced big game in many lands book of boone and crockett club 1895 roosevelt theodore editor and naturalist familiar with animal camouflage as well as a politician in a lengthy article in bulletin of american museum of natural history roosevelt begins by writing that thayers expounded doctrine of concealing coloration in its extreme form which he thought had been pushed to such a fantastic extreme and to include such wild absurdities as to call for application of common sense thereto then to show sweeping claims made roosevelt quotes verbatim eight passages from book one after other 500 words in all last one being all patterns and colors whatsoever of all animals that ever prey or are preyed upon are under certain normal circumstances obliterative roosevelt 1911 pp 121 122 thumb abbott thayer and richard meryman painted peacock in woods for thayer s 1909 book image wrongly suggests that even male bird s brilliant plumage functions as camouflage he then observes that thayers claims both in pictures and in writing are not so much arguments as plain misstatements of facts or wild guesses put forward as facts he puts these down to enthusiasm rather than dishonesty and as an example critiques picture book s frontispiece of peacock in a 1911 pp 123 124 this roosevelt writes would be an extremely rare sight in nature worse female would he argues be conspicuous in those conditions thayers have chosen a blue sky to argue that peacock is camouflaged but then they choose a white sky to allow prongbuck s white rump to fade into that background this roosevelt argues is so dishonest that an engineer who constructed a report in that way would at once be dismissed and directors of a corporation who tried to float shares on strength of such a report would be liable to prosecution for fraud roosevelt had recently returned from his african safari having seen admired and shot large numbers of animals rothenburg 2011 p 137 he was scornful of thayer s theories which he described as phantasmagoria and writer as a well meaning and ill balanced enthusiast thayer s suggestion that white markings on body of harnessed bush buck are meant to resemble flecks of water shine is dismissed as wild with observation from personal experience that bush buck spend little time in watery places while or lechwe which lack spots spend more roosevelt 1911 p 194 roosevelt does not refrain from harshness he describes camouflaged flamingo theory as probably wildest of all wild absurdities to which mr thayer has committed himself roosevelt 1911 p 228 auk thumb in roseate spoonbills 1905 1909 thayer tried to show that even bright pink of these conspicuous birds had a cryptic function thumb male wood duck in a forest pool painted by thayer for book to argue that male duck s conspicuous plumage was disruptively patterned rather than sexual dimorphism thayer was also roundly criticised in 1911 by herpetologist thomas barbour and conservation pioneer john c phillips in auk where they wrote that barbour and phillips warmly welcome thayer s work on countershading which he has so excellently demonstrated they protest gently against his slightly patronizing treatment of camouflage of birds like woodcock and grouse which has been known and recognized since ornithology began and go on to attack on his claims for flamingo they are equally critical of his roseate spoonbill observing that painting looks nothing like actual skins of species as for wood duck they point out its sexual dimorphism of plumage and that male spends summer in eclipse plumage while he is barbour and phillips note that thayer in his enthusiasm has ignored or glossed over sexual dimorphism with an artistic haze they also question whether every animal needs protection by skilful we are shown how anything and everything may be rendered inconspicuous citing skunk among other boldly black and white animals with both skunk coloration and well known skunk smell they conclude by writing that they have purposely omitted calling special attention to strong features of book and that they have no axe to grind making of species english ornithologists douglas dewar and frank finn write in their 1909 book making of species that thayer seems to be of opinion that all animals are cryptically or as he calls it or obliteratively coloured they note that edward bagnall poulton had written approvingly of thayer and that thayer had asserted that almost all animals were countershaded they agree that countershading exists but to his suggestion that it is universal we feel sorely tempted to poke fun at him and promptly ask any reader who agrees with thayer that every animal is countershaded to look at a flock of rooks at sunset dewar finn 1909 pp 184 187 they admit that camouflage is in general advantageous but point out that different plumages of seasonally and sexually dimorphic birds cannot all be explained as camouflage considering conspicuous colours of male birds they counter further argument that hens may be in more danger than cocks through sitting on nests by observing that in many dimorphic species showy cock shares work of incubating eggs modern assessment hugh cott thumb thayer straining theory to a fantastic extreme white flamingoes red flamingoes and skies they simulate dawn or dusk painted for book by abbott thayer zoologist and camouflage expert hugh cott in his 1940 book adaptive coloration in animals writes that cott attacks thayer s comprehensive assertion that all patterns and colors whatsoever are obliterative and continues more specifically with a detailed rebuttal of both text and thayer s contrived paintings cott then gives examples of peacock in woods with blue sky behind neck flock of red flamingoes matching a red sunset sky and roseate spoonbill whose pink plumage matches a pink cloud scheme he then lists cases of white flamingo skunk and white rump of prongbuck quoting roosevelt raven s coloration is of course concealing if it is put into a coal scuttle notes how unreasonable are extreme views like that adopted by thayer and admits that criticisms of certain of thayer s conclusions are justified before returning to attack on those critics robustly defending theory of protective and aggressive resemblance cott 1940 p 173 more favourably cott explicitly recognises thayer s work on countershading though granting edward bagnall poulton s partial anticipation with his work on chrysalis of purple emperor butterfly further cott quotes thayer s description of countershading and cott s figure 1 of countershaded fish is captioned diagrams illustrating thayer s principle of obliterative shading implicitly also cott follows thayer in his figure 3 larva of eyed hawk moth in both natural e g up side down and unnatural positions in his figure 5 drawing of disruptive effect of stripes and bold markings of woodcock chicks like thayer s figure 81 in his plate 7 with just like thayer s figure 7 a photograph of a white cock against a white background in his figure 18 and front cover drawings of a copperhead snake lying on a bed of leaves with and without its disruptive pattern like thayer s plate 11 and so on cott 1940 37 facing p48 and pp66 67 john endler and peter forbes evolutionary biologist john endler reviewing topic of camouflage in proceedings of royal society b in 2006 cites thayer s 1909 book three times for disruption with conspicuous elements which distract predator s attention and break up body outline making detection of prey difficult for masquerade where prey is detected as distinct from visual background but not recognized as edible for example by resembling a leaf and for countershading where false gradients are common in animal colour patterns leading to misleading appearance of shape even when they do not disrupt body outline thayer is by far earliest source used by endler only other early source he cites for disruption is hugh cott s 1940 adaptive coloration in animals art and science writer peter forbes notes that thayer became obsessed by flattening effect of countershading and that far from being a scientist he was an artist whose idealist fervour edged by deep insecurity led him to regard his findings less as discovery than as revelation describing concealing coloration as a magnum opus forbes writes that by 1909 thayer s prophetic intolerance was in full flood that he was overcompensating for his need for approval of his artwork and that he failed to see that acceptance of ideas in science does not depend on vehemence with which they are expressed in forbes s view thayer was battling for rights of artists over scientists citing thayer it properly belongs to realm of pictorial art in evidence apart from thayer s bizarre flamingos forbes calls thayer s opposition to batesian mimicry extreme for forbes reading thayer s book today is a strange experience he sets out with idea that every single creature is perfectly camouflaged and then tries to bludgeon his readers into agreeing forbes is critical of thayer s rejection of warning coloration quoting thayer s daughter gladys as writing my father s special mission was tasting butterflies thayer apparently wanted to prove that mimicry was wrong explanation as both model and mimic tasted same forbes observes that natural selection did not have to contend with human reactions to taste of butterflies forbes 2009 pp 76 79 david rothenberg philosopher and jazz musician david rothenberg in his 2012 book survival of beautiful on relationship between aesthetics and evolution argues that while thayers book set out principles of camouflage from observation of nature art contributed to military needs of society thayer following charles darwin was swept up in idea that every animal had evolved to perfectly live in its surroundings but was emotionally unable to accept other half of darwin s view of animal coloration rothenberg 2011 pp 132 133 rothenberg then discusses thayers account of wood duck which rothenberg calls our most garishly colored duck he explains that thayers believed they trained as artists had seen what earlier observers had missed rothenberg 2011 p 134
