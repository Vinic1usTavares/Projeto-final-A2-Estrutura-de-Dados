diplomat naval commander linguist and medical author see and nominally survived as pharaoh by her son caesarion as a member of ptolemaic dynasty she was a descendant of its founder ptolemy i soter a macedonian greek general and companion of alexander great writes about ptolemy i soter ptolemaic dynasty of which cleopatra was last representative was founded at end of fourth century bc ptolemies

and alternatively describes them as a macedonian greek speaking dynasty other sources such as and describe ptolemies as greco macedonian or just macedonians who possessed a greek culture as in after death of cleopatra egypt became a province of roman empire marking end of hellenistic period that had lasted since reign of alexander 336 323 bc notes that hellenistic period beginning with reign of alexander great came to an end with death of cleopatra in 30 bc michael grant stresses that hellenistic greeks were viewed by contemporary romans as having declined and diminished in greatness since age of classical greece an attitude that has continued even into works of modern historiography in regards to hellenistic egypt grant argues cleopatra vii looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time was not likely to make same mistake but she and her contemporaries of first century bc had another peculiar problem of their own could hellenistic age which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time still be said to exist at all could any greek age now that romans were dominant power this was a question never far from cleopatra s mind but it is quite certain that she considered greek epoch to be by no means finished and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation her native language was koine greek and she was first ptolemaic ruler to learn egyptian language in 58 bc cleopatra presumably accompanied her father ptolemy xii during his exile to rome after a revolt in egypt a roman client state allowed his daughter berenice iv to claim throne berenice was killed in 55 bc when king returned to egypt with roman military assistance when he died in 51 bc joint reign of cleopatra and her brother ptolemy xiii began a falling out

egypt where ptolemy had him killed while caesar occupied alexandria caesar attempted to reconcile siblings ptolemy s chief adviser potheinos viewed caesar s terms as favoring cleopatra so his forces besieged her and caesar at palace shortly after siege was lifted by reinforcements ptolemy died in 47 bc battle of nile his sister arsinoe iv was eventually exiled to ephesus for her role in carrying out siege caesar declared cleopatra and her brother ptolemy xiv as joint rulers but maintained a private affair with her that produced caesarion cleopatra traveled to rome as a client queen in 46 and

alexandria declared their children alexander helios cleopatra selene ii and ptolemy philadelphus rulers over various erstwhile territories under his triumviral authority this event their marriage and antony s divorce of octavian s sister octavia minor led to final war of roman republic octavian engaged in a war of propaganda forced antony s allies in roman senate to flee rome in 32 bc and declared war on cleopatra after defeating naval fleet of antony and cleopatra at 31 bc battle of actium octavian s forces invaded egypt in 30 bc and defeated antony leading to his suicide when cleopatra learned that octavian planned to bring her to his roman triumphal procession she committed suicide by poisoning popular belief is that she was bitten by an asp cleopatra s legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art roman historiography and latin poetry produced a generally critical view of queen that pervaded later medieval and renaissance literature in visual arts her ancient depictions include roman and ptolemaic coinage roman sculptures busts and paintings as well as reliefs and cameo glass and carvings she was subject of many works in renaissance and baroque art including sculptures paintings poetry theatrical dramas and operas in modern times cleopatra has appeared in applied and fine arts burlesque satire hollywood films and brand images for commercial products

idea of a sole reigning female monarch berenice iii accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson ptolemy xi alexander ii an arrangement made by roman dictator sulla ptolemy xi had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 bc but was lynched soon thereafter in resulting riot over assassination ptolemy xi and perhaps his uncle ptolemy ix or father ptolemy x alexander i willed ptolemaic kingdom to rome as collateral for loans so that romans had legal grounds to take over egypt their client state after assassination of ptolemy xi romans chose instead to divide ptolemaic realm among illegitimate sons of ptolemy ix bestowing cyprus to ptolemy of cyprus and egypt to ptolemy xii auletes early childhood cleopatra vii was born in early 69 bc to ruling ptolemaic

required for her appearances before her egyptian subjects a more practical option for general day to day wear was no nonsense melon hairdo in which her natural hair was drawn back in sections resembling lines on a melon and then pinned up in a bun at back of head a trademark style of arsinoe ii and berenice ii style had fallen from fashion for almost two centuries until revived by cleopatra yet as both traditionalist and innovator she wore her version without her predecessor s fine head veil and whereas they had both been blonde like alexander cleopatra may well have been a redhead judging from portrait of a flame haired woman wearing royal diadem surrounded by egyptian motifs which has been identified as cleopatra in 58 bc romans annexed cyprus and on accusations of piracy drove ptolemy of cyprus ptolemy xii s brother to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to paphos for political background information on roman annexation of cyprus a move pushed for in roman senate by publius clodius pulcher see ptolemy xii remained publicly silent on death of his brother a decision which along with ceding traditional ptolemaic territory to romans damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies ptolemy xii was then exiled from egypt by force traveling first to rhodes then athens and finally villa of triumvir pompey in alban hills near italy for further information see ptolemy xii spent nearly a year there on outskirts of rome ostensibly accompanied by his daughter cleopatra then about 11 expresses little doubt about this deposed in late summer 58 bc and fearing for his life auletes had fled both his palace and his kingdom although he was not completely alone for one greek source reveals he had been accompanied by one of his daughters and since his eldest berenice iv was monarch and youngest little more than a toddler it is generally assumed that this must have been his middle daughter and favourite child eleven year old cleopatra berenice iv sent an embassy to rome to advocate for her rule and oppose reinstatement of her father ptolemy xii but ptolemy had assassins kill leaders of embassy an incident that was covered up by his powerful roman supporters for further information see when roman senate denied ptolemy xii offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to egypt he decided to leave rome in late 57 bc and reside at temple of artemis in ephesus roman financiers of ptolemy xii remained determined to restore him to power pompey persuaded aulus gabinius roman governor of syria to invade egypt and restore ptolemy xii offering him 10 000 talents for proposed mission although it put him at odds with roman law gabinius invaded egypt in spring of 55 bc by way of hasmonean judea where hyrcanus ii had antipater idumaean father of herod great furnish roman led army with supplies as a young cavalry officer mark antony was under gabinius s command he distinguished himself by preventing ptolemy xii from massacring inhabitants of pelousion and for rescuing body of husband of berenice iv after he was killed in battle ensuring him a proper royal burial cleopatra now 14 years of age would have traveled with roman expedition into egypt years later antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time gabinius was put on trial in rome for abusing his authority for which he was acquitted but his second trial for accepting bribes led to his exile from which he was recalled seven years later in 48 bc by caesar crassus replaced him as governor of syria and extended his provincial command to egypt but he was killed by parthians at battle of carrhae in 53 bc ptolemy xii had berenice iv and her wealthy supporters executed seizing their properties he allowed gabinius s largely germanic and gallic roman garrison gabiniani to harass people in streets of alexandria and installed his longtime roman financier rabirius as his chief financial officer for further information on roman financier rabirius as well as gabiniani left in egypt by gabinius see within a year rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to rome after his life was endangered for draining egypt of its resources for further information see despite these problems ptolemy xii created a will designating cleopatra and ptolemy xiii as his joint heirs oversaw major construction projects such as temple of edfu and a temple at dendera and stabilized economy for further information see on 31 may 52 bc cleopatra was made a regent of ptolemy xii as indicated by an inscription in temple of hathor at dendera for further information see rabirius was unable to collect entirety of ptolemy xii s debt by time of latter s death and so it was passed on to his successors cleopatra and ptolemy xiii accession to throne ptolemy xii died sometime before 22 march 51 bc when cleopatra in her first act as queen began her voyage to near thebes to install a new sacred bull worshiped as an intermediary for god montu in ancient egyptian religion for further information see and states that partial solar eclipse of 7march 51 bc marked death of ptolemy xii and accession of cleopatra to throne although she apparently suppressed news of his death alerting roman senate to this fact months later in a message they received on 30 june 51 bc however claims that senate was informed of his death on 1august 51 bc michael grant indicates that ptolemy xii could have been alive as late as may while an ancient egyptian source affirms he was still ruling with cleopatra by 15 july 51 bc although by this point cleopatra most likely hushed up her father s death so that she could consolidate her control of egypt cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking throne these included famine caused by drought and a low level of annual flooding of nile and lawless behavior instigated by gabiniani now unemployed and assimilated roman soldiers left by gabinius to garrison egypt inheriting her father s debts cleopatra also owed roman republic 17 5 million drachmas in 50 bc marcus calpurnius bibulus proconsul of syria sent his two eldest sons to egypt most likely to negotiate with gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in desperate defense of syria against parthians however gabiniani tortured and murdered these two perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in cleopatra s court cleopatra sent gabiniani culprits to bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment but he sent them back to cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication which was prerogative of roman senate bibulus siding with pompey in caesar s civil war failed to prevent caesar from landing a naval fleet in greece which ultimately allowed caesar to reach egypt in pursuit of pompey by 29 august 51 bc official documents started listing cleopatra as sole ruler evidence that she had rejected her brother ptolemy xiii as a co ruler she had probably married him but there is no record of this ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by ptolemy ii and his sister arsinoe ii a long held royal egyptian practice it was loathed by contemporary greeks writes following about sibling marriage of ptolemy ii and arsinoe ii ptolemy keraunos who wanted to become king of macedon killed arsinoe s small children in front of her now queen without a kingdom arsinoe fled to egypt where she was welcomed by her full brother ptolemy ii not content however to spend rest of her life as a guest at ptolemaic court she had ptolemy ii s wife exiled to upper egypt and married him herself around 275 b c though such an incestuous marriage was considered scandalous by greeks it was allowed by egyptian custom for that reason marriage split public opinion into two factions loyal side celebrated couple as a return of divine marriage of zeus and hera whereas other side did not refrain from profuse and obscene criticism one of most sarcastic commentators a poet with a very sharp pen had to flee alexandria unfortunate poet was caught off shore of crete by ptolemaic navy put in an iron basket and drowned this and similar actions seemingly slowed down vicious criticism by reign of cleopatra however it was considered a normal arrangement for ptolemaic rulers despite cleopatra s rejection of him ptolemy xiii still retained powerful allies notably eunuch potheinos his childhood tutor regent and administrator of his properties others involved in cabal against cleopatra included achillas a prominent military commander and theodotus of chios another tutor of ptolemy xiii cleopatra seems to have attempted a short lived alliance with her brother ptolemy xiv but by autumn of 50 bc ptolemy xiii had upper hand

from wars in gaul and crossing rubicon in january of 49 bc caesar had forced pompey and his supporters to flee to greece in perhaps their last joint decree both cleopatra and ptolemy xiii agreed to gnaeus pompeius s request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops including gabiniani a move that helped erase some of debt owed to rome losing fight against her brother cleopatra was then forced to flee alexandria and withdraw to region of thebes by spring of 48 bc cleopatra had traveled to roman syria with her younger sister arsinoe iv to gather an invasion force that would head to egypt she returned with an army but her advance to alexandria was blocked by her brother s forces including some gabiniani mobilized to fight against her so she camped outside pelousion in eastern nile delta in greece caesar and pompey s forces engaged each other at decisive battle of pharsalus on 9august 48 bc leading to destruction of most of pompey s army and his forced flight to tyre lebanon for further

alexandria at head of his army in clear defiance of caesar s demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival cleopatra initially sent emissaries to caesar but upon allegedly hearing that caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women she came to alexandria to see him personally historian cassius dio records that she did so without informing her brother dressing in an

ptolemy xiii as his joint heirs for further information see caesar then attempted to arrange for other two siblings arsinoe iv and ptolemy xiv to rule together over cyprus thus removing potential rival claimants to egyptian throne while also appeasing ptolemaic subjects still bitter over loss of cyprus to romans in 58 bc judging that this agreement favored cleopatra over ptolemy xiii and that latter s army of 20 000 including gabiniani could most likely defeat caesar s army of 4 000 unsupported troops potheinos decided to have achillas lead their forces to alexandria to attack both caesar and cleopatra for further information see after caesar managed to execute potheinos arsinoe iv joined forces with achillas and was declared queen but soon afterward had her tutor ganymedes kill achillas and take his position as commander of her army for further information see ganymedes then tricked caesar into requesting presence of erstwhile captive ptolemy xiii as a negotiator only to have him join army of arsinoe iv resulting siege of palace with caesar and cleopatra trapped together inside lasted into following year of 47 bc for further information see and sometime between january and march of 47 bc caesar s reinforcements arrived including those led by mithridates of pergamon and antipater idumaean for further information see as part of siege of alexandria states that caesar s reinforcements came in january but says that his reinforcements came in march ptolemy xiii and arsinoe iv withdrew their forces to nile where caesar attacked them ptolemy xiii tried to flee by boat but it capsized and he drowned for further information and validation see and ganymedes was perhaps killed in battle theodotus was found years later in asia by marcus junius brutus and executed while arsinoe iv was forcefully paraded in caesar s triumph in rome before being exiled to temple of artemis at ephesus cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in palace most likely because she had been pregnant with caesar s child since september 47 bc caesar s term as consul had expired at end of 48 bc however antony an officer of his helped to secure caesar s appointment as dictator lasting for a year until october 47 bc providing caesar with legal authority to settle dynastic dispute in egypt wary of repeating mistake of cleopatra s sister berenice iv

historian suetonius provided considerable details about voyage including use of thalamegos pleasure barge constructed by ptolemy iv which during his reign measured in length and in height and was complete with dining rooms state rooms holy shrines and promenades along its two decks resembling a floating villa caesar could have had an interest in nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography he was well read in works of eratosthenes and pytheas and perhaps wanted to discover source of river but turned back before reaching ethiopia caesar departed from egypt around april 47 bc allegedly to confront ii of pontus son of mithridates vi of pontus who was stirring up trouble for rome in anatolia it is possible that caesar married to prominent roman woman calpurnia also wanted to avoid being seen together with cleopatra when she bore him their son he left three legions in egypt later increased to four under command of freedman to secure cleopatra s tenuous position but also perhaps to keep her activities in check caesarion cleopatra s alleged child with caesar was born 23 june 47 bc and was originally named pharaoh caesar as preserved on a stele at serapeum in memphis for further information and validation see and perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with calpurnia caesar remained publicly silent about caesarion but perhaps accepted his parentage in private writes following about caesar and his parentage of caesarion matter of parentage became so tangled in propaganda war between antonius and octavian in late 30s b c it was essential for one side to prove and other to reject caesar s role that it is impossible today to determine caesar s actual response extant information is almost contradictory it was said that caesar denied parentage in his will but acknowledged it privately and allowed use of name caesarion caesar s associate c even wrote a pamphlet proving that caesarion was not caesar s child and c helvius cinna poet who was killed by rioters after antonius s funeral oration was prepared in 44 b c to introduce legislation to allow caesar to marry as many wives as he wished for purpose of having children although much of this talk

established his headquarters at tarsos in anatolia and summoned cleopatra there in several letters which she rebuffed until antony s envoy quintus dellius convinced her to come meeting allowed cleopatra to clear up misconception that she had supported cassius during civil war and address territorial exchanges in levant but antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal romantic

whom priests of temple of artemis at ephesus had associated with antony prior to this meeting with cleopatra according to a cult surrounding isis had been spreading across region for hundreds of years

cleopatra sailed up river to tarsos in thalamegos hosting antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board ship cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of cassius

given birth to twins a boy named alexander helios and a girl named cleopatra selene ii both of whom antony acknowledged as his children helios sun and selene moon were symbolic of a new era of

antony s brother lucius antonius were eventually besieged by octavian at perusia modern perugia italy and then exiled from italy after which fulvia died at sicyon in greece while attempting to reach antony her sudden death led to a reconciliation of octavian and antony at brundisium in italy in september 40 bc although agreement struck at brundisium solidified antony s control of roman republic s territories east of ionian sea it also stipulated that he concede italia hispania and gaul and marry octavian s sister octavia younger a potential rival for cleopatra in december 40 bc cleopatra

of long established hasmonean dynasty latter had imprisoned herod s brother and fellow tetrarch who was executed while herod was fleeing toward cleopatra s court cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment but herod declined and traveled to rome where triumvirs octavian and antony named him king of judea this act put herod on a collision course with cleopatra who would desire to reclaim former ptolemaic territories that comprised his new herodian kingdom relations between antony and cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married octavia but also sired her two children antonia elder in 39 bc and antonia minor in 36 bc and moved his headquarters to athens however cleopatra s position in egypt was secure her rival herod was occupied with civil war in judea that required heavy roman military assistance but received none from cleopatra since authority of antony and octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1january 37 bc octavia arranged for a meeting at tarentum where triumvirate was officially extended to 33 bc with two legions granted by octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by octavia antony traveled to antioch where he made preparations for war against parthians antony summoned cleopatra to antioch to discuss pressing issues such as herod s kingdom and financial support for his parthian campaign cleopatra brought her now three year old twins to antioch where antony saw them for first time and where they probably first received their surnames helios and selene as part of antony and cleopatra s ambitious plans for future in order to stabilize east antony not only enlarged cleopatra s domain he also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him yet would ultimately outlast him according to these client state rulers installed by antony included herod amyntas of galatia polemon i of pontus and archelaus of cappadocia in this arrangement cleopatra gained significant former ptolemaic territories in levant including nearly all of phoenicia lebanon minus tyre and sidon which remained in roman hands she also received ptolemais modern acre israel a city that was established by ptolemy ii given her ancestral relations with seleucids she was granted region of syria along upper orontes river she was even given region surrounding jericho in palestine but she leased this territory back to herod at expense of nabataean king malichus i a cousin of herod cleopatra was also given a portion of nabataean kingdom around gulf of aqaba on red sea including modern aqaba jordan to west cleopatra was handed cyrene along libyan coast as well as and in roman crete although still administered by roman officials these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare inauguration of a new era by double dating her coinage in 36 bc thumb roman aureus bearing portraits of mark antony left and octavian right issued in 41 bc to celebrate establishment of second triumvirate by octavian antony and marcus aemilius lepidus in 43 bc antony s enlargement of ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled roman territory was exploited by his rival octavian who tapped into public sentiment in rome against empowerment of a foreign queen at expense of their republic octavian fostering narrative that antony was neglecting his virtuous roman wife octavia granted both her and livia his own wife extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity some 50 years before cornelia africana daughter of scipio africanus had been first living roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her she was now followed by octavia and livia whose statues were most likely erected in forum of caesar to rival that of cleopatra s erected by caesar in 36 bc cleopatra accompanied antony to euphrates in his journey toward invading parthian empire she then returned to egypt perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy by summer of 36 bc she had given birth to ptolemy philadelphus her second son with antony antony s parthian campaign in 36 bc turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons in particular betrayal of artavasdes ii of armenia who defected to parthian side after losing some 30 000 men more than crassus at carrhae an indignity he had hoped to avenge antony finally arrived at near berytus modern beirut lebanon in december engaged in heavy drinking before cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops antony desired to avoid risks involved in returning to rome and so he traveled with cleopatra back to alexandria to see his newborn son donations of alexandria thumb a denarius minted in 32 bc on obverse is a portrait of cleopatra with latin inscription cleopatra e reginae regvm regvm and on reverse a portrait of mark antony with inscription reading antoni vs armenia as antony prepared for another parthian expedition in 35 bc this time aimed at their ally armenia octavia traveled to athens with 2 000 troops in alleged support of antony but most likely in a scheme devised by octavian to embarrass him for his military losses claims that octavia minor provided antony with 1 200 troops not 2 000 as stated in and antony received these troops but told octavia not to stray east of athens as he and cleopatra traveled together to antioch only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon military campaign and head back to alexandria when octavia returned to rome octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by antony although she refused to leave antony s household octavian s confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in west including sextus pompeius and even lepidus third member of triumvirate who was placed under house arrest after revolting against octavian in sicily dellius was sent as antony s envoy to artavasdes ii in 34 bc to negotiate a potential marriage alliance that would wed armenian king s daughter to alexander helios son of antony and cleopatra when this was declined antony marched his army into armenia defeated their forces and captured king and armenian royal family antony then held a military parade in alexandria as an imitation of a roman triumph dressed as dionysus and riding into city on a chariot to present royal prisoners to cleopatra who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais news of this event was heavily criticized in rome as a perversion of time honored roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an egyptian queen thumb left a papyrus document dated february 33 bc granting tax exemptions to a person in egypt and containing signature of cleopatra written by an official but with make it happen or so be it added in greek likely by queen s own hand in an event held at gymnasium soon after triumph cleopatra dressed as isis and declared that she was queen of kings with her son caesarion king of kings while alexander helios was declared king of armenia media and parthia and two year old ptolemy philadelphos was declared king of syria and cilicia cleopatra selene ii was bestowed with crete and cyrene antony and cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony says that it is unclear if antony and cleopatra were ever truly married says that marriage publicly sealed antony s alliance with cleopatra and in defiance of octavian he would divorce octavia in 32 bc coins of antony and cleopatra depict them in typical manner of a hellenistic royal couple as explained by antony sent a report to rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims now known as donations of alexandria octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes but two consuls both supporters of antony had it censored from public view in late 34 bc antony and octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years writes that octavian waged a propaganda war against antony and cleopatra stressing cleopatra s status as a woman and a foreigner who wished to share in roman power antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in italy while octavian accused antony of unlawfully detaining king of armenia marrying cleopatra despite still being married to his sister octavia and wrongfully claiming caesarion as heir of caesar instead of octavian litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped popular perceptions about cleopatra from augustan period literature through to various media in modern times cleopatra was said to have brainwashed mark antony with witchcraft and sorcery and was as dangerous as homer s helen of troy in destroying civilization horace s satires preserved an account that cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth 2 5 million drachmas in vinegar just to win a dinner party bet accusation that antony had stolen books from library of pergamum to restock library of alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by gaius calvisius a papyrus document dated to february 33 bc later used to wrap a mummy contains signature of cleopatra probably written by an official authorized to sign for her it concerns certain tax exemptions in egypt granted to either quintus or publius canidius crassus

land forces at actium a subscript in a different handwriting at bottom of papyrus reads make it happen or so be it notes that t he fragmentary texts of ancient greek papyri do not often make their way into modern public arena but this one has and with fascinating results while remaining almost entirely unacknowledged is remarkable fact that cleopatra s one word subscription contains a blatant spelling error with a superfluous iota adscript this spelling error has not been noted by popular media however being simply transliterated including without comment superfluous iota adscript p 208 even in academic sources misspelling was largely unacknowledged or quietly corrected pp 206 208 210 although described as normal orthography in contrast with correct orthography by peter van p 208 spelling error is much rarer and more puzzling than sort one would expect from greek papyri from egypt p 210 so rare in fact that it occurs only twice in 70 000 greek papyri between 3rd century bc and 8th century ad in navigator s database this is especially so when considering it was added to a word with no etymological or morphological reason for having an iota adscript p 210 and was written by well educated native greek speaking queen of egypt cleopatra vii p 208 this is likely autograph of queen as it was ptolemaic practice to documents to avoid forgery battle of actium thumb upright 0 75 a reconstructed statue of augustus as a younger octavian dated in a speech to roman senate on first day of his consulship on 1january 33 bc octavian accused antony of attempting to subvert roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his oriental queen before antony and octavian s joint imperium expired on 31 december 33 bc antony declared caesarion as true heir of caesar in an attempt to undermine octavian on 1january 32 bc antonian loyalists gaius sosius and gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus were elected as consuls on 1february 32 bc sosius gave a fiery speech condemning octavian now a private citizen without public office and introduced pieces of legislation against him during next senatorial session octavian entered senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against consuls intimidated by this act consuls and over 200 senators still in support of antony fled rome next day to join side of antony antony and cleopatra traveled together to ephesus in 32 bc where she provided him with 200 of 800 naval ships he was able to acquire ahenobarbus wary of having octavian s propaganda confirmed to public attempted to persuade antony to have cleopatra excluded from campaign against octavian publius canidius crassus made counterargument that cleopatra was funding war effort and was a competent monarch cleopatra refused antony s requests that she return to egypt judging that by blocking octavian in greece she could more easily defend egypt cleopatra s insistence that she be involved in battle for greece led to defections of prominent romans such as ahenobarbus and lucius munatius plancus during spring of 32 bc antony and cleopatra traveled to athens where she persuaded antony to send octavia an official declaration of divorce this encouraged plancus to advise octavian that he should seize antony s will invested with vestal virgins although a violation of sacred and legal rights octavian forcefully acquired document from temple of vesta and it became a useful tool in propaganda war against antony and cleopatra octavian highlighted parts of will such as caesarion being named heir to caesar that donations of alexandria were legal that antony should be buried alongside cleopatra in egypt instead of rome and that alexandria would be made new capital of roman republic in a show of loyalty to rome octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at campus martius octavian s legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 bc with antony s will made public octavian had his casus belli and rome declared war on cleopatra not antony as explained by politically octavian had to walk a fine line as he prepared to engage in open hostilities with antony he was careful to minimize associations with civil war as roman people had already suffered through many years of civil conflict and octavian could risk losing support if he declared war on a fellow citizen legal argument for war was based less on cleopatra s territorial acquisitions with former roman territories ruled by her children with antony and more on fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that antony s triumviral authority had expired antony and cleopatra had a larger fleet than octavian but crews of antony and cleopatra s navy were not all well trained some of them perhaps from merchant vessels whereas octavian had a fully professional force antony wanted to cross adriatic sea and blockade octavian at either tarentum or brundisium but cleopatra concerned primarily with defending egypt overrode decision to attack italy directly antony and cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at in greece and by spring of 31 bc they had moved to actium on southern side of ambracian gulf cleopatra and antony had support of various allied kings but cleopatra had already been in conflict with herod and an earthquake in judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from campaign they also lost support of malichus i which would prove to have strategic consequences antony and cleopatra lost several skirmishes against octavian around actium during summer of 31 bc while defections to octavian s camp continued including antony s long time companion dellius and allied kings amyntas of galatia and of paphlagonia while some in antony s camp suggested abandoning naval conflict to retreat inland cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation to keep octavian s fleet away from egypt on 2 september 31 bc naval forces of octavian led by marcus vipsanius agrippa met those of antony and cleopatra at battle of actium cleopatra aboard her flagship commanded 60 ships at mouth of ambracian gulf at rear of fleet in what was likely a move by antony s officers to marginalize her during battle antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from enemy which cleopatra ever concerned about defending egypt used to swiftly move through area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to peloponnese burstein writes that partisan roman writers would later accuse cleopatra of cowardly deserting antony but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible antony followed cleopatra and boarded her ship identified by its distinctive purple sails as two escaped battle and headed for tainaron antony reportedly avoided cleopatra during this three day voyage until her ladies in waiting at tainaron urged him to speak with her battle of actium raged on without cleopatra and antony until morning of 3september and was followed by massive defections of officers troops and allied kings to octavian s side downfall and death thumb a roman painting from house of giuseppe ii in pompeii early 1st century ad most likely depicting cleopatra wearing her royal diadem consuming poison in an act of suicide while her son caesarion also wearing a royal diadem stands behind her while octavian occupied athens antony and cleopatra landed at paraitonion in egypt couple then went their separate ways antony to cyrene to raise more troops and cleopatra sailing into harbor at alexandria in a misleading attempt to portray activities in greece as a victory it is also uncertain if at this time she actually executed artavasdes ii and sent his head to his rival artavasdes i of media atropatene in an attempt to strike an alliance with him lucius pinarius mark antony s appointed governor of cyrene received word that octavian had won battle of actium before antony s messengers could arrive at his court pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to octavian s side surrendering to him four legions under his command that antony desired to obtain antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers in alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on island of pharos that he nicknamed after philosopher timon of athens who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy herod who had personally advised antony after battle of actium that he should betray cleopatra traveled to rhodes to meet octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to antony octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty so he allowed him to maintain his position in judea further isolating antony and cleopatra cleopatra perhaps started to view antony as a liability by late summer of 31 bc when she prepared to leave egypt to her son caesarion cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him taking her fleet from mediterranean into red sea and then setting sail to a foreign port perhaps in india where she could spend time recuperating however these plans were ultimately abandoned when malichus i as advised by octavian s governor of syria quintus didius managed to burn cleopatra s fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with herod that cleopatra had largely initiated cleopatra had no other option but to stay in egypt and negotiate with octavian although most likely later pro octavian propaganda it was reported that at this time cleopatra started testing strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants thumb left death of cleopatra 1658 by guido cleopatra had caesarion enter into ranks of ephebi which along with reliefs on a stele from dated 21 september 31 bc demonstrated that cleopatra was now grooming her son to become sole ruler of egypt in a show of solidarity antony also had marcus antonius his son with fulvia enter ephebi at same time separate messages and envoys from antony and cleopatra were then sent to octavian still stationed at rhodes although octavian seems to have replied only to cleopatra cleopatra requested that her children should inherit egypt and that antony should be allowed to live in exile in egypt offering octavian money in future and immediately sending him lavish gifts octavian sent his diplomat thyrsos to cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction thyrsos advised her to kill antony so that her life would be spared but when antony suspected foul intent he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to octavian without a deal after lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results octavian set out to invade egypt in spring of 30 bc stopping at ptolemais in phoenicia where his new ally herod provided his army with fresh supplies octavian moved south and swiftly took pelousion while cornelius gallus marching eastward from cyrene defeated antony s forces near paraitonion octavian advanced quickly to alexandria but antony returned and won a small victory over octavian s tired troops outside city s hippodrome however on 1august 30 bc antony s naval fleet surrendered to octavian followed by his cavalry cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants sending a message to antony that she had committed suicide in despair antony responded to this by stabbing himself in stomach and taking his own life at age 53 according to plutarch he was still dying when brought to cleopatra at her tomb telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust octavian s companion gaius proculeius over anyone else in his entourage it was proculeius however who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained queen denying her ability to burn herself with her treasures cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury antony within her tomb before she was escorted to palace thumb death of cleopatra 1796 1797 by jean baptiste regnault octavian entered alexandria occupied palace and seized cleopatra s three youngest children when she met with octavian she told him bluntly that i will not be led in a triumph according to livy a rare recording of her exact words octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom when a spy informed her that octavian planned to move her and her children to rome in three days she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a roman triumph like her sister arsinoe iv it is unclear if cleopatra s suicide in august 30 bc at age 39 took place within palace or her tomb it is said she was accompanied by her servants eiras and charmion who also took their own lives octavian was said to be angered by this outcome but had her buried in royal fashion next to antony in her tomb cleopatra s physician olympos did not explain her cause of death although popular belief is that she allowed an asp or egyptian cobra to bite and poison her plutarch relates this tale but then suggests an implement spine cheese grater was used to introduce toxin by scratching while dio says that she injected poison with a needle and strabo argued for an ointment of some kind for translated accounts of both plutarch and dio writes that implement used to puncture cleopatra s skin was a hairpin no venomous snake was found with her body but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle cleopatra decided in her last moments to send caesarion away to upper egypt perhaps with plans to flee to kushite nubia ethiopia or india caesarion now ptolemy xv would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on orders of octavian on 29 august 30 bc after returning to alexandria under false pretense that octavian would allow him to be king and explain nominal short lived reign of caesarion as lasting 18 days in august 30 bc however duane w roller relaying theodore cressy skeat affirms that caesarion s reign was essentially a fiction created by egyptian to close gap between cleopatra s death and official roman control of egypt under new pharaoh octavian citing for instance stromata by clement of alexandria plutarch translated by wrote in vague terms that octavian had caesarion killed later after cleopatra s death octavian was convinced by advice of philosopher arius didymus that there was room for only one caesar in world translating plutarch quotes arius didymus as saying to octavian that it is not good to have too many caesars which was apparently enough to convince octavian to have caesarion killed with fall of ptolemaic kingdom roman province of egypt was established contrary to regular roman provinces egypt was established by octavian as territory under his personal control barring roman senate from intervening in any of its affairs and appointing his own equestrian governors of egypt first of whom was gallus for further information see and marking end of hellenistic period in january 27 bc octavian was renamed augustus revered and amassed constitutional powers that established him as first roman emperor inaugurating

diadem and on reverse an inscription reading with an eagle standing on a thunderbolt following tradition of macedonian rulers cleopatra ruled egypt and other territories such as cyprus as an absolute monarch serving as sole lawgiver of her kingdom she was chief religious authority in her realm presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to deities of both egyptian and greek polytheistic faiths she oversaw construction of various temples to egyptian and greek gods a synagogue for jews in egypt and even built caesareum of alexandria dedicated to cult worship of her patron and lover julius caesar cleopatra was directly involved in administrative affairs of her domain tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to starving populace during a drought at beginning of her reign although command economy that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality government attempted to impose price controls tariffs and state monopolies for certain goods fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons apparent financial troubles led cleopatra to debase her coinage which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant ptolemaic predecessors legacy children and successors after her suicide cleopatra s three surviving children cleopatra selene ii alexander helios and ptolemy philadelphos were sent to rome with octavian s sister octavia younger a former wife of their father as their guardian cleopatra selene ii and alexander helios were present in roman triumph of octavian in 29 bc fates of alexander helios and ptolemy philadelphus are unknown after this point octavia arranged betrothal of cleopatra selene ii to juba ii son of juba i whose north african kingdom of numidia had been turned into a roman province in 46 bc by julius caesar due to juba i s support of pompey emperor augustus installed juba ii and cleopatra selene ii after their wedding in 25 bc as new rulers of mauretania where they transformed old carthaginian city of iol into their new capital renamed caesarea mauretaniae modern cherchell algeria cleopatra selene ii imported many important scholars artists and advisers from her mother s royal court in alexandria to serve her in caesarea now permeated in hellenistic greek culture she also named her son ptolemy of mauretania in honor of their ptolemaic dynastic heritage cleopatra selene ii died around 5 bc and when juba ii died in 23 24 ad he was succeeded by his son ptolemy however ptolemy was eventually executed by roman emperor caligula in 40 ad perhaps under pretense that ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized regalia reserved for roman emperor ptolemy of mauretania was last known monarch of ptolemaic dynasty although queen zenobia of short lived palmyrene empire during crisis of third century would claim descent from cleopatra a cult dedicated to cleopatra still existed as late as 373 ad when petesenufe an egyptian scribe of book of isis explained that he overlaid figure of cleopatra with gold roman literature and historiography thumb upright 1 15 cleopatra testing poisons on condemned prisoners 1887 by alexandre although almost 50 ancient works of roman historiography mention cleopatra these often include only terse accounts of battle of actium her suicide and augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies despite not being a biography of cleopatra life of antonius written by plutarch in 1st century ad provides most thorough surviving account of cleopatra s life plutarch lived a century after cleopatra but relied on primary sources such as philotas of amphissa who had access to ptolemaic royal palace cleopatra s personal physician named olympos and quintus dellius a close confidant of mark antony and cleopatra plutarch s work included both augustan view of cleopatra which became canonical for his period as well as sources outside of this tradition such as eyewitness reports jewish roman historian josephus writing in 1st century ad provides valuable information on life of cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with herod great however this work relies largely on herod s memoirs and biased account of nicolaus of damascus tutor of cleopatra s children in alexandria before he moved to judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at herod s court roman history published by official and historian cassius dio in early 3rd century ad while failing to fully comprehend complexities of late hellenistic world nevertheless provides a continuous history of era of cleopatra s reign thumb upright 0 75 a restructured marble roman statue of cleopatra wearing a diadem and melon hairstyle similar to coinage portraits found along via cassia near rome and now located in museo pio cleopatra is barely mentioned in memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under caesar offers speculation that author of written in latin prose sometime between 46 43 bc was a certain aulus hirtius a military officer serving under caesar writings of cicero who knew her personally provide an unflattering portrait of cleopatra augustan period authors virgil horace propertius and ovid perpetuated negative views of cleopatra approved by ruling roman regime although virgil established idea of cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic melodrama writes that virgil in his aeneid described battle of actium against cleopatra as a clash of civilizations in which octavian and roman gods preserved italy from conquest by cleopatra and barbaric animal headed gods of egypt horace also viewed cleopatra s suicide as a positive choice an idea that found acceptance by late middle ages with geoffrey chaucer historians strabo velleius valerius maximus pliny elder and appian while not offering accounts as full as plutarch josephus or dio provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records for further information and extracts of strabo s account of cleopatra in his geographica see inscriptions on contemporary ptolemaic coinage and some egyptian papyrus documents demonstrate cleopatra s point of view but this material is very limited in comparison to roman literary works as explained by this source material from egypt dated to reign of cleopatra includes about 50 papyri documents in ancient greek mostly from city of and only a few papyri from faiyum written in demotic egyptian language overall this is a much smaller body of surviving native texts than those of any other period of ptolemaic egypt fragmentary commissioned by cleopatra s son in law juba ii provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported cleopatra s perspective cleopatra s gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient medieval and even modern historiography about ancient egypt and greco roman world for instance historian ronald syme asserted that she was of little importance to caesar and that propaganda of octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree although common view of cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress she had only two known sexual partners caesar and antony two most prominent romans of time period who were most likely to ensure survival of her dynasty plutarch described cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty for description of cleopatra by plutarch who claimed that her beauty was not completely incomparable but that she had a captivating and stimulating personality see cultural depictions depictions in ancient art statues cleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art in egyptian as well as hellenistic greek and roman styles surviving works include statues busts reliefs and minted coins as well as ancient carved cameos such as one depicting cleopatra and antony in hellenistic style now in altes museum berlin contemporary images of cleopatra were produced both in and outside of ptolemaic egypt for instance a large gilded bronze statue of cleopatra once existed inside temple of venus genetrix in rome first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a roman temple it was erected there by caesar and remained in temple at least until 3rd century ad its preservation perhaps owing to caesar s patronage although augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in alexandria depicting cleopatra in regards to surviving roman statuary a life sized roman style statue of cleopatra was found near rome along and is now housed in part of vatican museums plutarch in his life of antonius claimed that public statues of antony were torn down by augustus but those of cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend paying emperor 2 000 talents to dissuade him from destroying hers since 1950s scholars have debated whether or not esquiline venus discovered in 1874 on esquiline hill in rome and housed in of capitoline museums is a depiction of cleopatra based on statue s hairstyle and facial features apparent royal diadem worn over head and uraeus egyptian cobra wrapped around base detractors of this theory argue that face in this statue is thinner than face on berlin portrait and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as naked goddess venus or greek aphrodite however she was depicted in an egyptian statue as goddess isis while some of her coinage depicts her as venus aphrodite she also dressed as aphrodite when meeting antony at tarsos esquiline venus is generally thought to be a mid 1st century ad roman copy of a 1st century bc greek original

surviving coinage of cleopatra s reign include specimens from every regnal year from 51 to 30 bc cleopatra only ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf almost certainly inspired her partner caesar to become first living roman to present his portrait on his own coins writes following cleopatra was only female ptolemy to issue coins on her own behalf some showing her as venus aphrodite caesar now followed her example and taking same bold step became first living roman to appear on coins his rather haggard profile accompanied by title parens patriae father of fatherland cleopatra was also first foreign queen to have her image appear on roman currency coins dated to period of her marriage to antony which also bear his image portray queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband these similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented mutually observed harmony of a royal couple her strong almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from smoother softer and perhaps idealized sculpted images of her in either egyptian or hellenistic styles her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father ptolemy xii auletes and perhaps also to those of her ptolemaic ancestor arsinoe ii 316 260 bc and even depictions of earlier queens such as hatshepsut and nefertiti it is likely due to political expediency that antony s visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her macedonian greek ancestors who founded ptolemaic dynasty to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of royal house inscriptions on coins are written in greek but also in nominative case of roman coins rather than genitive case of greek coins in addition to having letters placed in a circular fashion along edges of coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for greek ones these facets of their coinage represent synthesis of roman and hellenistic culture and perhaps also a statement to their subjects however ambiguous to modern scholars about superiority of either antony or cleopatra over other diana kleiner argues that cleopatra in one of her coins minted with dual image of her husband antony made herself more masculine looking than other portraits and more like an acceptable roman client queen than a hellenistic ruler cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with antony such as coins struck at ashkelon mint during her brief period of exile to syria and levant which joann fletcher explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male ptolemaic ruler various coins such as a silver tetradrachm minted sometime after cleopatra s marriage with antony in 37 bc depict her wearing a royal diadem and a melon hairstyle combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads for further information see this hairstyle with hair braided back into a bun is same as that worn by her ptolemaic ancestors arsinoe ii and berenice ii in their own coinage after her visit to rome in 46 44 bc it became fashionable for roman women to adopt it as one of their hairstyles but it was abandoned for a more modest austere look during conservative rule of augustus greco roman busts and heads of surviving greco roman style busts and heads of cleopatra there is academic disagreement on whether following portraits are considered heads or busts for instance exclusively uses former while

museums is damaged with a missing nose for further information and validation see and both berlin cleopatra and vatican cleopatra have royal diadems similar facial features and perhaps once resembled face of her bronze statue housed in temple of venus genetrix for further information and validation see and both heads are dated to mid 1st century bc and were found in roman villas along via appia in italy vatican cleopatra having been unearthed in villa of quintilii for further information see and francisco pina polo writes that cleopatra s coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that sculpted portrait of berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun a diadem and a hooked nose a third sculpted portrait of cleopatra accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at archaeological museum of cherchell algeria this portrait features royal diadem and similar facial features as berlin and vatican heads but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict cleopatra selene ii daughter of cleopatra provides a detailed discussion about this bust and its ambiguities noting that it could represent cleopatra but that it is more likely her daughter cleopatra selene ii argues in favor of its depicting cleopatra rather than her daughter while mentions only cleopatra as a possible likeness observes that it could be either cleopatra or cleopatra selene ii while arguing same ambiguity applies to other sculpted head from featuring a veil in regards to latter head indicates it as a possible portrait of cleopatra not selene ii from early 1st century ad while also arguing that its masculine features earrings and apparent toga veil being a component of it could likely mean it was intended to depict a numidian nobleman disagrees about veiled head arguing that it was commissioned by cleopatra selene ii at iol caesarea mauretaniae and was meant to depict her mother cleopatra a possible parian marble sculpture of cleopatra wearing a vulture headdress in egyptian style is located at capitoline museums discovered near a sanctuary of isis in rome and dated to 1st century bc it is either roman or hellenistic egyptian in origin other possible sculpted depictions of cleopatra include one in british museum london made of limestone which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to rome woman in this portrait has facial features similar to others including pronounced aquiline nose but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle however british museum head once belonging to a full statue could potentially represent cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by cleopatra to discard use of royal insignia i e diadem to make herself more appealing to citizens of republican rome duane w roller speculates that british museum head along with those in egyptian museum cairo capitoline museums and in private collection of maurice nahmen while having similar facial features and hairstyles as berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem most likely represent members of royal court or even roman women imitating cleopatra s popular hairstyle paintings in house of marcus fabius rufus at pompeii italy a mid 1st century bc second style wall painting of goddess venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of cleopatra as venus genetrix with her son caesarion commission of painting most likely coincides with erection of temple of venus genetrix in forum of caesar in september 46 bc where caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting cleopatra this statue likely formed basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at pompeii woman in painting wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to vatican cleopatra which bears possible marks on marble of its left cheek where a cupid s arm may have been torn off observation that left cheek of vatican cleopatra once had a cupid s hand that was broken off was first suggested by ludwig curtius in 1933 kleiner concurs with this assessment see as well as and while has suggested lump on top of this marble head perhaps contained a broken off uraeus offered explanation that it once held a sculpted representation of a jewel room with painting was walled off by its owner perhaps in reaction to execution of caesarion in 30 bc by order of octavian when public depictions of cleopatra s son would have been unfavorable with new roman regime behind her golden diadem crowned with a red jewel is a translucent veil with that suggest melon hairstyle favored by queen wrote that damaged lump along hairline and diadem of vatican cleopatra likely contained a sculpted representation of a jewel which directly compares to painted red jewel in diadem worn by venus most likely cleopatra in fresco from pompeii her ivory white skin round face long aquiline nose and large round eyes were features common in both roman and ptolemaic depictions of deities roller affirms that there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of cleopatra and caesarion before doors of temple of venus in forum and as such it becomes only extant contemporary painting of queen another painting from pompeii dated to early 1st century ad and located in house of giuseppe ii contains a possible depiction of cleopatra with her son caesarion both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide for further information about painting in house of giuseppe ii joseph ii at pompeii and possible identification of cleopatra as one of figures see painting was originally thought to depict carthaginian noblewoman sophonisba who toward end of second punic war 218 201 bc drank poison and committed suicide at behest of her lover masinissa king of numidia arguments in favor of it depicting cleopatra include strong connection of her house with that of numidian royal family masinissa and ptolemy viii physcon having been associates and cleopatra s own daughter marrying numidian prince juba ii sophonisba was also a more obscure figure when painting was made while cleopatra s suicide was far more famous an asp is absent from painting but many romans held view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite a set of double doors on rear wall of painting positioned very high above people in it suggests described layout of cleopatra s tomb in alexandria a male servant holds mouth of an artificial egyptian crocodile possibly an elaborate tray handle while another man standing by is dressed as a roman in 1818 a now lost encaustic painting was discovered in temple of serapis at hadrian s villa near tivoli lazio italy that depicted cleopatra committing suicide with an asp biting her bare chest a chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that medium for painting was composed of one third wax and two thirds resin thickness of painting over cleopatra s bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to paintings of fayum mummy portraits a steel engraving published by john sartain in 1885 depicting painting as described in archaeological report shows cleopatra wearing authentic clothing and jewelry of egypt in late hellenistic period as well as radiant crown of ptolemaic rulers as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns after cleopatra s suicide octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in rome portrait painting of cleopatra s death was perhaps among great number of artworks and treasures taken from rome by emperor hadrian to decorate his private villa where it was found in an egyptian temple in frances pratt and becca fizel rejected idea proposed by some scholars in 19th and early 20th centuries that painting was perhaps done by an artist of italian renaissance pratt and fizel highlighted classical style of painting as preserved in textual descriptions and steel engraving they argued that it was unlikely for a renaissance period painter to have created works with encaustic materials conducted thorough research into hellenistic period egyptian clothing and jewelry as depicted in painting and then precariously placed it in ruins of egyptian temple at hadrian s villa a roman panel painting from herculaneum italy dated to 1st century ad possibly depicts cleopatra in it she wears a royal diadem red or reddish brown hair pulled back into a bun describe her hair as reddish brown while describes her as a flame haired redhead and in likewise describes her as a red haired woman pearl studded hairpins and earrings with ball shaped pendants white skin of her face and neck set against a stark black background her hair and facial features are similar to those in sculpted berlin and vatican portraits as well as her coinage a highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in house of orchard at pompeii features egyptian style imagery such as a greek style sphinx and may have been created by same artist portland vase thumb a possible depiction of mark antony being lured by cleopatra straddling a serpent while anton antony s alleged ancestor looks on and eros flies above portland vase a roman cameo glass vase dated to augustan period and now in british museum includes a possible depiction of cleopatra with antony in this interpretation cleopatra can be seen grasping antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent i e asp rises between her legs eros floats above and anton alleged ancestor of antonian family looks on in despair as his descendant antony is led to his doom other side of vase perhaps contains a scene of octavia abandoned by her husband antony but watched over by her brother emperor augustus vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 bc when antony sent his wife octavia back to italy and stayed with cleopatra in alexandria native egyptian art thumb right upright 0 75 cleopatra and her son caesarion at temple of dendera bust of cleopatra in royal ontario museum represents a bust of cleopatra in egyptian style

ptolemaic sculpted works of art dendera temple complex near dendera egypt contains egyptian style carved relief images along exterior walls of temple of hathor depicting cleopatra and her young son caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to gods augustus had his name inscribed there following death of cleopatra a large ptolemaic black basalt statue measuring in height now in hermitage museum saint petersburg is thought to represent arsinoe ii wife of ptolemy ii but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant cleopatra due to three adorning her headdress an increase from two used by arsinoe ii to symbolize her rule over lower and upper egypt woman in basalt statue also holds a divided double cornucopia which can be seen on coins of both arsinoe ii and cleopatra in his 2006 contends that this basalt statue like other idealized egyptian portraits of queen does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to knowledge of her appearance comes to a similar conclusion about native egyptian depictions of cleopatra apart from certain temple carvings which are anyway in a highly stylised pharaonic style and give little clue to cleopatra s real appearance only certain representations of cleopatra are those on coins marble head in vatican is one of three sculptures generally though not universally accepted by scholars to be depictions of cleopatra adrian goldsworthy writes that despite these representations in traditional egyptian style cleopatra would have dressed as a native only perhaps for certain rites and instead would usually dress as a greek monarch which would include greek headband seen in her greco roman busts medieval and early modern reception thumb upright 1 15 banquet of cleopatra 1744 by giovanni battista tiepolo now in national gallery of victoria melbourne in modern times cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to renaissance as well as paintings and films this material largely surpasses scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on general public s view of cleopatra than latter 14th century english poet geoffrey chaucer in legend of good women contextualized cleopatra for christian world of middle ages his depiction of cleopatra and antony her shining knight engaged in courtly love has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire however chaucer highlighted cleopatra s relationships with only two men as hardly life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to negative depiction of cleopatra in and latin works by 14th century italian poet giovanni boccaccio renaissance humanist in his 1504 libretto delle donne was first italian to defend reputation of cleopatra and criticize perceived moralizing and misogyny in boccaccio s works works of islamic historiography written in arabic covered reign of cleopatra such as 10th century meadows of gold by al masudi although his work erroneously claimed that octavian died soon after cleopatra s suicide cleopatra appeared in miniatures for illuminated manuscripts such as a depiction of her and antony lying in a gothic style tomb by boucicaut master in 1409 in visual arts sculpted depiction of cleopatra as a free standing nude figure committing suicide began with 16th century sculptors bartolommeo bandinelli and alessandro vittoria early prints depicting cleopatra include designs by renaissance artists raphael and michelangelo as well as 15th century woodcuts in illustrated editions of boccaccio s works in performing arts death of elizabeth i of england in 1603 and german publication in 1606 of alleged letters of cleopatra inspired samuel daniel to alter and republish his 1594 play cleopatra in 1607 he was followed by william shakespeare whose antony and cleopatra largely based on plutarch was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of cleopatra in stark contrast to england s own virgin queen cleopatra was also featured in operas such as george frideric handel s

lever art gallery port sunlight england alt bare breasted woman on a boat surrounded by naked and semi naked people in victorian britain cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products including oil lamps lithographs postcards and cigarettes fictional novels such as h rider haggard s cleopatra 1889 and theophile gautier s one of cleopatra s nights 1838 depicted queen as a sensual and mystic easterner while egyptologist georg ebers s cleopatra 1894 was more grounded in historical accuracy french dramatist victorien sardou and irish playwright george bernard shaw produced plays about cleopatra while burlesque shows such as f c burnand s antony and cleopatra offered satirical depictions of queen connecting her and environment she lived in with modern age shakespeare s antony and cleopatra was considered canonical by victorian era its popularity led to perception that 1885 painting by lawrence alma tadema depicted meeting of antony and cleopatra on her pleasure barge in tarsus although alma tadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in alexandria in his unfinished 1825 short story egyptian nights alexander pushkin popularized claims of 4th century roman historian aurelius victor previously largely ignored that cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives cleopatra also became appreciated outside western world and middle east as qing dynasty chinese scholar yan fu wrote an extensive biography of her georges melies s robbing cleopatra s tomb an 1899 french silent horror film was first film to depict character of cleopatra hollywood films of 20th century were influenced by earlier victorian media which helped to shape character of cleopatra played by theda bara in cleopatra 1917 claudette colbert in cleopatra 1934 and elizabeth taylor in cleopatra 1963 in addition to her portrayal as a vampire queen bara s cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 19th century orientalist painting such as despotic behavior mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality colbert s character of cleopatra served as a glamour model for selling egyptian themed products in department stores in 1930s targeting female moviegoers in preparation for film starring taylor as cleopatra women s magazines of early 1960s advertised how to use makeup clothes jewelry and hairstyles to achieve egyptian look similar to queens cleopatra and nefertiti by end of 20th century there were forty three separate films two hundred plays and novels forty five operas and five ballets associated with cleopatra written works whereas myths about cleopatra persist in popular media important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed such as her command of naval forces administrative acts and publications on ancient greek medicine only fragments exist of medical and cosmetic writings attributed to cleopatra such as those preserved by galen including remedies for hair disease baldness and dandruff along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes aetius of amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to cleopatra while paul of aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair attribution of certain texts to cleopatra however is doubted by ingrid d rowland who highlights that berenice called cleopatra cited by 3rd or 4th century female roman physician was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to cleopatra ancestry cleopatra belonged to macedonian greek dynasty of ptolemies for further information on cleopatra s macedonian greek lineage see and their european origins tracing back to northern greece through her father ptolemy xii auletes she was a descendant of two prominent companions of alexander great of macedon general ptolemy i soter founder of ptolemaic kingdom of egypt and seleucus i nicator macedonian greek founder of seleucid empire of west asia for further information and validation of foundation of hellenistic egypt by alexander great and cleopatra s ancestry stretching back to ptolemy i soter see and while cleopatra s paternal line can be traced through her father identity of her mother is unknown for further information see and she was presumably daughter of cleopatra vi tryphaena also known as cleopatra v tryphaena and label wife of ptolemy xii auletes as cleopatra v tryphaena while and call her cleopatra vi tryphaena due to confusion in primary sources conflating these two figures who may have been one and same as explained by cleopatra vi may have actually been a daughter of ptolemy xii who appeared in 58 bc to rule jointly with her alleged sister berenice iv while ptolemy xii was exiled and living in rome whereas ptolemy xii s wife cleopatra v perhaps died as early as winter of 69 68 bc when she disappears from historical records assumes that ptolemy xii s wife who he numbers as cleopatra vi was merely absent from court for a decade after being expelled for an unknown reason eventually ruling jointly with her daughter berenice iv explains that alexandrians deposed ptolemy xii and installed his eldest daughter iv and as co ruler recalled cleopatra v tryphaena from 10 years exile from court although later historians assumed she must have been another of auletes daughters and numbered her cleopatra vi it seems she was simply fifth one returning to replace her brother and former husband auletes cousin wife or sister wife of ptolemy xii for further information see cleopatra i syra was only member of ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some non greek ancestry being a descendant of apama sogdian wife of seleucus i for sogdian ancestry of apama wife of seleucus i nicator see it is generally believed that ptolemies did not intermarry with native egyptians as explained by main ethnic groups of ptolemaic egypt were egyptians greeks and jews each of whom were legally segregated living in different residential quarters and forbidden to intermarry with one another in multicultural cities of alexandria naucratis and ptolemais however as explained by native egyptian priesthood was strongly linked to their ptolemaic royal patrons to point where cleopatra is speculated to have had an egyptian half cousin iii high priest of ptah at memphis egypt michael grant asserts that there is only one known egyptian mistress of a ptolemy and no known egyptian wife of a ptolemy further arguing that cleopatra probably did not have any egyptian ancestry and would have described herself as greek argues that cleopatra s grandmother i e mother of ptolemy xii might have been a syrian though conceding that it is possible she was also partly greek but almost certainly not an egyptian because there is only one known egyptian mistress of a ptolemaic ruler throughout their entire dynasty stacy schiff writes that cleopatra was a macedonian greek with some persian ancestry arguing that it was rare for ptolemies to have an egyptian mistress further argues that considering cleopatra s ancestry she was not dark skinned though notes cleopatra was likely not among ptolemies with fair features and instead would have been honey skinned citing as evidence that her relatives were described as such and it would have presumably applied to her as well agrees to this contending that cleopatra having macedonian blood with a little syrian was probably not dark skinned as roman propaganda never mentions it writing fairer skin is marginally more likely considering her ancestry though also notes she could have had a darker more mediterranean complexion because of her mixed ancestry agrees to goldsworthy s latter speculation of her skin color that though almost certainly not egyptian cleopatra had a darker complexion due to being greek mixed with persian and possible syrian ancestry agrees with grant that considering this ancestry cleopatra was almost certainly dark haired and olive skinned contends that it is reasonable to infer cleopatra had dark hair and pale olive skin duane w roller speculates that cleopatra could have been daughter of a theoretical half macedonian greek half egyptian woman from memphis in northern egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to ptah a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship for further information on identity of cleopatra s mother see and joann fletcher finds this hypothesis to be dubious and lacking evidence stanley m burstein claims that strong circumstantial evidence suggests cleopatra s mother could have been a member of priestly family of ptah but that historians generally assume her mother was cleopatra v tryphaena wife of ptolemy xii adrian goldsworthy dismisses idea of cleopatra s mother being a member of an egyptian priestly family as pure conjecture adding that either cleopatra v or a concubine probably of greek origin would be cleopatra vii s mother michael grant contends that cleopatra v was most likely cleopatra vii s mother duane w roller notes that while cleopatra could have been daughter of priestly family of ptah other main candidate would be cleopatra vi maintaining uncertainty stems from cleopatra v vi s loss of favor that obscured issue but contends that whatever cleopatra s ancestry she valued her greek ptolemaic heritage most concurs with this concluding that cleopatra upheld family tradition as noted by cleopatra and her family were successor s to native pharaohs exploiting through a highly organized bureaucracy great natural resources of nile valley ernle bradford writes that cleopatra challenged rome not as an egyptian woman but as a civilized greek claims that cleopatra was an illegitimate child never appeared in roman propaganda against her argues that if cleopatra had been illegitimate her numerous roman enemies would have revealed this to world strabo was only ancient historian who claimed that ptolemy xii s children born after berenice iv including cleopatra were illegitimate cleopatra v or vi was expelled from court of ptolemy xii in late 69 bc a few months after birth of cleopatra while ptolemy xii s three younger children were all born during absence of his wife high degree of inbreeding among ptolemies is also illustrated by cleopatra s immediate ancestry of which a reconstruction is shown below family tree and short discussions of individuals can be found in aidan dodson and dyan hilton refer to cleopatra v as cleopatra vi and cleopatra selene of syria is called cleopatra v selene dotted lines in chart below indicate possible but disputed parentage family tree given below also lists cleopatra v ptolemy xii s wife as a daughter of ptolemy x alexander i and berenice iii which would make her a cousin of her husband ptolemy xii but she could have been a daughter of ptolemy ix lathyros which would have made her a sister wife of ptolemy xii instead confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number ptolemy xii s wife as either cleopatra v or cleopatra vi latter may have actually been a daughter of ptolemy xii and some use her as an indication that cleopatra v had died in 69 bc rather than reappearing as a co ruler with berenice iv in 58 bc during ptolemy xii s exile in rome see also amanirenas a
