improvements were introduced clan system of highlands and islands had been seen as a challenge to rulers of scotland from before 17th century james vi s various measures to exert control included statutes of iona an attempt to force clan leaders to become integrated into rest of scottish society this started a slow process of change which by second half of 18th century saw clan chiefs start to think of themselves as commercial landlords rather than as patriarchs of their people to their tenants initially this meant that monetary rents replaced those paid in kind later rent increases became common in 1710s dukes of argyll started putting leases of some of their land up for auction by 1737 this was done across argyll property this commercial attitude replaced principle of which included obligation on clan chiefs to provide land for clan members shift of this attitude slowly spread through highland elite but not among their tenants as clan chiefs became more integrated into scottish and british society many of them built up large debts it became easier to borrow against security of a highland estate from 1770s onwards as lenders became predominantly people and organisations outside highlands there was a greater willingness to foreclose if borrower defaulted combined with an astounding level of financial incompetence among highland elite this ultimately forced sale of estates of many highland landed families over period 1770 1850 greatest number of sales of whole estates was toward end of this period jacobite rebellion of 1745 gave a final period of importance to ability of highland clans to raise bodies of fighting men at short notice with defeat at culloden any enthusiasm for continued warfare disappeared and clan leaders returned to their transition to

restriction on subletting by tacksmen meant that landlords received all rent paid by actual farming tenants thereby increasing their income by early part of 19th century had become a rare component of highland society t m devine describes displacement of this class as one of clearest demonstrations of death of old gaelic society many emigrated leading parties of their tenants to north america these tenants were from better off part of highland peasant society and together with tacksmen they took their capital and entrepreneurial energy to new world unwilling to participate in economic changes imposed by their landlords which often involved a loss of status for tenant agricultural improvement was introduced across highlands over relatively short period of 1760 1850 evictions involved in this became known as highland clearances there was regional variation in east and south of highlands old townships or which were farmed under run rig system were replaced by larger enclosed farms with fewer people holding leases and proportionately more of population working as employees on these larger farms this was broadly similar to situation in lowlands in north and west including hebrides as land was taken out of run rig crofting communities were established much of this change involved establishing large pastoral sheep farms with old displaced tenants moving to new crofts in coastal areas or on poor quality land sheep farming was increasingly profitable at end of 18th century so could pay substantially higher rents than previous tenants particularly in hebrides some crofting communities were established to work in kelp industry others were engaged in fishing croft sizes were kept small so that occupiers were forced to seek employment to supplement what they could grow this increased number of seasonal migrant workers travelling to lowlands resulting connection with lowlands was highly influential on all aspects of highland life touching on income levels social attitudes and language migrant working gave an advantage in speaking english which came to be considered language of work in 1846 highland potato famine struck crofting communities of north and west highlands by 1850 charitable relief effort was wound up despite continuing crop failure and landlords charities and government resorted to encouraging emigration overall result was that almost 11 000 people were provided with assisted passages by their landlords between 1846 and 1856 with greatest number travelling in 1851 a further 5 000 emigrated to australia through highland and island emigration society to this should be added an unknown but significant number who paid their own fares to emigrate and a further unknown number assisted by colonial land and emigration commission this was out of a famine affected population of about 200 000 people many of those who remained became even more involved in temporary migration for work in lowlands both out of necessity during famine and having become accustomed to working away by time famine ceased much longer periods were spent out of highlands often for much of year or more one illustration of this migrant working was estimated 30 000 men and women from far west of gaelic speaking area who travelled to east coast fishing ports for herring fishing season providing labour in an industry that grew by 60 between 1854 and 1884
