and perfect she was and i sat there and listened never meaning it any of times i said oh i m so happy for you hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years swift never confessed her feelings to him by release of taylor swift he remained unaware of swift s intentions or song and continued his relationship with same female upon teardrops on my guitar

as she was leaving her house to attend a nashville predators hockey game with kellie pickler and carrie underwood hardwick appeared at her driveway a car parked and out of it exited hardwick and a friend of his after two and a half years of not speaking two conversed he was like hey how s it going and i m like wow you re late good to see you but we were civilized swift conjectured multiple theories as to why hardwick appeared at her house one of them was that he was attempting to prove to his friend that he was indeed subject of teardrops on my guitar other possibilities was that he wanted to amend their friendship or believed swift was still pining away from him swift said it would have been poetic if he approached her upon album s release and she would have accepted but that she had already moved on swift cited teardrops on my guitar as an example of how she expresses her sentiments in songs and sometimes in no other manner she was not afraid of using hardwick s first name on track and therefore believed it was very honest and susceptible something she adored composition teardrops on my guitar is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 35 seconds it

teardrops on my guitar speak of heartbreak and are direct referring to subject by his first name drew song describes fancying someone who is already interested in someone else and therefore maintaining sentiments a secret to him swift acted as though she was happy about his relationship while crying and lamenting at home dave heaton of popmatters interpreted lines and there she goes so
