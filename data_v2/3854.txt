because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film but we wanted to get it right when they tried to sell it to various hollywood studios they were told that film would not work group kept saying no this is a story that s pretty familiar to people we re not introducing them to anything they don t really know so shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with public film was

was a fan of a column groening used to write shearer was asked if he wanted to be in series but he was initially reluctant because he thought recording sessions would be too much trouble he felt voice acting was not a lot of fun because traditionally voice actors record their parts separately he was told that actors would record their lines together and after three calls executive producer james l brooks managed to convince shearer to join cast shearer s first impression of simpsons was that it was funny shearer who thought it was a pretty cool way to work found it peculiar that members of cast were adamant about not being known to public as people behind voices shearer provides voices for principal skinner kent brockman mr burns waylon smithers ned flanders reverend lovejoy dr hibbert lenny leonard otto mann rainier wolfcastle scratchy kang dr marvin monroe and judge snyder among others he has described all of his regular characters voices as easy to slip into i wouldn t do them if they weren t easy shearer modeled mr burns s voice on two actors lionel barrymore and ronald reagan shearer says that burns is most difficult character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice he describes burns as his favorite character saying he like s mr burns because he is pure evil a lot of evil people make mistake of diluting it never your evil shearer is also voice of burns assistant smithers and is able to perform dialogue between two characters in one take in episode bart s inner child harry shearer said wow in voice of otto which was then used when otto was seen jumping on a trampoline jean al 2002 commentary for blood feud in simpsons complete second season dvd 20th century fox ned flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that homer was jealous of but because shearer used such a sweet voice for him flanders was broadened to become a christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over homer jean al 2003 commentary for when flanders failed in simpsons complete third season dvd 20th century fox dr marvin monroe s voice was based on psychiatrist david groening matt 2001 commentary for there s no disgrace like home in simpsons complete first season dvd 20th century fox monroe has been retired since seventh season because voicing character strained shearer s throat jean al 2001 commentary for some enchanted evening in simpsons complete first season dvd 20th century fox in 2004 shearer criticized what he perceived as show s declining quality i rate last three seasons as among worst so season four looks very good to me now shearer has also been vocal about principal and pauper season nine 1997 one of most controversial episodes of simpsons many fans and critics reacted negatively to revelation that principal seymour skinner a recurring character since first season was an impostor episode has been criticized by both shearer and groening in a 2001 interview shearer recalled that after reading script he told writers that s so wrong you re taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in trash can for no good reason for a story we ve done before with other characters it s so arbitrary and gratuitous and it s disrespectful to audience due to scheduling and availability conflicts shearer decided not to participate in simpsons ride which opened in 2008 so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in ride at all in a 2010 interview on howard stern show shearer alluded that reason he was not part of ride was because he would not be getting paid for it until 1998 shearer was paid 30 000 per episode during a pay dispute in 1998 fox threatened to replace six main voice actors with new actors going as far as preparing for casting of new voices dispute however was resolved and shearer received 125 000 per episode until 2004 when voice actors demanded that they be paid 360 000 an episode dispute was resolved a month later and shearer s pay rose to 250 000 per episode after salary re negotiations in 2008 voice actors received 400 000 per episode three years later with fox threatening to cancel series unless production costs were cut shearer and other cast members accepted a 30 pay cut down to just over 300 000 per episode on may 13 2015 shearer announced he was leaving show after other voice actors signed a contract for same pay shearer refused stating it was not enough al jean made a statement from producers saying show must go
