pinkner paul a edwards directed episode his second of season early in series actress jasika nicole feared her character was going to become liked by audience only to suddenly die she explained that when i was reading script in episode where dr bishop stabs her in neck with sedative and all script says is dr bishop grabs astrid from behind and jams needle into her neck then it fades to black my mouth hung open for awhile and i was like oh my god i only made it through six episodes while michael cerveris has appeared as observer in three previous episodes and has appeared in every episode to date his previous appearances had been brief background cameos when initially cast for fringe cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star and that his character was one of several nuggets dropped in by j j abrams in a manner similar to his other science fiction series lost cerveris soon discovered that his character was this sort of where s waldo thing as linchpin in an overarching story of series he continued executive producer jeff pinkner commented our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally he s more specifically connected with overall character mythology of show than we ever expected decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared which caused stress in make up department because cerveris would not shave his eyebrows he commented about affair i ve got a little too much else going on and who knows if they would ever grow back i have little enough hair as it is arrival was first episode in which observer had dialogue and first in which he was treated as a focal character in addition to cerveris actor michael kelly made a guest appearance in episode in episode a character introduced as rogue has a specialized weapon that fires massive amounts of energy to simulate energy gun rogue fires at olivia in forest crew placed pyrotechnic charges near trees to make it appear large blasts were close to hitting her in a dvd special feature one of crew commented it was challenging to choreograph fight scene between observer and peter because former does not fight back as he is only there to observe dvd special features include a deleted scene where peter emphatically denies existence of parallel universes after walter implies their existence in a quote from shakespeare s

after its airing fox announced on october 1 2008 that fringe had been picked up for a full season order reviews episode s reception ranged from positive to mixed critic maureen ryan was very positive about episode in her blog at chicago tribune writing i liked this week s episode and for once it wasn t a case of really wanting to like it and trying to find reasons to see past various flaws i just enjoyed hour and felt it had just right mixture of creepiness and character development plus observer was awesome if only they d called him watcher but let s not quibble alan sepinwall of star ledger found arrival a noticeable improvement over previous episodes after being more than prepared to give fringe that s it for me status going into episode i enjoyed strangeness of it observer s hairlessness and diet capt patterson from generation kill toting around a futuristic looking ray gun and a retro looking mind reading machine walter casually injecting with a sedative that i think i ll be sticking around for a bit if i can brace myself for probability that this will all lead to nonsense i can groove on all atmospherics along way and if nothing else abrams is great at atmosphere also seeing improvement was jane boursaw of aol s tv squad commenting tonight s episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science and this is first time i can really say i m looking forward to next episode it s a combination of things and of course walter s scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment less impressed was noel murray of onion s a v club who gave episode a grade of c murray wrote arrival was weirdest episode of fringe yet a deep down sci fi that minimized show s procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered in fact i can t think of any questions that arrival satisfactorily answered not even what happened in fringe episode entitled arrival shock and awe factor of arrival was strong but as a piece of storytelling episode felt slight and soggy and hardly satisfying standalone experience that creators promised each fringe chapter would be ign contributor travis fickett rated episode 7 5 10 explaining that he liked attention to bits of logic that work as glue holding show together such as peter s security clearance but was skeptical of episode s fringe science fickett also noticed many similarities to x files writing not enough is being done to move show into its own direction he concluded production values are exceptional acting is top notch and it certainly seems to be going somewhere where is another matter all together but there does seem to be momentum website blogger io9 highlighted arrival as one of crucial episodes new viewers must watch to understand show jeff jensen of entertainment
