paintings 1801 1805 david s works also show napoleon s journey through great st bernard pass but there are significant stylistic differences between two conceptions delaroche s napoleon is cold and downcast whereas david s wears a pristine uniform and is idealized as a hero delaroche was commissioned to paint a realistic portrait style of which was emerging at time quilley geoff bonehill john p 172 while painting largely represented and was one of pioneers of an emerging style work was criticised by several authorities on subject reasons for this varied from delaroche s depiction of scene to a general disapproval of delaroche himself many of those who were in latter state of mind felt that delaroche was trying to match genius of napoleon in some way and had failed miserably in doing so

order to regain upper hand he planned to launch a surprise assault on austrian army stationed in cisalpine republic based on assumption austrians would never expect napoleon s large force to be able to traverse alps he chose that as his route he selected shortest route through alps great st bernard pass which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible dodge t a p archibald p

start to campaign austrian forces were driven back to marengo after nearly a month there a large battle took place on 14 june which resulted in austrian evacuation of italy delaroche delaroche s early works had been based on topics from bible s old testament but gradually his interests switched to painting scenes from english and french history he combined skill with an interest in detailed scenes from history walther i f suckale r p crossing alps which was painted roughly eight years before delaroche s death exemplifies this phase in delaroche s career commissioning aside delaroche was inspired to create bonaparte crossing alps because he felt that he both looked like napoleon and that his achievements were comparable to napoleon s it is likely that delaroche s painting is relatively historically accurate details such as napoleon s clothes appear to have been researched by delaroche in an effort at authenticity further reading org retrieved on 6 august 2007 painting left thumb jacques louis david s version of scene differs a great deal from delaroche s idea of napoleon s crossing of alps commissioning of painting liverpool painting was commissioned by arthur george third earl of onslow after delaroche and george reportedly visited louvre in paris where they saw david s version of famous event it had only recently been re hung in museum after a resurgence of interest in napoleon nearly 40 years after he was exiled agreeing that painting was unrealistic george who owned a sizable collection of napoleonic paraphernalia commissioned delaroche to create a more realistic depiction elizabeth foucart walker asserts that in fact painting that hangs in louvre was produced first as it was already in america by 1850 when liverpool painting was produced stephen bann suggests that arthur george s meeting with delaroche may have occurred but delaroche chose to produce two works that are almost identical and send one to america bann stephen delaroche napoleon and english collectors apollo october 2005 30 liverpool version of painting is more refined contrast to david s depiction contrast between jacques louis david s depiction of same scene of napoleon traversing alps on his way to italy which was a flattering portrait that king of spain requested for napoleon as a gift and delaroche s depiction in bonaparte crossing alps is easily apparent first and most significant difference is in napoleon in his clothing and in his general stature david s version depicts napoleon dressed in an immaculate multi coloured uniform with a billowing cape delaroche s version however sees napoleon in a fairly ordinary gray coat with sole purpose of keeping cold away rather than showing him as symbol he may have represented that of a gallant and powerful war leader which is impression given in david s version however there is another significant difference in napoleon himself in way he holds himself david s napoleon is flamboyant confident in his leadership of french army and in his ability to cross alps and defeat austrians in italy delaroche s napoleon is instead downcast gaunt and embittered by harsh cold his eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness his tiredness a result of long and unstable trek last properly significant difference in two art works excluding actual setting background men seen in distance etc is difference in animals that napoleon rides on in david s version napoleon rides a large strong steed with a long mane and this is one figment of david s version that is irrefutably untrue napoleon is known to have ridden a mule on his journey which was borrowed from a local peasant rather than a horse chandler d g p 51 this presence of a horse rather than a mule was one of most major grounds for delaroche s criticism of david s version and is basis of delaroche s claim that bonaparte crossing alps which includes a mule is a more realistic portrayal of scene analysis setting delaroche s picture of napoleon crossing alps napoleon is seen wearing clothing appropriate for his location over his uniform he wears a long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him in which he keeps his right hand warm he retains a piece of his dignity in gold trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head mule napoleon rides is undernourished tired from its ordeal in struggling through alps on left of mule is his guide pierre nicholas who must constantly push himself and mule forward and who leans heavily on shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward his clothes are weather beaten his face ruddy from cold he is not allowed luxury of riding an animal for he must be able to navigate independently on ground elements of cold harsh environment of alps are apparent distant mountains capped in snow rise up behind napoleon and his troupe while a steep cliff face appears on his left and path underfoot has a thick layer of ice more members of napoleon s entourage can be seen slightly behind him their robust figures accentuating bonaparte s fragility napoleon is shown to be as he would have been high up in mountains as a mortal and imperilled man while this seems in some way demeaning to napoleon s figure and contrasts in extreme with david s version which shows napoleon impervious to cold and in a heroic light delaroche s artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way delaroche wanted to depict napoleon as a credible man who suffered and underwent human hardship too on his most daring exploits and felt that making him appear as he really would have been in situation would by no means debase or diminish napoleon s iconic status or legacy but rather make him a more admirable person left thumb 110px amber light strikes napoleon introducing a level of contrast artistic style along with mass of white seen behind napoleon amber sunlight glow originating from west of napoleon s troupe is central source of lighting in painting it introduces contrast when coupled with shadow and by illumination highlights key aspects of scene this is particularly seen by light that falls across bonaparte s pigeon chest napoleon and mule he is saddled on are richly textured visually by contrasting light and shade as is guide leading mule ice and snow layers also are made whiter by sunshine from west brightening whole scene however overhanging cliff on left of napoleon s guide and legs of mule both cast shadows to balance lighting scheme of painting textural hues and schemes that delaroche uses in this painting are quite detailed and well considered especially in regards to most important figures such aspects of work were described as being rendered with a fidelity that has not omitted plait of a drapery shaggy texture of four footed animal nor a detail of harness on his back mule especially its fur was intensely textured and detailed to make it look visually rough and bristly and mule itself weary and worn same techniques were applied to red and yellow adornments draped and hung over animal central detail of napoleon is applied to his coat in its ruffles and creases much detail and textural diversity is given to guide too most particularly to his face his green wind caught tunic and his leather boots delaroche s attention to detail and literal precision in this painting evidences and demonstrates slow but steady evolution of realism in art during 19th century and how its popularity began to rise reception work despite its attempt to depict napoleon realistically was criticised by several authorities for a variety of reasons a few disapproved of delaroche s choice of painting while others disapproved of delaroche himself saying in some form that he sought genius of napoleon to no avail soon after its completion work was taken to england and there in 1850 it was reviewed by critic of atheneum a literary magazine magazine s comments on work indicated that while they praised painting for several of its features they criticised delaroche for various reasons some were displeased with delaroche s work at time in general and in part bonaparte crossing alps criticising what was described as his lowered standards in art such critics included gentleman s magazine who wrote following text about delaroche gallery notes i bonaparte chose to ride across alps on a mule obtained at a convent at martigny american whig review p 456 rather than a steed typical gentleman s mount at time because mule was considered to be more sure footed on slippery slopes and narrow passes of alps and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain clubbe j p j s c p 4 ii napoleon ordered assemblage of over 5 000 artillery for transport through pass despite fact that pass was widely considered to be much too narrow and route too volatile and unstable to allow any form of artillery light or heavy to come through thus napoleon s military advisers warned him against this move but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery bunbury h e p 61 addition to these figures approximately 3 600 french men were wounded with over 900 captured or missing and almost 5 520 austrians were wounded with over 2 900 captured missing numbers cannot be accurately estimated smith d greenhill napoleonic wars data book greenhill books 1998 painting was rehung as a result of revival of napoleon s reputation and a fresh interest into his exploits however before this in 1815 year napoleon was exiled napoleonic themed art was proscribed for artists and painters as he was not well liked because of events that had occurred in few years immediately preceding 1815 and napoleon s exile it was only truly by 1830s that artwork related to emperor was being created once more as such after being removed from walls of louvre around 1815 david s version had been re hung by time delaroche observed it king of spain of time commissioned jacques louis david s napoleon crossing alps as a friendly gesture towards napoleon hoping that flattering gift would strengthen relationships between france and spain to degree that napoleon would not consider invading spain and taking it over after he became emperor however king of spain s attempt failed and soon after napoleon crowned himself emperor he crossed pyrenees and conquered spain
