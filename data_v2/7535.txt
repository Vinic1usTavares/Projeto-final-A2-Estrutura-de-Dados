rendered to serbian monarchy serb people and serbian state though it is now bestowed upon serbs and non serbs alike during balkan wars and world war i order was mostly awarded for acts of bravery on battlefield post war kingdom of yugoslavia retained order and it was awarded by yugoslav government in exile until end of world war ii in some cases to individuals who collaborated with axis powers following war monarchy was outlawed and a communist government came to power along with other monarchist symbols order was suppressed during administration of josip broz tito and replaced with communist decorations such as order of people s hero following breakup of yugoslavia serbia ceased using many of awards and decorations established during communist period though it was not until 2010

royal serbian army during world war i and was only british woman to officially serve as a soldier in conflict order of karadorde s star was instituted by royal decree of king peter i on 1 january 1904 commemorating his recent accession to serbian throne as well as one hundredth anniversary of first serbian uprising it was meant to replace order of cross of takovo and order of milos great two decorations that had been awarded by rival obrenovic dynasty which ruled serbia prior to may 1903 coup d etat that reinstated peter s karadordevic dynasty after several decades in exile first award was disagreeable to and their supporters because it was named after takovo village where obrenovic dynasty founder milos obrenovic had launched second serbian uprising order of milos great had to be replaced as it was named after obrenovic himself initially order of karadorde s star was categorized as a senior state award and organized into four classes grand cross of karadorde s star highest class consisted of a badge of order on a sash and breast star a grand officer of karadorde s star was decorated with a badge necklet and a slightly smaller breast star a commander of karadorde s star was only awarded a badge necklet and recipient of order s fourth class officer of karadorde s star would receive a small triangular chest ribbon order was usually awarded for services to karadordevic dynasty serbian state or serb people while karadordevic princes received a grand cross at baptism recipients included both soldiers and civilians though until 1906 only serbian citizens were permitted to receive award during balkan wars 1912 13 serbian government introduced war merit order of karadorde s star to reward acts of conspicuous gallantry of commissioned officers in field as well as battlefield victories of royal serbian army s senior officers non commissioned officers ncos and soldiers in field were ineligible in june 1915 at height of world war i serbia instituted a sub division of war merit order called military order which was awarded to ncos and men for bravery in combat war merit order was divided into two classes 1st division gold cross and 2nd division silver cross one of recipients of military order was highly decorated female soldier savic and another was flora sandes only british woman to openly serve as a soldier in war several senior serbian military leaders were recipients of war merit order including prince regent alexander and field marshals zivojin misic and stepa stepanovic foreign recipients included american general john j pershing british field marshal douglas haig french generals joseph joffre maurice sarrail philippe petain and louis franchet d esperey and king ferdinand i of romania thumb right 220px tennis player novak djokovic was first person to receive order after its reinstatement in 2010 kingdom of yugoslavia retained order after world war i in 1939 it was awarded to city of belgrade during world war ii peter ii bestowed order upon a number of chetniks on recommendation of chetnik leader draza mihailovic some of decorated chetnik commanders included pavle durisic dobroslav jevdevic momcilo dujic and uros drenovic these decorations proved controversial both during and after war as many of commanders cooperated with germany and italy against communist partisans for several years such a discrepancy can best be seen in case of dujic who was given order for displaying gallantry in face of enemy and subsequently celebrated receiving it at an italian general s headquarters in jevdevic s case order was given in 1943 for his services to serb population of herzegovina during a series of ustase massacres but mihailovic had news of award suppressed because jevdevic had visited rome to plan an anti communist offensive with italians and his forces had carried out several massacres of non serbs over previous several years after war yugoslavia came under rule of communist dictator josip broz tito and karadordevic era medals and orders were replaced by non royal decorations such as order of people s hero in 1990s republika srpska instated its own decoration also called order of karadorde s star
