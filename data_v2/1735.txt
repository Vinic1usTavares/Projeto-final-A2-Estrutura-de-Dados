thumb upright 1 35 a garden of eden in conway s game of life discovered by r banks in 1971 cells outside image are all dead white thumb right an orphan in life found by achim black squares are required live cells blue x s are required dead cells in a cellular automaton a garden of eden is a configuration that has no predecessor it can be initial configuration of automaton but cannot arise in any other way john tukey named these configurations after garden of eden in abrahamic religions which was created out of nowhere a garden of eden is determined by state of every cell in automaton usually a one or two dimensional infinite square lattice of cells however for any garden of eden there is a finite pattern a subset of cells and their states called an orphan with same property of having no predecessor no matter how remaining cells are filled in a configuration of whole automaton is a garden of eden if and only if it contains an orphan for one dimensional cellular automata orphans and gardens of eden can be found by an efficient algorithm but for higher dimensions this is an undecidable problem nevertheless computer searches have succeeded in finding these patterns in conway s game of life garden of eden theorem of moore and myhill asserts that a cellular automaton on square grid or on a tiling of any higher dimensional euclidean space has a garden of eden if and only if it has twins two finite patterns that have same successors whenever one is substituted for other definitions a cellular automaton is defined by a grid of cells a finite set of states that can be assigned to each cell and an update rule often grid of cells is one or two dimensional infinite square lattice update rule determines next state of each cell as a function of its current state and of current states of certain other nearby cells neighborhood of cell neighborhood can be an arbitrary finite set of cells but each two cells should have neighbors in same relative positions and all cells must use same update rule a configuration of automaton is an assignment of a state to every cell section 2 1 basic definitions pp 5 6 successor of a configuration is another configuration formed by applying update rule simultaneously to every cell note however that and refer to transition function as global map transition function of automaton is function that maps each configuration to its successor if successor of configuration x is configuration y then x is a predecessor of y a configuration may have zero one or more predecessors but it always has exactly one successor a garden of eden is defined to be a configuration with zero predecessors p 10 a pattern for a given cellular automaton consists of a finite set of cells together with a state for each of those cells p 11 a configuration contains a pattern when states of cells in pattern are same as states of same cells in configuration without translating cells before matching them definition of predecessors of configurations can be extended to predecessors of patterns a predecessor of a pattern is just a configuration whose successor contains pattern an orphan then is a pattern with no predecessor searching for garden of eden for one dimensional cellular automata gardens of eden can be found by an efficient algorithm whose running time is polynomial in size of rule table of automaton for higher dimensions determining whether a garden of eden exists is an undecidable problem meaning that there is no algorithm that can be guaranteed to terminate and produce correct answer kari s main result is that it is undecidable to test whether a cellular automaton is reversible but he also shows undecidability of testing whether a garden of eden exists nevertheless in many cases it is possible to use garden of eden theorem below to infer that a solution exists and then use a search algorithm to find one it would be possible for a computer program to search for orphan patterns by systematically examining all finite patterns in order by increasing size and by testing all possible predecessors for each pattern to determine whether it is in fact an orphan however number of patterns that would need to be generated to find a garden of eden in this way is exponential in area of pattern this enormous number of patterns would make this type of brute force search prohibitively expensive even for relatively small sizes of patterns even if one were willing to fall back on a brute force search a long search time would generate only a few items and even those would be for most part quite uninteresting pioneered a more efficient computational approach for finding orphan patterns his method is based on theory of formal languages and takes an amount of time that is exponential in width of pattern rather than its area key idea is that for any fixed width it is possible to construct a nondeterministic finite automaton that recognizes patterns of a given width that have a predecessor input symbols to this machine describe each row of pattern and states of machine describe nearby rows of possible predecessors for part of pattern that has been input so far one can construct from this machine another finite state machine that recognizes complementary set patterns that do not have predecessors by converting nondeterministic finite state machine to a deterministic finite automaton by using construction and then complementing its set of accepting states once a machine recognizing complementary set has been constructed one may test whether language it recognizes is empty by searching for a path from start state to an accepting state this path if it exists gives a row by row description of an orphan pattern martin gardner credits alvy ray smith with observation that garden of eden theorem applies to conway s game of life and proves existence of gardens of eden for this rule first explicit garden of eden in life with its live cells fitting in a rectangle was identified as a candidate to be a garden of eden by roger banks in 1971 and then verified by an exhaustive backtracking search for predecessors in lifeline vol 3 september 1971 editor robert t wainwright announced that roger banks and steve ward had proven existence of a garden of eden whose live cells fit into a rectangle and presented a configuration believed by banks to be a garden of eden in lifeline vol 4 december 1971 wainwright reported that a group at honeywell using software by don woods had verified banks configuration to be a garden of eden see also subsequently duparc used his formal language approach to find narrowest possible gardens of eden in conway s game of life with bounding box for their live cells being only six cells wide smallest known orphan pattern in conway s game of life by area of its bounding box was found by steven eker in april 2016 it has 57 living cells and fits in an rectangle existence of orphans by definition every orphan belongs to a garden of eden extending an orphan to a configuration of whole automaton by choosing a state for each remaining cell arbitrarily will always produce a garden of eden but reverse is also true every garden of eden contains at least one orphan one dimensional case of this result is theorem 5 1 of as in simpler proof given here it uses compactness of configuration space in their earlier work moore and myhill did not distinguish orphans from gardens of eden and proved their results only in terms of orphans to prove this kari proposition 2 p 11 uses a topological argument based on curtis hedlund lyndon theorem according to which transition functions of cellular automata are exactly translation invariant continuous functions on space of configurations theorem 3 4 here continuity is defined by assigning a discrete topology to finite set of states of automaton and then using a product topology with one term in product for each cell in automaton to construct a topological space whose points are automaton s configurations by tychonoff s theorem it is a compact space for each finite pattern set of configurations that contain pattern is an open set in this topology called a cylinder cylinders form a basis for topology as kari observes collection of configurations that are not gardens of eden is just image of transition function so by closed map lemma for compact spaces it is a closed set set of gardens of eden correspondingly is an open set because it is open and cylinders form a basis set of gardens of eden can be represented as a union of cylinders each of cylinders in this union consists only of gardens of eden so pattern that determines each cylinder must be an orphan if set of gardens of eden is non empty there must be at least one cylinder in this union so there must be at least one orphan and any particular garden of eden must belong to one of these cylinders and therefore must contain orphan for that cylinder garden of eden theorem in a cellular automaton two finite patterns are twins if one can be substituted for other wherever it appears without changing future configurations a cellular automaton is injective if every pair of distinct configurations of automaton remain different after a step of automaton and locally injective if it has no twins it is surjective if and only if every configuration has a predecessor that is if and only if it has no garden of eden configuration an automaton that is both injective and surjective is called a reversible cellular automaton garden of eden theorem due to and asserts that a cellular automaton in a euclidean space is locally injective if and only if it is surjective in other words it asserts that a cellular automaton has a garden of eden if and only if it has twins more strongly every non locally injective cellular automaton has an orphan pattern an immediate corollary is that an injective cellular automaton must be surjective moore proved one direction of theorem that automata with twins have orphans myhill proved converse that an automaton with an orphan also has twins in case of conway s game of life twins are much easier to find than orphans for instance a five by five block of dead cells and a five by five block with its center cell live and remaining cells dead are twins state of center cell cannot affect later configurations of pattern thus in this case garden of eden theorem allows existence of a garden of eden to be demonstrated much more easily than by finding an explicit orphan pattern proof sketch main idea of proof of theorem is to use a counting argument to show that any failure of local injectivity twin patterns leads to an orphan pattern and vice versa in more detail suppose for concreteness that underlying lattice of automaton is a two dimensional square grid that it has different cell states that twin patterns and both fit into an square and that radius of any cell s neighborhood is at most then in order to determine whether a pattern that fits within an square is an orphan one need only look at parts of potential predecessors that fit within an square and that do not contain pattern but there are only of these potential predecessors for sufficiently large values of this number is smaller than number of potential orphans therefore one of potential orphans has no predecessor and is really an orphan that is non injectivity implies non surjectivity conversely letting be size of a bounding box of an orphan a very similar counting argument shows that number of patterns that fit within an square and do not contain an orphan is too small to provide a distinct successor to every starting pattern within an square from which it follows that some two of possible starting patterns are twins therefore non surjectivity implies local non injectivity injectivity versus local injectivity thumb upright 0 75 time space diagram of rule 90 which has no garden of eden despite being non injective each row depicts a configuration with time progressing downwards distinction between injectivity and local injectivity in theorem is necessary as there exist cellular automata that are locally injective but not injective one example is rule 90 one dimensional binary automaton whose update rule replaces each cell s state with exclusive or of its two neighbors in this automaton every state has four predecessors so it is not injective but also has no garden of eden with quiescent states in automata such as conway s game of life there is a special quiescent state such that a quiescent cell whose neighborhood is entirely quiescent remains quiescent in this case one may define a finite configuration to be a configuration with only finitely many non quiescent cells any non locally injective cellular automaton with a quiescent state has gardens of eden that are themselves finite configurations for instance any finite configuration that contains an orphan it may also be possible for an automaton to have a finite configuration whose only predecessors are not finite for instance in rule 90 a configuration with a single live cell has this property however garden of eden theorem does not characterize existence of such patterns in non euclidean geometries in cellular automata defined over tessellations of hyperbolic plane or of higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces counting argument in proof of garden of eden theorem does not work because it depends implicitly on property of euclidean spaces that boundary of a region grows less quickly than its volume as a function of radius there exist hyperbolic cellular automata that have twins but that do not have a garden of eden and other hyperbolic cellular automata that have a garden of eden but do not have twins these automata can be defined for instance in a rotation invariant way on uniform hyperbolic tilings in which three heptagons meet at each vertex or in which four pentagons meet at each vertex credits result jointly to himself and jarkko kari however garden of eden theorem can be generalized beyond euclidean spaces to cellular automata defined on elements of an amenable group a weaker form of garden of eden theorem asserts that every injective cellular automaton is surjective it can be proven for groups using ax grothendieck theorem an analogous relation between injectivity and in algebraic geometry more generally groups for which this weaker form holds are called surjunctive groups there are no known examples of groups that are not surjunctive in fiction in greg egan s novel permutation city protagonist uses a garden of eden configuration to create a situation in which a copy of himself can prove that he is living within a simulation previously all his simulated copies had found themselves in some variant of real world although they had memories of being simulated copies living in a simulation there was always a simpler explanation for how those memories came to be garden of eden configuration however cannot occur except in an intelligently designed simulation religious parallels are intentional notes references see in particular pp 230 and 248 reprinted in reprinted in external links garden of eden garden of eden eric
