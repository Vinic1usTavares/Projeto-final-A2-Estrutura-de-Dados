mellow tracks and working on notebooks that he compiled while band was touring he also noted that he was able to write for a couple of hours and would receive over 15 20 ideas that he could take out for band so once they all got together they can start collaborating on record mosely also in discussion of this added that reason it took them so long was because they were scared to death with writing mosely concluded that once writing had begun process was easier on them it was also during this time that key and mosely began to turn their apartment into a studio adding a drum kit guitar amps and even including a piano while key and mosely began development of songs rest of members would occasionally fly to new york to check on progress in april 2005 band met in los angeles and began

2000 and guns n roses 1991 albums use your illusion i and use your illusion ii as major influences for album yellowcard also credit aphex twin mouse on mars and explosions in sky for inspiration regarding music sound in album thumb left 210px ryan key performing in support of release of lights and sounds in september 2006 in an interview in august 2005 key explained that album was a definite departure and more political than what ocean avenue had contained in discussion of album key said that band had matured and that music in lights and sounds would be different from their previous album though key added we have to be careful we have to try and write songs in style of ones we wrote before we have to make a conscious effort not to think about fact that we went from being a nothing band to having a bunch of hit singles in like one year printz board of black eyed peas collaborated with yellowcard on song two weeks from twenty where he played a trumpet solo song how i go features a duet with dixie chicks lead vocalist natalie maines and features a twenty five piece orchestra which was conducted by violinist sean mackin according to peter mosely band liked dixie chicks and even thought of collaborating with maines on ocean avenue for song view from heaven mosely also revealed that band approached maines about singing on how i go original plan was just for her to sing back up on song but it ended up turning into a duet he also added that maines took a demo of song and returned to studio sunset sound where band were working in addition to dixie chicks working on their album with lyrics and vocals of her own mackin also composed an entire string section and conducted an orchestra in album in an interview with daily nexus in june 2006 mackin revealed that conducting was easy part and that composing part was much harder in this interview mackin also commented composing was getting so frustrating since i wasn t writing as fast as my mind was thinking so going back i wanted to make sure that each of my arrangements for this album and 12 different songs were completely different lyrical content lights and sounds primarily focuses on band coping with success they were enduring when writing songs for album album also goes with what key described as when he was preoccupied with making lights and sounds key said that one of common themes that were written in album was band s hatred in living in los angeles key said that songs have lost that adolescent bounciness they ve come into adulthood a bit in an interview with rolling stone magazine key revealed that during time he and mosely spent in new york he said it brought out some darker places in them and that it was not in a now i m going to start wearing eyeliner kind of way but emotionally darker in addition many of song s themes deal with key s battle with drugs and alcohol while making album yellowcard had also developed a character holly wood who served as a narrator and protagonist for album s storyline character is featured in songs rough landing holly and holly wood died band explained meaning of title track which they said is based on a whirlwind rocker about pressures on band members and how they have changed as they have aged after release of ocean avenue key also commented that when he was preoccupied with making album there were distractions while in process he simply referred to distractions as lights and sounds which ultimately resulted in band naming album just that he also says that main reason behind that was how it affected band during that particular time during discussion of track listing in lights and sounds yellowcard revealed that two weeks from twenty stretched limits for them and explained that it was a jazz lounge anti war song band also explained that song is a narrative of a young soldier named jimmy from new jersey who is killed in iraq war other songs such as down on my head city of devils and holly wood died had a theme that spoke about bitterness and disillusionment how i go is based on both lament of a father over life that has flowed past him and 2003 film big fish another song words hands hearts is written about events that occurred during september 11 attacks release and promotion in september 2005 band announced album s title and revealed that title track lights and sounds was confirmed to be first single

arenas tour lasted for six weeks in november 2005 it was announced that guitarist ben harper had parted ways with band key explained that band went through a lot of highest and lowest points and that making an album would be on highest list and losing a member would be on lowest he also added it s really been a long journey together you know so obviously parting ways with ben was a really unpleasant experience it was either go on without him or don t go on at all and at core we decided that we had something too great to let go of and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him harper was replaced by ryan mendez album s title track was included in video game burnout revenge as well as its spinoff burnout legends music video of lights and sounds was featured on a verizon wireless commercial around time of album s release lights and sounds was released on january 24 2006 through major label capitol records in january and february band went on a tour of us in

from and reeve oliver song city of devils was featured in episode i love you but i ve chosen darkness on cw s one tree hill in october 2006 song rough landing holly was featured in 2006 video game 2 critical reception reviews for lights and sounds were mostly mixed upon release particularly from mainstream media but some critics have stated that album had fallen well short of standards of ocean avenue album s predecessor kelefa sanneh of new york times in review of album wrote to listeners on either side of rock s latest generational divide there s a big difference difference of a decade between being a loser and being a lights and sounds is yellowcard s attempt to split that difference sanneh reports that song two weeks from twenty one of band s anti war song sounds suspiciously like green day lyrics echo plot of video for green day s wake me up when september ends despite this sanneh goes on to say that yellowcard is still pretty good at writing sweeping upbeat punk rock love songs ben of kent news wrote one thing is certain yellowcard you grew to know and love circa ocean avenue is no longer with us band has vastly matured when compared to past records but it comes at a price members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in first place it s clearly right direction for band but yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average mike schiller of popmatters who was somewhat displeased with album wrote that album does not make up for overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of album schiller went on to say lights and sounds may be yellowcard s attempt at a big serious album but band doesn t sound even remotely ready nick cowen from drowned in sound wrote those who register for pop punk 101 will receive yellowcard s lights and sounds as their first set work jacksonville quintet s new album would be perfect teaching aid as it s technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire temptation to plagiarise cowen concluded that album is a substandard second tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure it s really not worth money in your wallet even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain now magazine claimed that band may be in right place it s clear they re simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus despite mixed reaction many critics were fond of album rolling stone s music critic jenny eliscu wrote that album has made what ends up being one of best straight up pop rock albums of 2006 also complimented band writing like goo goo dolls yellowcard have rightfully recognized transcendent value of a big fist pumping anthem coated with a light dose of romantic schmaltz alternative press gave album a perfect rating saying it may be one of least punk albums a pop punk band will make this year but it s probably one of best too sputnikmusic gave album 3 5 out of five stars writing it s pop punk and fairly unambitious stuff at that what keeps this record on its feet is lyricism production and simplicity of it all heather phares of allmusic wrote on lights and sounds yellowcard sounds light years away from its one for kids where we stand days granted band still trades in immediate melodies and heart on sleeve lyrics that they ve used since beginning but major label success suits them well though phares went on to add that band ends up sounding self assured instead of compromised in its big budget surroundings billboard magazine gave album 8 out of 10 stars and claimed that yellowcard made a strong effort that trades sunny sounding rockers and breakup songs for weightier concerns of war and family lights conveys that maturity without seeming strained dan mcclanahan of iowa state daily wrote this disc will likely change people s opinion of yellowcard much more angst and a drastically matured sound make for a pleasant surprise mcclanahan revealed that he was not looking forward to listen to album but admitted once he heard he knew it embraced band s strengths and that they greatly expanded subject matter of its songs commercial performance thumb right yellowcard performing songs from lights and sounds on tour lights and sounds debuted at number five on billboard 200 and top internet albums charts and sold over 95 000 copies in its first week of release since june 2006 lights and sounds has sold over 315 000 copies in united states album did not exceed expectations of ocean avenue which approached 2 million in record sales internationally

certified gold by riaa on march 15 2006 indicating shipment of 500 000 when asked about disappointment of sales that lights and sounds received sean mackin said i think that band went on maybe not a tangent but we had a goal in mind and at end of recording process we were so proud of how artistic we were and i think we showed too much i think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark and i think that lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people but i think that it s all part of our evolution we all went a bit too far mackin also insisted that band did not see album as a mistake but more of a learning experience so that it would not happen again whey they work on their next project two singles were released from lights
