strange glue reviewer aidan williamson praised album s hooks guardian described band s sound to be uk s answer to fall out boy with reviewer emma johnston choosing jealous minds think alike as a highlight in a lukewarm review alternative addiction described album as such think fallout boy meets new found glory and you won t be far off getting what makes you me at six tick gossip and opener truth is a terrible thing all echo aforementioned bands however there is a rough edge that separates you me at six from their glossy luminaries they praised simple production on record which retained their distinctly british sound and concluded a happy medium has been reached with an americanized sound that retains some of bands gritty origins evan lucy of alternative press also gave album a mixed review commenting that some songs feel ripped from fall out boy s take this to your grave but praised songs which were less adherent to pop punk namely tigers and sharks and always attract thrash hits

you me at six are perfect poster boys for their so called scene allmusic reviewer jon o brien also criticised album s sound describing it as an album which was more mature than a busted record but not as heavy as fightstar s music o brien stated that band followed a well worn formula of emo pop on take off your colours however another allmusic reviewer jason birchmeier later regarded take off your colours as an impressive debut album which cemented group as one of england s hottest up and coming rock bands track listing all songs written and arranged by you me at six personnel personnel per
