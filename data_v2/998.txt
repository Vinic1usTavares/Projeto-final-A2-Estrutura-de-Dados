proves a worthy adversary cast fictitious trailers before each segment there are trailers advertising fake films as well as vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called acuna boys according to rodriguez it was tarantino s idea to film fake trailers for grindhouse i didn t even know about it until i read it in trades it said something like rodriguez and tarantino doing a double feature and tarantino says there s gonna be fake trailers and i thought there are rodriguez and tarantino had originally planned to make all of film s fake trailers themselves according to rodriguez we had so many ideas for trailers i made machete i shot lobby cards and poster and cut trailer and sent it to quentin and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real he started showing it around to eli roth and to edgar wright and they said can we do a trailer we have an idea for a trailer we were like hey let them shoot it if we don t get around to shooting ours we ll put theirs in movie if theirs come out really great we ll put it in movie to have some variety then rob zombie came up to me in october at scream awards and said i have a trailer werewolf women of ss i said say no more go shoot it you got me each trailer was shot in two days while wright and roth shot only what ended up on screen zombie shot enough footage to work into a half hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down some canadian screening releases included south by southwest winning trailer hobo with a shotgun machete rodriguez wrote machete in 1993 as a full feature for danny trejo i had cast him in desperado and i remember thinking wow this guy should have his own series of movies like charles bronson or like jean claude van damme so i wrote him this idea of a from mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in u s i had heard sometimes fbi or dea have a really tough job that they don t want to get their own agents killed on they ll hire an agent from mexico to come do job for 25 000 i thought that s machete he would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it s peanuts but i never got around to making it trailer was made into a feature film which was released in september 2010 a sequel machete kills followed in 2013 werewolf women of ss rob zombie s contribution werewolf women of ss starred nicolas cage as fu manchu udo kier as franz hess commandant of death camp 13 zombie s wife sheri and sybil danning as ss officers sisters eva and gretchen krupp she devils of professional wrestlers andrew test martin and oleg vladimir kozlov also featured plus nelson and new as werewolf women according to zombie basically i had two ideas it was either going to be a nazi movie or a women in prison film and i went with nazis there re all those movies like ilsa she wolf of ss fraulein devil and love camp 7 i ve always found that to be most bizarre genre zombie is also quoted as saying i was getting very conceptual in my own mind with it a lot of times these movies would be made like well you know i ve got a whole bunch of nazi uniforms but i got this chinese set too we ll put em together they start jamming things in there so i took that approach don t edgar wright s contribution don t was produced in style of a 1970s hammer house of horror film trailer trailer featured appearances from jason isaacs matthew macfadyen singer katie melua lee ingleby georgina chapman emily booth stuart wilson lucy punch rafe spall wright regulars simon pegg and nick frost and a voice over by will arnett mark gatiss peter serafinowicz michael smiley and nicola cunningham who played zombie mary in shaun of dead among others made uncredited cameo appearances to get necessary 1970s look wright used vintage lenses and old style graphics during editing he scratched some of film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward according to wright in 70s when american international would release european horror films they d give them titles and one that inspired me was this jorge grau film in uk it s called living dead at manchester morgue in spain and in italy i think it s called do not speak ill of dead but in states it was called don t open window i just loved fact that there isn t a big window scene in film it s all based around spin and voiceover not really telling you what hell is going on in film on charlie rose talk show quentin tarantino also pointed out another aspect of american advertising of british films in 1970s that was being referenced none of actors have any dialogue in trailer as if trailer was intentionally edited to prevent american viewers from realizing that film is british thanksgiving thumb right eli roth directs fictitious trailer thanksgiving eli roth s contribution is a promo for slasher opus thanksgiving produced in style of holiday themed slasher films like halloween silent night deadly night april fool s day and my bloody valentine trailer starred jeff rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a pilgrim jordan ladd jay hernandez and roth himself as his intended victims and michael biehn as sheriff design for titles in thanksgiving was based on a mad magazine slasher parody titled arbor day excerpts of score from were used in faux trailer according to roth my friend jeff who plays killer pilgrim we grew up in massachusetts we were huge slasher movie fans and every november we were waiting for thanksgiving slasher movie we had whole movie worked out a kid who s in love with a turkey and then his father killed it and then he killed his family and went away to a mental institution and came back and took revenge on town i called jeff and said dude guess what we don t have to make movie we can just shoot best parts shooting trailer was so much fun roth has stated because every shot is a money shot every shot is decapitation or nudity it s so ridiculous it s absurd it s just so wrong and sick that it s right roth s fake trailer contained elements that almost earned grindhouse an nc 17 rating including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping bouncing on a trampoline and getting stabbed in vulva and three decapitations first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in an exaggerated manner second occurs as victim s girlfriend performs fellatio on him and last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim according to roth instead of seeing it spread out in a feature watching it all jammed together non stop makes it more shocking but we had a great discussion with ratings board they got it once they saw it with all bad splices and distress and scratches they were fine with it roth confirmed in an interview with cinema blend s eric eisenberg that he and co writer jeff rendell are working on a possible feature film hobo with a shotgun some screenings of grindhouse mainly in canada also featured a fake trailer for a film titled hobo with a shotgun trailer created by dartmouth nova scotia filmmakers jason eisener john davies and rob cotterill won robert rodriguez s south by southwest grindhouse trailers contest in trailer david brunt plays a vagabond with a 20 gauge shotgun changed to a 12 gauge for actual movie who becomes a vigilante in trailer he is shown killing numerous persons ranging from armed robbers to corrupt cops to a pedophilic santa claus trailer was available in certain selected movie theaters in united states and canada in 2010 trailer was made into a full length feature film starring rutger hauer as hobo with david brunt playing a dirty cop hobo with a shotgun was second of grindhouses fake trailers to be turned into a feature film first being machete film was released march 25 2011 in canada april 1 2011 on american video on demand and may 6 2011 in u s theatres history and development left thumb poster for a double feature consisting of films dragstrip girl and rock all night sparked idea for grindhouse idea for grindhouse came to robert rodriguez and quentin tarantino when tarantino set up screenings of double features in his house complete with trailers before and in between films during one screening in 2003 rodriguez noticed that he owned same double feature movie poster as tarantino for 1957 films dragstrip girl and rock all night rodriguez asked tarantino i always wanted to do a double feature hey why don t you direct one and i ll do other tarantino quickly replied and we ve got to call it grindhouse film s name originates from american term for theaters that played all exploitation genres kung fu horror giallo sexploitation good old boy redneck car chase movies blaxploitation spaghetti westerns all those risible genres that were released in 70s according to rodriguez posters were much better than movies but we re actually making something that lives up to posters rodriguez first came up with idea for planet terror during production of faculty i remember telling elijah wood and josh hartnett all these young actors that zombie movies were dead and hadn t been around in a while but that i thought they were going to come back in a big way because they d been gone for so long i said we ve got to be there first i had a script i d started writing it was about 30 pages and i said to them there are characters for all of you to play we got all excited about it and then i didn t know where to go with it introduction was about as far as i d gotten and then i got onto other movies sure enough zombie movie invasion happened and they all came back again and i was like ah i knew that i should ve made my zombie film story was when tarantino and rodriguez developed idea for grindhouse as planet terror took shape tarantino developed story for death proof based on his fascination for way stuntmen would death proof their cars as long as they were driving stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60 mph 97 km h and survive this inspired tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his death proof car tarantino remembers i realized i couldn t do a straight slasher film because with exception of women in prison films there is no other genre quite as rigid and if you break that up you aren t really doing it anymore it s inorganic so i realized let me take structure of a slasher film and just do what i do my version is going to be fucked up and disjointed but it seemingly uses structure of a slasher film hopefully against you according to rodriguez tarantino had an idea and a complete vision for it right away when he first talked about it he started to tell me story and said it s got this death proof car in it i said you have to call it death proof i helped title movie but that s it of car chases tarantino stated cgi for car stunts doesn t make any sense to me how is that supposed to be impressive i don t think there have been any good car chases since i started making films in 92 to me last terrific car chase was in terminator 2 and final destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece in between that not a lot every time a stunt happens there s twelve cameras and they use every angle for avid editing but i don t feel it in my stomach it s just action production direction according to actress marley shelton rodriguez and tarantino really co directed at least planet terror quentin was on set a lot he had notes and adjustments to our performances and he changed lines every once in a while of course he always deferred to robert on planet terror and vice versa for death proof so it s really both of their brainchild tarantino has stated i can t imagine doing grindhouse with any other director in way me and robert did it because i just had complete faith and trust in him so much so that we didn t actually see each other s movie completed until three weeks before film opened it was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down and then put them together and watched it all play and then made a couple of little changes after that and pretty much that was it casting many of cast members had previously worked with both directors before appearing in grindhouse marley shelton had auditioned for faculty but rodriguez chose not to cast her she was eventually cast in role of a customer in opening sequence of sin city bruce willis had appeared in both tarantino s pulp fiction and rodriguez s sin city in addition to having a cameo appearance in a segment tarantino directed for anthology film four rooms tom savini had previously acted in from dusk till dawn which was written by tarantino and directed by rodriguez michael parks reprises role of earl mcgraw in planet terror and death proof parks first portrayed role in from dusk till dawn his son james appears in death proof as edgar mcgraw a character that first appeared in from dusk till dawn 2 texas blood money first time two characters appeared together was in tarantino s kill bill tarantino himself plays small roles in both segments of grindhouse and director eli roth who contributed fake trailer thanksgiving and whose film hostel was produced by tarantino has a cameo in death proof tarantino attempted to cast both kal penn and sylvester stallone in death proof but both were unable to work due to prior commitments in an interview tarantino revealed that he decided to cast kurt russell as killer stunt driver because for people of my generation he s a true hero but now there s a whole audience out there that doesn t know what kurt russell can do when i open newspaper and see an ad that says kurt russell in dreamer or kurt russell in miracle i m not disparaging these movies but i m thinking when is kurt russell going to be a badass again rodriguez later revealed that he cast rose mcgowan as cherry darling in response to mcgowan s blacklisting from productions of weinstein company then parent company of grindhouses distributor dimension films following harvey weinstein s alleged sexual assault of her cinematography rodriguez and tarantino each acted as cinematographer on their segments although rodriguez had previously worked as cinematographer on six of his own feature films death proof marked tarantino s first credit as a cinematographer director of photography for rob zombie s fake trailer werewolf women of ss was phil parmet whom zombie had first worked with on devil s rejects director of photography for eli roth s fake trailer thanksgiving was milan whom roth had previously worked with on hostel special effects right 200px thumb intentionally aged look of film as seen in trailer machete though set in modern day film uses various unconventional techniques to make films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in 1970s throughout both feature length segments and fake trailers film is intentionally damaged to make it look like many of exploitation films of 1970s which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape to reproduce look of damaged film reels in planet terror five of six 25 000 frame reels were edited with real film damage plug ins and stock footage planet terror makes heavy use of digital effects throughout film perhaps most notable effect is cherry s rose mcgowan fake leg to accomplish fake leg that cherry sports after her accident during post production effects teams digitally removed mcgowan s right leg from shots and replaced it with computer generated props first a table leg and then an m16 rifle during shooting for these scenes mcgowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her correct motion and helped effects artists to digitally remove it during post production editing during editing tarantino and rodriguez came up with idea of inserting missing reels into film quentin was about to show an italian crime movie with oliver reed rodriguez recalls and he was saying oh it s got a missing reel in it but it s really interesting because after missing reel you don t know if he slept with a girl or he didn t because she says he did and he says that he didn t it leaves you guessing and movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it i thought oh my god that s what we ve got to do we ve got to have a missing reel i m going to use it in a way where it actually says missing reel for 10 seconds and then when we come back you re arriving in third act late second acts in movies are usually most predictable and most boring that s where good guy really turns out to be bad guy and bad guy is really good and couple becomes friends suddenly though in third act all bets are off and it s a whole new story anyway on editing of death proof tarantino stated there is half an hour s difference between my death proof and what is playing in grindhouse i was like a brutish american exploitation distributor who cut movie down almost to point of incoherence i cut it down to bone and took all fat off it to see if it could still exist and it worked an extended 127 minute version of death proof was screened in competition for palme d or at 60th cannes film festival tarantino is quoted as saying it works great as a double feature but i m just as excited if not more excited about actually having world see death proof unfiltered it will be first time everyone sees death proof by itself including me grindhouse is rated r in united states for strong graphic bloody violence and gore pervasive language some sexuality nudity and drug use on march 15 2007 new york post reported that film would possibly require heavy and extensive cuts in order to avoid an nc 17 rating shortly after film officially received an r rating from mpaa ain t it cool news reported that according to tarantino only minimal cuts were made which ended up totaling 20 seconds soundtrack influences music for planet terror was composed by rodriguez inspiration for his score came from john carpenter whose music was often played on set a cover version of dead kennedys too drunk to fuck performed by nouvelle vague was also featured soundtrack for death proof consists entirely of non original music including excerpts from scores of other films soundtrack albums for both segments were released on april 3 2007 response box did not perform well at box office surprising box office analysts and fans alike given strong reviews and favorable media buzz costing 53 million to produce grindhouse opened poorly with a disappointing 11 5 million in united states making a per theater average of 4 417 box office analysts originally predicted an opening weekend total of at least 20 30 million opening weekend box office total stood below not only second weekends of blades of glory and meet robinsons but also fell below opening weekend gross of poorly reviewed are we done yet in an attempt to explain film s disappointing opening weekend box office analyst brandon gray suggested that grindhouse suffered usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted snakes on a plane and slither among others too funny to be scary too scary to be funny box office analyst lee of tracking website lee s movie info compared result with what may have happened if tarantino s kill bill saga had been released as one film instead of two separate volumes is it possible that tarantino got his wish this time as a result of two back to back 60 million grosses he asked others attributed film s disappointing opening to timing of easter weekend noting that weekend is more tailored for family oriented films or light comedy not exploitative horror films film s length running more than three hours also hurt keeping away casual theater goers and limiting number of screenings that could be held in a day quentin tarantino was quoted as saying about film s box office results it was disappointing yeah but movie worked with audience people who saw it loved it and applauded i m proud of my flop harvey weinstein said that he was so incredibly disappointed with film s opening weekend that he was considering re releasing it as two separate films and possibly adding back missing scenes film altogether earned 25 422 088 in ticket sales grindhouse was separated and released internationally death proof grossed 30 663 961 while planet terror grossed 10 871 224 bringing grindhouses total gross to 67 million in 2017 rodriguez told variety that he thinks weinstein buried film due to director s decision to cast rose mcgowan in planet terror actress had previously accused weinstein of raping her critical reception grindhouse was embraced by critics review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported that 84 of critics gave film a positive review based on a sample of 195 reviews with an average score of 7 38 10 site s consensus reads grindhouse delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache improving upon its source material with feral intelligence at website metacritic which utilizes a weighted average rating system film earned a favorable rating of 77 100 based on 36 reviews by mainstream critics audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale entertainment weekly awarded film a b rating praising it as a crazily funny and exciting tribute to grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films that will leave you laughing gasping thrilled at a movie that knows at long last how to put bad back in badass peter travers of rolling stone gave film a positive review commenting that by stooping low without selling out this babes and bullets tour de force gets you high on movies again critic james berardinelli also enjoyed film but was not as positive as other critics awarding film three stars out of four berardinelli found film to be cinema as an expression of pulp with attitude rodriguez and tarantino are speaking from hearts but that doesn t mean everyone sitting in theater will get it critics who did not like film were not amused by film s graphic and comical violence with larry ratliff of san antonio express news noting that this ambitious scratched and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on senses mick lasalle of san francisco chronicle awarded film a high rating but noted that rodriguez segment is terrific tarantino one long winded and juvenile others considered death proof to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment critic a o scott of new york times noted that a t a certain point in death proof scratches and bad splices disappear and you find yourself watching not an arch clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie chicago sun times critic roger ebert was divided he gave grindhouse as a whole two and a half stars out of four awarding planet terror two stars and death proof three stars ebert also noted irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big budget r rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence critics generally enjoyed fake trailers geoff pevere of toronto star wrote that use of trailers helps film establish its credibility as both mock artifact and geeky fetish object even before opening feature todd mccarthy of variety claimed that trailers were excellent candidates for exploitation immortality jeff vice of deseret news who gave feature films negative reviews called trailers strongest aspect of entire presentation maitland mcdonagh of tv guide added with exception of werewolf women which tries a little too hard they re all spot on pastiches double feature appeared at number six on jack mathews and owen gleiberman s respective top ten lists for new york daily news and entertainment weekly and at number seven on stephanie zacharek s list for salon marc savlov listed death proof at number ten on his list for austin chronicle release theatrical outside us and canada

coming attractions from rodriguez while planet terror would feature coming attractions from tarantino while separated version of planet terror includes machete trailer none of other fake trailers were included when features were released individually in reaction to possibility of a split in a foreign release tarantino stated especially if they were dealing with non english language countries they don t really have this tradition not only do they not really know what a grind house is they don t even have double feature tradition so you are kind of trying to teach us something else many european fans saw split as an attempt to increase profits by forcing audiences to pay twice for what was shown as a single film in united states in united kingdom death proof was released on september 21 2007 release of planet terror followed on november 9 with an eventual theatrical limited run of entire grindhouse feature following year death proof was screened in europe in extended version that was

million budget at end of film it is announced there will be two sequels machete kills and machete kills again soon afterward rodriguez confirmed that financing for sequels was in place and that once everyone was free they could begin shooting a trailer that played in some theaters in united states and canada hobo with a shotgun was also adapted into a feature rutger hauer replaced dave brunt as titular character though brunt makes a cameo as a corrupt cop these two adaptations received mainly positive reviews with general consensus being that they were enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being although hobo with a shotgun was not as big a box office success in u s as it was in canada it has since gained a cult following there many of other fake trailer directors have expressed interest in making their trailers into real films including edgar wright and eli roth both rodriguez and tarantino have said that they are interested in making a sequel to grindhouse tarantino said that he wants to shoot an old school kung fu movie in mandarin with subtitles in some countries and release a shorter dubbed cut in others for his segment it has also been reported by
