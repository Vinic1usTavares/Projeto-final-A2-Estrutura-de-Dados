zanzibar red colobus piliocolobus kirkii is a species of red colobus monkey endemic to unguja main island of zanzibar archipelago off coast of tanzania it is also known as kirk s red colobus after sir john kirk british resident of zanzibar who first brought it to attention of zoological science it is now classified as an endangered species and in mid 1990s was adopted as flagship species for conservation in zanzibar population is still decreasing and conservationists are attempting to work with local government to devise a proper effective strategy to protect population and habitat challenges include species habitat which is limited to archipelago species has been reclassified three times it was previously in genus colobus then in genus procolobus and later in genus piliocolobus evolutionary history and taxonomy zanzibar red colobus piliocolobus kirkii population on zanzibar represents a population of red colobus that is believed to have been isolated on island after sea levels rose toward end of pleistocene epoch furthermore it is suggested through mitochondrial analysis that phylogenetic groups within red colobus have been genetically isolated from another since pliocene examining cranial morphology has shown that p kirkii has diverged from mainland piliocolobus to its own species it has experienced an acceleration in morphological evolution of size which is suggested to be result of on island and environmental pressures such as competition habitat predation and or resource availability there has been no evidence for population bottlenecks in species smaller cranium of p kirkii in contrast to mainland colobus monkey is consistent with foster s rule also known as island rule in which original larger animal becomes smaller over time when there are limited resources males tend to have traits which include a shorter face large orbits and an enlarged it is not certain how long ago and where this evolutionary change occurred through molecular analyses it is indicated that p kirkii is more closely related to red colobus p compared to other red colobus species this analysis has also placed divergence of p kirkii from its sister species p at about 600 000 years ago which actually allows for an older evolutionary age compared to previous assumption that it had become its own species around last glacial period species has been reclassified twice it was previously in genus colobus and more recently in genus procolobus and then genus piliocolobus an alternative common name is kirk s red colobus after sir john kirk 1832 1922 british resident of zanzibar who first brought it to attention of zoological science inventory acc 942 papers of sir john kirk kcb and lady kirk nee helen cooke national library of scotland manuscripts division physical description this old world monkey s coat ranges from dark red to black accented with a black stripe along shoulders and arms and a pale underside its black face is crowned with long white hair and features a distinguishing pink mark on its lips and nose also zanzibar red colobus has a long tail used only for balancing it is not prehensile sexual dimorphism is generally decreased in species meaning females have little difference in their body size and colour from their male counterparts females usually outnumber males in their groups species has a notably small cranium and rotund body shape with males potentially reaching over 12 kg and females 10 kg in adults highly differentiated facial features help them to distinguish each other in a group jorgensen matthew 2009 behavioral application in wildlife photography developing a foundation in ecological and behavioral characteristics of zanzibar red colobus monkey procolobus kirkii as it applies to development exhibition photography sit zanzibar coastal ecology and natural resource management word colobus comes from greek meaning he cut short and is so named because of significant reduction in size or complete lack of an opposable thumb in comparison to other primates colobus monkey american wildlife foundation to make up for this they have four long digits that align to form a strong hook allowing them to easily grasp branches and climb locals on island have called zanzibar red colobus kima which means poison monkey in swahili because of their strong smell unlike other monkeys this has caused people to hold negative views of monkey and even to say it has an evil influence on trees on which they feed ultimately killing trees habitat zanzibar red colobus is found in three forests of zanzibar archipelago it displays a wide habit tolerance but it is mainly an arboreal species and prefers drier areas over wet ones its habitats include coastal thickets and coastal rag scrub but it can also be found in agricultural areas and in mangrove swamps latter provides food year round when found in agricultural areas monkey is more used to humans and comes closer to ground about 1 600 to 3 000 individuals remain and currently 50 of monkeys found on islands live outside protected zones largest and most significant area of protection and habitat for monkey is in jozani national park which provides of land reserve forestry technical paper number 45 department of commercial crops fruits forestry dccff tanzania 2006 p 2 it is located on main island and populations here have been greatly studied in regards to both their ecology and behavior even so many groups have been found in shambas swahili for farmland in close proximity to park in these shambas adjacent to park higher densities of red colobus have been reported living here in more cohesive groups compared to inside park reserve incidence of some of these monkeys living permanently outside zone of protected park reserve can increase endangerment of groups thumb right thumb right behavior groups consist of up to four adult males and many adult females typically yielding a 1 2 ratio of males to females young of varying ages are also incorporated in group number of monkeys in a group can range from 30 to 50 individuals species is a very social animal and can often be observed playing and grooming during rest periods between meals unlike females in a group males actually maintain close bonds acting together in defense of their group and even in grooming each other thumb right feeding feeding is also a group activity it begins to feed in morning and is more active during cooler parts of day loud calls from males indicate group is ready to move to another tree to feed this monkey is mainly a and on average half of leaves consumed are young leaves they also eat leaf shoots seeds flowers and unripe fruit it has also been found eating bark dead wood and soil nowak k 2007 behavioral flexibility and demography of procolobus kirkii across floristic and disturbance gradients dissertation for degree of doctor of philosophy department of biological anthropology university of cambridge it is one of few species that do not eat ripe fruits it has a sacculated stomach with four chambers specific for breaking down plant materials however it cannot digest sugars contained in mature fruits because monkey feeds on young leaves though not limited to them there are instances where it consumes charcoal which is believed to aid their digestion of toxins possibly phenolic compounds found in young leaves of indian almond tree and mango tree habit of consuming charcoal is thought to be a learned behavior presumably passed on from mother to her offspring it has been noted however that not all populations on islands carry out behavior but that it is rather mostly done by those who consume more perennial and exotic foliage since some populations use mangroves as a source of food it is natural for monkey to consume more sodium chloride nacl because of this those populations have been observed to drink water directly from tree holes or licking water off of leaves this innovative behavior shows adaptation of monkey to novel ecological and environmental circumstances in dry season one of staple foods indian almond tree as previously mentioned drops its leaves and can cause monkey to go beyond park boundaries in order to extend its feeding range this puts already endangered colobine at more risk reproduction males usually reach sexual maturity at about 3 3 5 years old while females reach it at about two years old females approaching estrous can be easily identified because of swelling and bright red coloration of genital area this signals to males that given female is ready for mating moreover just prior to mating males will use their fingers to probe female s birth canal this is immediately followed by sniffing area because estrogen and progesterone can be detected by this method further helping male conclude if female is indeed ready to breed gestation is about 6 months for colobus monkeys and one female has about 1 2 new born every two years parental care is intense and often role is shared by multiple females of group it is observed that about 76 of offspring are born between september and december infanticide has also been noted on occasion when a new male joins a given group that has infants research has suggested that ability for dietary expansion which consuming charcoal partly allows explains higher birth rates and densities due to resource availability birth rates for those living in mangroves are higher than colobus monkeys living in coral rag forests there are higher birthing rates between october december for colobines on uzi island and then january february for those in located on eastern side of main island infant mortality can be significantly high with half of infants born not reaching more than six months of age birth rates themselves however are actually decreased in comparison to mainland colobus monkeys and interbirth intervals are longer as well research has suggested that this is a consequence of disturbed habitats in which mainland colobi are not so affected communication red colobus species have a smaller larynx compared to other members of colobinae subfamily male s call is more of an alto or soprano in contrast to low bass of a male s in black and white colobus species zanzibar red colobus is non territorial in nature and as so does not typically make loud territorial threat calls zanzibar red colobus distress and warning calls are bark or one of loudest calls from monkey is heard when he expresses his dominance over group and when checking sexual status of his females call heard most often by people in or near jozani forest is alerting signal this is an attention getting call that is derived from progression call chirps and grunts are made when there are changes in surrounding environment such as changes in weather or animal movement in proximity to group with most arboreal animals there are two different alerting calls one for when a predator is on land and another when there is an aerial predator however because of lack of larger birds of prey in zanzibar such calls are not often witnessed young on other hand because of their smaller size and vulnerability do at times make such calls when they see shadows because zanzibar red colobus is extremely social it has a specific call for when it is alone for a certain amount of time upon which it feels vulnerable or threatened young are typically ones to make such a call that sounds like a loud scream but adults are occasionally likely when deemed necessary to make some variation of call as well conservation a number of factors have contributed to monkey s endangered status first an increase in deforestation has resulted in a significant reduction in resources and habitat second it is hunted for meat and pet markets to counteract decline in population various attempts have been made to protect species in 1974 specimens were moved to forest on pemba island to try to re establish monkey s population it had been found however that 20 years after translocation to island only one group of zanzibar red colobus was found and with few sightings and interviews with locals population was estimated to be between 15 and 30 individuals researchers concluded that group had certainly survived but did not increase in number possibly due to adverse relations with humans some locals in pemba hold superstitions against monkey because of idea that it brings bad luck upon farmers this may explain reason that they have not significantly grown in population size on uzi and vundwe islands zanzibar red colobus is subject to extensive habitat destruction particularly with coral rag forests there is also reported poisoning netting and disappearance of monkeys as well as other with animals nowak k perkin a jones t 2009 update on habitat loss and conservation status of endangered zanzibar red colobus on uzi and vundwe islands unpublished report for department of commercial crops fruits and forestry zanzibar various attempts have been made for conservation of species one project was with world wildlife fund specifically in menai bay which is located just west of uzi island second wildlife conservation society has funded conservation projects intended for colobine but in both cases there has been no apparent action that was directly supportive of monkey in mid 1990s zanzibar red colobus was adopted as flagship species for conservation in zanzibar african convention has played a role in conservation of animal by categorizing it as class a according to document african convention on conservation of nature and natural resources class a is described as species in class a shall be totally protected throughout entire territory of contracting states hunting killing capture or collection of specimens shall be permitted only on authorization in each case of highest competent authority and only if required in national interest or for scientific purposes african convention on conservation of nature and natural resources organisation of african unity p 15 it has been suggested that an important way to promote conservation of monkey is to simply spread awareness about it that it is not a harmful animal and that it can actually be good for region s economy because it draws tourism this has been case on island of unguja zanzibar furthermore it would be necessary to establish and designate protected zones references external links arkive images and movies of kirk s red colobus procolobus kirkii department of commercial crops fruits forestry dccff
