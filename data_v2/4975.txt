giant otter or giant river otter pteronura brasiliensis is a south american carnivorous mammal it is longest member of mustelidae or weasel family a globally successful group of predators reaching up to atypical of mustelids giant otter is a social species with family groups typically supporting three to eight members groups are centered on a dominant breeding pair and are extremely cohesive and cooperative although generally peaceful species is territorial and aggression has been observed between groups giant otter is diurnal being active exclusively during daylight hours it is noisiest otter species and distinct vocalisations have been documented that indicate alarm aggression and reassurance giant otter ranges across north central south america it lives mostly in and along amazon river and in pantanal its distribution has been greatly reduced and is now discontinuous decades of poaching for its velvety pelt peaking in 1950s and 1960s considerably diminished population numbers species was listed as endangered in 1999 and wild population estimates are typically below 5 000 guianas are one of last real strongholds for species which also enjoys modest numbers and significant protection in peruvian amazonian basin it is one of most endangered mammal species in neotropics habitat degradation and loss is greatest current threat giant otter is also rare in captivity in 2003 only 60 animals were being held giant otter shows a variety of adaptations suitable to an amphibious lifestyle including exceptionally dense fur a wing like tail and webbed feet species prefers freshwater rivers and streams which are usually seasonally flooded and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs it constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas clearing large amounts of vegetation giant otter subsists almost exclusively on a diet of fish particularly characins and catfish but may also eat crabs turtles snakes and small caiman j hajek f schenck c 2004 pteronura brasiliensis in iucn 2006 2006 iucn red list of threatened species https www iucnredlist org species it has no serious natural predators other than humans although it must compete with other species including neotropical otter and caiman species for food resources naming giant otter has a handful of other names in brazil it is known as from tupi word ari rana meaning water jaguar in spanish river wolf and water dog are used occasionally though latter also refers to several different animals and may have been more common in reports of explorers in 19th and early 20th centuries see e g all three names are in use in south america with a number of regional variations giant otter translates literally as nutria gigante and lontra gigante in spanish and portuguese respectively among achuar people they are known as and among as genus name pteronura is derived from ancient greek words pteron pteron feather or wing and oura oura tail a reference to its distinctive wing like tail taxonomy and evolution thumb giant otter head from museu emilio research institute otters form subfamily within mustelids and giant otter is only member of genus pteronura two subspecies are currently recognized by canonical mammal species of world p b brasiliensis and p b paraguensis incorrect descriptions of species have led to multiple synonyms latter subspecies is often p b in literature p b brasiliensis is distributed across north of giant otter range including orinoco amazon and guianas river systems to south p b paraguensis has been suggested in paraguay uruguay southern brazil and northern argentina although it may be extinct in last three of these four world conservation union iucn considers species presence in argentina and uruguay uncertain database entry includes justification for why this species is endangered in former investigation has shown thinly distributed population remnants p b paraguensis is supposedly smaller and more gregarious with different dentition and skull morphology carter and rosas however rejected subspecific division in 1997 noting classification had only been validated once in 1968 and p b paraguensis type specimen was very similar to p b brasiliensis biologist nicole duplaix calls division of doubtful value an extinct genus is believed to be ancestral to present species having migrated to new world during pliocene or early pleistocene giant otter shares south american continent with three of four members of new world otter genus lontra neotropical river otter southern river otter and marine otter north american river otter lontra canadensis is fourth lontra member giant otter seems to have evolved independently of lontra in south america despite overlap smooth coated otter of asia may be its closest extant relative similar behaviour vocalizations and skull morphology have been noted both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs giant otter fossil remains have been recovered from a cave in brazilian mato grosso phylogenetic analysis by and wayne in 1998 found giant otter has highest divergence sequences within otter subfamily forming a distinct clade that split away 10 to 14 million years ago they noted that species may be basal divergence among otters or fall outside of them altogether having split even before other mustelids such as ermine polecat and mink later gene sequencing research on mustelids from 2005 places divergence of giant otter somewhat later between five and 11 million years ago corresponding phylogenetic tree locates lontra divergence first among otter genera and pteronura second although divergence ranges overlap physical characteristics thumb a wild giant otter periscoping in cantao state park in brazil showing its identifying throat marks thumb skull seen from side short snouted as usual in mustelids it has a pronounced sagittal crest allowing for a very powerful bite in this species giant otter is clearly distinguished from other otters by morphological and behavioural characteristics it has greatest body length of any species in mustelid family although sea otter may be heavier males are between in length from head to tail and females between animal s well muscled tail can add a further to total body length boitani luigi simon schuster s guide to mammals simon schuster touchstone books 1984 early reports of skins and living animals suggested exceptionally large males of up to intensive hunting likely reduced occurrence of such massive specimens weights are between for males and for females giant otter has shortest fur of all otter species it is typically chocolate brown but may be reddish or fawn and appears nearly black when wet fur is extremely dense so much so that water cannot penetrate to skin guard hairs trap water and keep inner fur dry guard hairs are approximately 8 millimetres one third of an inch in length about twice as long as fur of inner coat its velvety feel makes animal highly sought after by fur traders and has contributed to its decline unique markings of white or cream fur color throat and under chin allow individuals to be identified from birth giant otters use these marks to recognize one another and upon meeting other otters they engage in a behavior known as periscoping displaying their throats and upper chests to each other giant otter muzzles are short and sloping and give head a ball shaped appearance ears are small and rounded nose or rhinarium is completely covered in fur with only two slit like nostrils visible giant otter s highly sensitive whiskers vibrissae allow animal to track changes in water pressure and currents which aids in detecting prey legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws well suited for an aquatic life it can close its ears and nose while underwater at time of carter and rosas writing vision had not been directly studied but field observations show animal primarily hunts by sight above water it is able to recognize observers at great distances fact that it is exclusively active during day further suggests its eyesight should be strong to aid in hunting and predator avoidance in other otter species vision is generally normal or slightly myopic both on land and in water giant otter s hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent species possesses 2n 38 chromosomes biology and behaviour giant otter is large gregarious and diurnal early travellers reports describe noisy groups surrounding explorers boats but little scientific information was available on species until duplaix s groundbreaking work in late 1970s concern over this endangered species has since generated a body of research vocalisations giant otter is an especially noisy animal with a complex repertoire of vocalizations all otters produce vocalizations but by frequency and volume giant otter may be most vocal duplaix identified nine distinct sounds with further subdivisions possible depending on context quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger a wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders while a low growl is used for aggressive warning hums and coos are more reassuring within group whistles may be used as advance warning of intent between groups although evidence is limited newborn pups squeak to elicit attention while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities an analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates each family of otters was shown to have its own unique audio signature social structure giant otter is a highly social animal and lives in extended family groups group sizes are anywhere from two to 20 members but likely average between three and eight larger figures may reflect two or three family groups temporarily feeding together groups are strongly cohesive otters sleep play travel and feed together thumb giant otters leave a pool together at philadelphia zoo species is extremely social a rarity among mustelids and family groups are cohesive group members share roles structured around dominant breeding pair species is territorial with groups marking their ranges with latrines gland secretions and vocalizations at least one case of a change in alpha relationship has been reported with a new male taking over role mechanics of transition were not determined duplaix suggests a division between residents who are established within groups and territories and nomadic and solitary transients categories do not seem rigid and both may be a normal part of giant otter life cycle one tentative theory for development of sociality in mustelids is that locally abundant but unpredictably dispersed prey causes groups to form aggression within species intraspecific conflict has been documented defence against intruding animals appears to be cooperative while adult males typically lead in aggressive encounters cases of alpha females guarding groups have been reported one fight was directly observed in brazilian pantanal in which three animals violently engaged a single individual near a range boundary in another instance in brazil a carcass was found with clear indications of violent assault by other otters including bites to snout and genitals an attack pattern similar to that exhibited by captive animals while not rare among large predators in general intraspecific aggression is uncommon among otter species and suggest a correlation to animal s sociability which is also rare among other otters a capacity for aggressive behavior should not be overstated with giant otter researchers emphasize that even between groups conflict avoidance is generally adopted within groups animals are extremely peaceful and cooperative group hierarchies are not rigid and animals easily share roles reproduction and life cycle thumb a giant otter den dug on a lake shore at cantao state park newly dug white sand is a sign of recent activity at this den giant otters build dens which are holes dug into riverbanks usually with multiple entrances and multiple chambers inside they give birth within these dens during dry season in cantao state park otters dig their reproductive dens on shores of oxbow lakes starting around july when waters are already quite low they give birth between august and september and young pups emerge for first time in october and november which are months of lowest water and fish concentrations in dwindling lakes and channels are at their peak this makes it easier for adults to catch enough fish for growing young and for pups to learn how to catch fish entire group including nonreproductive adults which are usually older siblings to that year s pups collaborates to catch enough fish for young details of giant otter reproduction and life cycle are scarce and captive animals have provided much of information females appear to give birth year round although in wild births may peak during dry season estrous cycle is 21 days with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation at tierpark hagenbeck in germany long term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen with copulation most frequently taking place in water females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days giving birth to one to five pups with an average of two research over five years on a breeding pair at cali zoo in colombia found average interval between litters was six to seven months but as short as 77 days when previous litter did not survive other sources have found greater intervals with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in wild thumb upright left captive giant otters have contributed greatly to scientific knowledge of species by providing readily available subjects for research on species reproduction and life cycle mothers give birth to furred and blind cubs in an underground den near river shore and fishing sites males actively participate in rearing cubs and family cohesion is strong older juvenile siblings also participate in rearing although in weeks immediately after birth they may temporarily leave group pups open their eyes in their fourth week begin walking in their fifth and are able to swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks old they are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after animal reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age and both male and female pups leave group permanently after two to three years they then search for new territory to begin a family of their own giant otter is very sensitive to human activity when rearing its young no institution for example has successfully raised giant otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect abuse and infanticide as well as decreased lactation in wild it has been suggested although not systematically confirmed that tourists cause similar stresses disrupted lactation and denning reduced hunting and habitat abandonment are all risks this sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards young all group members may aggressively charge intruders including boats with humans in them longest documented giant otter lifespan in wild is eight years in captivity this may increase to 17 with an unconfirmed record of 19 animal is susceptible to a variety of diseases including canine parvovirus parasites such as larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms also afflict giant otter other causes of death include accidents gastroenteritis infanticide and epileptic seizures hunting and diet right thumb a captive giant otter when feeding grasps prey in its forepaws and begins eating immediately at head giant otter is an apex predator and its population status reflects overall health of riverine ecosystems it feeds mainly on fish including cichlids characins such as piranha and catfish one full year study of giant otter scats in amazonian brazil found fish present in all fecal samples fish from order perciformes particularly cichlids were seen in 97 of scats and such as characins in 86 fish remains were of medium sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water to advantage of probably visually oriented giant otter prey species found were also sedentary generally swimming only short distances which may aid giant otter in predation hunting in shallow water has also been found to be more rewarding with water depth less than having highest success rate giant otter seems to be opportunistic taking whatever species are most locally abundant if fish are unavailable it will also take crabs snakes and even small caimans and anacondas species can hunt singly in pairs and in groups relying on sharp eyesight to locate prey in some cases supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental a result of group members fishing individually in close proximity truly coordinated hunting may only occur where prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water prey chase is rapid and tumultuous with lunges and twists through shallows and few missed targets otter can attack from both above and below swiveling at last instant to clamp prey in its jaws giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately they grasp fish firmly between forepaws and begin eating noisily at head carter and rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10 of their body weight daily about in keeping with findings in wild ecology habitat species is amphibious although primarily terrestrial it occurs in freshwater rivers and streams which generally flood seasonally other water habitats include freshwater springs and permanent freshwater lakes four specific vegetation types occur on one important creek in suriname riverbank high forest floodable mixed marsh and high swamp forest floodable low marsh forest and grass islands and floating meadows within open areas of creek itself duplaix identified two critical factors in habitat selection food abundance which appears to positively correlate to shallow water and low sloping banks with good cover and easy access to preferred water types giant otter seems to choose clear black waters with rocky or sandy bottoms over silty saline and white waters thumb a group of four giant otters emerging from water to patrol a campsite on riverbank at cantao state park giant otters use areas beside rivers for building dens campsites and latrines they clear significant amounts of vegetation while building their campsites one report suggests maximum areas long and wide well marked by scent glands urine and feces to signal territory carter and rosas found average areas a third this size giant otters adopt communal latrines beside campsites and dig dens with a handful of entrances typically under root systems or fallen trees one report found between three and eight campsites clustered around feeding areas in seasonally flooded areas giant otter may abandon campsites during wet season dispersing to flooded forests in search of prey giant otters may adopt preferred locations perennially often on high ground these can become quite extensive including backdoor exits into forests and swamps away from water otters do not visit or mark every site daily but usually patrol all of them often by a pair of otters in morning research generally takes place in dry season and an understanding of species overall habitat use remains partial an analysis of dry season range size for three otter groups in ecuador found areas between presumed habitat requirements and availability would differ dramatically in rainy season estimating range sizes of 1 98 to as much as 19 55 square kilometres 0 76 to 7 55 sq miles for groups other researchers suggest approximately and note a strong inverse correlation between sociality and home range size highly social giant otter has smaller home range sizes than would be expected for a species of its mass see figure three for home range size estimate population densities varied with a high of reported in suriname and with a low of found in guyana predation and competition thumb right characins such as piranha species are prey for giant otter but these aggressive fish may also pose a danger duplaix speculated that piranhas may attack giant otters adult giant otters living in family groups have no known serious natural predators however there are some accounts of black caimans in peru and yacare caimans in pantanal preying on giant otters in addition solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by jaguar cougar and anaconda but this is based on historical reports not direct observation pups are more vulnerable and may be taken by caiman and other large predators although adults are constantly mindful of stray young and will harass and fight off possible predators when in water giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter as evidenced by scarring on individuals even if without direct predation giant otter must still compete with other predators for food resources duplaix documented interaction with neotropical otter lontra in it was listed as guiana otter under older binomial lutra while two species are sympatric with overlapping ranges during certain seasons there appeared to be no serious conflict smaller neotropical otter is far more shy less noisy and less social at about a third weight of giant otter it is more vulnerable to predation hence a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness reducing likelihood of conflict with diurnal giant otter its smaller prey different denning habits and different preferred water types also reduce interaction other species that prey upon similar food resources include caimans and large fish that are themselves piscivores such as electric eel and large catfish are among aquatic competitors two river dolphins and might potentially compete with giant otter but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap furthermore observed associations between giant otters and amazon river dolphins and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from otters spectacled caiman is another potential competitor but duplaix found no conflict with species in suriname conservation status iucn listed giant otter as endangered in 1999 it had been considered vulnerable under all previous listings from 1982 when sufficient data had first become available it is regulated internationally under appendix i of convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites all trade in specimens and parts is illegal threats animal faces a variety of critical threats poaching has long been a problem statistics show between 1959 and 1969 amazonian brazil alone accounted for 1 000 to 3 000 pelts annually species was so thoroughly decimated number dropped to just 12 in 1971 implementation of cites in 1973 finally brought about significant hunting reductions although demand did not disappear entirely in 1980s pelt prices were as high as us 250 on european market threat has been exacerbated by otters relative fearlessness and tendency to approach human beings they are extremely easy to hunt being active through day and highly inquisitive animal s relatively late sexual maturity and complex social life makes hunting especially disastrous more recently habitat destruction and degradation have become principal dangers and a further reduction of 50 is expected in giant otter numbers within 20 years after 2004 about span of three generations of giant otters typically loggers first move into rainforest clearing vegetation along riverbanks farmers follow creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats as human activity expands giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging in parts of giant otter range and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish a byproduct of gold mining water pollution from mining fossil fuel extraction and agriculture is a serious danger concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in food chain and can poison top predators such as giant otter other threats to giant otter include conflict with fishermen who often view species as a nuisance see below ecotourism also presents challenges while it raises money and awareness for animals by its nature it also increases human effect on species both through associated development and direct disturbances in field a number of restrictions on land use and human intrusion are required to properly maintain wild populations schenck et al who undertook extensive fieldwork in peru in 1990s suggest specific no go zones where species is most frequently observed offset by observation towers and platforms to allow viewing limits on number of tourists at any one time fishing prohibitions and a minimum safe distance of are proposed to offer further protection distribution and population thumb right giant otter from venezuela giant otter has lost as much as 80 of its south american range while still present in a number of north central countries giant otter populations are under considerable stress iucn lists bolivia brazil colombia ecuador french guiana guyana paraguay peru suriname and venezuela as current range countries given local extinctions species range has become discontinuous total population numbers are difficult to estimate an iucn study in 2006 suggested 1 000 to 5 000 otters remain populations in bolivia were once widespread but country became a black spot on distribution maps after poaching between 1940s and 1970s a relatively healthy but still small population of 350 was estimated in country in 2002 species has likely been extirpated from southern brazil but in west of country decreased hunting pressure in critical pantanal has led to very successful recolonization an estimate suggests 1 000 or more animals in region left thumb 200px guianas are last real stronghold of giant otter suriname retains extensive forest cover and many protected areas it is pictured above guyana is immediately to west and french guiana is immediately to east in 2006 most of this species lived in brazilian amazon and its bordering areas a significant population lives in wetlands of central araguaia river and in particular within cantao state park which with its 843 oxbow lakes and extensive flooded forests and marshlands is one of best habitat patches for this species in brazil suriname still has significant forest cover and an extensive system of protected areas much of which protects giant otter duplaix returned to country in 2000 and found giant otter still present on creek a jewel of biodiversity although increased human presence and land use suggests sooner or later species may not be able to find suitable habitat for campsites in a report for world wildlife fund in 2002 duplaix was emphatic about importance of suriname and other guianas other countries have taken a lead in designating protected areas in south america in 2004 peru created one of largest conservation areas in world alto national park with an area similar in size to belgium park harbors many endangered plants and animals including giant otter and holds world record for mammal diversity bolivia designated wetlands larger than size of switzerland as a freshwater protected area in 2001 these are also home to giant otter interactions with indigenous peoples throughout its range giant otter interacts with indigenous groups who often practice traditional hunting and fishing a study of five indigenous communities in colombia suggests native attitudes toward animal are a threat otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing and are sometimes killed even when told of importance of species to ecosystems and danger of extinction interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with species schoolchildren however had a more positive impression of animal velasco diana marcela 2005 estudio sobre el estado de de la nutria gigante pteronura brasiliensis en la zona de de inirida bajo rio inirida colombia pdf giant otter research retrieved on 2008 01 27 in suriname giant otter is not a traditional prey species for human hunters which affords some protection one researcher has suggested giant otter is hunted only in desperation due to its horrible taste animal sometimes drowns in nets set across rivers and machete attacks by fishermen have been noted according to duplaix but tolerance is rule in suriname one difference in behavior was seen in country in 2002 normally inquisitive giant otters showed active avoidance behavior with visible panic when boats appeared logging hunting and pup seizure may have led groups to be far more wary of human activity local people sometimes take pups for exotic pet trade or as pets for themselves but animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable duplaix relates story of an indian who took two pups from their parents while revealing of affection held for animals seizure was a profound blow to breeding pair which went on to lose their territory to competitors species has also appeared in folklore of region it plays an important role in mythology of achuar people where giant otters are seen as a form of or water spirits they are a sort of water people who feed on fish they appear in a fish poisoning legend where they assist a man who has wasted his sexual energy creating anacondas of world from his distressed and extended genitals bororo people have a legend on origin of tobacco smoking those who used leaf improperly by swallowing it were punished by being transformed into giant otters bororo also associate giant otter with fish and with fire a legend has it that giant otter exchanged places with jaguar story says jaguar formerly lived in water and giant otter came to land only to eat indigenous peoples from amazonian peru believed in a world of water where yaku runa reigned as mother of water and was charged with caring for fish and animals giant otters served as yaku
