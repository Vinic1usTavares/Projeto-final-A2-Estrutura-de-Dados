carnot was a pre dreadnought battleship of french navy she was laid down in july 1891 launched in july 1894 and completed in july 1897 she was a member of a group of five broadly similar battleships along with charles martel jaureguiberry bouvet and massena which were ordered in response to british like her half sisters she was armed with a main battery of two guns and two guns in individual turrets she had a top speed of carnot had a fairly uneventful career she spent majority of her service life in northern and mediterranean squadrons of french fleet where she participated in extensive annual maneuvers she was withdrawn from service by outbreak of world war i in august 1914 and so did not see action during conflict she remained in french navy s inventory until 1922 when she was stricken from naval register and sold for scrap design thumb left which formed basis for carnots design in 1889 british royal navy passed naval defence act that resulted in construction of eight s this major expansion of naval power led french government to pass its reply naval naval law of 1890 law called for a total of twenty four cuirasses d escadre squadron battleships and a host of other vessels including coastal defense battleships cruisers and torpedo boats first stage of program was to be a group of four squadron battleships that were built to different designs but met same basic characteristics including armor armament and displacement naval high command issued basic requirements on 24 december 1889 displacement would not exceed primary armament was to consist of and guns belt armor should be and ships should maintain a top speed of secondary battery was to be either or caliber with as many guns fitted as space would allow basic design for ships was based on previous battleship but instead of mounting main battery all on centerline ships used lozenge arrangement of earlier vessel which moved two of main battery guns to single turrets on wings although navy had stipulated that displacement could be up to 14 000 tons political considerations namely parliamentary objections to increases in naval expenditures led designers to limit displacement to around five naval architects submitted proposals to competition design for carnot was prepared by victor saglio sous directeur des constructions navales under director of naval construction at toulon navy accepted saglio s proposal and ordered ship on 10 september 1891 though program called for four ships to be built in first year five were ultimately ordered carnot and she and her half sisters were disappointments in service they generally suffered from stability problems and louis emile bertin director of naval construction in late 1890s referred to ships as prone to capsizing all five of vessels compared poorly to their british counterparts particularly their contemporaries of ships suffered from a lack of uniformity of equipment which made them hard to maintain in service and their mixed gun batteries comprising several calibers made gunnery in combat conditions difficult since shell splashes were hard to differentiate many of problems that plagued ships in service were a result of limitation on their displacement particularly their stability and seakeeping general characteristics and machinery thumb left line drawing of carnot carnot was long between perpendiculars and had a beam of and a draft of she had a displacement of her forecastle gave her a high freeboard forward but her quarterdeck was cut down to main deck level aft her hull was given a marked tumblehome to give 27 cm guns wide fields of fire ship was equipped with a heavy military foremast and a lighter pole mainmast her bridge and other superstructure was smaller compared to charles martel to reduce topweight and she was equipped with lighter pole masts instead of heavy fighting masts used on her half sister she nevertheless suffered from same stability problems that plagued charles martel and many other french capital ships of period attempts to reduce her topweight by cutting down bridge and replacing her military mast with another pole mast but these changes were not successful in addition carnot was completed with a very large number of portholes in her hull which were criticized for reduction in hull s watertight integrity they imposed later in ship s career many of portholes were sealed to reduce risk of flooding carnot had a crew of 647 officers and enlisted men carnot had two vertical three cylinder triple expansion engines manufactured by schneider creusot each engine drove a single screw with steam supplied by twenty four d water tube boilers boilers were divided into four boiler rooms and were ducted into two funnels her propulsion system was rated at which allowed ship to steam at a speed of with forced draft as built she could carry of coal though additional space allowed for up to in total armament and armor carnots main armament consisted of two canon de 305 mm modele 1887 guns in two single gun turrets one each fore and aft she also mounted two canon de 274 mm modele 1887 guns in two single gun turrets one amidships on each side sponsoned out over tumblehome of ship s sides her secondary armament consisted of eight canon de 138 6 mm modele 1888 guns which were mounted in single turrets at corners of superstructure light armament for defense against torpedo boats consisted of eight canon de 65 mm modele 1891 quick firing guns on shelter deck amidships and forward and aft of superstructure twelve 47 mm modele 1885 quick firing guns and eight 37 mm revolving cannon her armament suite was rounded out by four torpedo tubes two of which were submerged in ship s hull with other two in trainable deck mounts ship s armor was constructed with nickel steel that was manufactured by schneider creusot main belt was thick amidships where it protected ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces and tapered down to at lower edge on either end of central citadel belt was reduced to at waterline and 25 cm on lower edge belt extended for entire length of hull above belt was a thick strake side armor that created a highly subdivided cofferdam to reduce risk of flooding from battle damage coal storage bunkers were placed behind upper side armor to increase its strength main battery guns were protected with of armor and secondary turrets had 10 cm thick sides main armored deck was thick below which was a splinter deck that was thick intended to catch shell fragments that penetrated main deck conning tower had thick sides history carnot was laid down in toulon in 1891 and launched three years later on 12 july 1894 originally under name lazare carnot after lazare carnot fitting out work was completed another two years after that and ship began sea trials in 1896 after completing those ship was commissioned into fleet in july 1897 by that time her name had been shortened to carnot to honor her original namesake as well as his grandson marie francois sadi carnot who had been president of france until his assassination on 25 june 1894 immediately on entering service she and her half sisters charles martel and jaureguiberry were sent to join international squadron that had been assembled beginning in february multinational force also included ships of austro hungarian navy imperial german navy italian regia marina imperial russian navy and british royal navy and it was sent to intervene in 1897 1898 greek uprising on crete against rule by ottoman empire carnot spent majority of her active career alternating between northern and mediterranean squadrons newer battleships typically served in mediterranean while older vessels were assigned to northern squadron in january 1900 she was assigned to northern squadron under command of vice admiral menard replacing in july she and other northern squadron ships met with mediterranean squadron off coast of portugal and then steamed to quiberon bay for joint training exercises maneuvers concluded with a naval review in cherbourg on 19 july for president emile loubet by 1902 carnot had been transferred to reserve squadron of mediterranean squadron along with battleships brennus charles martel and and three armored cruisers and reserve squadron was commanded by rear admiral besson who flew his flag in brennus entire french fleet including carnot conducted extensive maneuvers in mediterranean in july and august of that year carnot and bouvet were transferred back to northern squadron in 1904 carnot was still serving with northern squadron in 1906 when she participated in annual summer maneuvers in june july that year following year carnot was back in mediterranean in second squadron she remained in second squadron through 1911 on 5 january 1911 carnot and rest of second squadron was transferred to brest later that year as s began to enter service ships of second squadron became new third squadron as displaced ships of first squadron to second squadron which was transferred back to toulon during this period on 4 september 1911 three squadrons of french fleet held a naval review off toulon on 11 january 1913 carnot was reduced to reserve in early 1914 french naval minister ernest decided to discard carnot owing to cost of maintaining obsolete battleship which was by then nearly twenty years old by outbreak of world war i in august 1914 carnot had been laid up in port of brest along with charles martel both ships were retained on effective list however pending completion of new s carnot was ultimately stricken from naval register in 1922 and sold for scrapping that year footnotes references category 1894 ships category battleships of french navy category ships built in france
