1994 pacific hurricane season was final season of eastern north pacific s consecutive active hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1982 season officially started on may 15 1994 in eastern pacific and on june 1 1994 in central pacific and lasted until november 30 1994 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in northeastern pacific ocean first tropical cyclone formed on june 18 while last system dissipated on october 26 this season twenty two tropical cyclones formed in north pacific ocean east of dateline with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes a total of 10 hurricanes occurred including five major hurricanes above average activity in 1994 was contributed to ongoing 1990 95 el nino at time of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms season was first on record to see three category 5 hurricanes later tied in 2002 and 2018 hurricanes emilia gilma john and olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars longevity wise no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as hurricane john which lasted 31 days elsewhere hurricane rosa caused four casualties in mexico as basin s lone landfalling tropical storm or hurricane and later was responsible for flooding in texas season summary this season twenty two tropical cyclones formed in north pacific ocean east of dateline all but two of them became tropical storms or hurricanes in eastern pacific region 140degw to north america nineteen tropical depressions formed of which seventeen became tropical storms nine further intensifying into hurricanes and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of category 3 intensity or higher on saffir simpson scale these numbers are slightly above long term

hurricane formed overall there were eleven tropical cyclones eight tropical storms five hurricanes and three major hurricanes that formed or entered central pacific region these numbers are well above long term average of four tropical cyclones two hurricanes one tropical storm and two depressions exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an el nino ongoing at time only named storm to make landfall this year was hurricane rosa which killed four people in western mexico and forced over 400 to be evacuated other notable storms include hurricane olivia a high end category 4 system three category 5 hurricanes emilia gilma and john both john and hurricane li existed in two of three basins east and west of pacific ocean this season marked end of northeastern pacific s most recent active period which began in 1982 and at time included five most active pacific hurricane seasons beginning in 1995 multi decadal factors switched to a phase that suppressed pacific hurricane activity after 1994 pacific hurricane seasons were generally been below normal with exception of 1997 until 2014 1994 pacific hurricane season set several records first three hurricanes reached category 5 intensity on saffir simpson hurricane scale setting a record later tied in 2002 then tied again in 2018 hurricane john lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in central pacific a record shared with 1992 season until 2015 season broke record finally of four most intense hurricanes recorded in central pacific three of them occurred this season season began with formation of tropical depression one e on june 18 and ended with dissipation of tropical depression nona on october 26 no named systems formed in may three in june four in july five in august six in september two in october and none in november total length of season from formation of first depression to dissipation of last was 130 days accumulated cyclone energy ace is a measure of how active a hurricane season is it is calculated by squaring windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm force winds every six hours summing results and dividing that total by 104 as a tropical cyclone does not have gale force winds until it becomes a tropical storm tropical depressions are not included in these tables for all storms ace is given to three significant figures ace in east pacific proper 140degw to north america is given ace in central pacific international date line to 140degw is given in brackets table includes ace for li and john only during those storm s time east of dateline their ace west of dateline is part of totals of 1994 typhoon season national hurricane center uses ace to rank hurricane seasons as above normal near normal and below normal it defines below normal as having an ace less than 95 104 kt2 kt2 it defines above normal as having an ace above 150 104 kt2 along with numbers of any two of following above average tropical storms 15 hurricanes 9 or major hurricanes 4 it defines near normal as having an ace between 100 104 kt2 and 150 104 kt2 or an ace above 150 104 kt2 with fewer than two of numbers of following above average tropical storms 15 hurricanes 9 or major hurricanes 4 excluding central pacific there were a total of seventeen tropical storms nine hurricanes and five major hurricanes altogether total ace of this season was 185 104 kt2 this qualifies this season as above normal systems tropical storm aletta tropical depression one e formed from an area of disturbed weather on june 18 it strengthened to tropical storm aletta next day it continued intensifying and reached its peak intensity on june 20 vertical wind shear began to weaken storm thereafter weakening trend continued weakening aletta to a depression on june 21 system dissipated june 23 aletta s remnant low however could be tracked on satellite images for days following storm low finally dissipated north of hawaii aletta never affected land and no damage or casualties were reported tropical storm bud tropical depression two e formed on june 27 about south southwest of tip of baja california peninsula depression headed west northwest gradually turned to northwest and strengthened into tropical storm bud on june 27 early next day bud peaked in intensity shear caused by a nearby upper level low slowly weakened bud later on june 28 a second center of circulation developed two centers started a fujiwhara interaction second center then became dominant and first one vanished this confused structure is similar to what happened to 1993 s tropical storm arlene this confused structure also weakened bud to a tropical depression on afternoon of same day second center formed bud then headed westward over cool waters and dissipated on june 29 tropical storm bud spent its entire life over open ocean far from land areas no casualties or damage was reported hurricane carlotta tropical depression that would be carlotta formed on june 28 it quickly became tropical storm carlotta and a large eye became visible because of this nhc upgraded storm to a hurricane carlotta peaked in intensity on july 1 as a hurricane it gradually weakened as it moved into cooler waters dissipating on july 5 carlotta did not threaten land carlotta buffeted socorro island with sustained winds of on june 30 other than there carlotta caused no damage or deaths tropical storm daniel on july 8 a disturbance located about southwest of southern tip of baja california peninsula developed a circulation and became tropical depression four e convection increased and depression strengthened into tropical storm daniel upper level outflow improved and daniel peaked in intensity on july 9 daniel slowly declined as it continued westward it entered central pacific on july 11 wind shear weakened daniel as it approached big island and by july 15 had degenerated into an open wave when daniel was approaching hawaii moderate surf of impacted south and southeast shores of big island on july 13 and 14 daniel s remnants also passed about south of south point hawaii on july 15 that day they caused rainfall on windward slopes of big island locally reaching no reports of damage or casualties were received hurricane emilia on july 16 an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave organized into tropical depression five e it strengthened into tropical storm emilia later that day it moved west northwest and strengthened into a hurricane it entered central pacific on july 17 it continued intensifying reaching category 5 intensity on july 19 first category 5 pacific hurricane since ava emilia started weakening quickly on july 21 it weakened to a tropical storm on july 23 and dissipated two days later emilia passed south of hawaiian islands producing swells of in height near puna and ka u coasts winds caused minor damage and rain was moderate no one was killed tropical storm fabio a tropical depression formed on july 19 later that day it strengthened into tropical storm fabio fabio headed generally west or northwestward it entered central pacific as a tropical depression and dissipated on july 24 fabio s remnants brought locally heavy rainfall to hawaii reaching no one was killed and there was no damage hurricane gilma part of a tropical wave organized into a tropical depression on july 21 it headed westward and out to sea strengthening into a tropical storm next day gilma rapidly strengthened and became a hurricane exactly one day after it was named it continued to intensify as it entered central pacific shortly after entering central pacific gilma reached category 5 intensity on saffir simpson hurricane scale second of season it then suddenly weakened for unexplained reasons and weakened into a tropical storm on july 27 it became a depression three days after that and dissipated on july 31 hurricane gilma had minor impact on johnston atoll that atoll received light rain wind gusts to near gale force and surf no casualties or damage were reported hurricane gilma was second most intense pacific hurricane at time as of 2019 it is tied with hurricane as tenth most intense gilma is also strongest july storm in eastern or central pacific hurricane li a tropical disturbance southwest of cabo san lucas organized into tropical depression eight e on july 31 it headed west northwest without strengthening much and crossed into central pacific on august 2 eight e developed a second center of circulation which became dominant and then became bound up in intertropical convergence zone eight e then became disorganized with multiple centers of circulation and advisories were discontinued on august 5 depression s remains continued their westward path well south of hawaiian islands depression regenerated on august 8 it soon strengthened into a tropical storm and was named li which is hawaiian for lee li approached dateline on its generally westward heading just before crossing it intensified into a minimal category 1 hurricane it crossed dateline on august 12 and became a storm in 1994 pacific typhoon season wind shear from a tropical upper tropospheric trough weakened back into a tropical storm as it crossed dateline and joint typhoon warning center downgraded li with its first advisory li stayed a tropical storm until august 16 where it weakened into a tropical depression system then began recurving and dissipated on august 18 a weakening tropical depression li caused showers on wake island other than there li had no impact on any land and no casualties or damage were reported hurricane li is one of only six tropical cyclones to exist on all three tropical cyclone basins in pacific ocean it is also one of only six systems to form as a depression in east pacific but be named in central others are lala iniki lana ela and ulika tropical storm hector on august 7 a tropical depression formed from a tropical wave a few hundred miles south of baja california it became tropical storm hector quickly and as it paralleled coast of mexico it began to weaken dissipating on august 10 no damage was reported anywhere tropical storm hector was forecast to approach baja california peninsula a tropical storm watch was issued for part of peninsula on august 8 it was lifted later same day hector s most significant impact was rain tropical storm dumped rain along a discontinuous zone of coastal and inland mexico highest point maxima were at cerro de ortega and at santiago no damage or casualties were reported tropical depression one c an area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on august 9 while located southeast of hilo hawaii depression moved westward without organizing and dissipated on august 14 moisture from system produced heavy rainfall over island of hawaii totaling to over flooding closed all major roads in hilo and was considered worst flooding in 40 years rainfall destroyed two homes and damaged 214 14 severely it also damaged roads and businesses damage throughout island totaled to 5 million 1994 usd usd flooding occurred in maui as well where landslides blocked portions of hana highway one c s point maximum of makes it hawaii s ninth wettest known tropical cyclone hurricane ileana a disturbance that was part of intertropical convergence zone developed several centers of circulation after it organized it separated from itcz and became tropical depression eleven e on august 10 while system was about south southeast of southern tip of baja california peninsula it was upgraded to tropical storm ileana at second advisory at same time as john next storm an eye appeared and ileana became a hurricane on august 12 it began weakening almost immediately thereafter as it passed over cooler waters and encountered increasing wind shear ileana was a tropical storm on august 13 and next day it was a dissipating swirl low level clouds located about west of punta eugenia although ileana paralleled coast of mexico watches and warnings were not issued because winds of tropical storm force were not expected to affect land no one was killed and there was no damage reported in association with this cyclone hurricane john tropical depression ten e formed on august 11 south of mexico it headed generally westward and was upgraded into a tropical storm twelve hours after it formed and was named john john fluctuated in strength as it headed west always managing to stay at tropical storm strength on august 20 steady intensification began and john was a major hurricane when it entered central pacific it continued westward reaching category 5 intensity on august 23 it passed around south of hawaii and passed just north of johnston atoll on august 26 john stayed at hurricane intensity until it crossed dateline on august 28 becoming a typhoon of 1994 pacific typhoon season after weakening into a tropical storm john recurved looped and recurved again it reintensified and was a hurricane when it recrossed dateline to reenter central pacific john headed north northeast until it went extratropical on september 10 thirty one days after it formed ahead of hurricane 1100 people at johnston atoll evacuated on atoll john caused 15 million 1994 usd usd in damage no deaths were reported other than on johnston hurricane john had minor effects in hawaii its remnants also affected alaska hurricane john was longest lasting and farthest traveling tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history it is also one of six tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of pacific ocean an uncommon west to east dateline crosser and one of few tropical cyclone to cross dateline more than once hurricane kristy on august 28 tropical depression thirteen e formed about southwest of cabo san lucas mexico it was named tropical storm kristy on august 30 as it crossed into central pacific a banding type eye formed and it became a hurricane twelve hours later it reached category 2 intensity kristy weakened steadily from that point due to wind shear it passed about south of hawaii and dissipated on september 5 lowest central pressure of kristy is unknown last estimate was made when kirsty was still a tropical storm as it approached hawaiian islands a high surf advisory and a high wind warning were issued for big island of hawaii no damage or deaths were reported in association with this system its remnants crossed 180th meridian very early on september 7 and was absorbed by a tropical depression which became typhoon melissa in western pacific basin hurricane lane same tropical wave that spawned tropical depression five in atlantic became tropical depression fourteen e on september 3 it quickly became tropical storm lane a high pressure ridge centered itself north of lane keeping storm on a westward track this brought lane into very favorable conditions and lane intensified when tropical storm reached hurricane strength it entered a phase of rapid intensification reaching winds of about making it a category four hurricane high pressure ridge shifted eastward and allowed lane to enter unfavorable conditions lane dissipated on september 10 national hurricane center hurricane lane retrieved on march 8 2007 tropical storm mele a tropical disturbance became tropical depression two c on september 6 it reached tropical storm strength next day being named mele name mele means song in hawaiian language and is also hawaiian form of mary mele headed west northwest and weakened back into a tropical depression on september 9 it dissipated later that day without incident tropical storm miriam miriam formed from a weak disturbance on september 15 it strengthened slightly into tropical storm miriam and dissipated on september 21 having led an uneventful life without impact in an interesting occurrence low level remnants of miriam were still visible for weeks after storm dissipated near 140degw tropical storm norman a tropical depression formed on september 19 and became tropical storm norman next day after tracking northwest it began to turn north in response to a trough and convection began to diminish norman dissipated on september 22 without having ever affected land hurricane olivia hurricane olivia ultimately formed from a disturbance that had separated from intertropical convergence zone and become distinct by september 19 disturbance slowly headed westward and it organized into a tropical depression on september 22 while located about south of southern tip of baja california peninsula depression headed west northwestwards and strengthened into tropical storm olivia on september 22 it steadily intensified and was a hurricane on september 24 it then rapidly strengthened into a powerful major hurricane it slowly curled to northwest as it was observed by noaa research aircraft olivia peaked in intensity on september 25 meanwhile a large cyclone off extreme southern part of california induced a northward path as olivia started a small anticyclonic loop wind shear began to weaken hurricane when olivia was finished loop it had weakened to a tropical storm it then headed westward it weakened into a tropical depression on september 28 and dissipated next day no impact was reported at time olivia was third most intense pacific hurricane on record it has since dropped to eleventh storm also had lowest barometric pressure of a category 4 pacific hurricane on record in 2001 hurricane juliette joined olivia as most intense category 4 hurricane on record in 2014 hurricane odile beat both storms when it attained a minimum pressure of 918 at time olivia was also most intense september hurricane but was surpassed by hurricane linda in 1997 and is currently third most intense september hurricane in pacific basin tropical storm paul a nearly stationary cluster of thunderstorms and convection that had been hanging around since september 15 and escaped destruction by tropical storm miriam organized into tropical depression eighteen e on september 24 it was located between miriam s remnants and developing olivia it became tropical storm paul on afternoon of september 25 it peaked in intensity on september 27 then upper outflow from nearby olivia started shearing tropical cyclone paul had been completely destroyed by september 30 tropical cyclone never threatened land and consequently no damage or deaths were reported hurricane rosa an area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on october 8 it had trouble organizing and advisories were discontinued for a while cyclone finally became a tropical storm on october 11 and was named rosa it moved glacially but eventually a trough steered rosa north and then northeast rosa intensified quickly peaking at category 2 intensity just before landfall near la concepcion on morning of october 14 rosa quickly decayed over mountains of mexico and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through united states spreading moisture on october 12 a hurricane watch was issued for coast from culiacan to manzanillo and baja california peninsula south of latitude at same time a tropical storm warning was issued from manzanillo to on october 14 a hurricane warning was issued for coast between culiacan and cabo corrientes jalisco and a tropical storm warning south of cabo corrientes to manzanillo all watches and warnings were lifted later that day four deaths two in each of nayarit and durango were reported four people were missing in sinaloa all of deaths were due to drowning more than 100 000 people had their homes damaged in nayarit telephone poles and power lines were downed in sinaloa rain caused landslides and flash flooding in mountainous areas in jalisco mudslides forced evacuation of 400 people from two coastal villages highest rainfall total in mexico was at mesa de pedro pablo moisture rosa sent into united states was a contributing factor in record rains in parts of southeastern texas from october 15 to 19 those rains caused flooding that killed 22 people destroyed over 3000 homes and caused us 700 million in damage tropical storm nona tropical depression three c formed on october 21 in central pacific basin it traveled westward for about 4 days before strengthening to tropical storm nona on october 25 name nona is hawaiian for latin name spelled same way nona immediately weakened back into a tropical depression upper level westerlies from a nearby trough destroyed depression on october 26 no deaths or damage were reported nona was a tropical storm for six hours minimum possible time other systems on august 14 an area of convection organized enough to be considered a tropical depression it was steered by john s circulation and it was never expected to strengthen much because it was close to cool waters cyclone drifted north then northeast north again northwest and then west national hurricane center declared depression dissipated on august 15 depression had no effects anywhere according to joint typhoon warning center and japan meteorological agency on october 21 a tropical depression formed west of international dateline and soon exited cphc s area of responsibility system subsequently became tropical storm yuri storm names following names were used for named storms that formed in northeastern pacific ocean during 1994 names that were not assigned this season are marked in gray no names were retired so this same list was used again in 2000 season this is
