anglesey central railway welsh lein amlwch amlwch line was a standard gauge railway in anglesey wales connecting port of amlwch and county town of llangefni with north wales coast line at gaerwen built as an independent railway railway opened in portions from 1864 to 1867 due to financial troubles railway was sold to london and north western railway in 1876 which invested significantly in infrastructure operation continued under various companies during 20th century but passenger services were withdrawn in 1964 as part of beeching axe industrial freight services continued until 1993

railway of which section from to holyhead opened in 1848 two years before britannia bridge was finished richards 1972 page 99 chester and holyhead railway surveyed a branch to llangefni in 1852 but chose not to proceed baughan 1991 page 82 george stephenson notably reported that line was not worth building idea of a local railway was still of interest to people of anglesey a public meeting was held in llangefni on 5 july 1858 to popularise idea of building a railway leaving main line at gaerwen running north to amlwch west to cemaes bay then south through to rejoin main line at valley this ambitious scheme did not gain enough support to proceed although some landowners offered to exchange land for shares rear 1993 pages 7 8 proposals changed into a railway from gaerwen to amlwch with another meeting in llangefni on 1 august 1861 david davies and his partner ezra roberts offered to build line at a cost of ps6 000 per mile complete except for rolling stock or for ps5 000 per mile with company to purchase land and meet preliminary and parliamentary expenses this proposal won favour with fledgling company but it was not taken up london and north western railway lnwr who had taken over chester and holyhead railway were approached in 1862 lnwr were not interested so railway was financed independently 1863 1876 independent operation anglesey central railway act 1863 26 27

central railway s expense rear 1993 page 8 line opened for freight as far as llangefni on 16 december 1864 a special train carried directors and friends from bangor to a temporary station in llangefni in 37 minutes a banquet was held at bull hotel for 100 guests with celebrations continuing that evening in bangor line was surveyed by captain rich on behalf of board of trade in february and they approved line for passenger traffic on 8 march 1865 passenger services started four days later with an engine and carriages loaned by lnwr in six months to december 1865 railway carried 18 839 passengers and 3 866 tons of freight 3 928 t excluding livestock baughan 1991 page 83 further construction of line was limited by a lack of funds russell asked lnwr to adopt line in august 1865 to no avail an act of 1866 gave permission to raise a further ps20 000 with loans of ps6 600 after raising this capital line was opened to llanerchymedd in 1866 with temporary station at llangefni replaced by a permanent structure half a mile further on captain rich when surveying line noted that curves and gradients were severe and recommended that line be worked at moderate speed he also noted lack of turntables and company s intention to use fairlie engines on line thumb mountaineer a double fairlie engine was used in 1866 but was not a success 1866 act also gave anglesey central railway acr right to authorise dickson to lease or work line or to lease or sell line to lnwr dickson did indeed undertake to operate services he requested permission from lnwr to run services through to bangor but they refused and passengers had to continue to change at gaerwen act authorised a branch from rhosgoch to cemaes but this was not built fairlie engine mountaineer was in use on line in april 1866 but by october 1867 it was in use on neath and brecon railway of which dickson was also contractor and whose traffic he was working neath and brecon s 0 6 0 miers also operated on acr under name anglesea neither of those engines was considered successful baughan 1991 page 84 railway reaches amlwch final section to amlwch was surveyed by now major rich in january 1867 after remedial work it opened to passengers throughout on 3 june 1867 although first freight train to amlwch was on 10 september 1866 according to amlwch s first stationmaster mr o dew line had been built single track throughout with only run around loop provided at amlwch meaning that trains could not pass each other to ensure safe working staff and ticket system was used in three sections gaerwen llangefni llangefni llanerchymedd and llanerchymedd amlwch using a and b configured staffs alternately no turntable was built as intended fairlie engines would not require one when lnwr provided engines they used tank engines where possible rather than an engine with a tender christensen 1991 page 367 mona mine operating copper works at parys mountain switched from exporting ore by sea to by railway in 1865 two years before it reached amlwch delivery prices per ton of ore were 25 shillings to london 20 shillings to birmingham and 14 shillings and 2 pence to liverpool when carried from gaerwen by lnwr

william dew secretary of company writing in april of that year stated that affairs of railway are in such a critical and pressing state acr turned once again to lnwr asking them to work line these negotiations failed but lnwr did agree to lend an engine and carriages once again t l kettle suggested to chairperson in 1870 that sale to lnwr would be desirable on account of company s debts financial situation restricted company s ambitions on 16 december 1875 as a result of legal action by independent locomotive manufacturers an injunction was issued restricting lnwr from manufacturing locomotive engines or other rolling stock for sale or hire on other than their own railway in january 1876 lnwr informed acr that they could no longer lend engine in use as a result of recent court case three choices were suggested by lnwr that line be bought outright that a proper working arrangement be made or that acr might buy engine and carriages now on line acr were not in a position to buy stock and made arrangements for sale of railway 1876 1923 london and north western railway thumb lnwr ticket for travel to bangor a nearby hub on railway network after a decade of operating as an independent company line was transferred to london and north western railway in 1876 for ps80 000 this was enacted by anglesey central railway transfer act of 1876 39 40 vict cap and lnwr assumed control of line on 1 july 1876 a survey conducted by lnwr found that bridges and culverts were in a fair condition but stations were dirty fences were decayed rails needed replacing some sleepers were rotten and ballast was soft and baughan 1991 page 85 lnwr addressed these problems over coming years a short passing loop was built at llangefni station in 1877 for engines to run round but at only long it was not of much use for allowing passenger trains to pass each other a refuge siding was built for freight trains at llanerchymedd in 1878 along with an engine shed in amlwch in 1882 new station buildings replaced basic wooden sheds at holland arms llangwyllog and rhosgoch as well as development of junction at gaerwen into a full double junction and a second signal cabin built there

would operate between llangefni and gaerwen while main branch train was on round trip from llangefni to amlwch and back foster 1994 page 30 passing loop at llangwyllog lack of a passing loop suitable for passenger trains on amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours coordinating this limited timetable with main line services through gaerwen was difficult and passengers could face a long wait on occasions to make branch line workings more flexible a passing loop was proposed for llangwyllog in march 1914 work was completed for summer timetables foster 1994 page 32 this
