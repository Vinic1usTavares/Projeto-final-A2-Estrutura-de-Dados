john endecott also spelled endicott before 1600 15 march 1664 5 regarded as one of fathers of new england john b moore memoirs of american governors new york gates and stedman 136 nassau street 1846 p 362 was longest serving governor of massachusetts bay colony which became state of massachusetts he served a total of 16 years including most of last 15 years of his life when not serving as governor he was involved in other elected and appointed positions from 1628 to 1665 except for single year of 1634 endecott was a zealous and somewhat hotheaded puritan with separatist attitudes toward anglican church this sometimes put him at odds with nonconformist views that were dominant among colony s early leaders which became apparent when he gave shelter to vocally separatist roger williams endecott also argued that women should dress modestly and that men should keep their hair short and issued judicial decisions banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well with those of puritans he notoriously defaced english flag because he saw st george s cross as a symbol of papacy and had four quakers put to death for returning to colony after their banishment an expedition he led in 1636 is considered opening offensive in pequot war which practically destroyed pequot tribe as an entity endecott used some of his properties to propagate fruit trees a pear tree he planted still lives in danvers massachusetts he also engaged in one of earliest attempts to develop a mining industry in colonies when copper ore was found on his land his name is found on a rock in lake winnipesaukee carved by surveyors sent to identify massachusetts colony s northern border in 1652 places and institutions are named for him and like many early colonists he has several notable descendants life most of what is known about john endecott s origins is at best circumstantial biographers of 19th century believed he was from dorset town of dorchester because of his significant later association with people from that place endicott p 11 in early 20th century historian roper lethbridge proposed that endecott was born circa 1588 in or near chagford in devon in 16th century prominent endecott family together with and owned most of mines around stannary town of chagford which might if he is indeed from this family explain his interest in developing copper mining based on this evidence chagford now has a house from period named in endecott s honour however more recent research by new england historic genealogical society has identified problems with lethbridge s claims which they dispute anderson p 2 644 according to their research endecott may have been born in or near chagford but there is no firm evidence for this nor is there evidence that identifies his parents they conclude based on available evidence that he was probably born no later than 1600 a john endecott was active in devon early in 17th century but there is no firm evidence connecting him to this endecott mayo pp 6 7 very little is known of endecott s life before his association with colonisation efforts in 1620s he was known to sir edward coke and may have come to know roger williams through this connection mayo p 4 he was highly literate and spoke french some early colonial documents refer to him as captain endecott indicating some military experience and other records suggest he had some medical training endicott p 12 settlement in new world in march 1627 8in julian calendar then in use in england year began on 25 march to avoid confusion with dates in gregorian calendar then in use in other parts of europe dates between january and march were often written with both years dates in this article are in julian calendar unless otherwise noted endecott was one of seven signatories to a land grant given to new england company for a plantation in massachusetts or new england company by earl of warwick on behalf of plymouth council for new england mayo pp 7 12 council was at time umbrella organisation overseeing english colonisation efforts in north america between 40 and 48 degrees latitude bremer p 151 endecott was chosen to lead first expedition and sailed for new world aboard abigail with fifty or so planters and servants on 20 june 1628 mayo p 12 settlement they organized was first called after local indian tribe but was eventually renamed salem in 1629 mayo p 15 area was already occupied by settlers of failed dorchester company some of whose backers also participated in new england company this group of earlier settlers led by roger conant had migrated from a settlement on cape ann near present day gloucester massachusetts after it was abandoned mayo pp 13 15 endecott was not formally named governor of new colony until it was issued a royal charter in 1629 at that time he was appointed governor by company s council in london and matthew craddock was named company s governor in london mayo p 22 thumb left endicott pear tree in 1997 endecott s responsibility was to establish colony and to prepare it for arrival of additional settlers endicott p 28 winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in england and he called on plymouth colony for medical assistance mayo p 49 his wife who had been ill on voyage over died that winter endicott p 26 other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among colony s settlers dividing between nonconformists and separatists and poor relations with thomas morton whose failed wessagusset colony and libertine practices which including a maypole and dancing were anathema to conservative puritanism practiced by most settlers in massachusetts bay and plymouth colonies early in his term as governor he visited abandoned site of morton s colony and had maypole taken down bremer p 166 when one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by colonial leadership he had their leaders summarily sent back to england moore pp 350 351 early 1630s endecott s first tenure as governor came to an end in 1630 with arrival of john winthrop and colonial charter company had reorganised itself relocating its seat to colony itself with winthrop as its sole governor mayo pp 51 52 after seeing conditions at salem winthrop decided to relocate colony s seat at mouth of charles river where he founded what is now city of boston mayo pp 54 58 endecott who was chosen as one of governor s assistants a precursor to later notion of a governor s council chose to remain in salem where he was one of its leading citizens for rest of his life serving in roles as town councilor and militia leader in addition to statewide roles as militia leader magistrate deputy governor and governor he established a plantation called orchard in salem village now known as danvers where he cultivated seedlings of fruit trees one particular pear tree brought over as a sapling on one of early settlement convoys still lives and bears fruit it is known as endicott pear tree mayo pp 72 76 thumb right upright 1 2 illustration by howard pyle showing endecott defacing english flag pyle has incorrectly depicted flag as a union jack when flag at time only contained st george s cross in early 1630s religious conflict between nonconformists and separatists was primary source of political disagreement in colony and it was embodied by churches established in boston and salem salem church adhered to separatist teachings which sought a complete break with church of england while nonconformist teachings which were held by winthrop and most of colonial leadership in boston sought to reform anglican church from within mayo pp 63 64 arrival in boston in 1631 of roger williams an avowed separatist heightened this conflict authorities there banished him and he first went to salem where due to endecott s intervention he was offered a position as a teacher in local church when word of this reached boston endecott was criticised for supporting williams who was banished from colony mayo pp 65 67 williams went to plymouth but returned to salem a few years later becoming church s unofficial pastor following death of samuel skelton in 1634 boston authorities called for his arrest after he made what they viewed as treasonous and heretical statements he fled eventually establishing providence rhode island mayo p 92 during this time endecott argued that women should be veiled in church mayo p 83 and controversially defaced local militia s flag because it bore st george s cross which williams claimed was a symbol of papacy mayo pp 84 85 this action is celebrated in nathaniel hawthorne s story endicott and red cross where writer presents tension between endecott as a symbol of religious intolerance and as an emblem of heroic resistance to foreign domination of new england wright p 80 endecott did this at a time when privy council of king charles i was examining affairs in massachusetts and colonial administration was concerned that a strong response was needed to prevent loss of colonial charter bremer pp 238 239 endecott was censured for rashness of his action and not for act itself and deprived of holding any offices for one year 1635 was only year in which he held no office mayo pp 87 90 committee managing colonial militia voted that year to stop using english flag as its standard bremer p 239 following incident and refusal of colonial assembly to grant salem additional land on marblehead neck because of williams presence in salem salem church circulated a letter to other churches in colony calling legislative act a heinous sin mayo p 90 although authorship of letter is uncertain endecott defended letter when summoned to boston and was consequently jailed for a day after he came and acknowledged his fault he was discharged mayo p 91 pequot war in 1636 boat of massachusetts trader john oldham was seen anchored off block island swarming with indians indians fled at approach of investigating colonists and oldham s body was found below main deck cave p 104 attackers were at time believed to be from tribes affiliated with narragansetts but narragansett leaders claimed that those responsible had fled to protection of pequots bremer p pp 105 107 at time pequots were aggressively expansionist in their dealings with surrounding native tribes including narragansett but had generally kept peace with english colonists of present day southern new england accusation of angered massachusetts authorities then under governor henry vane who were already upset that pequots had earlier failed to turn over men implicated in killing another trader on connecticut river this second perceived affront produced calls in massachusetts for action against pequots cave pp 100 107 109 in august 1636 governor vane placed endecott at head of a 90 man force to extract justice from pequots cave p 109 thumb left 240px engraving depicting endecott s men landing on block island endecott s instructions were to go to block island where he was to kill all of indian men and take captive women and children he was then to go to pequots on mainland where he was to make three demands first that killers of oldham and other trader be surrendered second that a payment of one thousand fathoms of wampum be made and third that some pequot children be delivered to serve as hostages endecott executed these instructions with zeal although most of indians on block island only briefly opposed english landing there he spent two days destroying their villages crops and canoes most of indians on island successfully eluded english searches for them english reports claimed as many as 14 indians were killed but narragansetts only reported one dead cave pp 111 112 endecott then sailed for saybrook an english settlement at mouth of connecticut river lion gardiner leader there angrily informed endecott when he learned of mission s goals you come hither to raise these wasps around my ears and then you will take wing and flee away cave p 113 after some discussion and delays due to bad weather gardiner and a company of his men agreed to accompany massachusetts force to raid pequot harvest stores when they arrived at pequot village near mouth of thames river they returned friendly greetings of inhabitants with stony silence eventually a pequot sachem rowed out to meet them english delivered their demands threatening war if they did not receive satisfaction cave p 114 when sachem left to discuss matter in village endecott gave a promise to await his return however shortly after sachem left he began landing his fully armed men on shore sachem rushed back claiming senior tribal leaders were away on long island endecott responded that this was a lie and ordered an attack on village cave p 116 most of villagers got away and once again expedition s activity was reduced to destroying village and seizing its crop stores gardiner reported that t he bay men killed not a man cave p 117 after completing this work endecott and massachusetts men boarded their boats to return to boston leaving gardiner and his men to finish removal of crops pequots regrouped and launched an attack on gardiner s party whose armor protected them from but their escape was nevertheless difficult cove pp 117 118 historian alfred cave describes endecott s actions as a heavy handed provocation of an indian war cove p 119 all of surrounding colonies protested action complaining that lives of their citizens were placed in jeopardy by raid since pequots had previously been relatively peaceful with english endecott s raid had effect gardiner predicted and feared communities on connecticut river were attacked in april 1637 and gardiner was virtually besieged in saybrook by pequot forces cave pp 135 136 endecott had no further role in war which ended with destruction of pequots as a tribe their land was divided up by colonies and their indian allies in 1638 treaty of hartford and surviving tribespeople were distributed among their neighbors cave pp 162 163 later terms as governor endecott was elected deputy governor in p 151 and in this role was one of signatories to massachusetts body of liberties which enumerated a number of individual rights available to all colonists and presaged united states bill of rights mayo pp 150 p 51 next few years were quiet although rumors of war with indians led to formation in 1643 of new england confederation designed to facilitate united action by new england colonies against common external threats as well as internal matters such as dealing with escaped slaves and fugitives from justice mayo p 161 in 1643 governor winthrop became embroiled in a controversy over propriety of taking sides in a power struggle going on in neighbouring french acadia endecott pointed out that he should have let french fight amongst themselves without english involvement as this would weaken them both mayo p 166 1644 governor s election became a referendum on winthrop s policy endecott was elected governor with winthrop as his deputy mayo p 170 during his one year term he oversaw division of colony into four counties suffolk essex middlesex and norfolk mayo p 172 ascent of salem based endecott also prompted an attempt by other salem residents to have colonial capital relocated there attempt was rejected by governor s council of assistants mayo pp 173 174 fallout from english civil war begun in 1642 also permeated boston during endecott s tenure two ships one with a royalist captain other with a parliamentarian captain arrived in boston and parliamentarian sought to seize royalist ship after much deliberation endecott s councils essentially adopted support of parliamentarian position reserving right to declare independence if parliament should hereafter be a malignant spirit mayo pp 177 178 parliamentarian was permitted to seize royalist vessel and colony also began seizing royalist vessels that came into port mayo pp 179 183 thomas dudley was elected governor in 1645 with winthrop as his deputy endecott as a consolation was given command of colonial militia reporting to governor mayo p 188 he was also once again made a governor s assistant and was chosen to represent colony to confederation in 1646 mayo p 193 threat of indian conflicts in neighbouring colonies prompted colony to raise its defensive profile in which endecott played a leading role mayo pp 189 192 winthrop was reelected governor in 1646 after his death in 1649 endecott succeeded him as governor by annual re elections endecott served nearly continuously until his death in 1664 5 for two periods 1650 1651 and 1654 1655 he was deputy governor mayo p 200 in 1639 endecott had been granted several hundred acres of land north of salem in what is now boxford and topsfield tract was not formally laid out until 1659 but as early as 1651 endecott was granted an additional three hundred acres of land to tend furtherance of a copper works that was adjacent to his land topsfield historical society p 17 endecott hired richard leader an early settler who had done pioneering work at an iron works in nearby lynn but efforts to develop site for copper processing failed a persistent shortage of coinage in all of colonies prompted massachusetts to establish a mint on may 27 1652 and begin production of coins from its silver reserves http www coins nd edu intro html this act solved a practical problem but colony had no authority to do so from crown adams p 304 although this did not become an issue while endecott was governor it eventually became a source of controversy with crown and mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682 american antiquarian society pp 294 301 colony s boundaries expanded somewhat during endecott s tenure mainly in 1650s in addition to formally claiming present day stonington connecticut as spoils from pequot war endecott sought to establish colony s northern boundary in 1652 he sent a commission with surveyors to locate most northerly point on merrimack river since colonial grant defined its northern border as north of that river these surveyors were led by indian guides to outlet of lake winnipesaukee which was claimed by guides to be source of merrimack mayo pp 221 223 at that location party incised an inscription on a rock that survives and is now located in a small new hampshire state park when this survey line was extended eastward boundary was determined to fall on coast at casco bay and colony thus claimed most of what is now southern maine and new hampshire mayo pp 225 226 religious intolerance thumb right upright mary dyer being led to gallows in 1660 painting by howard pyle one written statement made early in his tenure in may 1649 showed endecott s dislike of a fashionable trend toward long hair forasmuch as wearing of long haire after manner of ruffians and barbarous indians hath begun to invade new england contrary to rule of gods word wee magistrates who have subscribed signed this paper doe declare and manifest our dislike and detestation against wearing of such long haire mayo p 201 in 1651 he presided over a legal case in which three people were accused of being baptists a practice that had been banned in colony in 1644 mayo pp 212 213 in convicting john clarke and sentencing him to either pay a fine or be whipped endecott according to clarke s account of exchange told clarke that he deserved death and said he would not have such trash brought into his jurisdiction mayo p 214 clarke refused to pay fine it was paid by friends against his wishes and he returned to rhode island mayo p 215 of three men convicted only obadiah holmes was whipped john crandall out on bond returned to rhode island with clarke mayo pp 216 217 when oliver cromwell consolidated his control over england in early 1650s he began a crackdown on religious communities that dissented from his religious views mayo p 236 this notably included baptists and quakers and these groups began their own migration to north american colonies to escape persecution those that first arrived in boston in 1656 were promptly deported by endecott s deputy richard bellingham while endecott was in salem more quakers arrived while endecott was resident in boston and he had them imprisoned pending trial and deportation mayo p 237 he met several times with quaker mary prince after receiving an outrageous letter from her mayo p 238 meetings were apparently fruitless and she and other quakers were deported following these acts members of new england confederation all adopted measures for prompt removal of quakers from their jurisdictions mayo p 240 measures adopted were insufficient to prevent influx of these perceived undesirables so harsher measures were enacted repeat offenders were to be punished by having ears cut off and on third offense to have tongue bored through with a hot iron mayo p 241 by 1658 punishment for third offense had been raised to death except they do then and there plainly and publicly renounce their said cursed opinions and devilish tenets in october 1658 death penalty was enacted for second offense in massachusetts mayo p 243 one year later three quakers were arrested and sentenced to death under this law two of them marmaduke stephenson and william robinson were hanged while third mary dyer received a reprieve at last minute mayo p 244 dyer returned to colony in 1660 and under questioning by endecott and other magistrates refused to either recant her beliefs or agree to permanent banishment from colony she was hanged on 1 june 1660 she stephenson robinson and william hanged in 1661 are now known as boston martyrs mayo pp 248 249 severity of these acts was recognized by colonists as problematic and laws were changed so that execution was penalty for fifth offense mayo p 249 poor treatment of quakers and other religious dissenters would be cited as one of reasons for revocation of colonial charter in 1684 adams p 381 endecott s role in treatment of quakers was immortalized by john greenleaf whittier in his poem ballad of cassandra southwick named for another quaker who suffered persecution along with husband lawrence and at least three of her six children daughter provided and sons daniel and josiah while endecott was governor whittier characterized endecott as dark and haughty and exhibiting bitter hate and scorn for quaker henry wadsworth longfellow recreated trial of wenlock christison in john endicott one of three dramatic poems in a collection called new england tragedies longfellow henry w poetical works g routledge and sons 1891 p 498 christison was last quaker endecott sentenced to death for returning to massachusetts after having been banished he was not executed however because law was changed shortly after his sentencing author nathaniel hawthorne described endecott in gentle boy whose title character is six year old son of william and mary dyer as a man of narrow mind and imperfect education and his uncompromising bigotry was made hot and mischievous by violent and hasty passions he exerted his influence indecorously and unjustifiably to compass death of enthusiasts i e quakers and his whole contact in respect to them was marked by brutal cruelty hawthorne nathaniel gentle boy reprinted in maggie a girl of streets and other stories berlin seven seas publishers 1958 p 29 even though puritan colonists of new england were supportive of oliver cromwell s reign in england they were not always receptive to cromwell s suggestions in response to a proposal by cromwell that new englanders migrate to ireland to increase its protestant population massachusetts assembly drafted a polite response signed by endecott indicating that its people were happy where they were mayo p 232 english restoration in july 1660 word arrived in boston that charles ii had been restored to english throne this was an immediate cause for concern in all of colonies that had supported cromwell since their charters might be revoked in boston it created a more difficult problem for edward whalley and william goffe two of regicide commissioners who had voted to execute charles i although charles promised in 1660 declaration of breda that all were pardoned except by act of parliament indemnity and oblivion act of 1660 singled out all of regicides for punishment whalley and goffe moved freely about boston area for some time and endecott refused to order their arrest until word arrived of passage of indemnity act mayo pp 257 259 endecott then issued a warrant for their arrest on 8 march 1661 it is unknown whether whalley and goffe had advance warning of warrant but they fled apparently to new haven area mayo p 260 thumb right upright portrait of charles ii c 1653 endecott s warrant was followed by an order issued by king charles in march and received by endecott in may 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend two fugitives and ship them back to england endecott dutifully obeyed but he appointed two recently arrived royalists to track them down mayo p 261 somewhat predictably their search came up empty and whalley and goffe thus escaped biographer lawrence mayo suggests endecott would have appointed different men for search had he been serious about catching them mayo p 262 opponents to rule of puritans in massachusetts were vocal in airing their complaints to new king among their complaints was fact that charles ascension to power had not been formally announced this only took place in 1661 after endecott received a chastising order from king mayo p 264 this prompted assembly to draft another of several laudatory letters it addressed to king congratulating him on his rise to power mint was claimed to be a bald faced attempt to devalue good english currency some colonists complained that expansion of colony s borders in 1652 was little more than a land grab while others put forward claims of administrative malfeasance with respect to funds provided by crown for christianization of indians and quakers catalogued a long list of grievances mayo pp 265 266 believing that it was best to ignore accusations endecott and other members of old guard opposed sending representatives to london to argue against these charges supporters of idea raised funds in a private subscription and sent a commission to london mayo p 270 colonial mission led by future governor simon bradstreet and pastor john norton was successful and king charles announced that he would renew colonial charter provided colony allowed church of england to practice there mayo p 271 endecott administration dragged its feet on implementation and after months of inaction king sent a commission headed by samuel maverick one of colony s most vocal critics to investigate mayo p 274 endecott had advance warning of what commission was to investigate and took steps to address in form if not in substance some of expected actions charles insisted that all religious dissenters be freed which endecott had done long before maverick s arrival but he did so by deporting them mayo p 277 upon commissioners arrival assembly took up matter of allowing church of england activity in colony they passed a law deliberately using king s language allowing anyone orthodox in religion to practice in colony however they also defined such orthodoxy as consisting of views that were acceptable to local ministers this effectively negated law because there were probably no ministers in colony who would agree that anglicans satisfied their idea of orthodoxy mayo p 279 last years in 1655 massachusetts assembly passed a law requiring its governor to live closer to boston this was probably done in response to endecott s sixth consecutive election as governor endecott was consequently obliged to acquire a residence in boston although he returned to salem frequently boston became his home for rest of his life mayo pp 233 234 endecott died in boston on 15 march 1664 5 although early accounts claim he was buried at boston s king s chapel later evidence has identified his burial site as tomb 189 in granary burying ground mayo p 284 family thumb right upright endecott descendant william crowninshield endicott before he came to colonies in 1628 endecott was married to his first wife anne who was a cousin of governor matthew craddock anderson p 2 643 after her death in new england he was married in 1630 to a woman whose last name was gibson and by 1640 he was married to elizabeth daughter of cogan of somersetshire mayo p 56 it is uncertain whether these represent two different wives or a single wife whose name was elizabeth cogan gibson because of uncertainty concerning his wives it is not known who mother of his two sons was there is only firm evidence that he was already married to elizabeth in 1640 and records that survive for 1630s when his sons were born do not otherwise identify his wife by name endecott s last wife elizabeth was a sister in law of colonial financier and magistrate roger ludlow endecott s two known children were john endecott and dr endecott neither of whom seemingly to his disappointment followed him into public service there is also evidence that endecott fathered another child in his early years in england in about 1635 he arranged funds and instructions for care of a minor also named john endecott mayo pp 68 69 despite his high position endecott was never particularly affluent according to his will several large tracts of land including orchard estate in salem and one quarter of block island were distributed to his wife and sons however it was also noted that some of his books were sold to pay debts mayo p 282 one unexpected legacy left behind by endecott was uncertain boundaries of orchard estate several generations later his descendants were involved in litigation concerning disputed occupancy of part of estate endecott s descendants include massachusetts governor endicott peabody and united states secretary of war william crowninshield endicott his descendants donated family records dating as far back as colonial era to massachusetts historical society in 1930 massachusetts tercentenary was marked by issuance of a medal bearing endecott s likeness it was designed by laura fraser mayo p 285
