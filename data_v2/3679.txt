1976 its owners announced plans to enclose then open air concourses following opening of several other larger malls in area such as tri county mall and northgate mall swifton center consisted of 56 stores at time among which were lerner new york baker shoes and hancock fabrics no renovations had begun by 1978 at which point mall had begun to suffer from deferred maintenance of parking lot and outer structures kroger had also confirmed that it would be relocating to hillcrest square a strip mall under development across street due to a need for a larger store mall s main anchor store changed names again in 1978 when dayton based department store elder beerman acquired mabley carew glazer enterprises of which mall owner general development was a subsidiary submitted a request to

would consist of an exterior cleanup followed by an interior renovation by 1981 swifton center had an occupancy of about 52 percent a figure including mostly local stores which at time were on monthly leases among vacancies were former locations of kroger walgreens and lerner new york edward j debartolo corporation purchased mall in 1985 renaming it to swifton commons debartolo renovated mall s exterior and brought in new tenants such as lane bryant waldenbooks and gold star chili along with a food court at time developers noted that mall s decline was due to a perception of white flight in surrounding neighborhoods a perception seen by developers as unsubstantiated since many of former mall tenants such as kroger and walgreens had relocated across street and not left neighborhood entirely another factor in mall s decline prior to mid 1980s was a lack of escalation clause in leases of original tenants which in turn resulted in deferred maintenance of property and an inability to attract new tenants in order to stay competitive with other area malls debartolo had been selected by glazer enterprises owner jerome glazer to assist in mall renovations and had gotten nearly 7 million in city grants to undergo renovations this was also second time that debartolo had renovated an existing shopping mall which had begun to falter having previously done similar work on cheltenham square now greenleaf at cheltenham in philadelphia pennsylvania grand re opening of mall occurred in september 1985 by which point drugstore j j newberry kinney shoes and casual corner had

stores operated by milwaukee wisconsin based value merchants a dollar store called everything s 1 00 a closeout store called 5 and 10 store and a discount sporting goods store called play outlet in addition elder beerman converted its store to an outlet format which sold closeout merchandise from other elder beerman locations a move which required closing off store s third floor however trio of value merchants stores closed after christmas 1993 and elder beerman outlet closed in late 1995 both due to respective companies filing for bankruptcy second decline and change to jordan crossing swifton commons was foreclosed on in 1996 when debartolo corporation defaulted on loans it was put up for auction at a sheriff s sale in august 1996 but attracted no buyers a second auction in october

real estate company from indianapolis indiana announced plans to buy mall from star bank in 1997 but withdrew their offer in march 1998 by this point mall s uncertain financial state and closure of
