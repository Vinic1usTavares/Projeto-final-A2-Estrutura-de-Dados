trading center at this time interior of oman was ruled by an arab imam but coast on which muscat lay was subject to persian king of hormuz in 1497 portuguese navigator vasco da gama found a route around southern cape of africa and east to india and spice islands portuguese quickly began trying to establish a monopoly on trade in spices silk and other goods they came into conflict with mamluk egypt whose trade with europe through red sea was threatened hormuz was main center for trade route with modern iraq and iran through persian gulf portuguese wanted control of this route too on 10 august 1507 an expedition of six ships under admiral afonso de albuquerque left newly established portuguese base on socotra with hormuz as objective portuguese sailed along oman coast destroying ships and looting towns at which they took after a hard fight portuguese mutilated their captives killed inhabitants regardless of sex or age and despoiled and burned town muscat at first surrendered unconditionally to avoid same fate however people withdrew their submission when reinforcements arrived albuquerque launched a successful assault against muscat he slaughtered most of inhabitants and then plundered and burned town portuguese continued along coast governor of sohar agreed to transfer his allegiance to king of portugal and to pay tribute portuguese arrived at hormuz on 26 september 1507 they took town after fierce resistance on 10 october 1507 albuquerque signed a treaty under which portuguese were free of customs duties and could build a fort and trading factory at hormuz muscat now became a regular port of call for portuguese diogo fernandes de beja came there in 1512 to collect tribute albuquerque now viceroy of india visited in march 1515 in 1520 a fleet of twenty three portuguese ships anchored in harbor en route from red sea to hormuz when a general revolt against portuguese rule over hormuz broke out in november 1521 muscat was one place where portuguese were not attacked portuguese stronghold fort jalali left dominating muscat harbor thumb in 1527 portuguese began to construct a barracks warehouse and chapel at muscat apparently completed in 1531 a force of four ottoman galiots entered harbor in 1546 and bombarded town but did not land to make their base more secure portuguese sent an engineer to build a fort to west of harbor where al mirani stands today portuguese built this first muscat fort in 1550 in april 1552 an ottoman fleet of twenty four galleys and four supply ships under piri reis left suez en route to hormuz aiming to eliminate portuguese presence in region an advance force landed at muscat in july 1552 after an eighteen day siege of muscat town fell and fort was destroyed commander joao de lisboa and 128 portuguese were taken captive main ottoman fleet arrived and combined fleet went on to hormuz portuguese regained town two years later and in 1554 repulsed another attack by turks fort al jalali was

first leveled and rock was scarped calaca built a cistern to hold water for occupants and armed fort with cannon it seems to have been built on older foundations main improvement made by portuguese was to construct a gun deck looking over harbor fort al jalali and twin fort al mirani were both completed between 1586 and 1588 portuguese faced growing competition in region from english and dutch traders in 1622 a joint persian english force took hormuz after this portuguese built forts in other ports on omani coast although they abandoned most of them in 1633 34 concentrating on defending muscat after 1622 portuguese began to strengthen fort al jalali apparently with intention of making it main fort however in 1623 forte do almirante today s fort al mirani was still considered more important of two forts and was used as a residence in hot weather by governor of muscat old muscat from south forts in background thumb in 1625 portuguese built walls and towers around muscat to improve defenses remains of these fortifications exist today muscat was a drain on portuguese finances with its requirement to maintain large military and naval forces to defend it trade did not prosper as hoped since persian market was closed to them until 1630 by then dutch and english dominated trade in persian gulf nasir bin murshid r 1624 49 was first imam of yaruba dynasty in oman

1742 persians made an unsuccessful attempt to take muscat defeated by a stratagem of new imam sultan bin murshid later in 1743 persians returned bringing saif bin sultan ii with them they took town of muscat but al jalali and al mirani forts held out and saif bin sultan ii would not order them to yield omani historians say that persian commander mirza taki invited saif to a banquet on his ship saif became stupefied by wine and his seal was taken from him it was used to forge orders to forts commanders to surrender a ruse that was successful later history ahmad bin said al first ruler of al said
