channel 4 commissioned another animation from tvc studios producer john coates approached dianne jackson and composer howard blake suggesting burningham s picture book granpa blake was initially reluctant due to book s upsetting ending but was convinced after witnessing his own daughter s reaction to her grandfather s death that year fiona collins noted in turning page children s literature in performance and media that while burningham s book is open ended with emily ultimately left alone to contemplate her grandfather s death film offers a less stark interpretation his death is explored through her implied remembrance of him in final scene collins suggests that this was probably because original offered an unremittingly bleak ending that would be difficult for its intended child audience film was entirely financed by channel 4 and cost over one million pounds to make according to coates it was first broadcast on channel on new year s eve 1989 at 6 30pm music musical

sensitive and life affirming animated adaptation film has rarely been repeated and has never been released on dvd perhaps due to its subject matter toonhound review suggest that film takes tone of ending of snowman even further exploring an aspect of life rarely approached in animated form paul madden writing dianne jackson s obituary in 1993 suggests that film was less of immediate popular appeal than snowman but was perhaps more satisfying to her creatively demanding a more subtle approach toonhound notes that just like that film there is a tangible sense of loss at end a loss which builds with repeated viewings you know that granpa won t be playing with emily for much longer and what s more you re aware that he knows this too see also references external links granpa at british
