please don t go for decca records in october 1964 besides morrison there is conflicting information about who participated in session in addition to group s original members guitarist billy harrison bassist alan henderson drummer ronnie millings and keyboard player eric wrixon others have been suggested pat mcauley on keyboards bobby graham on a second drum kit jimmy page on second guitar and peter on keyboards as page biographer george case notes there is a dispute over whether it is page s piercing blues line that defines song if he only played a run harrison had already devised or if page only backed up harrison himself morrison has acknowledged page s participation in early sessions he played rhythm guitar on one thing and doubled a bass riff on other and morrison biographer johnny rogan notes that page doubled distinctive riff already worked out by billy harrison janovitz identifies riff as backbone of arrangement and describes henderson s contribution as an amphetamine rush pulsing two note bass line music critic greil marcus comments that during song s quieter middle passage guitarist session player jimmy page or not seems to be feeling his way into another song
