alt a white mountain rising over a forested bay with a ship thumb monte burney painting of 1871 monte burney is a volcano in southern chile part of its austral volcanic zone which consists of six volcanoes with activity during quaternary this volcanism is linked to subduction of antarctic plate beneath south america plate and scotia plate monte burney is formed by a caldera with a glaciated stratovolcano on its rim this stratovolcano in turn has a smaller caldera an eruption is reported for 1910 with less certain eruptions in 1970 and 1920 tephra analysis has yielded evidence for many eruptions during pleistocene and holocene including two large explosive eruptions during early and mid holocene these eruptions deposited significant tephra layers over patagonia and tierra del fuego name volcano is named after james burney a companion of james cook it is one of many english language placenames in region which are product of numerous english research expeditions such as these by robert fitzroy and phillip parker king in 1825 1830 geography and geomorphology monte burney is on northwest munoz gomera peninsula this area lies in patagonian region of chile which is known for its spectacular fjords volcano lies in commune of natales northwest of punta arenas and approximately southwest of puerto natales area is unpopulated and remote regional andes feature about four areas of volcanic activity from north to south northern volcanic zone central volcanic zone southern volcanic zone and austral volcanic zone aside from main belt so called back arc volcanism occurs as far as behind volcanic arc these volcanic zones are separated by gaps lacking volcanic activity volcanism in region occurs because of southern volcanic zone and austral volcanic zone these contain about 74 volcanoes with post glacial activity they include both monogenetic volcanoes stratovolcanoes and volcanic complexes llaima and villarrica are among most active of these volcanoes southern and austral volcanic zones are separated by a gap without volcanic activity close to chile triple junction strongest volcanic eruption in region occurred 7 750 years before present at cerro hudson volcano which deposited tephra all over southern patagonia and tierra del fuego this eruption probably caused a major depopulation of tierra del fuego temporary disappearance of long range obsidian trade and a change in prevalent lifestyles of region local thumb monte burney seen from space monte burney is most southern stratovolcano of austral volcanic zone six quaternary volcanoes form this long volcanic arc antarctic plate subducts beneath south america plate and scotia plate at a pace of about causing volcanism young age of subducting crust 12 24 million years old gives volcanic rocks a unique chemical composition including adakitic rocks movement between south america plate and scotia plate is taken up by strike slip faulting in terms of composition lautaro aguilera and form one group distinct from burney and reclus lies between these two southeast of monte burney lies fueguino a volcanic field with possible historical activity in 1820 and 1712 fueguino is southernmost holocene volcano in andes large explosive eruptions have occurred at aguilera reclus and burney but due to long distance between these volcanoes and critical infrastructure they are considered a low hazard a wide caldera lies in area which is partly filled by pyroclastic flows some of these flows extend outside caldera on western rim of caldera high monte burney volcano developed it has its own summit caldera and a steep wall on northern side with uncertain origin this volcano is glaciated with a glacier extending between of altitude total glacier volume is about and there might be rock glaciers as well volcano also shows traces of a sector collapse towards south southwest flank vents are also found and generated lava and pyroclastic flows rim of larger caldera is taken up by a ring of lava domes glacial erosion has left a rugged landscape which close to volcano is smoothed by deposits coming from volcano landscape east of caldera is buried by pyroclastic flows and some outcrops in them may be remnants of a pre burney volcano composition flank vents have erupted andesite and dacite belonging to a potassium poor series such a limited range of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect small amount of research conducted on them tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by monte burney during pleistocene according to compositional data holocene eruptions have near identical composition minerals found in burney rocks include amphibole plagioclase and pyroxene foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from patagonian batholith magnesium poor adakites have been found at monte burney fueguino volcanic rocks also include adakites but these are richer in magnesium these adakitic magmas reflect subduction of a relatively hot and young antarctic plate in case of monte burney these magmas then underwent some fractionation during ascent as it was retarded by tectonic regimen which is somewhat compressive climate climate of patagonian region is influenced both by close distance to antarctica and by southern hemisphere westerlies polar cold air outbreaks cool ocean upwelling orographic precipitation and antarctic circumpolar current further affect regional climate about four stages of glaciation have been recognized in area during pleistocene although glacial history is poorly known monte burney was glaciated during last glacial maximum during early holocene glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during antarctic cold reversal a slight expansion is noted during little ice age eruptive history eruptions occurred at monte burney during pleistocene two eruptions around 49 000 500 and 48 000 500 years before present deposited tephra in laguna potrok aike a lake approximately east of monte burney there they reach thicknesses of and respectively other pleistocene eruptions are recorded there at 26 200 and 31 000 years ago with additional eruptions having occurred during marine isotope stage 3 holocene tephras from monte burney have also been found in this lake radiocarbon dating and tephrochronology has evidenced holocene activity at burney 2 320 100 and 7 450 500 bce large plinian eruptions with a volcanic explosivity index of 5 generated mb2 and mb1 tephras respectively these tephras have volumes exceeding for mb1 and for mb2 mb2 eruption may have formed summit caldera as well as tephra deposits exceeding of thickness east of volcano it probably reached antarctica as well as tephra layers in talos ice core in east antarctica show a tephra layer of approximately same age and composition to mb2 soil acidification from tephras of mb2 eruption lasted for millennia after eruption on basis of stalagmite data and lake and peat sediments indicate that this soil acidification caused a decay of nothofagus vegetation in area of seno skyring vegetation changes at lago lynch may have also been caused by burney eruption but there climate change is considered to be a more likely driver a sulfate spike in an antarctic ice core around 4 100 100 years before present may have been caused by mb2 mb2 ash spread in a southeasterly direction in comparison to easterly mb1 ash these ashes have also been found at lake arturo first discovery of them in argentine tierra del fuego further findings were made at ushuaia brunswick peninsula and a number of other sites tephras from monte burney and other volcanoes are important for in region of andes date of mb2 eruption is also given as 4 260 years before present other dates are 8 425 500 years before present for mb1 and 3 830 390 or 3 820 390 for mb2 both by radiocarbon dating further eruptions occurred 90 100 800 500 3 740 10 7 390 200 bce and 1 529 28 1 944 29 10 015 and 1 735 years before present last two were small eruptions tephra from an eruption that occurred about 2 000 years before present reached a thickness of in a peat bog away from monte burney one tephra around 1805 bce found at siple dome in antarctica may be linked to monte burney but timing of tephra is problematic two tephras at vogel and seno skyring have been linked to monte burney they are dated 4 254 120 and 9 009 17 9 175 111 years before present younger of these two eruptions influenced sedimentation in these water bodies and adjacent vegetation reports from natives mentioned in 1847 of a volcano at end of a bay that makes ground tremble probably refer to monte burney which is visible on clear days from in 1910 a researcher concluded that volcano had been active in postglacial time given that pumice formations found around volcano would not have survived glaciation only one historical eruption is known from burney which occurred in 1910 this eruption has a volcanic explosivity index of 2 and was observed by a merchant ship this eruption appeared to coincide with an earthquake and tsunami on 24 june 1910 in area an unconfirmed report of an eruption in 1920 exists as well as reports of a flash of light and earthquakes during night of 24 june 1970 no reports of such activity were identified in contemporaneous newspaper however shallow seismic activity occurs to this day at monte burney research history mountain was already known before 1871 a book written in that year by robert oliver cunningham records following travel report mentioning monte burney appearance of mountain was considered majestic in 1899 eric shipton explored area in 1962 and after a failed attempt in 1963 climbed monte burney on 10th of march 1973 reaching its summit together with peter radcliffe and roger perry auer in 1974 did correlate some tephras on tierra del fuego with monte burney one of which was later linked to reclus in 2015 chilean geological agency sernageomin began setting up volcano
