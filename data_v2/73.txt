deerfoot trail is a freeway segment of highway 2 in calgary alberta canada it stretches entire length of city from south to north and links suburbs to downtown via memorial drive and 17 avenue se it also forms part of canamex corridor which connects calgary to edmonton and interstate 15 in united states via highways 3 and 4 freeway begins south of calgary where it splits from macleod trail crosses bow river into city limits and reaches stoney trail ring road crisscrossing twice more with river it intersects glenmore trail and memorial drive former is a major east west expressway while latter is a freeway spur into downtown in north calgary it crosses highway 1 and passes calgary international airport before ending at a second interchange with stoney trail highway 2 becomes queen elizabeth ii highway as it continues north into rocky view county towards edmonton originally called blackfoot trail freeway upon opening of first section in 1971 it was renamed in 1974 to honour deerfoot a late 19th century siksika nation blackfoot long distance runner known for his exceptional speed subsequent sections opened in 1975 1980 1982 and 2003 deerfoot was not entirely a freeway until 2005 when final of four at grade intersections in southeast calgary was converted to an interchange well known for its frequent rush hour congestion and collisions traffic levels have steadily increased as calgary s population has tripled to over 1 2 million since 1971 mostly six lane freeway is alberta s busiest road with volume nearing 169 000 vehicles per day between highway 1 and memorial drive in 2018 more than twice that for which it was designed province of alberta has been fiscally responsible for road since 2000 but now seeks to offload maintenance and future improvement costs to city of calgary two parties remain at odds over who should operate road in long term but began a joint study in 2016 that has continued into 2019 it offered five short term recommendations in 2017 and by end of 2019 will present a long term strategy for upgrades in march 2019 alberta committed 478 million to deerfoot trail improvements work is scheduled to begin in 2023 route description overview thumb partial cloverleaf interchange at 17 avenue se in south calgary as a segment of highway 2 deerfoot trail is a core route of national highway system and a key international corridor it is also part of calgary s primary goods movement network and is identified as a skeletal road in city s transportation plan a limited access route important for long distance travellers and is only route that stretches entire length of city from north to south from its split with highway 2a macleod trail near hamlet of de winton in south it runs north to stoney trail at calgary s northern city limit where it becomes queen elizabeth ii highway freeway roughly bisects city though it lies entirely east of centre street which officially marks boundary between east and west side of city from its southern terminus until memorial drive deerfoot approximates course of bow river initially freeway is on east side then crosses to west bank and finally back to east before river and memorial drive veer west at inglewood towards downtown most of road s northern half parallels nose creek a tributary of bow deerfoot is a divided freeway for its entire 46 4 kilometre length ranging from four to eight lanes wide northbound and southbound lanes are separated by an approximately wide depressed grass median near de winton which narrows and becomes a combination of jersey and constant slope barriers through most of south calgary before returning to grass of varying widths from 17 avenue se to north terminus in north calgary grass median is supplemented by of high tension cable barriers htcb that were added in 2007 virtually eliminating risk of serious median collisions it was first major htcb installation in canada freeway has a posted speed limit of from its origin at highway 2a until just after first bow river crossing after which limit is reduced to for next through most of calgary until beddington trail in northeast where limit returns to 110 km h entire route is paved with asphalt except for a concrete section in south calgary alberta transportation branch of alberta government who operate and maintain all highways in province signed a contract with enterprises for maintenance of deerfoot trail from stoney trail in south calgary to northern city limit province intends to return control of freeway to city but it is desirable for city to avoid significant maintenance and rehabilitation costs associated with freeway and have road remain under provincial control for as long as possible former calgary mayor rod sykes said i wouldn t take on problems of deerfoot if i were at city hall now left thumb complex interchange of deerfoot trail bow bottom trail and anderson road is often congested as deerfoot traffic is reduced to two lanes each way maps were published in calgary herald to assist drivers with navigating interchange when it opened in late 1982 south calgary deerfoot trail begins as a rural freeway near de winton where two lanes fork to northeast from macleod trail and descend across dunbow road toward bow river it crosses river on twin bridges constructed over an environmentally sensitive area of valley rising from river freeway enters calgary limits and its southern suburban neighbourhoods of cranston and seton to which access is provided by a partial cloverleaf interchange a major junction at stoney trail ring road immediately follows with signage recommending that traffic destined for international airport edmonton and medicine hat use eastbound stoney trail as a bypass continuing north as an eight lane freeway deerfoot passes between communities of mckenzie lake and mckenzie towne crossing 130 avenue se to south terminus of barlow trail it then reduces to six lanes curving to west through neighbourhoods of douglasdale and across bow river on ivor strong bridge named after john ivor strong who served as chief commissioner for calgary until 1971 thumb deerfoot trail curving under memorial drive and northeast line of ctrain interchange was constructed as part of second deerfoot segment that opened in 1975 and ctrain bridges were constructed in 2000 immediately after river deerfoot merges with major routes of anderson road and bow bottom trail often a point of congestion at rush hour in both directions traffic through outdated interchange is reduced from three lanes to two freeway curves north along river s west bank to cross southland drive paralleling blackfoot trail near community of acadia north of acadia freeway bisects a large area of commercial development for several kilometres before reaching a major interchange at glenmore trail interchange is generally identified as second of two major congestion points on deerfoot in south calgary so called glenmore squeeze where traffic is reduced to two lanes each way over glenmore deerfoot turns sharply to east and again crosses bow river on calf robe bridge named after a siksika nation elder veering back to north it follows river s east bank across peigan trail to a partial cloverleaf interchange at 17 avenue se passing neighbourhoods of dover and deerfoot meets memorial drive a major freeway spur into downtown near pearce estate wetland calgary zoo and max bell centre and continues into north calgary while bow river turns west towards downtown north calgary in north calgary freeway climbs along east side of nose creek a tributary of bow river from memorial drive it passes vista heights neighbourhood to 16 avenue ne highway 1 trans canada highway this section has been largely unchanged since its completion in 1975 six lane freeway enters light commercial development north of 32 avenue ne access to huntington hills and deerfoot mall are then provided by an interchange at 64 avenue ne beddington trail splits to northwest from deerfoot following nose creek into a large residential area of north calgary that includes neighbourhoods of country hills panorama hills and hidden valley speed limit on deerfoot increases to 110 km h as development tapers in an increasingly rural area of north calgary after west nose creek park an interchange with airport trail serves as primary access for calgary international airport and to west neighbourhood of harvest hills via 96 avenue ne north of airport trail freeway curves northeast through light commercial areas across country hills boulevard and ends at an interchange with stoney trail it continues north to airdrie as queen elizabeth ii highway traffic and collisions thumb looking south on deerfoot trail at its major split with beddington trail usually northern limit of rush hour congestion deerfoot trail is alberta s busiest highway by a significant margin over glenmore trail with peak daily congestion lasting as many as four hours its most travelled stretch is between memorial drive and 16 avenue ne trans canada highway as traffic from calgary s northern and eastern suburbs converge to travel via memorial drive into downtown in addition to traffic transiting city and other intra city trips freeway was designed to carry approximately 65 000 vehicles per day but as of 2015 carries almost triple that volume near memorial drive in late 2013 southeastern segment of stoney trail was opened to traffic in conjunction with northeast portion which opened in 2009 it formed a full eastern bypass of calgary providing an alternate route for traffic transiting city traffic levels on deerfoot trail decreased in year following opening but have since risen to pre stoney levels in a 2016 study calgary ranked tenth in traffic congestion among major canadian cities with drivers spending nearly 16 hours of year in standstill traffic excessive volume of traffic on deerfoot trail is a contributing factor to 10 000 collisions recorded between 2002 and 2007 including 24 fatalities constable jeff klatt of calgary police service stated that there is a consensus among police officers that it s dangerous to do traffic stops on deerfoot trail a 1993 incident in which a stolen vehicle struck and killed a police officer on deerfoot was catalyst for calgary police service s acquisition of a helicopter 2013 statistics confirmed that deerfoot trail had more crashes and traffic jams than any other road in calgary deerfoot has many entrances and exits in close proximity which exacerbates problems but some have attributed a portion of congestion to driver error constable jim of calgary police service stated a lot of people don t understand or don t want to understand how to merge properly 30 of respondents to a 2016 poll stated that main reason they avoid deerfoot trail is because they do not feel safe on freeway in 2015 plans for improvements to deerfoot trail near southland drive were cancelled and a study was initiated to determine best course of action to begin improving freeway calf robe bridge is also prone to collisions as its concrete deck becomes slick in cold weather and large curves precede and follow bridge a 1996 crash on bridge claimed life of a teenager when her northbound car struck rear of a fire truck parked in left shoulder attending to an accident in southbound lanes poor visibility due to curve prior to bridge was a contributing factor in a successful lawsuit by girl s family against calgary traffic volumes location de winton stoney tr se 32 ave

road and bow river freeway features 21 interchanges of varying design most recent interchanges to be constructed at north and south ends of freeway are more consistently of partial cloverleaf type a design highly utilized in alberta as it is a desirable compromise between cost and capacity two interchanges with stoney trail are cloverstack interchanges where high capacity directional flyovers carry traffic turning left through interchange and lesser utilized left turn movements are serviced by loop ramps older and less efficient designs are used at deerfoot s intersections with both glenmore trail and highway 1 junction with glenmore is an incomplete cloverleaf interchange traffic northbound on deerfoot does not have direct access to westbound glenmore and one must first exit to east proceed through a traffic light behind calgary auto mall and enter glenmore trail from north side at highway 1 a split diamond interchange significantly slows east west traffic even outside of peak hours because all left turn movements must pass through three sets of traffic lights this outdated interchange was calgary s most dangerous road junction in 2011 with 234 crashes recorded history predecessor highways thumb highway 2 in calgary in late 1960s red line when it followed alignment of present day macleod glenmore and blackfoot trails 17 avenue se and barlow trail green line represents present day alignment of deerfoot trail prior to completion of deerfoot trail historic alignment of highway 2 in south calgary was along macleod trail as an extension of 4 street parallel to a branch of canadian pacific railway from calgary to macleod macleod trail has since been designated highway 2a on a routing largely same as original it is now a busy expressway connecting midnapore and other southwestern suburbs to downtown southernmost portion of route from highway 22x to de winton would continue to serve as highway 2 until completion of a deerfoot trail extension from its then southernmost point at neighbourhood of cranston to de winton in 2003 in north calgary highway 2 was originally composed of four present day routes edmonton trail 41 avenue 48 avenue and barlow trail edmonton trail is now a busy urban street on west bank of nose creek through neighbourhood of highland park but its alignment in 1920s had it curving to northeast across creek along present day 41 avenue to 48 avenue where it continued east past airport to barlow trail and north to edmonton as highway 1 later renamed to highway 2 by 1960s highway 2 had been realigned to follow macleod trail until turning east at glenmore trail before continuing north on blackfoot trail veering to northeast and crossing bow river to join barlow trail to north city limit former edmonton trail was re signed as highway 2a as airport continued to expand 48 avenue was reduced to an airport service road after construction of mcknight boulevard long after completion and opening of deerfoot trail and its signing as highway 2 segment of barlow trail north of mcknight blvd was closed in 2011 to allow construction of a new runway at calgary international airport thumb left deerfoot also known as scabby dried meat was a prominent runner in calgary area before 1890 early plans and construction due to its quickly rising population in 1960s calgary initiated planning for construction of an extensive freeway and expressway network that included numerous north south and east west routes many of these routes were ultimately not developed into freeways but a 1967 transportation study planned for a major north south freeway running along west side of calgary airport across bow river into inglewood remaining west of bow river through present day fish creek provincial park initially called blackfoot trail freeway first segment stretched from northern city boundary then near deerfoot s present day split with beddington trail to 16 avenue ne opening in 1971 it was named after a historic route that approximated location of present day memorial drive across nose creek between barlow trail and community of st george s heights now location of calgary zoo this trail appears on calgary maps as early as 1891 in 1974 signs were unveiled renaming road after a siksika nation long distance runner nicknamed deerfoot in 1884 he became known in calgary area as a great talent and won races against runners from as far away as europe controversy arose when deerfoot won a race but his opponent was credited with victory unhappy with result his attitude began to change he committed theft from a cabin and was later subject of a massive manhunt he spent time in and out of police custody for various crimes before dying of tuberculosis while in prison for assault he had reportedly been receiving medical treatment for disease since his arrival to prison in december 1974 premier peter lougheed reiterated his opposition to planned routing for southern portion of deerfoot trail which would take freeway along west side of bow river through fish creek park lougheed acknowledged that diverting freeway to east would be significantly more expensive but was firm on protecting and preserving fish creek as an urban park revised alignment took freeway approximately east of river through present day douglasdale mckenzie towne and mckenzie lake bow bottom trail a major arterial road was built in wide right of way that had been reserved for deerfoot trail a second section extending road further south to 17 avenue se opened on january 20 1975 new pavement continued south alongside nose creek and was originally to carry on straight across river into inglewood but residents of neighbourhood fought adamantly against construction of freeway in their community city hall conceded resulting in present day alignment that keeps freeway east of bow river as it passes downtown completion thumb deerfoot trail in 1982 after it had been extended to highway 22x in south calgary on december 2 1980 an extension of deerfoot trail south to glenmore trail was opened able to handle up to 80 000 vehicles per day it was advertised as an alternative north south route to nearby blackfoot trail construction of 70 million extension took more than two years and was described as badly needed by mayor ralph klein new concrete road included calf robe bridge over bow river and an interchange at 43 avenue se now called peigan trail next section then intended to be final segment extended deerfoot to highway 22x now stoney trail on altered alignment east of river it opened on november 22 1982 at a cost of 165 million it featured interchanges at southland drive and anderson road bow bottom trail a second crossing of bow river on ivor strong bridge took deerfoot to an at grade intersection with 24 street and a signalized intersection at barlow trail which had been extended south from glenmore trail as part of deerfoot project highway 2 was realigned in calgary to follow macleod trail north to anderson road then east on anderson road to new interchange at deerfoot trail where it turned north to follow deerfoot to city limit near airport plans to add a third level flyover at memorial drive by 1987 did not come to fruition original configuration of interchange was modified in 1983 to add a loop ramp for traffic turning northbound onto deerfoot trail from eastbound memorial a new ramp was also constructed for traffic turning west onto memorial from northbound deerfoot passing underneath eastbound memorial before joining westbound memorial from left province took over responsibility from city of calgary in 2000 to upgrade route to a freeway and render canamex corridor a contiguous route through city after which they intended to return road to city in 2003 a 100 million extension was completed extending deerfoot trail from its junction with highway 22x to its present terminus near de winton during planning segment had been temporarily designated as highway 2x prior to project deerfoot was effectively disconnected from rest of highway 2 traffic continuing south to fort macleod proceeded west on a two lane bridge carrying highway 22x over bow river before turning south onto macleod trail which was then designated as highway 2 section of highway 22x over river became stoney trail highway 201 in 2013 and a second bridge was completed in 2007 to carry westbound lanes while original bridge built in 1974 carries eastbound lanes thumb during construction of southeast stoney trail in 2013 two new bridges were built across deerfoot trail including this structure spanning northbound lanes interchanges were constructed at barlow trail 130 avenue se mckenzie towne boulevard cranston avenue and dunbow road between 2000 and 2004 last set of traffic lights was removed in 2005 upon completion of interchange at douglasdale boulevard making entire length of deerfoot trail a freeway since completion in an effort to reduce head on collisions caused by vehicles crossing over grass median in north calgary installation of high tension cable barriers was completed in first half of 2007 in 2009 modifications were made to interchange of peigan barlow and deerfoot trails built in 1979 existing westbound to southbound ramp left little distance for traffic to merge causing bottlenecks ramp was modified to first curve north and then loop back underneath itself extending merge distance before three southbound lanes crossed ogden road and then bow river in november 2009 construction of a major interchange at northern terminus of deerfoot trail was completed connecting it to northeast and northwest sections of stoney trail in august 2013 96 avenue ne was extended to east across west nose creek and canadian pacific railway tracks to meet existing interchange at deerfoot trail and airport trail it provided an alternative to beddington trail and country hills boulveard for access to neighbourhood of harvest hills project included a controversial 470 000 piece of public art a tall blue ring called travelling light that lies on north side of 96 avenue between railway and nose creek highly visible from deerfoot ring received national attention and was called awful and terrible by calgary mayor and an example of bureaucracy run amok by councillor jyoti mostly negative feedback prompted calgary to review its allocation of funds to public art on infrastructure projects as part of stoney trail construction in 2013 deerfoot trail was upgraded between most southerly bow river crossing north and mckenzie lake boulevard it was widened to six through lanes from stoney trail to bow river at calgary s southern limit and elevated directional ramps were added to major interchange at deerfoot and stoney trail to support significantly higher traffic levels a braided ramp was constructed northbound between cranston avenue and stoney trail preventing northbound traffic exiting to eastbound stoney trail from conflicting with auburn bay and cranston traffic merging onto northbound deerfoot trail future thumb south of memorial drive main canal of western irrigation district splits from bow river and passes underneath deerfoot trail providing water to areas east of calgary in march 2017 construction of a partial cloverleaf interchange was approved in south calgary at 212 avenue se between bow river and 192 avenue calgary will pay for project initially and later be repaid by alberta and brookfield residential who are developing neighbourhood in vicinity of interchange prior to a firm commitment for a portion of funding by brookfield alberta had been reluctant to front estimated 50 million in funding required for project though city of calgary had offered to pay for it in interim as long as money was paid back by province city had also considered contributing 20 million in tandem with brookfield with province paying for remaining 30 million city councillor shane keating stated in august 2016 that development of seton neighbourhood will be hampered until 212 avenue interchange is completed a study was completed by alberta in 2007 to determine best course of action for upgrades to incomplete interchange of glenmore trail and deerfoot trail interchange carries 130 000 vehicles per day on deerfoot trail and 100 000 vehicles on glenmore making it one of busiest interchanges in alberta but there is no direct access for traffic turning from northbound deerfoot to westbound glenmore stage 1 of proposed improvements would not remedy this problem but rather correct a pinch point on deerfoot trail by constructing a new three lane bridge to carry northbound lanes over glenmore deerfoot trail would then be three lanes each way through interchange ultimately a large cloverstack interchange is planned with left turn movements handled by third level directional flyovers providing free flowing access to and from deerfoot trail proposed ultimate configuration would require acquisition of land from adjacent properties for construction of flyovers and other modifications to glenmore trail left thumb looking south on deerfoot trail where it lies on east bank of nose creek near calgary international airport north of beddington trail planning study also calls for construction of a new bridge alongside existing calf robe bridge as part of a local express system between peigan and glenmore trails glenmore trail would be widened to as many as 10 lanes between blackfoot and deerfoot trails along with modifications of interchange at blackfoot trail and addition of braided ramps to facilitate new flyovers alberta transportation and city of calgary began a study in 2016 to develop short term and long term plans for deerfoot trail almost entire length of freeway is being assessed though changes are not anticipated for two major interchanges at stoney trail completed in 2009 and 2013 study hopes to address deerfoot trail problems overall as opposed to localized solutions that could simply shift traffic bottlenecks to another section of freeway due to complexity of freeway long term recommendations will not be available until end of 2018 but five short term options were presented in may 2017 they include a braided ramp in south calgary between southland drive and anderson road a jughandle intersection at 32 avenue ne and 12 street ne left turn restrictions on mcknight boulveard east of deerfoot and a pair of new northbound on ramps between mcknight boulevard and airport trail all possibilities for improvement are being considered including high occupancy vehicle lanes despite initial fixes presented by study alberta transportation did not include any of proposed projects on list of unfunded capital projects in 2017 city of calgary began work to construct a 2 lane bridge for bus rapid transit over deerfoot trail south of 17 avenue se as part of calgary transit s developing network of bus only routes new bridge does not interchange with deerfoot trail and was completed in late 2018 in march 2019 transportation minister brian mason announced plans for 478 million worth of improvements to a stretch of deerfoot between beddington
