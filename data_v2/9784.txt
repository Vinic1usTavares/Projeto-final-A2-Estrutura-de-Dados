united airlines flight 736 was a daily transcontinental passenger flight in united states operated by united airlines that crashed in southern nevada on 1958 following a aircraft assigned to flight 736 a douglas dc 7 airliner with 47 aboard 42 passengers 5 crew was flying at cruise altitude above clark county en route to a stopover at denver colorado when it was struck by a united states air force fighter jet crewed by two pilots collision occurred at 8 30 a m in clear weather within a major commercial airway both aircraft fell out of control from and crashed into unpopulated desert terrain southwest of las vegas there were no survivors from either aircraft and with 49 fatalities it remains deadliest crash in history of las vegas valley among victims were a group of military personnel and civilian contractors involved with sensitive department of defense weapons systems loss of group triggered new rules prohibiting similar groups engaged in critical projects from flying aboard same aircraft official investigation stated that cockpit visibility limitations played a role in accident but also faulted military and civilian aviation authorities for not taking measures to reduce well known collision risks that had existed for over a year within confines of airways despite numerous complaints from airline crews loss of flight 736 one of a series of 1950s mid air collisions in american skies helped usher in widespread improvements in air traffic control within united states events leading to accident flight 736 a four engined dc 7 propliner with registration departed los angeles international airport at 7 37 a m on a flight to new york city with stops in denver kansas city and washington d c on board were 42 passengers and five crew members captain duane m ward 44 first officer arlin edward sommers 36 flight engineer charles e woods 43 and stewardesses pauline mary murray 22 and yvonne marie peterson 27 of passengers on flight seven were military personnel and 35 were civilians soon after takeoff airliner was directed into airway victor 8 on a route that took it east over ontario california and then northeast toward las vegas crew flew dc 7

lt gerald d moran 24 who as part of his training would spend flight under a hood that blocked his view outside aircraft but allowed him to see his instrument panel instructor had two way microphone communication with student and his duties were to instruct student in rear seat monitor his performance and maintain a lookout for other aircraft f 100f had dual pilot control and instructor could take over flying jet at any time training flight involved a descent and approach to nellis air force base under simulated instrument meteorological conditions from an altitude of descent was to be a teardrop pattern with las vegas commercial radio station kram as navigational fix a process that was referred to as kram procedure prescribed descent angle for kram procedure was about five degrees at 8 14 a m united airlines crew radioed a routine position report over mojave desert to notify controllers that they expected to arrive over mccarran field near las vegas at 8 31 a m air force pilot moran radioed control tower at nellis air force base at 8 28 a m to report that he would now begin a procedural jet penetration descent to as fighter descended airliner was approaching las vegas air space at about on a heading of flying straight and level within confines of its designated airway caa stations controlling airliner were unaware of fighter jet air force controllers at nellis air force base directing jet were unaware of airliner collision thumb left los angeles times front page for april 22 1958 articles covering crash of united airlines flight 736 which originated in los

into a then empty patch of desert outside town of arden in what is now unincorporated town of enterprise nearly vertical impact and subsequent explosion instantly killed everyone on board fighter jet its right wing and right tailplane torn away by collision left a trail of fragments as it arced downward and crashed west of small community of sloan into a hilly area of uninhabited desert several miles south of dc 7 crash site at least one of air force pilots was still in jet when it hit ground but contemporary news reports differ on whether other pilot managed an unsuccessful ejection at too low an altitude to survive or stayed with jet all way to ground witnesses reported seeing a parachute drifting away from falling f 100f leading to hope that a pilot had ejected but when parachute was located it was determined to be a drag parachute that is meant to be deployed on landing to help slow fighter down investigations thumb an f 100 cockpit showing metal windscreen supports that likely

were 13 civilian and military managers engineers and technicians assigned to american ballistic missile program articles in las vegas review journal commemorating 40th and 50th anniversaries of crash reported that fbi search went beyond fingerprint matching for identification agents were also looking for any surviving sensitive papers relating to national security that group of military contractors had carried on board in handcuffed briefcases same reports also said crash prompted military and defense industry to adopt rules to keep groups of technical people involved in same critical project from traveling together on same plane civil aeronautics board cab conducted an investigation and published a report on accident cab ruled out weather conditions and airworthiness of two planes as factors in collision report stated probable cause was high rate of near head on closure and that at high altitude there were human and cockpit limitations involved analysis of approach angles concluded that a metal frame support on f 100 s windscreen interfered seriously with detection of dc 7 and a supporting pillar on dc 7 s windshield may have hindered sighting fighter cab accident report also cited a failure of nellis air force base and caa to take measures to reduce a known collision exposure training exercises were allowed to be conducted for more than a year prior to collision within confines of several airways even after numerous near misses with military jets had been reported by airline crews legacy this mid air collision and another a month later over maryland between a capital airlines airliner flight 300 and another military jet accelerated efforts in united states to change way air space was allocated to commercial and military flights on april 22 day after flight 736 collision cab proposed an experiment in which it would set aside part of air space from which would be barred all aircraft lacking specific clearance to enter it all aircraft operating in designated space would have to be equipped for instrument flight operations according to cab there had been 159 mid air collisions in years 1947 1957 and 971 near misses in 1957 alone increased speed of aircraft and higher air traffic density made it harder to give pilots enough time to spot each other during flights therefore cab said it is essential that positive control be extended to altitudes at 35 000feet and on additional routes as rapidly as practical at time such control only existed between 17 000 and 22 000feet on certain transcontinental airways in wake of two airliners lost in april and may 1958 collisions investigators from a house of representatives committee concerned about lack of coordination between civil and military air traffic controllers imposed a 60 day deadline on cab and air force to establish new control procedures committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft furthermore committee stated that military flying should be controlled in vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather but also in visual conditions four months after 49 lives were lost in worst aviation accident in history of las vegas region federal aviation act of 1958 was signed into law act dissolved caa and created federal aviation agency faa later renamed federal aviation administration faa was given unprecedented and total authority over control of american air space including military activity and as procedures and atc facilities were modernized airborne collisions gradually decreased in frequency las vegas review journal in a 50th anniversary article stated that act specifically referenced crash of united 736 in ordering creation of faa supersonic f 100 left a legacy of many crashes over its years of service nearly 25 percent were lost to accidents in particular 1958 was most costly with 47 f 100 pilots killed and 116 of fighters destroyed a loss rate averaging almost one every three days legal aftermath following collision at least 31 lawsuits seeking damages were brought against united airlines u s government or both on september 24 1958 united airlines filed for damages based on federal tort claims act against united states in u s district court for district of delaware airline alleged that united states through its agents in united states air force negligently operated f 100f and sought damages of us 3 576 698 court found neither crew was negligent for a failure to see and avoid each other but held united states was liable because of other negligence case was settled on december17 1962 with united states agreeing to pay airline 1 45million in another case on january 8 1964 surviving relatives of two of united airlines crew were awarded a total of 343 200 from government with u s district court judge hatfield chilson finding air force pilots did not use ordinary care in operation of fighter jet and should have yielded right of way to dc 7 airliner chilson also criticized air force for not coordinating instrument training flights with civilian instrument flight rules traffic and for failing to schedule flights to minimize traffic congestion government appealed and relatives cross appealed to have their damage awards increased but earlier 1964 judgment was affirmed on september 30 1965 nearby crash sites region where
