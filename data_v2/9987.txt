leading a conspiracy against his life he ordered pekik and his relatives killed this massacre of east java s most important princely house created a rift between amangkurat and his east javanese

initially they settled in territories of banten sultanate but in 1674 they were expelled and turned to piracy raiding coastal towns in java and nusa tenggara mataram crown prince later allowed them to settle in demung a village in eastern salient of java in 1675 an additional band of makassarese fighters and pirates arrived in demung led by kraeng of galesong these makassarese itinerant fighters would later join rebellion as trunajaya s allies forces involved thumb bugis forces under prince arung palakka pictured were among those allied with voc to suppress rebellion lacking a standing army bulk of mataram s forces were drawn from troops raised by king s vassals who also provided arms and supplies majority of men were peasants who were conscripted by local lords javanese dalem in addition army included a small number of professional soldiers drawn from palace guards army used cannons small firearms including flintlocks javanese from dutch and carbines cavalry and fortifications historian m c said transfer of european military technology to javanese was virtually immediate with javanese manufacturing gunpowder and firearms by 1620 at latest europeans were hired to train javanese troops in weapons handling military leadership skills and construction techniques but in spite of this training conscripted peasants of javanese armies often lacked discipline and fled during battle mataram s troops numbered much larger than rebel s 9 000 at gegodog in september 1676 dropped to just a small retinue after fall of capital in june 1677 and grew to over 13 000 during march to trunajaya s capital at kediri in late 1678 voc had professional soldiers of its own each voc soldier had a sword small arms cartridges carrying pouches and belts smoke bombs and grenades majority of voc regulars were indonesians with a small number of european soldiers and marines all under command of european officers while in technological sense voc troops were not superior to their indigenous counterparts they generally had better training discipline and equipment than indigenous indonesian armies voc troops also differed with regard to logistics its troops marched in step followed by a long caravan of carts carrying supplies this gave them an advantage over javanese troops who often lived off land and frequently faced supply shortages voc forces numbered 1 500 in 1676 but they were later augmented by bugis allies under leadership of arung palakka first contingent of 1 500 bugis arrived in java in late 1678 and by 1679 there were 6 000 bugis troops on java similar to other belligerents armies of trunajaya and his allies also used cannons cavalry and fortifications when voc took surabaya from trunajaya in may 1677 trunajaya fled with twenty of his bronze cannons and left behind 69 iron and 34 bronze pieces trunajaya s forces included javanese madurese and makassarese when rebels invaded java in 1676 they numbered 9 000 and consisted of trunajaya s followers and makassarese fighters later rebellion was joined by other javanese and madurese nobles notably lord of giri one of most prominent islamic spiritual lords in java joined in early 1676 trunajaya s father in law raden kajoran head of powerful kajoran family joined after trunajaya s victory at gegodog in september 1676 and trunajaya s uncle prince of later ii joined after fall of mataram s capital in june 1677 campaign beginning and initial rebel victories rebellion started with a series of raids from makassarese pirates based in demung against trading towns on northern coast of java first raid took place in 1674 in gresik but was repulsed trunajaya entered into a pact and marriage alliance with kraeng of galesong leader of makassarese in 1675 and planned further raids in

governor in jepara provincial capital of northern coast and reinforced town mataram forces marching on demung were defeated and combined actions by mataram and voc ships on coast controlled by raiders were not always successful kraeng of galesong moved to madura domain of his ally trunajaya in 1676 trunajaya gave himself title lord of and secured support of sunan spiritual lord of giri near gresik a voc fleet attack later destroyed raiders base in demung but they did not take action against trunajaya in madura in september 1676 a rebel army of 9 000 led by kraeng of galesong crossed over from madura to java and later took surabaya principal city of eastern java mataram sent a large force commanded by crown prince later amangkurat ii to meet rebels a battle took place in gegodog east of tuban in 1676 resulting in complete defeat of much larger mataram forces loyalist army was routed king s uncle pangeran was killed and crown prince fled to mataram crown prince was blamed for this defeat due to his long wavering before attacking rebels in addition there were rumours that he colluded with enemy which included his former protege trunajaya in few months after victory in gegodog rebels quickly took javanese northern trading towns from surabaya westward to cirebon including towns of kudus and demak towns fell easily partly because their fortifications had been destroyed due to their conquest by sultan agung about 50 years earlier only jepara managed to resist capture due to combined efforts of new military governor and voc forces who reinforced town just in time rebellion

forces voc intervention and fall of mataram s capital thumb cornelis speelman who led voc forces in war in 1677 and later governor general of voc in response to mataram s request for intervention voc

residence there in ruin trunajaya fled surabaya and established his capital in kediri although rebels were defeated in surabaya rebel forces campaigning in interior of central and east java had more success rebel campaign culminated in fall of capital plered in june 1677 king was ill and distrust among royal princes prevented organized resistance king fled west with crown prince and his retinue

kudus and pati amangkurat moved to jepara on voc ships in september 1677 king had to agree to sweeping concessions demanded by voc in exchange for restoring his monarchy he promised voc income of all harbour towns on northern coast priangan highlands and semarang would be ceded to voc king also agreed to recognize jurisdiction of voc courts over all non javanese residing in his domains dutch historian h j de graaf commented that by doing this voc being a corporation engaged in a hazardous speculation which they expected to pay off in future when their associate would regain his rule over mataram voc mataram forces made slow progress against rebels by beginning of 1678 their control was limited to several towns in central northern coast in 1678 speelman became director general of voc

java voc and king s forces chased trunajaya who isolated and deprived of food surrendered to voc on 26 december 1679 initially he was treated with respect as a captive of voc commander however during a ceremonial visit to royal residence in east java on 2 january 1680 he was personally stabbed by amangkurat and king s courtiers finished him off king defended this killing of a voc prisoner by saying that trunajaya had tried to kill him voc was not convinced by this explanation but it chose not to call king into account a romanticised account of trunajaya s death appears in 18th century central javanese end of pangeran puger s rebellion in addition to trunajaya s forces amangkurat ii continued to face opposition from his brother pangeran puger who had taken old capital in plered and had claimed throne for himself in 1677 before defeat of trunajaya amangkurat s forces had not taken action against him after trunajaya was defeated amangkurat still could not convince his brother to submit in september 1680 amangkurat constructed a new capital in kartasura in november amangkurat and voc forces drove puger from plered however puger quickly rebuilt his forces took plered again in

of capital in plered he built a new capital kartasura in district of pajang and moved his court there a voc fort was constructed in capital next to royal residence to defend it against invasion as for voc its involvement allowed cornered and nearly defeated amangkuratii to stay on his throne this began precedent of voc supporting javanese kings or claimants in exchange for concessions however in 1680 this policy required a high level of expenditure to maintain a military presence in central and east java and this contributed to voc s financial decline payments promised by amangkurat were not made and by 1682 king s debt to voc exceeded 1 5million reals about five times amount of royal treasury cession of semarang was delayed by disputes and other stipulations in contract were largely ignored by local javanese officials furthermore an anti voc faction developed at mataram court and a member of this faction became chief minister from 1682 to 1686 poor relations between mataram and voc continued with sheltering of an enemy of voc in 1684 and death of voc captain francois tack in mataram court in 1686 king s brother pangeran puger who tried to claim throne during trunajaya
