spanned chukchi sea and bering sea joining eurasia to north america beringian wolf is an extinct type of wolf canis lupus that lived during ice age it inhabited what is now modern day alaska yukon and northern wyoming some of these wolves survived well into holocene beringian wolf is an ecomorph of gray wolf and has been comprehensively studied using a range of scientific techniques yielding new information on prey species and feeding behavior of prehistoric wolves it has been determined that these wolves are morphologically distinct from modern north american wolves and genetically basal to most modern and extinct wolves beringian wolf has not been assigned a subspecies classification and its relationship with extinct european cave wolf canis lupus spelaeus is not clear beringian wolf was similar in size to modern alaskan interior wolf canis lupus pambasileus and other late pleistocene gray wolves but more robust and with stronger jaws and teeth a broader palate and larger carnassial teeth relative to its skull size in comparison with beringian wolf more southerly occurring dire wolf canis dirus was same size but heavier and with a more robust skull and dentition unique adaptation of skull and dentition of beringian wolf allowed it to produce relatively large bite forces grapple with large struggling prey and therefore made predation and scavenging on pleistocene megafauna possible beringian wolf preyed most often on horse and steppe bison and also on caribou mammoth and woodland muskox at close of ice age with loss of cold and dry conditions and extinction of much of its prey beringian wolf became extinct extinction of its prey has been attributed to impact of climate change competition with other species including humans or a combination of both factors local genetic populations were replaced by others from within same species or of same genus of north american wolves only ancestor of modern north american gray wolf survived remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and dentition have been found in western beringia northeastern siberia in 2016 a study showed that some of wolves now living in remote corners of china and mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28 000 year old eastern beringian wolf specimen taxonomy from 1930s representatives of american museum of natural history worked with alaska college and fairbanks exploration company to collect specimens uncovered by hydraulic gold dredging near fairbanks alaska childs frick was a research associate in paleontology with american museum who had been working in fairbanks region in 1930 he published an article which contained a list of extinct pleistocene mammals of alaska yukon this list included one specimen of what he believed to be a new subspecies which he named dirus alaskensis alaskan dire wolf american museum referred to these as a typical pleistocene species in fairbanks however no type specimen description nor exact location was provided and because dire wolves had not been found this far north this name was later proposed as nomen nudum invalid by paleontologist ronald m nowak between 1932 and 1953 twenty eight wolf skulls were recovered from ester cripple engineer and little eldorado creeks located north and west of fairbanks skulls were thought to be 10 000 years old geologist and paleontologist theodore galusha who helped amass frick collections of fossil mammals at american museum of natural history worked on wolf skulls over a number of years and noted that compared with modern wolves they were short faced paleontologist stanley john olsen continued galusha s work with short faced wolf skulls and in 1985 based on their morphology he classified them as canis lupus gray wolf gray wolves were widely distributed across north american during both pleistocene and historic period in 2007 jennifer leonard undertook a study based on genetic morphology and stable isotope analyses of seventy four beringian wolf specimens from alaska and yukon that revealed genetic relationships prey species and feeding behavior of prehistoric wolves and supported classification of this wolf as c lupus specimens were not assigned a subspecies classification by leonard who referred to these as eastern beringian wolves a subspecies was possibly not assigned because relationship between beringian wolf and extinct european cave wolf c l spelaeus is not clear beringia was once an area of land that spanned chukchi sea and bering sea joining eurasia to north america eastern beringia included what is today alaska and yukon lineage basal wolf dna sequences can be mapped to reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships with each branch point representing divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor on this tree term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to common ancestor wolf genetic sequencing has found beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for modern indian gray wolf and himalayan wolf and extinct belgian clade of pleistocene wolves different genetic types of gray wolf a haplotype is a group of genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents a haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor mitochondrial dna mdna passes along maternal line and can date back thousands of years a 2005 study compared mitochondrial dna sequences of modern wolves with those from thirty four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915 historic population was found to possess twice genetic diversity of modern wolves which suggests that mdna diversity of wolves eradicated from western us was more than twice that of modern population a 2007 study compared mdna sequences of modern wolves with those from beringian wolves twenty beringian wolves yielded sixteen haplotypes that could not be found in modern wolves compared with seven haplotypes that were found in thirty two modern alaskan and yukon wolves this finding indicates that beringian wolves were genetically distinct from modern wolves and possessed greater genetic diversity and that there once existed in north america a larger wolf population than today modern alaskan wolves have not descended from beringian wolves but from eurasian wolves which migrated into north america during holocene a 2010 study compared mdna sequences of modern wolves with those from 24 ancient wolf specimens from western europe dated between 44 000 and 1 200 years before present ybp study found that sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups haplogroups 1 and 2 could be found among wolves across eurasia but only haplogroup1 could be found in north america ancient wolf samples from western europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations and all belonged to haplogroup2 indicating its predominance in this region for over 40 000 years both before and after last glacial maximum a comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over past several thousand years but in north america beringian extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after last glacial maximum however a 2016 study did not support existence of two wolf haplogroups a scenario consistent with phylogenetic ice sheet size and sea level depth data is that during late pleistocene sea levels were at their lowest a single wave of wolf colonization into north america commenced with opening of bering land bridge 70 000ybp it ended with closing of yukon corridor that ran along division between laurentide ice sheet and cordilleran ice sheet 23 000ybp during late glacial maximum as wolves had been in fossil record of north america but genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80 000 years wolf haplotypes that were already in north america were replaced by these invaders either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture replacement in north america of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is consistent with findings of earlier studies right thumb artist s impression of beringian wolf beringian wolves are morphologically and genetically comparable to late pleistocene european wolves one study found that ancient wolves across eurasia had a mdna sequence identical to six beringian wolves indicating a common maternal ancestor these wolves included a wolf from 4 paleolithic site near odessa ukraine dated 30 000ybp a wolf from zaskalnaya 9 paleolithic site in zaskalnaya on crimean peninsula dated 28 000ybp and altai dog from altai mountains of central asia dated 33 000ybp another wolf from cave czech republic dated 44 000ybp had a mdna sequence identical to two beringian wolves indicating another common maternal ancestor beringian wolves are phylogenetically associated with a distinct group of four modern european mdna haplotypes which indicates that both ancient and extant north american wolves originated in eurasia of these four modern haplotypes one was only found in italian wolf and one only found among wolves in romania these four haplotypes fall along with those of beringian wolves under mdna haplogroup2 ancient specimens of wolves with similar skull and dentition have been found in western beringia northeast siberia peninsula ukraine and germany where european specimens are classified as canis lupus cave wolf beringian wolves and perhaps wolves across mammoth steppe were adapted to preying on now extinct species through their unique skull and tooth morphology this type of gray wolf that is adapted for preying on megafauna has been referred to as megafaunal wolf it is possible that a random mating wolf population with gene flow spanning eurasia and north america existed until closing of ice sheets after which southern wolves became isolated and only beringian wolf existed north of sheets land bridge became inundated by sea 10 000ybp and ice sheets receded 12 000 6 000ybp beringian wolf became extinct and southern wolves expanded through shrinking ice sheets to recolonize northern part of north america all north american wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of ice sheets however much of their diversity was later lost during twentieth century due to eradication description thumb upright 1 35 alt beringian wolf coming up to human waist height about as long as a human is in height beringian wolf size compared to a human olsen described short faced wolf skulls as follows beringian wolf was similar in size to modern alaskan interior wolf c l pambasileus largest northern wolves today have a shoulder height not exceeding and a body length not exceeding average weight of yukon wolf is for males and for females individual weights for yukon wolves can vary from to with one yukon wolf weighing beringian wolves were also similar in size to late pleistocene wolves whose remains have been found in la brea tar pits at los angeles california these wolves referred to as rancho labrea wolves canis lupus were not physically different from modern gray wolves only differences being a broader femur bone and a longer tibial insertion for quadriceps and hamstring that they had comparatively more powerful leg muscles for a fast take off before a chase beringian wolf was more robust and possessed stronger jaws and teeth than either rancho labrea or modern wolves during late pleistocene more southerly occurring dire wolf canis dirus had same shape and proportions as yukon wolf but dire wolf subspecies c is estimated to have weighed on average and subspecies c on average with some specimens being larger dire wolf was heavier than beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition adaptation adaptation is evolutionary process by which an organism becomes better able to live in its environment genetic differences between wolf populations is tightly associated with their type of habitat and wolves disperse primarily within type of habitat that they were born into ecological factors such as habitat type climate prey specialization and predatory competition have been shown to greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity which is an adaptation of cranium and teeth due to influences of environment in late pleistocene variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically morphologically and ecologically distinct from each another term ecomorph is used to describes a recognizable association of morphology of an organism or a species with their use of environment beringian wolf ecomorph shows evolutionary craniodental plasticity not seen in past nor present north american gray wolves and was well adapted to megafauna rich environment of late pleistocene paleoecology thumb 300px alt map showing higher rainfall across southern coastal beringia than in north beringia precipitation 22 000 years ago last glacial period commonly referred to as ice age spanned 125 000 14 500ybp and was most recent glacial period within current ice age which occurred during last years of pleistocene era ice age reached its peak during last glacial maximum when ice sheets began advancing 33 000ybp and reached their maximum limits 26 500ybp deglaciation commenced in northern hemisphere approximately 19 000ybp and in antarctica approximately 14 500ybp which is consistent with evidence that glacial meltwater was primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level 14 500ybp and bering land bridge was finally inundated around 11 000ybp fossil evidence from many continents points to extinction of large animals termed pleistocene megafauna near end of last glaciation during ice age a vast cold and dry mammoth steppe stretched from arctic islands southwards to china and from spain eastwards across eurasia and over bering land bridge into alaska and yukon where it was blocked by wisconsin glaciation land bridge existed because sea levels were lower due to more of planet s water being locked up in glaciers compared with today therefore flora and fauna of beringia were more related to those of eurasia rather than to those of north america in eastern beringia from 35 000 ybp northern arctic areas experienced temperatures 1 5 degc 2 7 degf warmer than today but southern sub arctic regions were 2 degc 3 5 degf cooler in 22 000ybp during last glacial maximum average summer temperature was 3 5 degc 5 4 9 degf cooler than today with variations of 2 9 degc 5 2 degf cooler on seward peninsula to 7 5 degc 13 5 degf cooler in yukon beringia received more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover from north pacific ocean than rest of mammoth steppe including dry environments on either side of it moisture occurred along a north south gradient with south receiving most cloud cover and moisture due to airflow from north pacific this moisture supported a shrub tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals in this beringian refugium eastern beringia s vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees this environment supported large herbivores that were prey for beringian wolves and their competitors steppe bison bison priscus yukon horse equus woolly mammoth mammuthus primigenius and wild yak bos consumed grasses sedges and herbaceous plants caribou rangifer tarandus and woodland muskox consumed tundra plants including lichen fungi and mosses prey thumb right bison surrounded by a gray wolf pack beringian wolves preyed most often on steppe bison and horse isotope analysis can be used to allow researchers to make inferences about diet of species being studied two isotope analyses of bone collagen extracted from remains of late pleistocene wolves found in beringia and belgium indicate that wolves from both areas preyed mainly on pleistocene megafauna which became rare at beginning of holocene 12 000 years ago beringian wolf preyed most often on horse and steppe bison in period leading up to last glacial maximum 50 000ybp 23 000ybp they also ate woodland muskox and after this time they also ate mammoth analysis supports conclusion that these wolves were capable of killing and dismembering large prey in another stable isotope analysis half of beringian wolves were found to be muskox and caribou specialists and other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists two wolves from full glacial period 23 000 18 000 ybp were found to be mammoth specialists but it is not clear if this was due to scavenging or predation analysis of other carnivore fossils from fairbanks region of alaska found that mammoth was rare in diets of other beringian carnivores dentition a 2007 study of canis dentition shows that in comparison with modern gray wolf and pleistocene labrea wolf beringian wolf possessed large carnassial teeth and a short broad palate relative to size of its skull row length of beringian wolf s premolars was longer p4 premolar upper carnassial longer and wider and m1 m2 and m1 lower carnassial molars longer than those found in other two types of wolves beringian wolf s short broad rostrum increased force of a bite made with canine teeth while strengthening skull against stresses caused by struggling prey today relatively deep jaws similar to those of beringian wolf can be found in bone cracking spotted hyena and in those canids that are adapted for taking large prey beringian wolves possessed a craniodental morphology that was more specialized than modern gray wolves and rancho labrea wolves for capturing dismembering and consuming bones of very large having evolved this way due to presence of megafauna their stronger jaws and teeth indicate a hypercarnivorous lifestyle an accepted sign of domestication is presence of tooth crowding in which orientation and alignment of teeth are described as touching overlapping or being rotated a 2017 study found that 18 of beringian wolf specimens exhibit tooth crowding compared with 9 for modern wolves and 5 for domestic dogs these specimens predate arrival of humans and therefore there is no possibility of cross breeding with dogs study indicates that tooth crowding can be a natural occurrence in some wolf ecomorphs and cannot be used to differentiate ancient wolves from early dogs thumb 300px diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled north american gray wolves compared by mean mandible tooth measurements

teeth tooth breakage is related to a carnivore s behavior mandibles of canids are buttressed behind carnassial teeth to enable them to crack bones with their post carnassial teeth molars m2 and m3 a study found that modern gray wolf possesses greater buttressing when compared to all other extant canids and extinct dire wolf this indicates that gray wolf is better adapted for cracking bone than other canids in comparison to extant north american gray wolves beringian wolves included many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth and with a significantly greater number of broken teeth frequencies of fracture in wolves ranged from a minimum of 2 found in northern rocky mountain wolf canis lupus up to a maximum of 11 found in beringian wolves distribution of fractures across tooth row also differs with beringian wolves having much higher frequencies of fracture for incisors carnassials and molars a similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption because bones are gnawed with incisors and then cracked with carnassials and molars risk of tooth fracture is also higher when taking and consuming large prey competitors in addition to beringian wolf other beringian carnivores include beringian cave lion panthera spelaea scimitar toothed cat homotherium serum giant short faced bear arctodus simus and omnivorous brown bear ursus arctos beringian wolves would have faced competition for carcasses of large herbivores from formidable giant short faced bear a scavenger additionally humans had reached bluefish caves in yukon territory by 24 000ybp with being found there on specimens of yukon horse steppe bison caribou rangifer tarandus wapiti cervus canadensis and dall sheep ovis dalli a 1993 study proposed that higher frequency of tooth breakage among pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not result of hunting larger game something that might be assumed from larger size of former when there is low prey availability competition between carnivores increases causing them to eat faster and consume more bone leading to tooth breakage compared to modern wolves high frequency of tooth fracture in beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition this proposal was challenged in 2019 when a survey of modern wolf behavior over past 30 years showed that when there was less prey available rates of tooth fracture more than doubled this suggests that large pleistocene carnivores experienced more periods of limited food availability when compared with their modern counterparts range thumb path of beringian wolves from alaska to natural trap cave wyoming denoted with a black dot dog icons represent sites where beringian wolves have previously been found and paw prints represent proposed path through ice sheets remains of beringian wolves have been found in alaska and as far eastward as yukon in canada specimens that have been identified by their skull morphology and limb morphology to be beringian wolves have been found in natural trap cave at base of bighorn mountains in wyoming united states these were radiocarbon dated to between 25 800 and 14 and this location is directly south of what would at that time have been division between laurentide ice sheet and cordilleran ice sheet this suggests that a temporary channel existed between glaciers from 25 until advance of ice sheets 16 000 13 000ybp migration of beringian wolf southwards is assumed to have been result of pursuing prey species as this cave also contained specimens of steppe bison that had migrated from beringia and would have been prey for wolves and muskox that is known to be an important prey species of beringian wolf dire wolves were absent north of latitude in late pleistocene therefore this region would have been available for beringian wolves to expand southwards there is no evidence of expansion beyond this region extinction thumb hollow biosphere reserve on border between russia and mongolia is one of last remnants of mammoth steppe extinction is result of elimination of geographic range of a species with a reduction of its population size down to zero factors that affect biogeographic range and population size include competition predator prey interactions variables of physical environment and chance events phenotype is extinct a phenotype is any observable and measurable characteristic of an organism and includes any morphological behavioral and physiological traits with these characteristics being influenced by genes and environment mammoth steppe lasted for 100 000 years without change until it came to an end around 12 000 years ago american megafaunal extinction event occurred 12 when of mammals weighing over became extinct extinction of large carnivores and scavengers is thought to have been caused by extinction of prey upon which they depended cause of extinction of this megafauna is debated but has been attributed to impact of climate change competition with other species including humans or a combination of both factors for those mammals with modern representatives ancient dna and radiocarbon data indicate that local genetic populations were replaced by others from within same species or by others of same genus thumb upright 1 5 phylogenetic tree based on mdna of wolves modern wolf clade xvi from china mongolia shares a haplotype with a beringian wolf alaska 28 000 ybp postglacial environmental change throughout eastern beringia brought about wholesale changes in vegetation regional extinction of much of megafauna and entrance of homo sapiens large late pleistocene carnivores that were more carnivorous than their competitors faced greater vulnerability to extinction beringian cave lion saber toothed cat and short faced bear went extinct at same time as their large megafaunal prey omnivorous coyote american black bear brown bear puma and bobcat survived both beringian wolf and dire wolf went extinct in north america leaving only less carnivorous and more gracile form of wolf to thrive one extinction theory holds that beringian wolf was outcompeted and replaced by ancestor of modern gray wolf radiocarbon dating of skeletal remains from 56 beringian wolves showed a continuous population from over 50 800 ybp until 12 500ybp followed by one wolf dated at 7 this indicates that their population was in decline after 12 500ybp although megafaunal prey was still available in this region until 10 500ybp timing of this latter specimen is supported by recovery of mammoth and horse dna from sediments dated 10 500 ybp 7 600 ybp from interior of alaska timing for extinction of horses in north america and minimum population size for north american bison coincide with extinction of an entire wolf haplogroup in north america indicating that disappearance of their prey caused extinction of this wolf ecomorph this resulted in a significant loss of phenotypic and genetic diversity within species haplotype is not extinct there are parts of central eurasia where environment is considered to be stable over past 40 000 years in 2016 a study compared mdna sequences of ancient wolf specimens with those from modern wolves including specimens from remote regions of north america russia and china one ancient haplotype that had once existed in both alaska eastern beringia 28 000ybp and russia bear cave area northern urals 18 000ybp was shared by modern wolves found living in mongolia and china indicating a common maternal ancestor study found that genetic diversity of past wolves was lost at beginning of holocene in alaska siberia and europe and that there is limited overlap with modern wolves study did not support two wolf haplogroups that had been proposed by earlier studies for ancient wolves of north america instead of an extinction replacement model indicated by other studies this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck reduction in which ancient wolf diversity was almost lost at beginning of holocene in eurasia loss of many ancient lineages
