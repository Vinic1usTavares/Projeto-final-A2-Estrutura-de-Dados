u s highway 75 us 75 is a united states highway in northwestern iowa it begins at missouri river on a bridge with interstate 129 i 129 and us 20 immediately upon landing in iowa from nebraska i 129 ends at an interchange with i 29 us 20 and us 75 continue around sioux city on a four lane expressway until us 20 exits to east us 75 heads to north northeast parallel to floyd river until le mars there iowa highway 60 iowa 60 continues northeastward on expressway while us 75 heads due north near hull it is briefly overlapped by us 18 it leaves state and enters minnesota north of rock rapids us 75 was one of original u s highways to be created in 1926 though its roots trace back nine years prior to creation of king of trails a auto trail that connected winnipeg manitoba and galveston texas in upper midwest there were two branches of king of trails that converged at sioux city which then continued south to council bluffs in 1920 iowa state highway commission assigned route numbers to roads in order to improve wayfinding for travelers king of trails was assigned primary road no 12 no 12 from council bluffs to sioux city and western branch and no 22 along eastern branch in 1926 u s highway 75 name was applied through iowa to primary roads no 12 and 22 king of trails route in 1950s us 75 s importance began to wane as i 29 was built along missouri river as sections of interstate highway opened up between council bluffs and sioux city us 75 were rerouted onto new road in 1984 southern half of us 75 was removed from iowa and rerouted into nebraska today highway is still an important part of iowa s highway system in late 1990s and throughout 2000s highway along with iowa 60 were improved into a continuous four lane expressway between sioux city and minnesota route description us 75 enters iowa on sergeant floyd memorial bridge which also carries i 129 and us 20 from nebraska over missouri river almost immediately upon landing in iowa there is an interchange with i 29 at which i 129 ends us 75 s business loop of sioux city begins at i 29 interchange as well continuing east us 20 and us 75 run together around southern and eastern sides of sioux city two routes split and us 75 continues to north it soon curves to west around bacon creek park in northeastern corner of city two half interchanges complete reconnection of business loop to mainline highway four lane highway now heads to north northeast parallel to meandering floyd river between road and river lie two sets of railroad tracks one track operated by bnsf railway and other union pacific thumb left us 75 in hinton in hinton highway and railroads separate residential western half of town from eastern half s grain elevator operation through merrill highway s divided highway configuration ends though it remains a four lane road there is a level crossing with bnsf railway line as it splits away to north after crossing western branch of floyd river four lane divided highway resumes us 75 bypasses le mars to west and north near southwestern corner of city there is an interchange that marks beginning of business route through city on western side an interchange with iowa 3 helps direct more traffic to downtown area last le mars interchange takes us 75 off of four lane road iowa 60 assumes expressway at end of exit ramp us 75 reconnects with business loop and highway heads north now on a two lane road us 75 heads due north bnsf railway line and west branch floyd river which previously split away from course of highway rejoin highway near maurice north of maurice is an intersection with iowa 10 which connects to orange city and alton to east and hawarden to west a curve in railway forces highway to deviate from its due north path though it shortly resumes that course river again departs here as road enters sioux center it becomes a four lane undivided highway again it passes through city s downtown area and then through industrial district north of town road becomes three lanes for a short while and then two lanes again as it approaches us 18 near hull two highways overlap for before us 18 turns to west north of us 18 us 75 continues on its due north course it is crossed twice by bnsf railway line as railroad tracks curve to northwest near doon it crosses little rock river followed by rock river later it soon enters rock rapids and meets iowa 9 northernmost east west highway in state west of downtown area two highways head west out of city and us 75 turns to north shortly thereafter road continues north toward minnesota state line still on a northerly path at state line iowa s section lines do not line up with minnesota s section lines so us 75 turns west to follow boundary after a short distance road then turns north and enters state completely history us 75 was created in 1926 with u s highway system but its route dates back to 1917 when king of trails association formed king of trails entered iowa at council bluffs and traveled north along missouri river to sioux city where it branched western branch traveled up into south dakota while eastern branch followed floyd river to le mars and then north to minnesota from le mars in 1920 iowa state highway commission applied route numbers to king of trails primary road no 12 from council bluffs to sioux city and western branch and no 22 along eastern branch in 1926 us 75 was designated along primary roads no 12 and 22 as interstate 29 i 29 was built along banks of missouri river us 75 was gradually moved on interstate highway portion of highway south of sioux city was moved into nebraska in 1984 king of trails king of trails was a highway that connected winnipeg manitoba and galveston texas as it was first planned out in july 1917 road would connect 89 cities with populations over 1000 residents and nine military posts through iowa king of trails entered at council bluffs and traveled north along missouri river through onawa and salix before it reached sioux city there route divided into two forks which met again at ortonville minnesota western branch followed big sioux river through eastern tier of counties in south dakota eastern branch traveled through le mars and rock rapids before entering minnesota there had been some competition between advocates for south dakota minnesota and iowa minnesota routes but in early 1918 compromise was reached and both forks were designated as king of trails primary highways in 1919 iowa general assembly passed a bill that created a fund for improving and hard surfacing nearly of primary roads in state primary road system was to connect every city and town with at least 1000 inhabitants bill gave iowa s 99 counties responsibility for maintaining roads which had previously fallen upon road associations that sponsored their respective highways new primary roads were assigned route numbers a trend in other midwestern states route numbers were painted onto telegraph and telephone poles in order to guide travelers without need for maps king of trails route was assigned two numbers primary road no 12 from council bluffs to sioux city which included western fork into south dakota and primary road no 22 from sioux city to minnesota u s highway origins 100px right iowa us 75 shield in mid 1920s automobile associations continued to sponsor their named routes there were 64 such named routes in iowa on top of route numbers given by state highway commission this proved to be more confusing than helpful to casual traveler so in 1924 american association of state highway officials aasho later aashto called for a national system of interstate highways of proposed by aasho nearly were allocated to iowa support for system was unanimous among iowa transportation officials and new national routings and route numbers were assigned in 1925 iowa state highway commission chose to renumber a few highways as to not have conflicting route numbers along important routes us 75 was designated along primary roads no 12 and 22 which was king of trails route once u s highway system was established automobile association sponsored roads gradually disappeared original routing us 75 and us 30 entered iowa via ak sar ben bridge over missouri river two highways followed broadway through council bluffs and then north along lincoln highway which was a graded dirt road routes winded through loess hills until honey creek and at base of hills until missouri valley there us 30 split away to east and us 75 to west and then to north again us 75 continued along base of loess hills where it met iowa 127 it then curved west onto missouri river flats at highway turned north again to run roughly parallel to missouri river it passed through little sioux river sioux and before meeting iowa 37 in onawa thumb left 4th street in sioux city north of onawa to monona woodbury county line us 75 headed north northwest on a gravel road after crossing into woodbury county near sloan a long section of paved road began road headed north northwest through whiting and sloan at sergeant bluff it turned north toward sioux city upon entering city us 75 followed lakeport road until reaching morningside avenue which carried iowa 141 us 75 turned west to follow morningside avenue past eponymous college routes followed a stair step routing until they reached road which carried us 20 three routes crossed floyd river together and entered downtown sioux city along 4th street at court street they diverged us 20 and iowa 141 continued west along 4th and us 75 turned north onto court when it reached 27th street route turned back to east toward floyd avenue onto which it turned floyd avenue headed northeast it became leeds road upon exiting city north of sioux city us 75 followed a paved road that ran parallel to floyd river and two rail lines chicago st paul minneapolis and omaha railway and dubuque and sioux city railroad operated by illinois central it passed through hinton and merrill before entering le mars it intersected iowa 27 a few blocks west of downtown north of le mars us 75 followed a gravel road that roughly traveled due north it passed near struble and maurice intersected iowa 10 and then went through sioux center at perkins highway intersected us 18 and two highways headed north then west and then north again for a few miles at doon us 18 turned west to go toward inwood us 75 eased back to east to reach rock rapids and iowa 9 highway moved back to west and entered minnesota improvements system of auto trails that coursed through iowa prior to u s highway system were routed to bring tourist traffic through towns along trails often times trail routes were determined by which cities had paid dues to trail s association by 1929 highway was paved from council bluffs to missouri valley stretch of highway overlapped by us 30 next year entire route between council bluffs and sioux city was paved in 1930s iowa received a 10 million grant equivalent to in from federal government for improving highways along northern section of us 75 engineers sought to straighten highway before paving could begin by end of decade highway was straightened and paved between sioux center and rock rapids us 18 was also relocated in area so overlap of two routes was eliminated between perkins and doon since doon was bypassed to east iowa 167 was created to serve town in sioux city road was shifted west to near missouri river past sergeant floyd memorial along lewis road and plymouth street in later years road would be straightened through sioux city again and renamed lewis boulevard former alignment on lakeport road and morningside avenue became iowa 230 decline federal aid highway act of 1956 brought interstate highway system to united states and of new highways to iowa which included a highway along eastern bank of missouri river construction began in segments on what would become i 29 in late 1950s near sioux city and council bluffs when section of i 29 opened between n 16th street in council bluffs and missouri valley us 75 was rerouted off of its old lincoln highway alignment and onto new freeway us 30 alternate which had replaced mainline us 30 was only remaining route along old lincoln highway a new bridge for i 480 adjacent to ak sar ben bridge opened in 1966 within a few years i 29 was complete between council bluffs and sioux city and us 75 was shifted off of its two lane road and onto interstate highway in sioux city us 75 exited i 29 at industrial road now known as singing hills boulevard which was a short connector to lewis boulevard in 1984 iowa department of transportation and nebraska department of roads proposed to aashto a number of changes that would alter highway systems of both states nebraska proposed that us 73 which ended at us 20 in south sioux city would be truncated and its northern end pulled all way back to an intersection with us 75 in southeastern nebraska iowa and nebraska jointly proposed moving us 75 out of iowa between council bluffs and sioux city from redundant i 29 corridor and onto corridor abandoned by us 73 proposed changes were approved iowa dot officials made transfer official on december 5 1984 now a much shorter highway within iowa it entered state on i 129 bridge with us 20 upon entering state northbound us 75 immediately exited onto southbound i 29 in order to reach singing hills boulevard and resume its course modernization while highway south of sioux city was growing less important due to construction of i 29 highway north of sioux city was growing in importance in late 1950s us 75 was widened to four lanes from lewis boulevard in sioux city to le mars in 1968 state highway commission slated a number of important corridors including sioux city to minnesota corridor which comprised us 75 and then iowa 33 to be expanded to a four lane expressway these corridors were to be completed with highest priority once interstate highway system was completed in state however only section of corridor between sioux city and le mars was improved by end of 20th century in late 1990s iowa dot once again identified six corridors in need of upgrading to four lane highway one of those corridors was us 75 and iowa 60 from sioux city to minnesota part of corridor improvements included two bypasses on us 75 completion of one around sioux city and construction of one around le mars sioux city bypass took five years to complete and opened on november 19 2001 former routing along lewis boulevard became us 75 business residents of le mars area were presented plans for construction of their bypass in february 2003 acquisition of property and construction of bypass took three and a half years bypass opened on november 22 2006 like in sioux city former routing of us 75 through le mars became a business route major intersections references footnotes works cited external links iowa termini of us 75 at iowa highway ends us 75 at iowa highways page iowa 75 category transportation
