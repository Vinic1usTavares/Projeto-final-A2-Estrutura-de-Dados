eighty four history after first world war university of london then based at imperial institute in kensington was in urgent need of new office and teaching space to allow for its growth and expansion in 1921 government bought of land in bloomsbury from duke of bedford to provide a new site for university however many within university were opposed to a move and in 1926 duke bought back land however election of william beveridge to post of vice chancellor of university in june 1926 was highly significant as beveridge supported a move to bloomsbury beveridge persuaded rockefeller foundation to donate ps400 000 to university and original site was reacquired in 1927 thumb left crush hall of senate house beveridge saw university as one for nation and world drawing from overseas as many students as oxford and cambridge and all other english universities together beveridge quoted by and specified that central symbol of university on bloomsbury site can not fittingly look like an imitation of any other university it must not be a replica from middle ages it should be something that could not have been built by any earlier generation than this and can only be at home in london building means a chance to enrich london to give london at its heart not just more streets and shops but a great architectural feature an academic island in swirling tides of traffic a world of learning in a world of affairs grand art deco design was work of charles holden who was appointed as architect in march 1931 from a short list which also included giles gilbert scott percy scott worthington and arnold dunbar smith in making their choice beveridge and principal edwin deller were influenced by success of holden s recently completed 55 broadway designed as headquarters for london electric railway and then tallest office building in london holden s original plan for university building was for a single structure covering whole site stretching almost from montague place to torrington street it comprised a central spine linked by a series of wings to perimeter facade and enclosing a series of courtyards scheme was to be topped by two towers taller senate house and a smaller one to north design featured elevations of load bearing brick work faced with portland stone holden used portland stone frequently as he considered it only stone that washes itself karol capable of withstanding london s then smoggy atmosphere construction began in 1932 and was undertaken by holland hannen cubitts cubitts 1810 1975 published 1975 king george v laid ceremonial foundation stone on 26 june 1933 and first staff moved in during 1936 university s centenary year on 27 november 1936 a group of university officials led by principal sir edwin deller went out to inspect work in progress suddenly without warning a skip being pushed by a workman overhead accidentally fell down and hit them all were rushed to university college hospital where three days later deller died of his injuries due to a lack of funds full design was gradually cut back and only senate house and library were completed in 1937 although external flanking wings of north eastern courtyard were not constructed as he had with his earlier buildings holden also prepared designs for individual elements of interior design completion of buildings for institute of education and school of oriental studies followed but onset of second world war prevented any further progress on full scheme critical opinion thumb senate house entrance architectural character and scale of building has received both positive and negative criticism since its construction steen rasmussen a friend of holden commented that with expansive design london university is swallowing more and more of old houses and this quarter which duke of bedford laid out for good domestic houses has taken on quite a different character quoted in karol evelyn waugh in put out more flags 1942 describes it as vast bulk of london university insulting autumnal sky quoted in karol positive comments came from functionalist architect erich mendelsohn in 1938 who wrote to holden that he was very much taken and am convinced that there is no finer building in london mendelsohn quoted in karol architectural historian arnold described building as a static massive pyramid obviously designed to last for a thousand years but thought interior is more pleasing than exterior there is essentially atmosphere of dignity serenity and repose that one associates with architecture of ancient greece nikolaus pevsner was less enthusiastic he described its style as strangely semi traditional undecided modernism and summarised result design certainly does not possess vigour and directness of charles holden s smaller underground stations others have described it as stalinist or as totalitarian due to its great scale holden recognised that his architectural style placed him in rather a curious position not quite in fashion and not quite out of it not enough of a traditionalist to please traditionalists and not enough of a modernist to please modernists holden quoted in karol present day right thumb senate house tower as seen from below senate house remains a prominent landmark throughout bloomsbury and is visible from some distance away building was listed as grade ii in 1969 following a
