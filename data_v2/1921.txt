his problems to his neighbor mrs prophecy of blood prophecy of blood is unusual in two ways it is first of bartholomew of sandwich s prophecies to feature a repeating refrain and it is carved backwards in a tight corner of prophecy room so that a mirror is required to read it nerissa tells gregor she believes sandwich purposely made it difficult to read in order to emphasize how difficult it is to understand and gregor later hypothesizes that sandwich forced humans to read it using mirrors so that as a person read they would see themselves ripred similarly points out that an annoying little dance boots makes up to go along with prophecy s refrain echoes this theme by forcing questers to turn and see themselves before they realize that plague originated with humans boots s help deciphering this prophecy leads characters to rely on her to do same in series s later books in gregor and marks of secret boots begins dancing to a song sandwich carved in nursery not room of prophecies after characters witness mass execution of a group of nibblers and becomes totally convinced that song is actually yet another prophecy in gregor and code of claw when prophecy of time calls for a princess to crack a boots is immediately assigned role because of her importance to last two prophecies despite fact that she is still a toddler repeating refrain goes as follows turn and turn and turn again you see what but not when remedy and wrong entwine and so they form a single vine gregor hypothesizes that sandwich included a cryptic repeating segment in prophecy to drum meaning of these lines into heads of his readers or to emphasize their importance prophecy s other stanzas describe plague and who it affects call for warrior s return explain how to find cure and win allies amongst nonhuman species and warn strongly against allowing a war to start in underland gregor refers to this final point as sandwich s usual prediction that if things didn t work out there would be

first two of series in words of tasha of school library journal for example collins maintains momentum charm and vivid settings of original title horn book magazine review went further saying that this immensely readable installment won t disappoint fans of first two books in fact collins seems to have hit her stride with this page turner kirkus mentioned novel s more serious plot and themes with review s comment this offering takes on an even darker tone than earlier ones delving into meaty questions of territorial expansion and its justification a review in library media connection on other hand said that collins s subtle messages about horrors of war and benefits of peace make book worthy of discussion by readers of all ages collins herself has said that she would like to take topics like war and introduce them at an earlier age if you look at gregor it has all kinds of topics there s biological warfare there s genocide there s military intelligence but it s in a fantasy collins has also stated that she approaches her books same way her father approached explaining his military service to her as a child at a level understandable to children but not without honest descriptions needed to show true gravity of situation a review published in bulletin of center for children s books makes claim that gregor s evolution from a scared unwilling combatant in first book to a morally responsible talented warrior here makes his character realistic and appealing and thus that increased violence in gregor and curse of warmbloods is a necessary part of his character
