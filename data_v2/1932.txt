mauritius blue pigeon alectroenas nitidissimus is an extinct species of blue pigeon formerly endemic to mascarene island of mauritius in indian ocean east of madagascar it has two extinct relatives from mascarenes and three extant ones from other islands it is type species of genus of blue pigeons alectroenas it had white hackles around head neck and breast and blue plumage on body and it was red on tail and bare parts of head these colours were thought similar to those of dutch flag a resemblance reflected in some of bird s names males had red foreheads and juveniles may have been partially green it was 30 cm 12 in long and larger and more robust than any other blue pigeon species it could raise its hackles into a ruff which it used for display its call sounded like barf barf and it also made a cooing noise it fed on fruits nuts and molluscs and was once widespread in forests of mauritius bird was first mentioned in 17th century and was described several times thereafter but very few accounts describe behaviour of living specimens several stuffed and at least one live specimen reached europe in 18th and 19th centuries only three stuffed specimens exist today and only one bird was ever depicted when alive species is thought to have become extinct in 1830s due to deforestation and predation taxonomy upright thumb left illustration of a stuffed specimen published with sonnerat s 1782 description first record of mauritius blue pigeon is two sketches in 1601 1603 journal of dutch ship gelderland birds appear to have been freshly killed or stunned drawings were made by dutch artist joris on mauritius but were not published until 1969 francois in 1651 briefly mentions white black and red turtle doves encountered in 1638 which is thought to be first unequivocal mention of bird next account is that of jean francois charpentier de cossigny in mid 18th century french naturalist pierre sonnerat described bird in 1782 calling it pigeon dutch pigeon a french vernacular name that derives from its red white and blue colouration which reminded him of dutch flag french flag did not yet have these colours he had collected two specimens during a voyage in 1774 these syntype specimens were deposited in museum national d histoire naturelle in paris by 1893 only one of them specimen mnhn g 2000 727 still existed and had been damaged by sulphuric acid in an attempt at fumigation since sonnerat named and described them in french scientific naming of bird was left to tyrolean naturalist giovanni antonio scopoli who did not observe a specimen himself but latinised sonnerat s description in 1786 he named bird columba nitidissima which means most brilliant pigeon when german naturalist johann friedrich gmelin redescribed bird with species name franciae of france in 1789 he referred to french tricolour which had just been flown for first time pierre joseph bonnaterre used name dutch one in his description in 1790 in 1840 english zoologist george robert gray named a new genus alectroenas for mauritius blue pigeon in greek means domestic cock and means dove alectroenas nitidissima is type species of genus which includes all blue pigeons specific name was emended from a nitidissimus to a nitidissima by ioc world bird list in 2012 another skin arrived at paris museum in 1800 collected by colonel m mathieu for french ornithologist louis dufresne it was sold in 1819 among other items was sent to edinburgh and is now in national museum of scotland as specimen mu no 624 it was not identified as a mauritius blue pigeon until british ornithologist alfred newton saw it in 1879 last specimen recorded was shot in savanne in 1826 and given to julien desjardins founder of mauritius natural history museum in port louis where it is still located though in poor condition only these three specimens still exist subfossil remains of mauritius blue pigeon were collected in mare aux swamp by theodore in 1889 more were collected by etienne around 1900 they are thought to have been found near le pouce mountain and plaine des roches evolution alectroenas blue pigeons are closely interrelated and occur widely throughout islands in western indian ocean they are allopatric and can therefore be regarded as a superspecies there are three extant species madagascan blue pigeon a madagascariensis comoros blue pigeon a and seychelles blue pigeon a three mascarene islands were each home to a species all of which are extinct mauritius blue pigeon rodrigues blue pigeon a and reunion blue pigeon a sp compared with other pigeons blue pigeons are medium to large stocky and have longer wings and tails all species have distinct mobile hackles on head and neck tibiotarsus is comparatively long and tarsometatarsus short blue pigeons may have colonised mascarenes seychelles or a now submerged hot spot island by island hopping they may have evolved into a distinct genus there before reaching madagascar their closest genetic relative is cloven feathered dove of new caledonia from which they separated 8 9 million years ago their ancestral group appears to be fruit doves ptilinopus of southeast asia and oceania description thumb upright life drawing of a male displaying its head feathers ca 1790 by g haasbroek feathers on head neck and breast of mauritius blue pigeon were silvery white long stiffened and pointed especially around neck a patch of bright red naked skin surrounded eyes and extended across cheeks to beak which was greenish with a dark tip plumage of body was indigo and back scapular feathers and wings were metallic blue base of outer rectrices was partially blackish blue tail feathers and tail coverts were maroon legs were dark slate grey iris was reddish orange and had an inner yellow ring bird was 30 cm 12 in in length wings were 208 mm 8 2 in tail was 132 mm 5 2 in culmen was 25 mm 1 in and tarsals were 28 mm 1 10 in it was largest and most robust member of its genus and hackles were longer and covered a larger area than in other blue pigeons thumb left subfossil tarsometatarsus leg bone in naturalis biodiversity center unlike three surviving skins of mauritius blue pigeons one of two illustrations other is in black and white of a live individual kept in netherlands around 1790 shows a red forehead both sexes of seychelles blue pigeon also have red foreheads and english palaeontologist julian hume has suggested that image depicts a male which was described as infinitely more handsome than female by cossigny in mid 18th century hume therefore interprets three surviving skins as belonging to female specimens a mauritian woman recalling observations of mauritius blue pigeons around 1815 mentioned green as one of its colours juvenile seychelles and comoro blue pigeons have green feathers so this may also have been case for juvenile mauritian pigeons some depictions and descriptions have shown legs of mauritius blue pigeons as red like those of madagascar blue pigeon legs of paris specimen were painted red when original colour faded presumably on basis of such accounts legs of two other surviving specimens have not been painted and have faded to a yellowish brown this feature is not mentioned in contemporary accounts and such depictions are thought to be erroneous some modern restorations of bird have also depicted it with facial crenulations like those of seychelles blue pigeon this feature was unknown from contemporary accounts until 1660s report of johannes pretorius about his stay on mauritius was published in 2015 where he mentioned bird s warty face behaviour and ecology thumb left upright 1907 illustration of paris specimen by john gerrard keulemans red legs are an inaccuracy few descriptions of behaviour of mauritius blue pigeons are known unpublished notes by desjardins are now lost an individual was brought to netherlands around 1790 where it survived in menagerie of william v prince of orange for three months before dying of oedema only two known life drawings of species by g haasbroek depict this individual illustrations show a displaying male raising its hackles into a ruff this is a characteristic behaviour of other blue pigeons too and they can also vibrate their hackles following description of display behaviour and calls of this individual was written on back on coloured drawing by arnout vosmaer director of menagerie thumb upright life drawings of a male with raised and lowered hackles c 1790 mauritius blue pigeon probably lived in pairs or small groups in humid mountainous evergreen forests like their extant relatives subfossil remains have been found in mid west mid east and south east mauritius indicating that bird was once widespread by 1812 french naturalist jacques gerard milbert stated that solitary individuals were found in river valleys they probably became rarer during french rule in mauritius 1715 1810 as lowland areas of island were almost completely deforested during this time many other endemic species of mauritius became extinct after arrival of man so ecosystem of island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct before humans arrived forests covered mauritius entirely but very little remains today because of deforestation surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened mauritius blue pigeon lived alongside other recently extinct mauritian birds such as dodo red rail mascarene grey parakeet broad billed parrot mauritius owl mascarene coot mauritian shelduck mauritian duck and mauritius night heron extinct mauritian reptiles include saddle backed mauritius giant tortoise domed mauritius giant tortoise mauritian giant skink and round island burrowing boa small mauritian flying fox and snail tropidophora carinata lived on mauritius and reunion but became extinct in both islands some plants such as and palm orchid have also become extinct diet thumb upright 1811 illustration by pauline knip and cesar fruits and nuts were probably mainstay of mauritius blue pigeon s diet and like other blue pigeons it may have occupied upper canopy and migrated seasonally to where food was available cossigny dissected a specimen in mid 18th century and later sent it and its stomach contents to french scientist rene antoine ferchault de reaumur with a letter describing his findings gizzard and crop contained four nuts which cossigny was told were seeds of either calophyllum tacamahaca or comoro and seychelles blue pigeons also feed on c tacamahaca and strong gizzard of former helps in digestion of seeds in 1812 jacques gerard milbert provided only description of behaviour of bird in wild claim that bird fed on river molluscs was criticised by french zoologists alphonse milne edwards and emile oustalet in 1893 with later agreement of american ornithologist james greenway in 1967 as blue pigeons are principally arboreal it has since been pointed out that other mainly frugivorous pigeons such as species of ptilinopus and do occasionally eat molluscs and other invertebrates two species of nesoenas have also been reported as eating freshwater snails and one was seen hunting tadpoles milbert may in any case have been referring to arboreal snails as extant blue pigeons rarely land on ground a diet of snails would have provided birds with calcium for egg production pretorius attempted to keep juvenile and adult mauritius blue pigeons in captivity but all his specimens died this is probably because species was almost exclusively frugivorous like extant blue pigeons extinction thumb left sketches of recently killed specimens on mauritius from gelderland journal 1601 mauritius blue pigeon coexisted with humans for 200 years its decline can be correlated with deforestation which is also main threat to extant blue pigeons little lowland forest was left on island by 1859 frugivorous birds often need a large area for foraging and move between forest types to feed on different types of food which grow irregularly other blue pigeons perch on bare branches making them vulnerable to hunters cossigny noted that bird had become rare by 1755 but were common 23 years before and attributed decline to deforestation and hunting by escaped slaves on other hand french naturalist pierre joseph bonnaterre stated they were still common in 1790 mauritius blue pigeon was not seasonally poisonous like pink pigeon which still survives on mauritius today but it was reputed to be in spite of this it was hunted for food and some early accounts praised flavour of bird extant blue pigeons are also considered good food and are heavily hunted as a result and it appears another population of them was hunted to extinction from farquhar and providence islands mauritius blue pigeon was easy to catch due to island tameness thumb upright 1808 illustration by j last confirmed specimen was shot in savanne district in 1826 but 1832 report by desjardins suggests that some could still be found in remote forests in centre of island convinced that pigeon still survived british ornithologist edward newton interviewed two inhabitants of mauritius about mauritius blue pigeon in 1863 and these accounts suggest that bird survived until at least 1837 first interviewee claimed he had killed two specimens when british colonel james simpson stayed on island which was 1826 37 second was a woman who had last seen a bird around this time and recalled hunts of it in approximately 1815 in a swampy area near black river gorges south western mauritius it can be concluded that mauritius blue pigeon became extinct in 1830s apart from habitat destruction and hunting introduced predators mainly crab eating macaques were probably also responsible
