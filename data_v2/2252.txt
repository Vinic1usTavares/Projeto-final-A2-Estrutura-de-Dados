baby rabbits tale was influenced by uncle remus stories and was set in fields of potter s castle farm black and white illustrations outnumber those in colour tale is critically considered one of potter s most complex and successful in plot and tone macdonald 1986 p 23 potter s publisher wanted mr tod to be first in a new series of peter rabbit tales in larger formats with elaborate bindings but potter disliked idea nonetheless mr tod and its 1913 follower tale of pigling bland were published in new formats but idea was eventually dropped and ordinary bindings were adopted for reprints two tales were last completely original productions by potter she continued to publish sporadically but used decades old concepts and sketches rather than new images and ideas in 1995 an animated film adaptation of tale was featured on bbc television anthology series world of peter rabbit and friends background thumb potter 1912 following her acquisition of hill top farm in 1905 in lancashire now cumbria potter began her most creative and productive years as a children s author and illustrator macdonald 1986 p 87 by end of decade however she had grown weary of writing for children her eyesight was failing and demands of operating her farm and caring for her aging parents limited amount of time and attention she could allocate to production of books taylor 1987 p 144 in 1912 however she brought peter rabbit and his kin together for one last time in tale of mr tod she thought her editors too cautious and too concerned about offending public and knew she was capable of creating more complex characters and plots in mr tod she offered her fans two villainous characters mr tod and tommy brock a fox and a badger tale of mr tod and book to follow in 1913 tale of pigling bland were her last completely original works kutzer 2003 p 133 her marriage to william in october 1913 effectively put an end to her career as a children s author and illustrator but she continued to produce sporadically over following years at demand of fans and publisher though relying upon decades old ideas and sketches rather than new concepts and illustrations macdonald 1986 p 2003 p 157 composition and publication influenced in part by uncle remus stories mr tod is longer than potter s earlier tales and set in sawrey countryside at bull banks and oatmeal crag two fields potter acquired with castle farm in 1909 pen and ink sketches outnumber watercolors lear 2008 p 243 potter s publisher harold warne received text of mr tod in november 1911 though potter had written tale some time in past taylor 1996 p 124 warne had doubts about name tod for a fox but potter responded tod is surely a very common name for a fox it is probably saxon it was word in ordinary use in scotland a few years ago probably is still amongst country people in same way brock or gray is country name for a badger i should call them brocks both names are used in westmoreland are examples of place names also broxbourne and hey tod it s a bright night wind s in west and moon shines bright mean to say you never heard that thumb esthwaite water above bull banks and oatmeal crag are three real world locales depicted in book s illustrations tale is about undesirable elements of society warne objected to potter s opening paragraph i am quite tired of making goody goody books about nice people i will make a book about two disagreeable people called tommy brock and mr tod he altered text to read i have made many books about well behaved people potter responded if it were not impertinent to lecture one s publisher you are a great deal too much afraid of public for whom i have never cared one button i have always thought opening paragraph distinctly good because it gets away from once upon a time taylor 1987 p 146 she teased him about name bull banks and his sensitivity to less than genteel expressions one thinks nothing of bulls and in farming world but after you objected to cigars it occurred to me to wonder taylor 1987 p 143 there were no objections and tale was finished in july lear 2008 p 245 thumb upright left tommy brock spring of 1912 was emotionally unsettling for potter her father was ill and severe strikes across country caused hardships in april 1912 she managed to get away from london for hill top to execute background drawings for tale by july most of colour blocks were finished but potter was concerned about anatomy of fox and checked photographs and reference books in natural history museum in an attempt to distinguish true english red fox vulpes vulpes from other species book was finished by end of july when she left for holiday at lake windemere lear 2008 pp 244 5 completion of tale had taken longer than usual because her time had been shared with participation in a campaign opposing hydroplanes on lake windemere and proposed construction of an aeroplane factory near lake tale of mr tod was published by frederick warne co in 1912 and dedicated to francis william two year old son of her cousin caroline hutton clark who had married laird of ulva and was living and farming on a small island off coast of mull for francis william of ulva someday during course of tale s development warne proposed launching mr tod as first in a new series of tales in slightly larger formats with elaborate bindings to accommodate wider spines potter objected she did not want to become involved in a new series her eyesight was failing and she had grown weary of writing she complained of having difficulty in producing fresh short stories and believed children preferred little change in books lear 2008 p 244 nonetheless mr tod and next book tale of pigling bland were published in a larger format with elaborate bindings as series ii new style macdonald 1986 p 44 potter disliked new endpaper depicting samuel whiskers sticking up a giant poster while watched by other animal characters thinking it too like a railway advertisement eventually larger format and new designation were dropped and ordinary binding adopted for reprints taylor 1987 p 148 plot tale begins with tommy brock a badger being entertained by old mr bouncer father of benjamin bunny mr bouncer has been left to tend his grandchildren while his son and daughter in law flopsy are away but after smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco he falls asleep in tommy s company tommy puts bunnies in his sack and slips out when parents return benjamin sets off in pursuit of thief benjamin finds and brings his cousin peter rabbit into rescue venture and two discover tommy has invaded one of mr tod s homes mr tod a fox has multiple homes but keeps moving often tommy lodges in his homes peeping through bedroom window rabbits see tommy asleep in mr tod s bed and peeping through kitchen window they see table set for a meal they realise bunnies are alive but shut in oven they try to dig a tunnel into house but hide when mr tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper which has caused him to move house fox discovers badger asleep in his bed and originally plans to hit him but decides against this due to badger s teeth he decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on overhead tester of bed brock however is awake escapes trick and makes tea for himself in kitchen mr tod thinks bucket has killed tommy and decides to bury him in tunnel rabbits have dug thinking tommy dug it when mr tod discovers tommy in kitchen and has tea thrown over him a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors two roll away down hill still fighting benjamin and peter quickly gather bunnies and return home in triumph macdonald 1986 pp 44 5 illustrations thumb upright mr tod tale of mr tod is longer than typical potter tale with 16 colour illustrations and a series of 42 black and white drawings one illustration per page illustrations depict wider landscape of near sawrey bull banks oatmeal crag and esthwaite water interior of mr tod s house provided opportunity to present details of interiors of village homes in frontispiece mr tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of and plank construction interlocking thick and thin vertical panels covered with a sage green a tea caddy a silver salt and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen beehive shaped brick oven was drawn from one at sun inn in and serves as a place for brock to hide bunnies denyer 2009 p 113 emphatic frames in black and white illustrations give impression of woodcuts potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back distance potter made kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of battle between tod and brock thumb upright left caxton s fox and grapes 1484 scholar ruth k macdonald argues that black and white illustrations emphasize mythic permanent quality of tale with heavy black lines that display little of delicacy characteristic of potter s work she suggests these pictures are more like woodcuts in their heaviness than drawings and points out they were not tossed off to satisfy fans and her publisher but deliberately planned to give an antique primitive quality to story in manner of caxton s woodcuts for his edition of aesop s fables macdonald 1986 p 49 she notes that colour illustrations are not nor surrounded with heavy black lines but rather with a white border that prevents pastels from fading into background lightness of pastels and overall green tones of colour illustrations contrast with heavy lines of black and white pictures and blocks of print and this contrast produces a sense of fading because of antiquity yet suggest permanence as greenness of nature is permanent and recurring in cycle of seasons reception many of potter s tales appealed to girls but mr tod had a strong following among boys due perhaps to lengthy fight at end of book accompanied by dreadful bad language six year old harold botcherby wrote to potter asking if fight between tod and brock was still raging potter replied describing end of battle and injuries to combatants lear 2008 p am sorry to tell you they are still quarreling mr tod has been living in willow till he was flooded out at present he is in stick house with a bad cold in his head as for end of fight mr tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of his brush tail and five bad bites especially one ear which is up like you sometimes see nasty old tom cat s ears only misfortune to tommy brock he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots so for a long time he went about with one of his feet bundled up in dirty rags like an old beggar man then he found boot in quarry there was a beetle in boot and several slugs tommy brock ate them he is a nasty person he will go on living in mr tod s comfortable house till springtime then he will move off into woods live out doors and mr tod will come back very very cautiously there will need to be a big spring cleaning taylor 1996 p 125 in 1915 children of an unknown family living in a devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in lack of a sequel to mr tod potter enjoyed continuing lives of her characters through these letters and responded it is sad to have caused such disappointment i think i saw tommy brock s wife last week i couldn t think who person reminded me of and when i read your letter i remembered directly i am not sure how many of a family there are lots and what we call a long family all ages with some long time between i believe tommy brock is very grumpy with grown up ones and makes them clear off into woods and as you know he is not often at home himself mrs badger is rather lighter coloured than he is rather sandy with little piggy eyes and a nose and a not particularly clean house i should say she finishes wearing out tommy s celebrated boots mr tod has been across lately i smelt him myself but he had removed before hounds came lane 2001 p 127 critical commentary tale of mr tod was sketched out long before its 1912 publication and is a forbidding tale with relief only in landscape illustrations graham greene thought potter was suffering some sort of emotional disturbance when tale was composed but potter denied allegation and observed only that she was suffering after effects of flu she deprecated greene s freudian school of criticism taylor 1987 p 145 there are a few inconsistencies from naturalist s view point foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature badgers do not normally invade homes of foxes and are not typically dirty badgers do sometimes eat bunnies not from a predilection for bunnies but simply because they are omnivorous inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger macdonald 1986 p 47 tale does have archetypical sources in stories of uncle remus there both rabbits and foxes contend but unlike fox in uncle remus potter fox is not particularly wily and rabbits win not by outsmarting fox but only because they enjoy a stroke of luck badger is not a typical animal in uncle remus but in potter he is clever one finale reunites rabbits but wily animals win nothing mr tod and uncle remus stories are only similar in depicting powerless triumphing over powerful adaptations mr tod was adapted to animation and telecast as a segment of bbc anthology series world of peter rabbit and friends and don henderson voiced tod and brock respectively british screenwriter mark huckerby voiced mr tod in british american cgi animated children s television series and mr tod and tommy brock voiced by and sam neill in this
