thumb illawarra steam navigation company s ss bega at eden in 1903 illawarra steam navigation company was a shipping company that serviced south coast of new south wales australia from 1858 to early 1950s it was formed through amalgamation of general steam navigation company kiama steam navigation company and shoalhaven steam navigation company each of whom serviced parts of south coast with their respective vessels after merging new company held a near monopoly in regard to shipping on south coast and their fleet visited every significant port between sydney and border of victoria company transported both passengers and a range of produce including livestock and hence it became known as pig and whistle line it was said that ships would wait an hour for a pig but not a minute for a passenger over years more than twenty steamships were a part of fleet including 1112 ton merimbula and 693 ton eden many of these vessels were purpose built for company s needs and were constructed at shipyards both within australia and abroad company s eventual demise came as a result of a number of factors including increased competition from road and rail cost of replacing ships after world war ii waterfront disputes and rising costs as a consequence after almost 100 years in operation company was placed into voluntary receivership and was delisted from stock exchange in 1955 history thumb allowrie thumb wharf at tathra which was erected through funding provided by local farmers and illawarra steam navigation company prior to formation of illawarra steam navigation company in 1858 pemberton states in 1858 a merger of those ships owned by eddie manning kiama s n co and shoalhaven s n co took place and outcome was given title illawarra steam navigation company a number of companies and individuals ran steamships along south coast of new south wales first of these was sophia jane which had traveled to australia under her own power from united kingdom and was first steamship to do so arriving in sydney in 1831 but while sophia jane ran a service to wollongong a more regular service was provided from 1839 with establishment of illawarra steam packet company illawarra steam packet company was not known by that name for long as just three months after being established company merged with brisbane water steam passenger co to become general steam navigation company newly formed company initially employed two steam vessels maitland and william iv both of which were built in new south wales on williams river and company serviced hunter river along with south coast general steam navigation company continued to expand services to jervis bay and kiama were trialled and later abandoned and company launched illawarra to handle run to wollongong nevertheless competition soon emerged this included screw driven steamship which began operations in 1852 between sydney and wollongong although she failed to achieve commercial success and was sold to victorian interests other competition emerged as a direct result of lack of service provided to ports further south of wollongong residents at two of those towns kiama and shoalhaven were led to form two new steamship companies in 1854 these new companies kiama steam navigation company and shoalhaven steam navigation company respectively ran steamships kiama and nora creina at this point three steamship companies were handling south coast and this proved to be too much competition for their respective interests thus in 1855 an agreement was reached leaving south coast to just illawarra kiama and nora creina however an enquiry had been undertaken into transport facilities in bega district in 1851 in october 1858 illawarra steam navigation company through an act of new south wales parliament became an amalgam of three companies new amalgamated company possessed a fleet of at least three vessels illawarra kiama and nora creina that had been servicing region to this list nowra was added while a sixth was soon included on register number of ships continued to grow and by 1866 illawarra steam navigation company was running weekly services from south coast ports to sydney carrying wool cedar coal and a variety of raw materials as company expanded it became known as pig whistle run due to main cargo and whistle that was made by ships prior to departing from port company was to play a leading role in development of coastal new south wales and her ships were to stop at every port between sydney and victorian border as such by 1905 company was able to link eden by regular steam communication with sydney launceston tasmania hobart and new zealand company enjoyed a near monopoly on south coast trade for many years negotiating with or taking over many potential competitors although competition from rail and road transport were to play a significant role in eventual demise of company along with cargo company also took passengers and an article by henry lawson published in bulletin in 1910 and titled bermagui in a strange sunset describes a steamer journey from bermagui to sydney in all likelihood lawson was traveling with company unfortunately in 1928 one of company s vessels merimbula ran ashore on beecroft head while heading south after this wreck passenger shipping to south coast finished and company focused entirely upon cargo in 1904 company was incorporated as illawarra and south coast steam navigation company and company continued to operate successfully until second world war however significant problems had emerged for company even though it remained in good financial standing in particular road transport was able to offer a door to door service although company did attempt to provide something similar at narooma and railways provided increased competition entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from shipping line when combined with waterfront disputes rising costs and post war costs of ship replacement company was in trouble and in 1948 for first time no dividend was paid to investors in 1950 company entered into voluntary liquidation and this led to from australian stock exchange in 1955 australian stock exchange information ports thumb wharf at nelligen on clyde river in early 1850s when general steam navigation company kiama steam navigation company and shoalhaven steam navigation company were independent operations major ports of call along south coast of new south wales included sydney wollongong shoalhaven merimbula kiama and twofold bay after amalgamation of three companies this list included stops at gerringong batemans bay and nelligen later minor gold rushes at both moruya and district resulted in their inclusion and other ports were to include bermagui eden narooma and tathra extent of illawarra steam navigation company s operations along coast can be seen by their 1870 schedule in which they were making journey to kiama shoalhaven and gerringong every three days and to ulladulla clyde shoalhaven and wollongong at about same rate was visited every two weeks while an additional journey was made to merimbula and ulladulla once a week 1873 saw a simplification of these services and a weekly run to merimbula eden and tathra was amongst changes maintaining services of illawarra steam navigation company did at times take some effort on part of residents for example in ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain services of company they had informed farmers that their ships would not call again at ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided after seven years jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by government on natural reef similarly town of tathra was created through erection of a small jetty built so that local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25 km away at merimbula ships thumb ss kameruka a 515 ton steamer launched in 1880 she was wrecked off pedro reef in 1897 thumb ss bega launched in 1897 she capsized in 1907 one elderly passenger died in disaster piecing together illawarra steamship navigation company s fleet is difficult as unlike most steamship companies of day neither company s advertising nor their arrival and departure notices carried names of vessels instead they simply listed ships as i s n steamers if vessels were mentioned at all nevertheless it is known that when company was amalgamated they had at least three vessels to handle south coast trade kiama from kiama steamship company nora creina from shoalhaven steam navigation company and general steamship company s illawarra also mentions nowra which was a river steamer and william fourth however pemberton 1979 states that william fourth had been sold by manning in 1844 of these three kiama was a 104 ton paddle steamer that entered service with company in 1855 purpose built in glasgow in 1854 she took 144 days to arrive in australia and she served south coast until 1876 when she was sold and converted into a hulk prior to sale she had been lengthened from her original 123 feet to 154 feet and her tonnage increased to 111 tons nora creina on other hand was lighter at 93 tons and was locally built in sydney she was sold by company in 1861 third of original three vessels illawarra had been constructed at waterford in 1849 with a net weight of 166 tons but like nora creina she was only to remain with new company until 1861 when she was sold by 1864 company was operating a fleet of at least four ships kiama was still in service and she had been joined by hunter mynora and kembla both kembla a 204 ton iron steamship and hunter a paddle steamer with a net weight of 105 tons were built in glasgow scotland mynora was built in australia at in sydney a 117 ton wooden paddle steamer her time with company ended in 1864 after she ran into st georges head in wreck bay in an attempt to save lives of passengers and crew captain fought to keep ship afloat until she finally ran aground on a sandy beach approximately three miles from headland while boat was lost all of passengers and crew on mynora were saved next significant change to company s fleet came in 1878 with purchase of illawarra ii at 533 tons and 190 feet in length she handled both passengers and cargo for company and proved to be most popular until being laid up in 1908 and eventually scrapped illawarra ii was soon joined by allowrie a 504 ton vessel built in 1880 for carrying passengers and cargo including livestock and dairy produce allowrie remained in service with illawarra steam navigation company until 1909 when like illawarra ii she was laid up third major vessel during this period was kameruka a 515 ton steamer she was built in 1880 but was then lost when wrecked on pedro reef off moruya in october 1897 when company was reconstituted as illawarra and south coast steam navigation company in 1904 their vessels included allowrie and two new steamers eden and bega eden was a 693 ton screw steamer that had arrived in 1900 a purpose built vessel constructed for company in glasgow to handle sydney merimbula eden tathra route eden remained with company until being converted to a hulk and she was finally scuttled in 1933 bega at 567 tons transported both passengers and cargo between 1883 when she was launched and 1907 when she capsized with loss of one of passengers at least two more ships joined fleet in early 1900s peterborough which was acquired from steam navigation company and merimbula at time merimbula was company s finest vessel she was a 1122 ton screw steamer which provided accommodation for 106 passengers 96 saloon and 10 second class as well as possessing refrigerated cargo space and she was capable of between 13 and 14 knots unfortunately she ran aground off beecroft head in 1928 just prior to onset of first world war company purchased four new ships bermagui bodalla and bodalla was requisitioned for war effort and repurposed as a minesweeper she was lost in 1924 after war company purchased another three vessels nergalia and kianga nergalia and kianga were requisitioned during world war ii but while both survived hostilities kianga was not returned to company after being decommissioned footnotes references category transport companies established in 1853 category defunct shipping companies of
