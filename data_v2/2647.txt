man in moone is a book by english divine and church of england bishop francis godwin 1562 1633 describing a voyage of utopian discovery long considered to be one of his early works it is now generally thought to have been written in late 1620s it was first published posthumously in 1638 under pseudonym of domingo gonsales work is notable for its role in what was called new astronomy branch of astronomy influenced especially by nicolaus copernicus although copernicus is only astronomer mentioned by name book also draws on theories of johannes kepler and william gilbert godwin s astronomical theories were greatly influenced by galileo galilei s sidereus nuncius 1610 but unlike galileo godwin proposes that dark spots on moon are seas one of many parallels with kepler s somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia of 1634 gonsales is a spaniard forced to flee country after killing a man in a duel having made his fortune in east indies he decides to return to spain but falls ill on voyage home and is set off on island of st helena to recover there he discovers gansa a species of wild swan able to carry substantial loads and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around island once fully recovered gonsales resumes his journey home but his ship is attacked by an english fleet off coast of tenerife he uses his flying machine to escape to shore but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again this time his birds fly higher and higher towards moon which they reach after a journey of twelve days there gonsales encounters lunars a tall christian people inhabiting what appears to be a utopian paradise after six months of living among them gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for condition of his birds and sets off to return to earth he lands in china where he is immediately arrested as a magician but after learning language manages to win trust of local mandarin story ends with gonsales meeting a group of jesuit missionaries who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to spain some critics consider man in moone along with kepler s somnium to be one of first works of science fiction book was well known in 17th century and even inspired parodies by cyrano de bergerac and aphra behn but has been neglected in critical history recent studies have focused on godwin s theories of language mechanics of lunar travel and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in book background and contexts godwin son of thomas godwin bishop of bath and wells was elected a student of christ church oxford in 1578 from where he received his bachelor of arts 1581 and master of arts degrees 1584 after entering church he gained his bachelor 1594 and doctor of divinity 1596 degrees he gained prominence even internationally in 1601 by publishing his catalogue of bishops of england since first planting of christian religion in this island which enabled his rapid rise in church hierarchy during his life he was known as a historian scientific advances and lunar speculation thumb right 200px clockwise from top left copernicus gilbert kepler galileo godwin s book appeared in a time of great interest in moon and astronomical phenomena and of important developments in celestial observation mathematics and mechanics influence particularly of nicolaus copernicus led to what was called new astronomy copernicus is only astronomer godwin mentions by name but theories of johannes kepler and william gilbert are also discernible galileo galilei s 1610 publication sidereus nuncius usually translated as sidereal messenger had a great influence on godwin s astronomical theories although godwin proposes unlike galileo that dark spots on moon are seas one of many similarities between man in moone and kepler s somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia of 1634 dream or posthumous work on lunar astronomy speculation on lunar habitation was nothing new in western thought but it intensified in england during early 17th century philemon holland s 1603 translation of plutarch s moralia introduced greco roman speculation to english vernacular and poets including edmund spenser proposed that other worlds including moon could be inhabited such speculation was prompted also by expanding geographical view of world 1630s saw publication of a translation of lucian s true history 1634 containing two accounts of trips to moon and a new edition of ariosto s orlando furioso likewise featuring an ascent to moon in both books moon is inhabited and this theme was given an explicit religious importance by writers such as john donne who in ignatius his conclave 1611 with new editions in 1634 and 1635 satirised a lunatic church on moon founded by lucifer and jesuits lunar speculation reached an acme at end of decade with publication of godwin s man in moone 1638 and john wilkins s discovery of a world in moone also 1638 and revised in 1640 dating evidence thumb upright 1 1 right frontispiece and title page of second edition 1657 now with pseudonym replaced by f g b of h francis godwin bishop of hereford until grant mccolley a historian of early modern english literature published his date of godwin s domingo gonsales in 1937 it was thought that godwin wrote man in moone relatively early in his life perhaps during his time at christ church from 1578 to 1584 or maybe even as late as 1603 but mccolley proposed a much later date of 1627 or 1628 based on internal and biographical evidence a number of ideas about physical properties of earth and moon including claims about a secret property that operates in a manner similar to that of a attracting iron did not appear until after 1620 and godwin seems to borrow concept of using a flock of strong trained birds to fly gonsales to moon from francis bacon s sylva sylvarum natural history published in july 1626 all this evidence supports mccolley s dating of 1626 29 with probable years of composition 1627 28 which is now generally accepted william poole in his 2009 edition of man in moone provides additional evidence for a later dating godwin he argues most likely got his knowledge of jesuit mission in china founded in 1601 from a 1625 edition of samuel purchass purchas his pilgrimage this book contains a redaction from nicolas trigault s de christiana expeditione apud sinas ab jesu 1615 concerning christian expedition to china undertaken by society of jesus itself redaction of a manuscript by jesuit priest matteo ricci poole also sees influence of robert burton who in second volume of anatomy of melancholy had speculated on gaining astronomical knowledge through telescopic observation citing galileo or from space travel lucian appearing for first time in 1628 edition of anatomy is a section on planetary periods which gives a period for mars of three years had godwin used william gilbert s de magnete 1600 for this detail he would have found a martian period of two years finally poole points to what he calls a genetic debt while details on for instance martian period could have come from a few other sources burton and godwin are only two writers of time to combine an interest in alien life with green children of from a 12th century account of two mysterious green children found in suffolk one of godwin s major intellectual debts is to gilbert s de magnete in which gilbert argued that earth was magnetic though he may have used a derivative account by mark ridley or a geographical textbook by nathanael carpenter it is unlikely that godwin could have gathered first hand evidence used in narrating events in his book such as details of gonsales s journey back from east especially a description of saint helena and its importance as a resting place for sick mariners and more likely that he relied on travel adventures and other books he used trigault s de christiana expeditione apud sinas 1615 based on a manuscript by matteo ricci founder of jesuit mission in beijing in 1601 for information about that mission details pertaining to sea voyage and saint helena likely came from thomas cavendish s account of his first circumnavigation of world available in richard hakluyt s principal navigations 1599 1600 and in purchas his pilgrimage first published in 1613 information on dutch revolt historical setting for early part of gonsales career likely came from annals of emanuel van a dutch historian working in london english editions and translations thumb upright 1 1 right frontispiece of der fliegende wandersmann nach dem mond 1659 mccolley knew of only one surviving copy of first edition held at british museum now british library c 56 c 2 which was basis for his 1937 edition of man in moone and nuncius inanimatus an edition criticised by literary critic kathleen tillotson as lacking in textual care and consistency h w lawton s review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in bibliotheque nationale de france v

of man in moone is identified on title page as john norton and book was sold by joshua kirton and thomas warren it also includes an epistle introducing work and attributed to e m perhaps fictitious edward mahon identified in stationers register as translator from original spanish poole speculates that this edward mahon might be thomas or morgan godwin two of bishop s sons who had worked with their father on telegraphy but adds that godwin s third son paul might be involved as well partial revision of manuscript first half has dates according to gregorian calendar second half still follows superseded julian calendar indicates an unfinished manuscript which paul might have acquired after his father s death and passed on to his former colleague joshua kirton paul godwin and kirton were apprenticed to same printer john bill and worked there together for seven years paul may have simply continued e m hoax unknowingly and or may have been responsible for partial revision of manuscript to second edition published in 1657 was added godwin s nuncius inanimatus in english and latin first published in 1629 third edition was published in 1768 its text was abridged and a description of st helena by printer nathaniel crouch functioned as an introduction a french translation by jean baudoin l homme dans la lune was published in 1648 and republished four more times this french version excised narrative s sections on lunar christianity as so do many translations based on it including german translation incorrectly ascribed to hans jakob christoffel von der fliegende wandersmann nach

netherlands between 1645 and 1718 second edition of 1651 and subsequent editions include a continuation of unknown authorship relating gonsales further adventures plot summary story is written as a first person narrative from perspective of domingo gonsales book s fictional author in his opening address to reader equally fictional translator e m promises an essay of fancy where invention is shewed with judgment gonsales is a citizen of spain forced to flee to east indies after killing a man in a duel there he prospers by trading in jewels and having made his fortune decides to return to spain on his voyage home he becomes seriously ill and he and a negro servant diego are put ashore on st helena a remote island with a reputation for temperate and healthful air a scarcity of food forces gonsales and diego to live some miles apart but gonsales devises a variety of systems to allow them to communicate eventually he comes to rely on a species of bird he describes as some kind of wild swan a gansa to carry messages and provisions between himself and diego gonsales gradually comes to realise that these birds are able to carry substantial burdens and resolves to construct a device by which a number of them harnessed together might be able to support weight of a man allowing him to move around island more conveniently following a successful test flight he determines to resume his voyage home hoping that he might fill world with fame of his glory and renown but on his way back to spain accompanied by his birds and device he calls his engine his ship is attacked by an english fleet off coast of tenerife and he is forced to escape by taking to air after setting down briefly on tenerife gonsales is forced to take off again by imminent approach of hostile natives but rather than flying to a place of safety among spanish inhabitants of island gansas fly higher and higher on first day of his flight gonsales encounters illusions of devils and wicked spirits in shape of men and women some of whom he is able to converse with they provide him with food and drink for his journey and promise to set him down safely in spain if only he will join their fraternity and enter into such covenants as they had made to their captain and master whom they would not name gonsales declines their offer and after a journey of 12 days reaches moon suddenly feeling very hungry he opens provisions he was given en route only to find nothing but dry leaves goat s hair and animal dung and that his wine stunk like horse piss he is soon discovered by inhabitants of moon lunars whom he finds to be tall christian people enjoying a happy and carefree life in a kind of pastoral paradise gonsales discovers that order is maintained in this apparently utopian state by swapping delinquent children with terrestrial children lunars speak a language consisting not so much of words and letters as tunes and strange sounds which gonsales succeeds in gaining some fluency in after a couple of months six months or so after his arrival gonsales becomes concerned about condition of his gansas three of whom have died fearing that he may never be able to return to earth and see his children again if he delays further he decides to take leave of his hosts carrying with him a gift of precious stones from supreme monarch of moon irdonozur stones are of three different sorts which can store and generate great quantities of heat which generates great quantities of light and ebelus which when one side of stone is clasped to skin renders a man weightless or half as heavy again if other side is touched gonsales harnesses his gansas to his engine and leaves moon on 29 march 1601 he lands in china about nine days later without re encountering illusions of men and women he had seen on his outward journey and with help of his ebelus which helps birds to avoid plummeting to earth as weight of gonsales and his engine threatens to become too much for them he is quickly arrested and taken before local mandarin accused of being a magician and as a result is confined in mandarin s palace he learns to speak local dialect of chinese and after some months of confinement is summoned before mandarin to give an account of himself and his arrival in china which gains him mandarin s trust and favour gonsales hears of a group of jesuits and is granted permission to visit them he writes an account of his adventures which jesuits arrange to have sent back to spain story ends with gonsales s fervent wish that he may one day be allowed to return to spain and that by enriching my country with knowledge of these hidden mysteries i may at least reap glory of my fortunate misfortunes themes religion story is set during reign of queen elizabeth i a period of religious conflict in england not only was there threat of a catholic resurgence but there were also disputes within protestant church when gonsales first encounters lunars he exclaims jesu maria at which lunars fall to their knees but although they revere name of jesus they are unfamiliar with name maria suggesting that they are protestants rather than catholics poole is of same opinion their lack of reaction to name of mary suggests that they have not fallen into errors of catholic church despite some otherwise rather catholic looking institutions on moon beginning in 1580s when godwin was a student at oxford university many publications criticising governance of established church of england circulated widely until in 1586 censorship was introduced resulting in martin marprelate controversy martin marprelate was name used by anonymous author or authors of illegal tracts attacking church published between 1588 and 1589 a number of commentators including grant mccolley have suggested that godwin strongly objected to imposition of censorship expressed in gonsales s hope that publication of his account may not prove prejudicial to catholic faith john clark has suggested that martin marprelate controversy may have inspired godwin to give name martin to lunars god but as a bishop of church of england it is perhaps unlikely that he was generally sympathetic to martin marprelate position critics do not agree on precise denomination of godwin s lunars in contrast with clark and poole david cressy argues that lunars falling to their knees after gonsales s exclamation a similar ritual takes place at court of irdonozur is evidence of a fairly mechanical form of religion as most of godwin s protestant contemporaries judged roman catholicism by time man in moone was published discussion on plurality of worlds had begun to favour possibility of extraterrestrial life for christian thinkers such a plurality is intimately connected to christ and his redemption of man if there are other worlds do they share a similar history and does christ also redeem them in his sacrifice according to philipp melanchthon a 16th century theologian who worked closely with martin luther it must not be imagined that there are many worlds because it must not be imagined that christ died or was resurrected more often nor must it be thought that in any other world without knowledge of son of god that men would be restored to eternal life similar comments were made by calvinist theologian lambert midway through 17th century matter appears to have been settled in favour of a possible plurality which was accepted by henry more and aphra behn among others by 1650 elizabethan oxford examination question an sint mundi can these be many worlds to which correct aristotelian answer was no had been replaced by disputation thesis quod luna sit that moon could be habitable which might be answered probably if not yes lunar language thumb right 180px transcription of lunar language from 1659 german edition godwin had a lifelong interest in language and communication as is evident in gonsales s various means of communicating with his servant diego on st helena and this was topic of his nuncius inanimatus 1629 language gonsales encounters on moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with inhabitants while its vocabulary appears limited its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as thomas more s utopia francois rabelais s gargantua and pantagruel and joseph hall s mundus alter et idem all books that godwin was familiar with p cornelius in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from 17th and 18th centuries proposes that a perfect rationally organised language is indicative of enlightenment s rationalism as h neville davies argues godwin s imaginary language is more perfect than for instance more s in one aspect it is spoken on entire moon and has not suffered from earthly dispersion of languages caused by fall of tower of babel one of godwin s sources for his lunar language was trigault s de christiana expeditione apud sinas gonsales provides two examples of spoken phrases written down in a cipher later explained by john wilkins in mercury or secret and swift messenger 1641 trigault s account of chinese language gave godwin idea of assigning tonality to lunar language and of appreciating it in language spoken by chinese mandarins gonsales encounters after his return to earth gonsales claims that in contrast to multitude of languages in china making their speakers mutually unintelligible mandarins language is universal by virtue of tonality he suppresses it in other varieties of chinese thus mandarins are able to maintain a cultural and spiritual superiority resembling that of lunar upper class which is to be placed in contrast with variety of languages spoken in a fractured and morally degenerate europe and elsewhere argues that using term language is overstating case and that cipher is proper term in spite of godwin s claims this musical language is not in fact a language at all but simply a cipher in which letters of an existing language may be transcribed he suggests godwin s source may have been a book by joan baptista porta whose de literarum notis 1606 contains an exact description of method he was to adopt genre book s genre has been variously categorised when it was first published literary genre of utopian fantasy was in its infancy and critics have recognised how godwin used a utopian setting to criticise institutions of his time moon was ideal perspective from which to view earth and its moral attitudes and social institutions according to maurice bennett other critics have referred to book as utopia renaissance utopia or picaresque adventure while some critics claim it as one of first works of science fiction there is no general agreement that it is even proto science fiction early commentators recognised that book is a kind of picaresque novel and comparisons with don quixote were being made as early as 1638 in structure as well as content man in moone somewhat resembles anonymous spanish novella de tormes 1554 both books begin with a genealogy and start out in salamanca featuring a man who travels from master to master seeking his fortune but most critics agree that picaresque mode is not sustained throughout and that godwin intentionally achieves a generic transformation godwin s book follows a venerable tradition of travel literature that blends excitement of journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection more s utopia is cited as a forerunner as is account of amerigo vespucci godwin could fall back on an extensive body of work describing voyages undertaken by his protagonist including books by hakluyt and jan huyghen van linschoten and narratives deriving from jesuit mission in beijing reception and influence man in moone was published five months after discovery of a world in moone by john wilkins later bishop of chester wilkins refers to godwin once in a discussion of spots in moon but not to godwin s book in third edition of discovery 1640 however wilkins provides a summary of godwin s book and later in mercury 1641 he comments on man in moone and nuncius inanimatus saying that former text could be used to unlock secrets of latter man in moone quickly became an international source of humour and parody cyrano de bergerac using baudoin s 1648 translation parodied it in l autre monde ou les etats et empires de la lune 1657 cyrano s traveller actually meets gonsales who is still on moon degraded to status of pet monkey it was one of inspirations for what has been called first science fiction text in americas and lunar aligned to meridian of merida of yucatan by an or inhabitant of moon by manuel antonio de rivas 1775 language of jonathan swift who was a distant relation of godwin s may have been influenced by man in moone either directly or through cyrano de bergerac man in moone became a popular source for often extravagantly staged comic drama and opera including aphra behn s emperor of moon a 1687 play inspired by third edition of man in moone and english translation of cyrano s work and elkanah settles world in moon 1697 thomas d wonders in sun or kingdom of birds 1706 was really a sequel starring domingo and diego its popularity was not limited to english a dutch farce don domingo gonzales of de man in de maan formerly considered to have been written by maria de wilde was published in 1755 book s influence continued into 19th century edgar allan poe in an appendix to unparalleled adventure of one hans called it a singular and somewhat ingenious little book poe assumed author to be french an assumption also made by jules verne in his from earth to moon 1865 suggesting that they may have been using baudoin s translation h g wells s first men in moon 1901 has several parallels with godwin s fantasy including use of a stone to induce weightlessness but man in moone has nevertheless been given only lukewarm consideration in different histories of english literature and its importance is downplayed in studies of utopian literature frank e manuel and p manuel s utopian thought in western world winner of 1979 national book award for nonfiction mentions it only in passing saying that godwin treats primarily of mechanics of flight with aid of a crew of birds and that man in moone like bergerac s and wilkins s books lacks high seriousness and unified moral purpose gonsales s load carrying birds have also left their mark oxford english dictionarys entry for gansa reads one of birds called elsewhere wild swans which drew domingo gonsales to moon in romance by bp f godwin for etymology it suggests found in philemon holland s
