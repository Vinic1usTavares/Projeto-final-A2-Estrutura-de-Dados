alt a video a minute in length showing rain falling on leaves streets and into puddles thumb right upright 1 4 falling rain rain is liquid water in form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall under gravity rain is a major component of water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of fresh water on earth it provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts if enough moisture and upward motion is present precipitation falls from convective clouds those with strong upward vertical motion such as cumulonimbus thunder clouds which can organize into narrow rainbands in mountainous areas heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along sides of mountains on leeward side of mountains desert climates can exist due to dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of air mass movement of monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone brings rainy seasons to savannah climes urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall both in amounts and intensity downwind of cities global warming is also causing changes in precipitation pattern globally including wetter conditions across eastern north america and drier conditions in tropics antarctica is driest continent globally averaged annual precipitation over land is but over whole earth it is much higher at climate classification systems such as koppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes rainfall is measured using rain gauges rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar thumb right 300px heavy rain falling over desert at sunset rain is also known or suspected on other planets where it may be composed of methane neon sulfuric acid or even iron rather than water formation water saturated air thumb right rain falling on a field in southern estonia air contains water vapor and amount of water in a given mass of dry air known as mixing ratio is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air g kg amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity which is percentage of total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature how much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated 100 relative humidity and forms into a cloud a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above earth s surface depends on its temperature warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated therefore one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it dew point is temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated there are four main mechanisms for cooling air to its dew point adiabatic cooling conductive cooling radiational cooling and evaporative cooling adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands air can rise due to convection large scale atmospheric motions or a physical barrier such as a mountain orographic lift conductive cooling occurs when air comes into contact with a colder surface usually by being blown from one surface to another for example from a liquid water surface to colder land radiational cooling occurs due to emission of infrared radiation either by air or by surface underneath evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to air through evaporation which forces air temperature to cool to its wet bulb temperature or until it reaches saturation main ways water vapor is added to air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion precipitation or virga falling from above daytime heating evaporating water from surface of oceans water bodies or wet land transpiration from plants cool or dry air moving over warmer water and lifting air over mountains water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds elevated portions of weather fronts which are three dimensional in nature force broad areas of upward motion within earth s atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass it can also form due to lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions coalescence and fragmentation alt diagram showing that very small rain drops are almost spherical in shape as drops become larger they become flattened on bottom like a hamburger bun very large rain drops are split into smaller ones by air resistance which makes them increasingly unstable thumb shape of rain drops depending upon their size coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets air resistance typically causes water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary when air turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets thumb black rain clouds as these larger water droplets descend coalescence continues so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing and is also known as warm rain process in clouds below freezing when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall this generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between crystal and neighboring water droplets this process is temperature dependent as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing in addition because of great temperature difference between cloud and ground level these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain raindrops have sizes ranging from mean diameter but develop a tendency to break up at larger sizes smaller drops are called cloud droplets and their shape is spherical as a raindrop increases in size its shape becomes more oblate with its largest cross section facing oncoming airflow large rain drops become increasingly flattened on bottom like hamburger buns very large ones are shaped like parachutes contrary to popular belief their shape does not resemble a teardrop biggest raindrops on earth were recorded over brazil and marshall islands in 2004 some of them were as large as large size is explained by condensation on large smoke particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops alt raindrop thumb right 300px a raindrop on a leaf intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related i e high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration droplet size distribution final droplet size distribution is an exponential distribution number of droplets with diameter between and per unit volume of space is this is commonly referred to as marshall palmer law after researchers who first characterized it parameters are somewhat temperature dependent and slope also scales with rate of rainfall d in centimeters and r in millimetres per hour deviations can occur for small droplets and during different rainfall conditions distribution tends to fit averaged rainfall while instantaneous size spectra often deviate and have been modeled as gamma distributions distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation raindrop impacts raindrops impact at their terminal velocity which is greater for larger drops due to their larger mass to drag ratio at sea level and without wind drizzle impacts at or while large drops impact at around or rain falling on loosely packed material such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples that can be fossilized called raindrop impressions air density dependence of maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints has been used to constrain density of air 2 7 billion years ago sound of raindrops hitting water is caused by bubbles of air oscillating underwater metar code for rain is ra while coding for rain showers is virga in certain conditions precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporate or sublime before reaching ground this is termed virga and is more often seen in hot and dry climates causes frontal activity stratiform a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity and dynamic precipitation convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems on order of cm s such as in vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside eyewall and in comma head precipitation patterns around mid latitude cyclones a wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front with thunderstorms possible but usually their passage is associated with a drying of air mass occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas what separates rainfall from other precipitation types such as ice pellets and snow is presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above melting point of water which melts frozen precipitation well before it reaches ground if there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing freezing rain rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments will result hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when freezing level within atmosphere exceeds above ground level convection alt diagram showing that as moist air becomes heated more than its surroundings it moves upward resulting in brief rain showers thumb right convective precipitation alt diagram showing how moist air over ocean rises and flows over land causing cooling and rain as it hits mountain ridges thumb right orographic precipitation convective rain or showery precipitation occurs from convective clouds e g cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent most precipitation in tropics appears to be convective however it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs graupel and hail indicate convection in mid latitudes convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts squall lines and warm fronts orographic effects orographic precipitation occurs on windward side of mountains and is caused by rising air motion of a large scale flow of moist air across mountain ridge resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation in mountainous parts of world subjected to relatively consistent winds for example trade winds a more moist climate usually prevails on windward side of a mountain than on leeward or downwind side moisture is removed by orographic lift leaving
