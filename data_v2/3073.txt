orcinus citoniensis is an extinct species of killer whale that lived from 3 6 to 2 5 million years ago mya in pliocene of italy and england it was smaller than modern killer whale o orca versus and had around 8 more teeth in its jaw it may have resembled modern killer whale in appearance and could represent a transitional species between modern killer whale and other dolphins o citoniensis may have hunted large fish and squid in pods and coexisted with other large predators of time such as orcinine hemisyntrachelus and extinct shark megalodon as pliocene of italy and england displayed diverse marine mammal and shark assemblages taxonomy holotype specimen mb 11 17 18 an incomplete skeleton was first described by paleontologist giovanni capellini as orca citoniensis in 1883 which came from late pliocene sediments of farm outside town of in tuscany italy to which species name citoniensis refers to capellini also referred to whale as o a specimen consisting of a tooth and a right inner ear periotic bone from red crag formation of crag group dating to early pleistocene in england was referred by english geologist richard lydekker in 1887 noting it was similar to but considerably smaller than that of modern killer whale o orca in 1904 french zoologist edouard louis trouessart replaced orca with orcinus and described whale as orcinus citoniensis in 1937 japanese paleontologist matsumoto referred to lydekker s finds as orca in 1988 italian paleontologist georg assigned isolated middle miocene teeth specimen from savoy france to species but this was later revised in 1996 by italian paleontologist giovanni bianucci on basis back of tooth root was too large and specimen actually dates to pliocene bianucci also identified a beak fragment showing tooth sockets specimen mb nc also from late pliocene of tuscany which may belong to species o citoniensis may represent a transitional species between early dolphins and modern killer whale however matsumoto while describing japanese o paleorca in 1937 noted that teeth of o paleorca are much larger and have more similar dimensions to modern killer whale than those of o citoniensis are description thumb a restoration of orcinus citoniensis holotype comprises right ramus of jawbone teeth in right jaw detached teeth a spinal cord lacking first three neck vertebrae and last tail vertebrae some ribs right shoulder blade and humerus and metacarpal fragments from fin skull measures around in comparison to skull of modern killer whale like modern killer whale snout is broad and relatively short and eye socket is relatively small it had 28 conical teeth in either jaw unlike modern killer whale which has on average 24 holotype could have been long in comparison to modern killer whale vertebrae are large with 11 thoracic vertebrae and 51 vertebrae in total comparable to numbers in modern killer whale acromion on shoulder blade which forms part of shoulder joint is short and broad as it is in primitive bottlenose dolphin tursiops it may have had appearance of a small killer whale paleobiology thumb modern killer whale orcinus orca like modern killer whale o citoniensis could have hunted in cooperative pods in regards to diet it may have been more similar to modern false killer whale crassidens and pygmy killer whale attenuata in that it was a generalist feeder of squid and large fish and vertebrates orcinus lineage may have fished up food chain with primitive o citoniensis able to target large fish and modern killer whale able to target large whales it may have been one of most predatory animals of its region alongside orcinine hemisyntrachelus and extinct shark megalodon paleoecology pliocene of tuscany is representative of a nutrient rich upwelling in coastal waters and upper midnight zone along a continental slope pliocene of italy featured a wide array of marine mammals for example dolphins such as small sperm whale kogia pusilla beaked whales such as baleen whales such as dugong and monk seal it also featured several sharks area has one of most diverse pliocene decapod crustacean assemblages which indicates a sandy muddy and at places hard rock seafloor with calm well oxygenated nearshore water settings which are conducive to decapod life seagrasses may have been common similar to modern day mediterranean neptune grass posidonia red crag formation is representative of a temperate shallow nearshore environment perhaps at mouth of a large river indicated by conifer pollen and small terrestrial vertebrate remains lydekker along with o citoniensis identified several other whales from formation for example dubious baleen whale balaenoptera sperm whale shark toothed dolphin as well as some species that exist in modern day such as northern bottlenose whale strap toothed whale and long finned pilot whale melas shark teeth and skate coprolite were also found here see also orcinus paleorca orcinus livyatan
