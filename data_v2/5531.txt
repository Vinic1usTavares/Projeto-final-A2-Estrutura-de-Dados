s rewrite and a revision by richard price during project s incarnation with director antoine fuqua scott preferred zaillian s approach and chose to follow it director encountered a challenge in script since characters frank lucas and richie roberts do not encounter each other until twenty minutes before end of film director sought to flesh out private universes of these characters which would

ethical business practices of wicked gangster and womanizing and failed marriage of do gooder police detective washington who was not normally a fan of gangster films chose to portray lucas when he saw arc of character which ended by showing prices that lucas paid for his actions to prepare for their roles actors met actual persons in addition washington took on lucas southern accent and crowe practiced to match roberts s manner of speaking and body language requesting tape recordings of roberts to assist in his preparation following march studio rehired zaillian to rewrite script for american gangster budget had escalated to 100 million which grazer stated was unexpected given it s not a high concept comedy it s not a fantasy movie it s not a four quadrant movie grazer and scott

lustig consulted with country s tourism minister filming for american gangster concluded in chiang mai following month using his experience from visiting new york in same time period in which film s story took place scott sought to downplay a beatles atmosphere to film and to instead create a atmosphere saying that harlem was really really shabby beautiful falling apart production and costume design was emphasized transforming location into rundown streets of upper manhattan from late 1960s and early 1970s denzel washington as frank lucas went through 64 different costume changes music in 2006 greg calloway was approached by producers to produce a soundtrack for film he presented idea to atlantic records chairman craig kallman and one of company s artists t i got an acting role in film however deal did not go further because universal pictures owned rights to film it was a universal film and they were not going to give soundtrack to wmg atlantic s parent company thus scott brought back marc streitenfeld who had worked with him in a good year composer stated that overall tone needed to be something bigger and darker given characters strong personalities and while not being original intention he added shades of blues and soul music to fit 1970s setting musical score for american gangster was recorded between april and may 2007 by streitenfeld with help of orchestrator bruce fowler and conductor mike nowak using an 80 piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre records performed by streitenfeld himself additional score material was composed and

i wanted to introduce a visual and sonic world that is a contained entity of 70s and scott felt it was vital to have brand of music that was harlem at time denzel washington pressed grazer into inviting rapper jay z to write film s score but producer just didn t think there d be enough for jay z to do given intentions to do a soundtrack filled with 1970s music film s trailer had already used jay z s heart of city ain t no love and rapper was invited to an advanced screening film had a profound resonance on musician who decided to create a concept album also entitled american gangster rapper recorded tracks that were prompted by specific scenes in film it was speculated that album s release in conjunction with film would attract a young audience and help universal pictures generate

gave film four out of four stars ign s jim stax vejvoda rated film four out of five stars praising acting particularly of two protagonists both dynamic presences on screen with neither actor outweighing other s importance to story and declaring that despite being preceded by other gangster stories such as scarface and sopranos american gangster managed to justify its existence with emphasis on human and class elements of story manohla dargis of new york times strongly commended film opining that greatness hovers just outside american gangster she continued it s a seductive package crammed with all on screen and off screen talent that big studio money can buy and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke city back in day when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red these sentiments were echoed by sukhdev sandhu of telegraph who asserted that storyline was amazing in comparison some reviewers were more critical of american gangster jonathan crocker of time out london was polarized with film criticizing its aesthetics in his review he wrote scott s meticulous aesthetics can t touch urban texture and deep focus of french connection godfather serpico and prince of city all looming heavily in intertextual nods in contrast crocker praised washington s acting writing he s immense centering every scene with tractor beam charisma that dangerous easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence in conclusion crocker gave film three out of five stars similarly owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly gave film a c grade expressing that american gangster is never dull but it could have used more good old fashioned melodramatic intrigue gleiberman found washington s performance to have a ghastly ingenuity empires ian freer rated film three stars out of five he stated that it was undeniably enjoyable and praised cast but also noted that he felt that very little in movie feels fresh re treading scenes riffs and imagery from whole history of crime flicks and that film did not explore enough of lucas story and scott s visual imagination slant magazine journalist nick schager harshly criticized film giving film a one out of four stars schager remarked that film was dumb as a rock and that it was far too convinced of its import to be any fun giving american gangster a two out of five stars peter bradshaw of guardian was disappointed with washington s acting asserting he doesn t seem to relax and enjoy himself in role or even inhabit it very satisfyingly he resumed he never has menace of his dirty cop in training day and we don t see anything like transformation from street hustler to leader in malcolm x that shoulder shimmying swagger is rarely seen and brand classic robes of american gangster sit on him heavily accuracy of film in an interview with msnbc lucas expressed his excitement about film and amazement at denzel washington s portrayal however lucas admitted to several news outlets that only a small portion of film was true and that much of it was fabricated for dramatic effect in addition richie roberts criticized film for portraying him in a custody battle while in real life he never had a child roberts criticized portrayal of lucas describing it as almost noble sterling johnson jr a federal judge who served as a special narcotics prosecutor for united states district court for eastern district of new york and assisted arrest and trial of lucas described film as one percent reality and ninety nine percent hollywood in addition johnson described real life lucas as illiterate vicious violent and everything denzel washington was not former dea agents jack toal gregory and louis diaz filed a lawsuit against universal saying that events in film were fictionalized and that film defamed them and hundreds of other agents lawsuit was eventually dismissed by us district judge colleen mcmahon while mcmahon noted that that appears at end of film stating that lucas collaboration led to arrest of many corrupt dea agents was wholly inaccurate in that lucas cooperation did not lead to convictions and admonished that it would a major corporation like universal which is owned by a major news organization nbc not to put inaccurate statements at end of popular films she stated that film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to show a single person who is identifiable as a dea agent many of lucas other claims as presented in film have also been called into question such as being right hand man of bumpy johnson rising above power of mafia and nicky barnes and that he was mastermind behind golden triangle heroin connection of 1970s ron chepesiuk a biographer of frank lucas deemed story as a myth associated press entertainment writer frank coyle
