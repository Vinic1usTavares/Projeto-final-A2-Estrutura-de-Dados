kitti s hog nosed bat craseonycteris thonglongyai also known as bumblebee bat is a near threatened species of bat and only extant member of family craseonycteridae it occurs in western thailand and southeast myanmar where it occupies limestone caves along rivers kitti s hog nosed bat is smallest species of bat and arguably world s smallest mammal it has a reddish brown or grey coat with a distinctive pig like snout colonies range greatly in size with an average of 100 individuals per cave bat feeds during short activity periods in evening and dawn foraging around nearby forest areas for insects females give birth annually to a single offspring although bat s status in myanmar is not well known thai population is restricted to a single province and may be at risk for extinction its potential threats are primarily anthropogenic and include habitat degradation and disturbance of roosting sites description thumb 240px left stuffed specimen at national museum of nature and

title are small shrews in particular etruscan shrew may be lighter at but is longer measuring from its head to base of tail bat has a distinctive swollen pig like snout with thin vertical nostrils its ears are relatively large while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur goswami a 1999 craseonycteris thonglongyai animal diversity web retrieved on 11 april 2008 its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat dental formula is 1 1 1 3 in upper jaw and 2 1 2 3 in lower jaw with large upper incisors bat s upperparts are reddish brown or grey while underside is generally paler wings are relatively large and darker in colour with long tips that allow bat to hover despite having two caudal vertebrae kitti s hog nosed bat has no visible tail there is a large web of skin between hind legs uropatagium which may assist in flying and catching insects although there are no tail bones or to help control it in flight range and distribution kitti s hog nosed bat occupies limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or deciduous forests in thailand kitti s hog nosed bat is restricted to a small region of tenasserim hills in sai yok district province within drainage basin of noi river while sai yok national park in dawna hills contains much of bat s range some thai populations occur outside park and are therefore unprotected since 2001 discovery of a single individual in myanmar at least nine separate sites have been identified in limestone outcrops of dawna and karen hills outside and rivers of and mon states thai and myanmar populations are morphologically identical but their echolocation calls are distinct it is not known whether two populations are reproductively isolated behaviour kitti s hog nosed bat roosts in caves in limestone hills far from entrance while many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals average group size is 100 with a maximum of about 500 individuals roost high on walls or roof domes far apart from each other bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves kitti s hog nosed bat has a brief activity period leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in evening and 20 minutes at dawn these short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures hutson a m mickleburgh s p and racey p a compilers 2001 microchiropteran bats global status survey and conservation action plan iucn ssc chiroptera specialist group iucn gland switzerland during this period bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees within one kilometre of roosting site wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight and gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage nevertheless most prey is probably caught in flight main staples of bat s diet include small flies chloropidae agromyzidae and anthomyiidae hymenopterans and late in dry season around april of each year females give birth to a single offspring during feeding periods young either stays in roost or remains attached to mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples taxonomy kitti s hog nosed bat is only extant species in family craseonycteridae which is grouped in superfamily as a result of molecular testing based on this determination bat s closest relatives are members of families hipposideridae and kitti s hog nosed bat was unknown to world at large prior to 1974 its common name refers to its discoverer thai zoologist kitti thonglongya thonglongya worked with a british partner john e hill in classifying bats of thailand after thonglongya died suddenly in february 1974 hill formally described species giving it binomial name craseonycteris thonglongyai in honour of his colleague conservation as of species most recent review in 2019 kitti s hog nosed bat is listed by iucn as near threatened with a downward population trend soon after bat s discovery in 1970s some roosting sites became disturbed as a result of tourism scientific collection and even collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs however these pressures may not have had a significant effect on species as a whole since many small colonies exist in hard to access locations and only a few major caves were disturbed another potential risk is activity of local monks who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation currently most significant and long term threat to thai population could be annual burning of forest areas which is most prevalent during bat s breeding season in addition proposed construction of a pipeline from myanmar to thailand may have a negative impact threats
