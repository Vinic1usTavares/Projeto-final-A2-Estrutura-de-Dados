iridomyrmex or rainbow ant referring to its blue green iridescent sheen is a genus of ant first described by austrian entomologist gustav mayr in 1862 he placed it in subfamily dolichoderinae of family formicidae there are 79 described species and five fossil species most of these ants are native to australia others are found in several countries and islands in asia and other areas in oceania and they have been introduced to brazil new zealand and united arab emirates fossil species are known from china france and united states these ants are known to be an ecologically dominant and important group of ants but they are sometimes regarded as pests because they disturb soil and enter human houses farmers in rural australia place animal carcasses on meat ant i purpureus mounds as a method of disposing of them meat ants will consume carcass and reduce it to bones in a matter of weeks meat ants also engage in ritualised fighting which helps prevent casualties and solve territorial disputes between neighbouring colonies largest members of this genus are those of i purpureus species group measuring after their nuptial flight queen ants may establish a colony by themselves by budding or cooperatively where a subset of colony migrates to a new location or when multiple queens help find a suitable nesting spot but they will display intolerance to each other when workers are present eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop into adults genus lives in a wide variety of habitats and nests in soil in numbers that range from a couple of hundred individuals to over 300 000 in a single colony depending on species nests are large mounds covered in pebbles with multiple entrances while others live above ground in twig nests in some cases ants dwell in several nest sites connected by paths some of these nests can extend to in length some species associate with caterpillars and butterflies that provide ants with secretions and honeydew and i bicknelli pollinates orchids these ants are predators and scavengers they hunt for prey to feed their young notably these ants are immune to toxins of cane toad and feed on juveniles predators such as spiders birds lizards and other ants prey on iridomyrmex ants phylogeny separation of genus iridomyrmex from its most recent common ancestor began around 12 million years ago its sister group has only two species even though both genera are same age in comparison to other indo australian genera in subfamily dolichoderinae clade of which it is a part is 23 million years old meaning that it is rather young however fossil species that have been found are from eocene and oligocene following cladogram shows phylogenetic position of iridomyrmex among indo australian genera taxonomy genus iridomyrmex was first described by austrian entomologist gustav mayr in 1862 but it had no designated type species until 1903 by then type species was designated as formica detecta a synonym of iridomyrmex purpureus genus was placed in subfamily dolichoderinae in 1878 same year subfamily was established since establishment of genus it suffered taxonomic misunderstanding due to gradual development of unrelated ants being designated into genus by early researchers who failed to identify easily recognisable features that would make them distinct from genus iridomyrmex myrmecologist william brown jr was perhaps first person to question monophyly of genus mentioning that argentine ant a former member of iridomyrmex differed from rest of genus first proper revisions of genus began in 1990s and 91 species were transferred to six genera only 62 species remained after these revisions these species were placed into genera linepithema ochetellus and in 2011 genus was revised again and 79 species and five extinct species were now present 31 of which were newly described four species were placed in different genera while 25 species and subspecies were classified as synonyms according to one source 350 australian iridomyrmex species may be present scientific name of genus iridomyrmex meaning rainbow ant refers to their blue green iridescent sheen word meaning rainbow derives from ancient greek and another greek word means ant species extinct species are marked with iridomyrmex heterick shattuck 2011 iridomyrmex agilis forel 1907 iridomyrmex alpinus heterick shattuck 2011 iridomyrmex

it is located above them eyes are located on top of ants head and they are noticeably distant from mandibles these ants range from small to medium members of i conifer species group measure being reddish brown in colour with a distinctive propodeum while members of i purpureus species group are largest at worker castes are rarely polymorphic based on observations iridomyrmex workers can be deformed when they are born for example a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused together and petiole was still present but enlarged despite deformity worker was still able to forage with little trouble distribution and habitat thumb left occurrences of iridomyrmex species reported in australia as of may 2015 ants of this genus are found in many countries and islands spanning several continents in oceanian region these ants are found in fiji indonesia new caledonia papua new guinea and solomon islands in australia they are found in every state and territory in new zealand this genus has been introduced to country establishing themselves in both north island and south island in asia they are found in burma east timor india malaysia and philippines i anceps is only known ant of this genus present in middle east having been introduced to united arab emirates i rufoniger was introduced to brazil through human activity populations are present on islands of norfolk island and phillip island in oceania extinct species were native to countries beyond modern distribution of genus fossils have been found in china france and united states thumbnail meat ant mound near new south wales genus iridomyrmex inhabits rural arid and semi arid areas nests are found in acacia banksia casuarina and eucalyptus woodland in pastures callitris forests city parks farmlands grasslands heath sand dunes savanna woodland swamps urban gardens wet rain forests wet and dry sclerophyll woodland and even in buildings such as hotels and houses most of these ants nest in soil but some prefer to live under rocks rotten wood and in some cases in sandy beaches and footpaths certain species will avoid nesting in sandy soil nests will vary in appearance most species live in small mounds with a single entrance while other species create large mounds covered in pebbles with multiple entrances some colonies are known to create super nests workers construct many nests connected through established paths extending up to in length in one extreme case a single colony was found to occupy over 10 hectares of land with 85 individual nests and 1 500 entrance holes while meat ants are never aggressive to their nest mates they will be aggressive to those who live in different nests within same colony nests may be above or below ground with some species such as i conifer alternating between two during winter nests will be constructed above in twigs with ants moving back underground during warmer months underground nests are located near areas where food sources are present colonies will relocate their nests to areas where there are reasonable levels of sunlight during winter behaviour and ecology thumbnail while most iridomyrmex species are notable for their aggression some are quite timid this worker is moving pupae to a safer location instead of attacking intruders after nest was exposed most iridomyrmex species are aggressive ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on this is noticeable with particular member species of i purpureus species group where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite and spray a defensive chemical found in genus because of their large numbers aggression and iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in australia and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them these ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers while iridomyrmex ants are known for their aggression some are more timid and shy workers will run and hide if they are disturbed and avoid contact with other ant species when nests are disturbed workers will not attack instead they will relocate their brood and disregard other disturbances should they occur workers will hide in leaves and other vegetation and in some cases i victorianus workers may remain still until any threat or danger subsides meat ants engage in ritualised fights to maintain and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies when individuals from separate colonies meet they will engage each other until appeasement occurs a meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of mandibles and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger suggesting that meat ants do this in a display of size matching once ants have finished fighting they will groom themselves and search for another ant such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in same area and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare foraging all species are predators and scavengers iridomyrmex ants tend to many hemiptera insects and butterfly larvae to receive honeydew workers forage and scavenge for small insects and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey iridomyrmex ants normally forage on ground but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation to look for food most ants are diurnal foragers but some are nocturnal these nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during day but this depends on suitability of weather they will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime however i bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during day in a few species a nest will not be placed in a shaded area this is so it can warm up during early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise diet thumbnail iridomyrmex with a captured termite iridomyrmex primarily feeds on sweet foods such as nectar and honeydew they hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes they collect these seeds remove elaiosomes and then discard seeds seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to aggressive iridomyrmex ants giving them a better chance of survival colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds and so termites are regularly preyed on by iridomyrmex no evidence for any kind of relationship other than a predatory one is known juvenile cane toads are often preyed on as certain iridomyrmex species such as i purpureus and i are immune to toxins released by cane toads as a result placing iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling cane toad population meat ant is only known ant in australia that feeds on guano predators some invertebrate species specialise in predation of iridomyrmex ants one spider in particular cursorial spider bradleyi is a specialist predator against these ants and will use alarm pheromones that are released by ants during territorial disputes to locate them australian thorny devil lizard moloch horridus is a sit and wait predator that primarily preys on iridomyrmex ants and one lizard will reject specific species in this genus while eating others blind snake nigrescens follows trails laid by these ants to locate them as a potential prey species and will eat broods of some species while ground beetles dig burrows near ant nests to prey on workers passing by a prominent predator is short beaked echidna tachyglossus aculeatus that eats virgin queens during nuptial flight due to their high percentage of fat echidnas do not consume iridomyrmex ants all year instead they usually attack nests during august to october which is when winged females and males known as alates emerge from their nest queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after birds such as currawongs magpies and ravens attracted by recently excavated soil will dig out nests shortly after queens have founded their colonies parasitic flatworms in class are known to infect iridomyrmex life cycle and reproduction thumb left meat eater ant nest during swarming nuptial flight occurs throughout year in humid and warm climates alates begin to emerge from their nest and immediately climb onto tall structures such as tree trunks fence posts or long flora where they begin to fly and copulate depending on species a queen either mates with a single male or with multiple males observations show that meat ant males begin to fly first followed by queens groups of 20 to 40 queens will approach top of nest and fly once they are warm enough and this would proceed multiple times for many days until climate changes or all of queens have withdrawn from nest after mating males soon die and queens proceed to search for a suitable nest to establish her colony finding a location to nest is dangerous as birds and other ants prey on them disease and starvation are other causes of death in queens while most queens will establish a nest by herself nests can be established when queens cooperate with each other are adopted into an existing colony or by budding also called satelliting or fractionating where a subset of colony including queens workers and brood eggs larvae and pupae leave main colony for an alternative nest site 10 of queens will cooperate with another queen during colony foundation thumb fertilised meat eater ant queen beginning to dig a new colony once a queen has excavated a chamber she will lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae in less than a month these eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults mature nests range in size from a few hundred to over 300 000 workers most colonies are meaning it only has a single queen but some colonies can have as many as four colonies also exist in which multiple queens are present but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens queens display intolerance to each other when first generation of workers is present and queens will separate from each other once colony grows to a certain size symbiosis thumbnail i rufoniger worker tending to a scale insect iridomyrmex ants share symbiotic relationships with many caterpillars aphids and workers protect these caterpillars and will sometimes take them to their feeding chambers inside nest in genus jalmenus workers attend to butterflies jalmenus clementi turquoise hairstreak jalmenus emerald hairstreak jalmenus northern hairstreak jalmenus imperial hairstreak jalmenus amethyst hairstreak jalmenus varied hairstreak and jalmenus waterhouse s hairstreak in genus ogyris attendants include ogyris amaryllis satin azure ogyris olane olane azure and ogyris silky azure additional species workers attend

fringed heath blue and saltbush blue i bicknelli is an effective pollinator of microtis parviflora and one study suggests pollen is not harmed by contact of these ants meat ants have been observed blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil to prevent them from leaving their nest during early hours of day ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris a behaviour known as nest plugging if meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade banded sugar ants may invade and take over nest since health of colony may deteriorate from overshadowing members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material interaction with humans in rural australia meat ants are important to farmers as they place animal carcasses on their nests in a matter of weeks entire carcass will be consumed and reduced to bones however iridomyrmex ants are sometimes considered pests due to these ants entering human houses to feed on food and soil disturbance eradication of nests can be difficult as nests can be repopulated from a rival colony or adjoining nests which were not affected particular species have adapted rather well to urbanisation during early days in canberra newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants and populations flourished other factors include plantations enriched with valuable food sources and home gardens workers also cause problems for those who are citrus producers they will affect biological control of hemiptera insects specifically those who produce honeydew see also list of ants of australia references cited texts
