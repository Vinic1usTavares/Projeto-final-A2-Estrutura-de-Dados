studios invasion of vorticons was only game developed by ideas from deep and was based on programmer john carmack s creation of adaptive tile refresh a technique that allowed ibm compatible general purpose computers to replicate smooth scrolling of video game consoles such as nintendo entertainment system game s success caused designer tom hall programmers john carmack and john romero and artist adrian carmack to found id software their obligations to softdisk where they had worked during development of game led to creation of keen dreams as a prototype for second trilogy of episodes final episode was split off during development into a stand alone retail title and plans for a third trilogy were cancelled after success of wolfenstein 3d 1992 and development focus on 3d first person shooters such as doom 1993 final keen game ten years later had oversight but little development work from id critical reception and series legacy has focused on two main trilogies of episodes with vorticons having large success as a shareware game and impacting success of apogee now 3d realms and its shareware model second trilogy sold fewer copies which was blamed by id and apogee on its split into two parts and 2001 game received mixed reviews ms dos games have been re released in several compilation packages and all but sixth episode are still sold through modern emulation releases on

team after success of first game and published through softdisk as part of an agreement between companies as founders of id had been employees of softdisk when they developed vorticons id used game which stands outside of general continuity of series as a dream episode as a prototype to test ideas they wanted to use in future games such as a more advanced art style parallax scrolling and gameplay changes in 2013 a port was developed by super fighter team for android devices and a 2014 indiegogo crowdfunding campaign led to original source code being released and a release by hard disk

composed of platforms on which keen can stand and some platforms allow keen to jump up through them from below beginning with episode two earth explodes there are also moving platforms as well as switches which extend bridges over gaps in floor keen dreams and later games add fireman s poles that keen can climb up or down and with exception of 2001 commander keen also show platforms viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo 3d effect throughout series once entered only way to exit a level is to reach end though for keen dreams and episodes four through six player can save and return to middle of a level rather than only between levels like other games in between levels player travels on a two dimensional map viewed from above from map player can enter levels by approaching entrance some levels are optional and can be bypassed while others are secret and can only be reached by following specific procedures episodes all contain a different set of enemies in their levels which player must kill stun or avoid these enemies are typically aliens or robots levels can also include hazards such as electricity or spikes touching a hazard or most enemies causes keen to lose a life and game is ended if all of keen s lives are lost invasion of vorticons features a raygun that keen can use ammo for to kill enemies keen dreams exchanges this for flower power pellets that temporarily stun enemies when thrown episodes four through six use a stun gun that permanently stuns enemies and 2001 commander keen has a stun gun that temporarily stuns enemies unless they are then

wakes up in his pajamas in bed on top of a hill after being told by potato soldiers that he is now slave of king and being asked by another child to save them he journeys through vegetable themed land to defeat king waking up in his bed at home afterwards main series of games continues in secret of oracle where keen builds a faster than light radio and overhears plans by a race of aliens known as shikadi to destroy galaxy he flies off to oracle on planet of gnosticus iv only to discover that gnosticenes that run oracle have been kidnapped by shikadi keen fights through outposts and temples of shadowlands rescuing gnosticenes and oracle then tells keen that shikadi are shadow beings from far side of galaxy who are building an armageddon machine at korath iii to blow up galaxy and rebuild it as they wish afterwards in armageddon machine keen infiltrates titular space station to disable it destroying subsystems of machine located in each level when he finishes he finds that gannalech that was leading shikadi was grand intellect mcmire who had escaped keen in vorticons by leaving behind an android in his place a note left behind for keen tells him that mcmire plans to instead destroy universe aliens ate my babysitter is set around same time though it is unclear whether it is actually after events of goodbye galaxy in it alien bloogs of xax kidnap keen s babysitter and plan to eat

mcmire to destroy universe keen fights his way through three races planets to find plasma crystals powering station only for mcmire to escape after taunting keen a final time development invasion of vorticons in september 1990 john carmack a game programmer for gamer s edge video game subscription service and disk magazine at softdisk in shreveport louisiana developed a way to create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game at time ibm compatible general purpose computers were not able to replicate common feat of video game consoles such as nintendo entertainment system which were capable of redrawing entire screen fast enough for a side scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware carmack created adaptive tile refresh a way to slide majority of visible screen to side both horizontally and vertically when player moved as if it had not changed and only redraw newly visible portions of screen other games had previously redrawn whole screen in chunks or like carmack s earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction he discussed idea with coworker tom hall who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating first level of recent super mario bros 3 on a computer pair did so in a single overnight session with hall recreating graphics of game replacing player character of mario with dangerous dave a character from an eponymous previous gamer s edge game while carmack optimized code next morning on september 20 resulting game dangerous dave in copyright infringement was shown to their other coworker john romero romero recognized carmack s idea as a major accomplishment nintendo was one of most successful companies in japan largely due to success of their mario franchise and ability to replicate gameplay of series on a computer could have large implications romero felt that potential of carmack s idea should not be wasted on softdisk while other members of gamer s edge team more or less agreed he especially felt that their talents in general were wasted on company which needed money their games brought in but in his opinion neither understood nor appreciated video game design as distinct from general software programming manager of team and fellow programmer jay wilbur recommended that they take demo to nintendo itself to position themselves as capable of building a pc version of super mario bros for company group composed of carmack romero hall and wilbur along with lane roathe editor for gamer s edge decided to build a full demo game for their idea to send to nintendo as they lacked computers to build project at home and could not work on it at softdisk they borrowed their work computers over weekend taking them in their cars to a house shared by carmack wilbur and roathe and made a copy of first level of game over next 72 hours they credited game to ideas from deep a name romero had previously used for some softdisk projects response from nintendo a few weeks later was not as hoped for however while nintendo was impressed with their efforts they wanted mario series to remain exclusive to nintendo consoles around same time as group was rejected by nintendo romero was approached by scott miller of apogee software who wanted him to publish more levels for his previous pyramids of egypt an adventure game where player navigates mazes while avoiding egyptian themed traps and monsters through apogee s shareware model miller was pioneering a model of game publishing where part of a game would be released for free with remainder of game available for purchase from apogee romero said he could not as pyramids of egypt was owned by softdisk but that it did not matter as game he was now working on was much better and sent miller mario demo miller was impressed and team agreed to create a new game for apogee before christmas of 1990 only a few months away split into three parts to match apogee s shareware model of giving away first part for free to attract interest in whole hall suggested a console style platformer in vein of super mario bros as they had technology made for it he further recommended a science fiction theme and developed a short introduction that convinced team to make commander keen in invasion of vorticons ideas from deep team could not afford to leave their jobs to work on game full time so they continued to work at softdisk spending their time on gamer s edge games during day and on commander keen at night and weekends using softdisk computers group split into different roles hall became game designer and creative director john carmack and romero were programmers and wilbur manager they invited artist adrian carmack from softdisk to join them late in development while roathe was soon removed from group ideas from deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at softdisk from october through december 1990 working on commander keen with wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks game s design was largely driven by tom hall romero and especially john carmack were focused almost exclusively on programming wilbur was not involved in game s design and adrian carmack joined late in development and found project s cute art style till then mostly created by hall far removed from his preferred darker style hall s personal experiences and philosophies therefore strongly impacted game keen s red shoes and green bay packers football helmet were items hall wore as a child dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences and enemies were based loosely on his reading of sigmund freud s psychological theories such as that of id other influences on hall for game were duck dodgers in 24 1 2th century and other chuck jones cartoons and available data on worp reaction a short story about a child constructing a spaceship keen s bean with bacon spaceship was taken from a george carlin skit about using bay leaves as deodorant so as to smell like soup keen was intended to be a reflection of hall as he had wanted to be as a child team separated game from its super mario bros roots by adding non linear exploration and additional mechanics like pogo stick a suggestion from miller that part of popularity of super mario bros was presence of secrets and hidden areas in game led hall to add several secrets such as an entire hidden level in first episode and galactic alphabet level maps were designed using a custom made program called tile editor ted which was first created for dangerous dave and was used for entire keen series as well as several other games as game neared completion miller began to market game to players strongly encouraged by updates team was sending him he began heavily advertising game in all of bulletin board systems bbs and game magazines he had access to game was completed in early december 1990 and on afternoon of december 14 miller began uploading completed first episode to bbss with other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for us 30 after arrival of first royalty check from apogee team planned to quit softdisk and start their own company when their boss and owner of softdisk al vekovius confronted them on their plans as well as their use of company resources to develop game team made no secret of their intentions vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between team and softdisk which fell apart when other employees of firm threatened to quit in response and after a few weeks of negotiation team agreed to produce a series of games for gamer s edge one every two months 1991 to present thumb john carmack in 2006 ideas from deep now founded as id software used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own games including in late spring of 1991 keen dreams which they used to develop new systems for their next set of major episodes of series they did not initially want to do a keen game for softdisk but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping to improve next full set of games for apogee team reprised their roles from first game and prototyped an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make background move at a different speed than foreground a pseudo 3d view rather than a side on view ramps rather than solely flat surfaces support for sound cards and changes to design based on player feedback game s plot as a result was designed to be a standalone game outside of continuity of main series and not a true sequel once parallax scrolling and design changes were completed keen dreams was completed in less than a month even as team simultaneously worked on another game beginning development in june 1991 team again reprised their roles for goodbye galaxy hall had received feedback from parents who did not like that enemies in vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games he did not want violence to have no effects and so in dreams had replaced raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies he was not satisfied with this change and while considering ways to remove keen s parents during introduction for goodbye galaxy came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies additionally music which was missing in prior keen games was added to goodbye galaxy composed by bobby prince game episodes four though six was intended to be published as a set named goodbye galaxy in same manner as first one released through apogee with episode four released for free in order to spur interest in purchasing other two episodes by august they had completed a beta version of episode four secret of oracle and romero sent it off to a fan he had met from canada mark rein who had offered to play test game romero was impressed with list of bugs that rein sent back as well as with his business sense and proposed bringing him in to company as a probationary president for six months in order to help expand their business within a few weeks of being hired rein made a deal to get id into commercial market to take sixth episode and make it a stand alone game published as a retail title through formgen instead of part of a shareware trilogy id signed deal but scott miller of apogee was dismayed he felt that not having a full trilogy for shareware game would hurt sales also in august 1991 team moved from shreveport to hall s hometown of madison wisconsin leaving behind wilbur who was unwilling to leave a stable job at softdisk to fully join in with startup but picking up programmer jason blochowiak who was working at time at softdisk there they worked on goodbye galaxy their remaining softdisk games and now standalone commander keen in aliens ate my babysitter between august and december despite being listed numerically as sixth episode due to it having a different publisher and schedule aliens ate my babysitter was developed after secret of oracle but before armageddon machine fifth episode however was created within one month another trilogy of episodes titled universe is toast was planned for december 1992 id worked on it for a couple of weeks before shifting focus to wolfenstein 3d 1992 hall proposed reviving project after wolfenstein was completed but team moved on to doom 1993 instead id did not return to series afterwards instead continuing to focus on 3d first person shooters in october 1999 during an online question and answer session john carmack while discussing that original founders of id software were unlikely to ever work together on a game again mentioned that he was considering idea of making a commander keen game for game boy color handheld game console activision formally announced at start of may 2001 that a new commander keen game had been developed by david a palmer productions and would be released at end of month an interview following week with founder david a palmer explained that original idea for game came from id who approached activision to produce it activision in turn recommended palmer as developer for project as they had been attempting to get an agreement with id and activision for several years for his studio to make a game boy color version of several of their games while palmer was developer for game id collaborated with studio with id having approval over game design elements and artist adrian carmack making some tile artwork for game reception commander keen in invasion of vorticons was an immediate hit for apogee company s previous sales levels had been around us 7 000 per month but by christmas keen already had sales of almost us 30 000 miller described game as a little atom bomb to magazine editors and bbs controllers when asked about it and recruited his mother and hired his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players by june 1991 game was bringing in over us 60 000 per month chris parker of pc magazine later in 1991 referred to game s release as a tremendous success a contemporary review by barry simon of pc magazine praised game s graphical capabilities as having a nintendo feel though he termed graphics as well drawn but not spectacular in terms of resolution he noted that game was very much an arcade game that players would not purchase for its scintillating plot or ground breaking originality but said that all three episodes were very fun to play and that scrolling graphics set it apart from similar games a short summary of trilogy in 1992 by pc world termed it one of most spectacular games available and praised superb sound and graphics and a similar summary in cq amateur radio described it as nintendo comes to pc and best action adventure game reviewer had ever seen after its release in december 1991 goodbye galaxy met with sales about a third of original trilogy scott miller of apogee blamed falling sales on lack of a third episode which he felt undercut shareware model of game tom hall has also claimed that split hurt sales of shareware episodes though he has said that they still did decently though pc zone in its first issue in 1993 quoted shareware distributors as saying goodbye galaxy was one of top shareware sellers of 1992 behind wolfenstein 3d ign has also referred to pair of episodes as apogee s hottest sellers hall has claimed armageddon machine as best commander keen episode and his favorite aliens ate my babysitter also did not sell as well as hoped for by id which team partially blamed on what they felt was terrible box art done by a company that had previously designed packaging for lipton tea despite this sales were strong enough that id agreed to use formgen as a retail publisher for at least two more games pc zone also stated that sales of aliens through shareware distributors was one of highest in shareware market in 1993 2001 commander keen received mixed reviews from critics graphics were both praised and criticized reviewers praised art style and bright and colorful graphics but disparaged busy backgrounds and lackluster animations as making game feel choppy and complained that graphical updates did not reflect ten years since last releases gameplay similarly received mixed opinions reviewers were split between praising difficult old school gameplay as a successful adaptation of originals and dismissing aging gameplay as sound but not comparing well to more recent games reviewers concluded that game was an acquired taste best suited for fans of original series or younger players in october 1992 shareware industry awards gave commander keen series best entertainment software and best overall award a review of entire commander keen series in 1993 by sandy petersen in first eye of monitor column for dragon described series as action games with hilarious graphics acknowledging its debt to super mario bros he called it especially goodbye galaxy one of best games of its type and praised it for not being mindlessly hard instead requiring some thought to play through and especially for humor in graphics and gameplay according to steam spy as of june 2016 there are approximately 200 000 owners of 2007 commander keen complete pack on steam and approximately 80 000 owners of keen dreams release legacy thumb right dopefish burping as

devote themselves full time to their own ideas leading to founding of id software in february in summer of 1991 id hosted a seminar for game developers with intention of licensing commander keen
