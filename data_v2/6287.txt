fleets of east indiamen he was already aware of risks of valuable ships he sailed on being preyed on by foreign navies having been captured by a franco spanish fleet in 1780 during east indies campaign of american war of independence his greatest achievement came during napoleonic wars when having been appointed commodore of one of company s fleets he came across a french squadron under rear admiral comte de linois which was raiding british shipping in area through skilful seamanship and aggressive tactics he fooled french commander into thinking that british convoy was escorted by powerful naval forces and french decided not to risk attacking convoy dance compounded deception by taking his lightly armed merchants and chasing french away despite considerable disparity of force having saved convoy from almost certain destruction dance was hailed as a hero lavishly rewarded with money and a knighthood and spent last years of his life in comfortable retirement family and early life dance was born in london on 20 june 1748 son of james dance and his wife elizabeth james dance was a successful lawyer of city but shortly after birth of nathaniel he abandoned his wife to live with an actress and in time established himself as a successful actor and playwright in drury lane elizabeth dance and her family were instead cared for by james s father and nathaniel s paternal grandfather george dance elder a prominent architect for city of london nathaniel lived with his grandfather until 1759 when he went to sea under patronage of nathaniel smith a high ranking official in honourable east india company with smith s support dance rose through ranks of service by 1780 having made eight voyages to india as well as one to mediterranean and one to west indies while making his ninth voyage to india as first officer on royal george when a combined spanish and french fleet captured his ship in action of 9 august 1780 dance was taken to spain where he spent six months on parole he became commander of in january 1787 making another four voyages to india aboard her including one that went as far as canton he was appointed commander of a new ship in 1802 and he sailed her in january 1803 to china voyage home thumb right east indiaman warley painted in 1801 by robert salmon warley commanded by captain henry wilson was one of ships of dance s fleet in 1804 earl camden sailed from canton with rest of fleet on 31 january 1804 bound for england by virtue of his seniority dance was appointed commodore of fleet of 11 country ships and 16 east indiamen fleet that had been assembled was richest to date carrying cargoes with an estimated value of ps8 million approximately ps in present day terms dance had been taken seriously ill at bombay during outward voyage but had recovered in time to sail with convoy fleet did not have any naval escorts and though east indiamen were heavily armed for merchants carrying nominal batteries of between 30 and 36 guns they were no match for disciplined and professional naval forces not all of their listed armament was always carried but to give illusion of greater strength fake gunports were often painted on hulls in hope of distant observers mistaking them for 64 gun ships of royal navy by time fleet approached strait of malacca on 14 february dance s convoy had swelled to include 16 east indiamen 11 country ships a portuguese merchant ship from macau and a vessel from botany bay in australia although heic had provided small armed brig ganges as an escort this vessel could only dissuade pirates it could not hope to confront a french warship as they neared entrance to straits suspicious sails were sighted in south west dance sent some of his ships to investigate and it was soon discovered that this was linois s squadron consisting of 74 gun marengo two heavy frigates semillante and belle poule corvette and dutch brig aventurier battle thumb left gallant commodore dance beating off admiral linois squadron unknown artist having ascertained identity of ships dance signalled for his merchants to form line of battle and continued their heading while french closed but made no move to attack dance used delay to gather his ships together so stronger east indiamen stood between french and weaker country ships merchants continued on towards straits followed by linois who was trying to gauge strength of convoy there were more ships in convoy than he had expected and taken in by dance s manoeuvres and painted gunports linois suspected that several warships were escorting them he seemed to be confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 february both forces raised their colours dance ordered brig ganges and four lead ships to hoist blue ensigns while rest of convoy raised red ensigns by system of national flags then in use in british ships this implied that ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to squadron of admiral peter rainier while others were merchant ships under their protection with french still appearing reluctant to attack on morning of 16 february dance ordered his ships to increase their speed by breaking into a sailing formation this had effect of making convoy appear less intimidating and linois decided to attack by afternoon french were observed to be moving to cut off rearmost ships of convoy dance promptly hoisted colours and ordered his largest ships led by east indiamen and his own ship earl camden to come about and close on french advancing under full sail they endured fire of french as they closed before firing broadsides at close range at this french abandoned their attack turned and fled under a press of sail dance hoisted signal for a general chase and his merchant fleet pursued french squadron for two hours before dance broke off and returned on his original heading fleet resumed their course towards malacca strait and having met two british ships of line from admiral peter rainier s fleet on 28 february were escorted as far as saint helena there convoy met with other british merchants and were escorted to britain by royal navy warships arriving in august 1804 rewards achievement of a convoy of merchants not only escaping without loss from a french squadron but going so far as to attack drive off and then pursue their would be predators was widely hailed as a signal victory thumb left nathaniel dance by his uncle george dance naval chronicle declared we cannot sufficiently express our opinion of coolness intrepidity and skill with which commander of this fleet unaccustomed as he was to practice of naval engagements provided against every emergency and prepared his plans either for attack or defence as manoeuvres of french admiral might render it expedient for him to adopt either one of other his conduct was worthy of experience and science of our most approved and veteran admirals while ardour and with which his orders were obeyed and his plans executed by several captains under his command may have been rivalled but can scarcely be exceeded in most renowned of our naval exploits dance received ps5 000 from bombay insurance company approximately 000 in present day terms a pension
