with autonomous laws in immigration control and native customary rights ncr and territory name was changed to sabah however under administration of united sabah national organisation usno led by mustapha harun this autonomy has been gradually eroded with federal government influence and hegemony with a popular belief amongst sabahans that both usno and umno have been working together in permitting illegal immigrants from southern philippines and indonesia to stay in state and become citizens to vote for muslim parties this was continued under sabah people s united front berjaya administration led by harris salleh with a total of 73 000 filipino refugees from southern philippines were registered in addition cession of labuan island to federal government by sabah state government under berjaya rule and unequal sharing and exploitation of sabah s resources of petroleum have become grievances often raised by sabahans which has resulted in strong anti federal sentiments and even occasional call for secession from federation amongst people of sabah until 2008 malaysian general election sabah along with states of kelantan and terengganu were only three states in malaysia that had ever been ruled by opposition parties not part of ruling bn coalition under joseph pbs formed state government after winning 1985 state election and ruled sabah until 1994 in 1994 state election despite pbs winning elections subsequent cross overs of pbs assembly members to bn component party resulted in bn having majority of seats and hence took over helm of state government a unique feature of sabah politics was a policy initiated by prime minister mahathir mohamad in 1994 whereby chief minister s post is rotated among coalition parties every two years regardless of party in power at time thus theoretically giving an equal amount of time for each major ethnic group to rule state however in practice this system was problematic as it is too short for any leader to carry out long term plans this practice was then since stopped political intervention by federal authorities for example an introduction and later abolition of chief minister s post and earlier pbs berjaya conflict in 1985 along with co opting rival factions in east malaysia are examples of political tactics used by then umno led federal government to control and manage autonomous power of borneo states federal government however tend to view that these actions are justifiable as display of parochialism amongst east malaysians is not in harmony with nation building this complicated federal state relationship has become a source of major contention in sabah politics in 2018 general election shafie s sabah heritage party warisan secured an electoral pact with democratic action party dap and people s justice party pkr of pakatan harapan ph coalition on 9 may 2018 this coalition and barisan nasional ended in a tie however as six bn elected representatives

much of eastern part of sabah it claims that territory is connected with sultanate of sulu and was only leased to north borneo chartered company in 1878 with sultanate s sovereignty never being relinquished malaysia however considers this dispute as a non issue as it interprets 1878 agreement as that of cession and that it deems that residents of sabah had exercised their right to self determination when they joined to form malaysian federation in 1963 philippine claim can be originated based on three historical events such as brunei civil war from 1660 until 1673 treaty between dutch east indies and bulungan sultanate in 1850 and treaty between sultan jamal ul azam with overbeck in 1878 further attempts by several filipino politicians such as ferdinand marcos to destabilise sabah proved to be futile and led to massacre in corregidor island philippines as a consequence this led malaysian government to once supporting insurgency in southern philippines although philippine claim to sabah has not been actively pursued for some years some filipino politicians are promising to bring it up again while malaysian government asks philippines not to threaten ties over such issue royal malaysia police and malaysian deputy prime minister made a proposal to ban barter trade between malaysia and philippines as it was seen only benefited to one side and threatening security
