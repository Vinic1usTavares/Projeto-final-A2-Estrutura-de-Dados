1983 atlantic hurricane season was least active atlantic hurricane season in 53 years during which only four tropical storms formed season officially began on june 1 1983 and lasted until november 30 1983 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most storms form in atlantic basin season had very little activity with only seven tropical depressions four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher this led to lowest accumulated cyclone energy count since 1950 but not since 1900 season began later than normal first tropical depression formed on july 29 and second on july 31 neither tropical depressions strengthened and they dissipated soon thereafter hurricane alicia formed as tropical depression three on august 15 quickly intensified into a hurricane on august 16 and made landfall in texas on august 18 alicia caused 3 billion in damage in texas hurricane barry formed on august 25 crossed florida and strengthened into a hurricane barry made landfall near mexico united states border and dissipated over land on august 30 hurricane chantal third and final hurricane in 1983 formed on september 10 it strengthened into a hurricane but stayed out at sea and became absorbed by a front on september 15 tropical depression six formed on september 19 and caused heavy rains in caribbean before degenerating into a wave on september 21 tropical storm dean was final storm of season forming on september 26 it originally tracked to north peaking at winds 85 km h and made landfall in delmarva peninsula on september 29 it dissipated over coast of virginia on september 30 toc seasonal forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 1983 high activity28158record low activity10 tie 0actual activity 4 3 1 forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts like dr william m gray and his associates at colorado state university a normal season as defined by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has six to fourteen named storms with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength and one to three major hurricanes july 23 1983 forecast predicted that after slow start to season that a total of eight storms would form and five of storms would reach hurricane status forecast did not specify how many of hurricanes would reach major hurricane status however predictions proved to be too high with only four named storms forming by end of season and three of those reaching hurricane status seasonal summary season which began on june 1 and ended on november 30 was very inactive because of strong upper level wind shear wind shear was unusually strong throughout caribbean and open atlantic and disrupted convection in areas of disturbed weather so they could not develop over sixty african systems had formed and made it westward but when they reached lesser antilles they were dissolved easily only area where shear was minimal a region encompassing gulf of mexico and atlantic north of bahamas and east of florida was where four named storms developed another contributing factor to low number of storms may have been decaying 1982 83 el nino event season long total of 4 named storms makes 1983 season least active season since 1930 atlantic hurricane season which had only two storms 1983 and prior season became first example of two consecutive years to have no storms form in caribbean sea since 1871 when reliable record began 1983 also proved to be first season since 1871 that a storm did not form south of 25degn latitude 1983 was first season for which national hurricane center issued numeric landfall probabilities probabilities had been calculated for prior storms for use in issuing of hurricane watches and warnings but this was first time raw numeric probabilities were released to public probabilities issued were accurate during alicia indicating that galveston and surrounding portions of upper texas coast were most likely area to be struck season s activity was reflected with a very low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 17 one of lowest on record which is classified as below normal ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength subtropical cyclones are excluded from total systems tropical depression one tropical depression one formed from a tropical disturbance near lesser antilles on july 29 national hurricane center indicated possibility of depression strengthening into a tropical storm in media reports but upper level wind shear inhibited any development depression dissipated next day tropical depression two an area of disturbed weather in central atlantic managed to gain enough organization to be designated tropical depression two on july 31 depression moved across atlantic without strengthening due to high upper level wind shear and dissipated near lesser antilles on august 3 hurricane alicia system that would become hurricane alicia originated from western end of a frontal trough that stretched from new england to gulf of mexico satellite pictures showed a meso scale low pressure area that had moved off alabama and mississippi coasts near trough and was possibly precursor system to alicia pressures in gulf of mexico were high and stayed high during early development stages on august 15 a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015 millibars 29 99 inhg when system was upgraded into tropical storm alicia with high environmental pressures around it alicia remained a small system steering currents above alicia remained weak during storm s lifetime however a ridge was well formed to north of developing storms with fluctuations in pressures alicia began to drift to west on august 16 this was short lived as alicia turned to northwest towards texas during period of august 16 to august 18 an anticyclone had formed over alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters caused alicia to intensify rapidly pressure in alicia decreased one millibar an hour in 40 hours before landfall alicia peaked at 115 mph 185 km h in winds and 962 millibars 28 39 inhg in pressure on august 18 alicia made landfall near galveston on august 18 as a category 3 hurricane alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over midwest before dissipating over nebraska on august 21 as alicia moved northward remnants caused moderate to heavy rainfall in several states houston suffered heavy damage including thousands of shattered glass panes from downtown skyscrapers overall alicia killed 22 people and caused 3 billion 1983 usd in damage hurricane barry hurricane barry originated from a tropical disturbance that left northwestern african coast on august 13 most of season northwestern tropical atlantic ocean had upper level wind shear which had inhibited development of systems due to these conditions disturbance was unable to strengthen until august 22 as it was approaching bahamas a weak trough moved disturbance into an area of low wind shear and disturbance intensified into tropical depression four on evening of august 23 depression was just to northeast of northern bahamian islands where it strengthened into tropical storm barry on morning of august 24 tropical storm barry subsequently turned to west into an area of increased wind shear and weakened rapidly it was able to make landfall near melbourne florida on morning of august 25 as a 45 mph tropical storm before weakening to a tropical depression over florida after tropical depression barry emerged from central florida it was still under pressure from high level winds depression entered central gulf of mexico and after meandering west for a day or so returned to tropical storm strength just off coast of mexico barry rapidly intensified into a hurricane on august 28 just before making landfall near matamoros that afternoon before landfall barry peaked with 80 mph 130 km h winds and a pressure of 986 millibars 29 11 inhg remnants quickly dissipated over sierra madre oriental on august 29 hurricane chantal precursor low to chantal originated from a large envelope of low pressure on morning of september 10 disturbed weather nested off coast of bermuda was one of remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from hispaniola to central north atlantic ocean this particular area of disturbed weather become part of northeast portion of a low pressure system on september 10 a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30 mph 50 km h and a 1010 millibar 29 83 inhg pressure reading indicating development into a tropical depression depression moved to within 100 miles 160 kilometers of bermuda and slowly intensified late that afternoon tropical depression five had intensified into a 40 mph 60 km h storm and was named chantal chantal intensified rapidly intensifying to hurricane status late on september 11 it then turned to east and gained a weak upper level cirrus cloud outflow structure of system changed little over next 24 hours before chantal lost organization and was downgraded to a tropical storm on night of 12th overnight all convection in chantal dissipated and its forward speed decreased as it headed north a frontal system attracted and absorbed remnants of chantal by night of september 14 effects on bermuda were minimal with island getting winds only up to 20 mph 25 km h and a few thundershowers however chantal generated swells of 30 40 ft 9 12 m offshore tropical depression six tropical depression six formed on september 19 from a tropical wave depression caused heavy rainfall in lesser antilles before degenerating into an open tropical wave on september 21 near dominican republic tropical storm dean tropical storm dean originated from inside a frontal cloud band which had moved off eastern coast of united states on september 22 during next few days band became stationary from bahamas to beyond bermuda during this period a 1035 millibar 30 56 inhg high pressure cell had become settled over northeastern united states this resulted in a strong pressure gradient and winds near gale force along eastern coast a low level circulation formed from frontal cloud band on september 26 about 460 miles 740 km east of central florida dean was first identified on afternoon of september 26 as a subtropical storm an air force reconnaissance flight was sent to dean on september 27 and only reported winds of 35 mph 55 km h at 23 miles 37 kilometres from center a pressure of 999 millibars 29 50 inhg indicated that dean was strengthening as it headed northward additionally satellite pictures showed that subtropical cyclone was emerging from cloud this data also showed that storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given name dean on afternoon of september 27 dean s winds peaked at 65 mph 105 km h on september 28 as it headed northward dean s circulation turned to northwest on september 29 then made landfall in delmarva peninsula and dissipated over land on september 30 gale warnings were from north carolina to rhode island in association with dean dean produced rainfall spreading from north carolina virginia border all way to new england virginia reported rains of 1 inch 25 4 mm with 3 inches 76 2 mm at border rains peaked at 4 62 inches 117 mm at ranger station in connecticut damage was limited to minor beach erosion and flooding along portion of mid atlantic coast states storm names following list of names was used for named storms that formed in north atlantic in 1983 names not retired from this list were used again in 1989 season this year marked first usage for this list of names in north atlantic basin names alicia barry chantal and dean were used for first and only in case of alicia time this year alicia barry chantal dean retirement in spring of 1984 at 6th session of ra iv hurricane committee world meteorological organization retired name alicia from its rotating name lists due to amount of damage and deaths it caused and it will not be used again for another atlantic hurricane alicia was replaced with allison for 1989 season season effects this is a table of storms in 1983 and their landfall s
