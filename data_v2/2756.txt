sabancaya is an active stratovolcano in andes of southern peru about northwest of arequipa it is considered part of central volcanic zone of andes one of three distinct volcanic belts of andes central volcanic zone includes a number of volcanoes some of which like huaynaputina have had large eruptions and others such as sabancaya and ubinas have been active in historical time sabancaya forms a volcanic complex together with hualca hualca to north and ampato to south and has erupted andesite and dacite it is covered by a small ice cap which leads to a risk of lahars during eruptions sabancaya has generated numerous long lava flows especially during early holocene while activity in later holocene has been more explosive historical reports indicate eruptions during 18th century volcano returned to activity in 1986 culminating in a large eruption in 1990 since then it has been continuously active with emission of ash and gas name name sabancaya is quechua and means tongue of fire or spitting volcano likely a reference to eruptive activity name is attested from 1595 implying that volcanic activity was observed by that date geography and geomorphology sabancaya lies about northwest of arequipa rio colca valley is located north of sabancaya hualca hualca ampato volcano complex regional subduction of nazca plate beneath south american plate in peru chile trench leads to volcanic activity in andes this volcanic activity presently occurs in three segments northern volcanic zone central volcanic zone and southern volcanic zone there is an additional volcanic belt south of southern volcanic zone austral volcanic zone sabancaya is located in central volcanic zone of andes which extends through southern peru many volcanoes in central volcanic zone are poorly known owing to their remote locations and adverse conditions such as high altitude sabancaya is part of a series of volcanoes that line southwestern coast of peru at a distance of roughly from shore of these volcanoes sabancaya el misti ubinas huaynaputina ticsani and tutupaca have been active during historical time further volcanoes in area with pliocene quaternary activity are sara sara solimana coropuna ampato chachani yucamane casiri and tacora all these volcanoes are considered part of central volcanic zone of andes and lie east of peru chile trench notable among them are ampato and coropuna for exceeding a height of huaynaputina and el misti for their large eruptions and ubinas and sabancaya for their recent activity these volcanoes are found in places where strike slip faults which delimit volcanic arc and strike along its length intersect additional faults formed by extensional tectonics such faults occur around sabancaya as well and include cabanaconde ichupampa pampa sepina and sepina faults volcanoes ampato and sabancaya are aligned on this fault which may thus be responsible for their existence these fault systems are still active and experience occasional earthquakes and deformation local alt two tall snow covered mountains thumb sabancaya with ampato in background sabancaya is high and rises above surrounding terrain it forms a group of volcanoes with northern hualca hualca and southern ampato in cordillera occidental which tower above colca canyon in north and siguas valley in southwest ampato and more heavily eroded hualca hualca are dominant volcanoes of this group with sabancaya forming a northeastward extension of former away from ampato s summit there is evidence of age progression from oldest hualca hualca over ampato to youngest volcano sabancaya alt a volcano surrounded by expanding lava flows left and right two snow covered summits as seen from space thumb sabancaya from space lava flows are clearly visible sabancaya consists of two separate centres that are formed by neighbouring domes sabancaya i north and sabancaya ii south summit crater of volcano lies between these two domes with traces of an additional crater just northeast despite presence of an ice cap lava flows are recognizable in summit area they have a total volume of a set of over 42 holocene lava flows emanates from volcano and covers a surface area of about with individual lava flows extending up to east and west from between its two neighbours lava flows at larger distances are older than ones close to vent these flows are blocky have lobe structures and reach thicknesses of total thickness of this pile of lava flows is about pyroclastic flow deposits are also found but they might originate from ampato rather than sabancaya sabancaya like its two neighbours is covered by an ice cap which in 1988 extended to distances of from summit in 1997 a surface area of was reported moraines at elevations of above sea level testify to occurrence of more extensive glaciation during last ice age between 25 000 and 17 000 years before present these moraines have diverted some lava flows younger moraines are found at higher altitudes above sea level and may have formed between 13 000 and 10 000 years ago shortly after beginning of holocene earthquake activity has allowed identification of a candidate magma reservoir beneath pampa sepina northeast of sabancaya about away from summit between 1992 and 1996 this area inflated at a depth of below sea level indicating that magma supply system of sabancaya may not be centered directly below volcano indeed a phase of ground uplift at hualca hualca volcano and earthquake swarms in 1990 could indicate that magma chamber of sabancaya is actually under neighbouring volcano geology tectonic conditions in region have not been constant over time at various times plates approached each other at higher speed and this led to a compressional tectonic regimen in western cordillera however tensional faulting facilitated occurrence of voluminous volcanism this faulting is still underway and produces earthquakes in area basement of volcano is formed by precambrian rocks which are overlaid by various sediments and volcanic formations of mesozoic and cenozoic age especially during neogene supply of volcanic material was high and dominated region forming a volcanic foot present volcanoes are constructed on this volcanic foot this foot is made out of an ignimbrite plateau that drops down south foot beneath ampato hualca hualca and sabancaya has been dated 2 2 0 15 million years ago while a lava flow beneath first and last of these is about 0 8 0 04 million years old composition thumb right aerial photo of solimana foreground coropuna upper right and sabancaya upper left fresh volcanites of sabancaya consist of porphyritic andesite and dacite which form a potassium rich calc alkaline suite similar to other volcanoes in southern peru andesites occasionally appear as fine grained enclaves rocks are not very vesicular and contain a moderate amount of phenocrysts minerals encountered in both phenocrysts and groundmass are amphibole biotite hornblende iron oxide plagioclase pyroxene and titanium oxide degraded olivine is also found magmas formed at temperatures of with uncertainties of highest temperatures are associated with 1992 eruption products isotope data indicate that pre magmas interacted with crust at great depths before rising to shallower magma chambers in these shallower magma chambers magma genesis involved processes of magma mixing which formed at least part of andesites and fractional crystallization which gave rise to dacites partial crystallization and flow events within magma chamber caused formation of andesite enclaves total magma production rate of sabancaya without accounting for repose periods is about sabancaya is a source of volcanic gases such as and amount of water emitted by sabancaya is noticeably large for a volcano about source of this water might be an evaporating hydrothermal system in volcano eruptive history most activity at sabancaya occurs in form of lava domes and lava flows one of which is dated to 5 440 40 years before present on eastern flank additional surface exposure dating has yielded ages of 12 340 550 6 650 320 and 6 300 310 on various lava flows indicating that effusive activity started shortly after beginning of holocene pyroclastic eruptions are less common and have a low volume with one such occurrence dated to 8 500 years before present this tephra layer along with layers dated 2500 2100 bc 420 150 bc 100 bc 150 ad and between 1200 1400 ad could have originated either on sabancaya or ampato however there is evidence that early and middle holocene sabancaya mostly erupted lava while late holocene volcano was more explosive in its activity it is possible that inca performed human sacrifices in response to eruptions of sabancaya to calm down mountain spirits alt a large plume of smoke rising over a volcano which is slightly below observer thumb 1994 eruption of sabancaya spanish chronicles mention probable eruptions in 1752 and 1784 which might have left layers of tephra after 18th century volcano went dormant for about two hundred years in late 1986 an increased fumarolic activity heralded onset of a new eruptive period and satellite images observed occurrence of black spots where ice had melted or boiled away during this time death of animals was observed in area this period reached a climax in may 1990 when an eruption with a volcanic explosivity index of 2 3 occurred this eruption threw ash to distances of from summit and was accompanied by strong earthquake activity and formation of eruption columns that reached heights of eruption and further activity through 1990 enlarged summit crater and caused formation of new rows of fumaroles chemical analysis of volcanic rocks suggests that this phase of volcanic activity was started by injection of mafic magma into magma chamber this eruption displaced between 4 000 and 1 500 people in region after large 1990 eruption style of activity at sabancaya changed towards a frequent occurrence of explosive eruptions with however low output which threw ballistic blocks to distances of about from summit crater this pattern of activity is referred to as vulcanian eruptions these explosive eruptions became less common over time from paroxysms every 20 30 minutes to only 5 6 eruptions per day and proportional amount of fresh volcanic material increased at first since 1997 discontinuous eruptions generate steam columns no higher than and ejected material is almost entirely lithic satellite imagery has evidenced occurrence of temperature anomalies on sabancaya on scale of probably owing to fumarolic activity in march and april 2013 fumarolic activity and occurrence of seismic swarms increased leading to local infrastructure being damaged an eruption occurred in august 2014 this pulse of activity was accompanied by an increased release of which was being emitted at a rate of in 2014 ash was emitted by volcano multiple times through 2014 and 2015 a further increase of fumarolic activity was observed in 2016 when new fumaroles appeared and sulfur flux increased to sulfur dioxide ash eruptions have occurred since 6 november 2016 with an eruption column high five days later a persistent gas plume lies above volcano and repeated emissions of ash have happened resulting in several alerts for local population hazards alt viewing a deep valley from space thumb colca canyon sabancaya is white dot just above right bottom of image sabancaya rises above valleys of colca river and of some tributaries of siguas river with about 35 000 people living in them sabancaya is particularly dangerous for colca river valley a major tourism destination in peru with towns cabanaconde chivay ichupampa lari maca madrigal and others flanks of sabancaya themselves include roads and a major power line that comes from and delivers electricity to southern peru all of these could be threatened in an eruption in case of a major plinian eruption at least 60 000 to 70 000 people would be threatened rock fall would affect area close to summit domes as would pyroclastic flows these would be a further hazard to valleys draining volcano presence of an ice cap is an additional source of danger as its melting during a volcanic eruption could form hazardous lahars although small volume of ice cap limits their damage potential majes river and river drainages would be threatened by such mudflows in case of an eruption former is site of a major irrigation project monitors sabancaya and has published a hazard map aside from direct threat of eruptions sabancaya also contributes to air pollution in colca valley which can damage plants and cause respiratory distress in animals and humans see also list of volcanoes in peru lake references sources category
