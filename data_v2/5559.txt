arrival of cleopatra in cilicia is an oil painting by english artist william etty it was first exhibited in 1821 and is now in lady lever art gallery in port sunlight across river mersey from liverpool during 1810s etty had become widely respected among staff and students at royal academy of arts in particular for his use of colour and ability to paint realistic flesh tones despite having exhibited at every summer exhibition since 1811 he attracted little commercial or critical interest in 1820 he exhibited coral finder which showed nude figures on a gilded boat this painting attracted attention of sir francis freeling who commissioned a similar painting on a more ambitious scale triumph of cleopatra illustrates a scene from plutarch s life of antony and shakespeare s antony and cleopatra in which cleopatra queen of egypt travels to tarsus in cilicia aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with roman general mark antony an intentionally cramped and crowded composition it shows a huge group of people in various states of undress gathering on bank to watch ship s arrival although not universally admired in press painting was an immediate success making etty famous almost overnight buoyed by its reception etty devoted much of next decade to creating further history paintings containing nude figures becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages background left thumb upright male nude with staff 1814 16 despite limited success in 1810s etty was admired for his ability to paint flesh tones alt nude man holding a long pole william etty was born in york in 1787 son of a miller and baker he showed artistic promise from an early age but his family were financially insecure and at age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in hull on completing his seven year indenture he moved to london with a few pieces of chalk crayons in colours with aim of emulating old masters and becoming a history painter etty gained acceptance to royal academy schools in early 1807 after a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter thomas lawrence etty returned to royal academy drawing in life class and copying other paintings he was unsuccessful in all academy s competitions and every painting he submitted for summer exhibition was rejected in 1811 one of his paintings telemachus rescues antiope from fury of wild boar was finally accepted for summer exhibition etty was becoming widely respected at royal academy for his painting particularly his use of colour and his ability to produce realistic flesh tones and from 1811 onwards had at least one work accepted for summer exhibition each year however he had little commercial success and generated little interest over next few years upright 1 3 right thumb coral finder 1820 led sir francis freeling to commission cleopatra alt naked woman on a boat surrounded by naked children at 1820 summer exhibition etty exhibited coral finder venus and her youthful satellites arriving at isle of paphos strongly inspired by titian coral finder depicts venus victrix lying nude in a golden boat surrounded by scantily clad attendants it was sold at exhibition to piano manufacturer thomas tomkinson for ps30 about ps in terms sir francis freeling admired coral finder at its exhibition and learning that it had been sold he commissioned etty to paint a similar picture on a more ambitious scale for a fee of 200 guineas about ps in terms etty had for some time been musing on possibility of a painting of cleopatra and took opportunity provided by freeling to paint a picture of her based loosely on composition of coral finder composition triumph of cleopatra is based loosely on plutarch s life of antony as repeated in shakespeare s antony and cleopatra in which cleopatra queen of egypt travels to tarsus in cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an alliance with roman general mark antony while superficially similar to coral finder cleopatra is more closely related to style of jean baptiste regnault with its deliberately cramped and crowded composition individual figures are intentionally out of proportion to each other and to ship while a large number of figures are tightly positioned within a relatively small section of painting left upright thumb william etty self portrait 1823 alt bearded man in his 30s as well as from regnault work borrows elements from titian rubens and classical sculpture figures are painted as groups and while each figure and group of figures is carefully arranged and painted combination of groups gives appearance of a confused mass surrounding ship when painting is viewed as a whole etty s 1958 biographer dennis farr comments that contains elements enough for three or four paintings no less ambitious but more maturely planned scene includes a number of images based on drawings etty had sketched while out and about in london such as mother holding up her baby to see view and crowd on roof of a temple in background it also includes elements of european painting that etty had learned while copying old master artworks as a student such as putti in sky etty greatly admired venetian school and painting includes obvious borrowings from titian and other venetian artists it also contains a number of elements from paintings of rubens such as nereids and triton in sea in front of ship unusually for an english painting of period in its representation of a queen of an african country group of cleopatra s attendants includes both dark and light skinned figures shown on equal terms and with equal prominence from earliest days of his career etty had been interested in depicting variations in skin colour and missionary boy believed to be his oldest significant surviving painting shows a dark skinned child reception cleopatra caused an immediate sensation etty later claimed that day after summer exhibition opened he awoke famous may 1821 issue of gentleman s magazine hailed cleopatra as belonging to highest class and charles robert leslie described it as a splendid triumph of colour painting did not meet with universal approval blackwood s edinburgh magazine conceded that painting had been seen and admired at royal academy but condemned etty s taking a mythological approach to a historical subject etty attempted to replicate success of cleopatra and his next significant exhibited work was a sketch from one of gray s odes youth on prow exhibited at british institution in january 1822 as with coral finder and cleopatra this painting showed a gilded boat filled with nude figures and its exhibition provoked condemnation from times despite tone etty was pleased to be noticed by a newspaper as influential as times and much later confessed how delighted he was that times noticed me i felt my chariot wheels were on right road to fame and honour and i now drove on like another jehu possibly as a result of criticism in times freeling asked etty to figures in foreground of cleopatra in 1829 after etty had become a respected artist freeling allowed restoration of figures to their original condition legacy criticism did little to dissuade etty from attempting to reproduce success of cleopatra and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing nude figures he exhibited 15 paintings at summer exhibition in 1820s including cleopatra and all but one contained at least one nude figure in so doing etty became first english artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages left thumb upright 1 3 world before flood 1828 reuses some elements from triumph of cleopatra alt large number of semi naked people in 1823 24 etty made an

watching dancers in his 1828 world before flood etty continued to produce paintings ranging from still lifes to formal portraits and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity until his death in 1849 in years following his death etty s work became highly collectable and his works fetched huge sums on resale changing tastes from 1870s onwards meant history paintings in etty s style fell rapidly out of fashion and by end of 19th century value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices despite its technical flaws cleopatra remained a favourite among many of etty s admirers during his lifetime in 1846 elizabeth rigby described it as a glorious confusion of figures and that wonderful cleopatra of etty s following freeling s death in 1836 cleopatra was sold for 210 guineas around same price freeling had paid for it and entered collection of lord taunton while in taunton s ownership it was shown at a number of important exhibitions
