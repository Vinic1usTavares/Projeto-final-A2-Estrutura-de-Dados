neaira also was a hetaera who lived in 4th century bc in ancient greece she was brought to trial between 343 and 340 bc accused of marrying an athenian citizen illegally and misrepresenting her daughter as an athenian citizen speech made against neaira in this trial by apollodorus is preserved as demosthenes fifty ninth speech though speech is often attributed to pseudo demosthenes who seems to have worked on many of speeches given by apollodorus speech provides more details than any other about prostitutes of antiquity and consequently a great deal of information about sex trade in ancient greek city states poleis speech against neaira speech against neaira is source of most of details of neaira s biography it concerns a case brought against neaira when she was about fifty by apollodorus son in law theomnestus though apart from a brief introduction of case given by theomnestus apollodorus delivered entirety of speech case revolves around accusation that neaira a foreigner married an athenian citizen and that she was attempting to pass off her own children as athenian citizens while speech revolves around life of neaira this is of little importance to substance of accusations details seem to be part of speech in hope that salacious accusations will hide weakness of apollodorus case accuracy of evidence given in speech has been questioned and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies despite this speech tells us much about life of an accomplished hetaera and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women s lives in classical greece indeed it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in classical world and one of our best sources on women s lives and gender relations in general for period biography life with nikarete neaira was probably born in first decade of fourth century bc her place of birth is unknown and earliest event in her life that we know of is her purchase when she was a young girl by nikarete pseudo demosthenes 59 18 nikarete trained girls she purchased to be hetaerae calling them her daughters in order to increase price her customers would pay pseudo demosthenes 59 19 and lived with them in corinth pseudo demosthenes 59 23 neaira s work as a prostitute started before she reached puberty she is twice described by apollodorus as having sex for money before she came of age though possibly due to her age he implies that she was not yet a hetaera pseudo demosthenes 59 24 during this time orator lysias was a prominent guest in nikarete s brothel and a regular customer of athenaeus deipnosophistae 13 65 another of nikarete s girls in order to reward her for her services he arranged for her to be initiated into eleusinian mysteries and funded journey pseudo demosthenes 59 21 neaira was at this time about twelve or thirteen and nikarete accompanied them pseudo demosthenes 59 22 neaira visited athens again for great of 378 this time accompanying simus of thessaly a young aristocrat leaving nikarete and corinth around 376 bc of corinth and eukrates of paid thirty minae to purchase neaira from nikarete at high end of prices for hetaerae when men married they agreed to let neaira buy her freedom for twenty minae which with aid of gifts and loans from her former customers she did pseudo demosthenes 59 30 32 as part of this deal neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in corinth and so left city for athens with phrynion who had helped her buy her freedom pseudo demosthenes 59 32 neaira was certainly living with phrynion in athens by 373 bc when he took her to a feast given by general chabrias to celebrate his victory in pythian games pseudo demosthenes 59 33 during this celebration apollodorus says neaira was sexually assaulted by guests and slaves of chabrias while she was drunk and asleep pseudo demosthenes 59 33 34 due to this and other mistreatment by phrynion in 372 bc neaira left his household and went to megara taking with her her clothing and jewellery two maids and other possessions belonging to phrynion pseudo demosthenes 59 35 life with stephanus in megara neaira continued to work as a hetaera and in 371 met stephanus stephanus offered to act as her patron if she returned with him to athens pseudo demosthenes 59 37 apollodorus claims that with her she brought two sons and a daughter to athens pseudo demosthenes 59 38 but modern commentators have largely concluded that sons in question were in fact those of stephanus by an athenian woman indeed christopher carey points out that one of sons at least was probably a legitimate son of stephanus being named after his father and john buckler notes that apollodorus contradicts himself on whether neaira s alleged sons were hers by another man or hers by stephanus phrynion learnt that neaira was back in athens and attempted to take her back from stephanus stephanus resisted claiming that as neaira was a free woman he had no right pseudo demosthenes 59 40 a claim which phrynion proceeded to challenge in court though he was persuaded to settle case by arbitration instead pseudo demosthenes 59 45 arbitrators decided that neaira was indeed free and that in addition to this she was her own mistress pseudo demosthenes 59 46 this was an extremely unusual decision in a society where all citizen women at least had a kyrios master despite this unusual level of freedom however neaira was compelled to split her time between two men as they agreed without any input herself trial sometime between 343 and 340 bc neaira was brought to trial by theomnestus on behalf of his father in law apollodorus accused of representing herself as a citizen when in fact she was not if she was convicted maximum penalty neaira faced was being sold into slavery and having her property sold pseudo demosthenes 49 16 neaira herself would not have been permitted to speak at her trial though she was probably present only surviving record of trial is speech given by theomnestus and apollodorus against neaira and stephanus and outcome is unknown no records of neaira exist after trial modern commentators have noted weaknesses in apollodorus arguments though as outcome of an athenian trial depended heavily on what parties involved could persuade jury to accept and how much of their dishonesty they could get away with we cannot say for certain that suit failed see also apollodorus of
